Research connected to a government agency might also raise the status of its efforts in the eyes of the news media, general public, and academic audiences. Also, investments in government statistical agencies, or grants to academic or other institutions to undertake pilot surveys or methodological research on SOGIESC questions, might move those questions into large-scale government surveys much more quickly. (c) Invest in communication and collaboration between researchers and the LGBTI community to ensure knowledge that is relevant and useful. Experience demonstrates that activists and researchers want to be connected so that research is relevant, but effective communication and collaboration take time, energy, and resources. LGBTI civil society groups and actors should be engaged in the research process, including in the selection of research priorities, data collection, data analysis, and the communication of research findings. This need to pull activists and researchers together generates another important investment opportunity that can be met in a number of ways, and support could go to several types of collaboration: formal consultations that provide activists with a voice to communicate research priorities to researchers; 58 relationship building and the creation of 56 Two networks in the United States have produced influential best practice guides: Sexual Minority Action Research Team (SMART), \u201cBest Practices for Asking Questions about Sexual Orientation on Surveys\u201d (Los Angeles, CA: The Williams Institute, UCLA, 2009), http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/SMART-FINAL- Nov-2009.pdf; and Gender Identity in U.S. Surveillance Group (GenIUSS), \u201cBest Practices for Asking Questions to Identify Transgender and Other Gender Minority Respondents on Population-Based Surveys\u201d (Los Angeles, CA: The Williams Institute, UCLA, 2014), http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/geniuss-report-sep- 2014.pdf. 57 Klugman and others, Voice and Agency. 58 This point was emphasized in the consultations at the Uruguay conference. 21 spaces for collaboration that bring researchers and activists together in formal or informal ways; participatory research strategies that involve LGBTI activists at many stages of the research process; and capacity building of LGBTI organizations to learn data collection and analysis skills. These strategies for communication and collaboration could either be funded independently or folded into specific research projects. (d) Invest in the expansion of a robust academic infrastructure to produce new researchers. More researchers are needed who are able and willing to work on LGBTI topics in government, academic, and NGO settings. The current number of researchers studying these issues across universities, governments, and NGOs is too small to carry out an SDG-related research agenda in only 10 countries, much less on a global scale covering 193 countries. Increasing funding and access to data would make more research possible. However, scaling up will also require funding to train many more new and existing researchers in best research practices. Through universities and government agencies, funders could support a number of different activities to benefit researchers: online or in-person courses on research methods and existing research; fellowships for masters, doctoral, and post-doctoral students; mentoring programs to match new researchers with more experienced ones; translations of existing studies; publication of open-access journals; and meetings for the sharing of research. Investments in technology and course content that allow academics to teach research methods to new researchers and to LGBTI groups outside of academia may yield long-term and sustainable growth in research capacity. This may be especially pertinent to NGOs that have expressed an interest in research and data collection but currently lack the capacity and experience to undertake it. At present, the capacity to collect and use data varies significantly across countries.59 (e) Engage the private sector and support partnerships between companies, researchers, and LGBTI NGOs. The private sector has the capacity to support and enrich the research needed for LGBTI inclusion and rights protection. Aside from partnerships based on big data analysis (see section 2 above), some companies can partner with researchers and LGBTI organizations to better understand the treatment of their employees and how to provide appropriate services to their customers. For example, some companies are beginning to utilize the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s Corporate Equality Index to determine if LGBT (not including intersex) staff receive equal benefits or face barriers in being hired.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "febc3946-8aac-471b-8d60-67e4d834981b": {"__data__": {"id_": "febc3946-8aac-471b-8d60-67e4d834981b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investing-research-revolution-lgbti-inclusion", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Investing in a research revolution for LGBTI inclusion", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investing-research-revolution-lgbti-inclusion", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8b3927d2aa6450fe5b103f3aee1249329ba31a684b421714cbb8ab6f2d9b9708"}, "2": {"node_id": "816a2715-e435-4760-b62e-c1df4c95dd4f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investing-research-revolution-lgbti-inclusion", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3f4dd2ad4143776744d96c5f27dc3bf23909ee85311b9ded980fdb38fa5ef236"}}, "hash": "47cd333048274ef6f9f0afde2f62c886a03af2a01ac709405557812e39167801", "text": "This data allow the tracking of practices promoting equality that may also boost overall labor productivity and larger societal goals.

This funding can be leveraged to support the research needs of LGBTI people in developing and middle-income countries. Recommendation 2: Invest in the establishment and operationalization of the UNDP-led LGBTI Inclusion Index (contributing to the national capacity building outlined in Recommendation 1 of government, civil society, and academia) to undertake the targeted research required for each of the identified priority dimensions of the LGBTI Inclusion Index: health, economic well- being, personal security and violence, education, and political and civic participation. The dimensions of the LGBTI Inclusion Index are a particularly important focus, since the index will be a global benchmark for progress in inclusion that, according to LGBTI activists, will have enormous value. The index will require the collection of data from all countries where such information is available, as well as investments in new LGBTI-specific data collection, including data that can be disaggregated across the different LGBTI subgroups, with a view to increasing the number of participating countries. This will also have major positive spillover effects, since the valuable data and knowledge produced by the index can also be used in many other projects. Although the UNDP-led LGBTI Inclusion Index is a large research and capacity-building undertaking, the five dimensions lend themselves well to collaborative efforts between different funders who might prefer to focus on one or two dimensions in the short, medium, and/or long term (see figure 2). Accordingly, one potential template for a process might include these stages: \uf0b7 Short-term investments (first 12 months): Funding to design, establish, and maintain a platform or repository to house the data on LGBTI inclusion to be collected over time, and support for a team of researchers to (i) assess existing data on the five priority dimensions, (ii) identify proxy indicators and agree on the approaches to gathering existing data that would be drawn on for the data collection envisaged by the LGBTI Inclusion Index, and (iii) develop LGBTI-specific indicators against which new data would be collected as well as appropriate methodologies for collecting this data in various country contexts. \uf0b7 Medium-term investments (12\u201348 months): Resourcing partnerships at the global level (civil society, academia, government, multilaterals) for mining and analyzing the data using proxy indicators in all countries where relevant data exist and issuing analytical reports; establishing and resourcing national partnerships (government, civil society, academia) to undertake the research for data collection of LGBTI-specific indicators in 20\u201325 countries, ensuring the inclusion of low-, medium-, and high-income countries across all regions. Capacity building for national data collection, funding to maintain the 60 This is another point that was raised at the Uruguay conference. 23 data repository, and advocacy activities to engage additional governments to participate in the data collection. \uf0b7 Long-term investments (48\u201360 months and beyond): Providing resources for expanding new research efforts and adding additional countries where data collection is undertaken, ensuring a balance of participating countries from all regions and country typologies, maintaining the data repository, continuing to build national capacities for LGBTI data collection, regularly issuing analytical reports, supporting advocacy for data collection on LGBTI inclusion, and providing technical assistance to countries to utilize the data and analysis to inform national policies and programs. Figure 2: Measuring the Inclusion of LGBTI People 24 Recommendation 3. Investing in existing, new, or future research priorities identified by LGBTI civil society groups, whether related to local, national, regional, or global issues. In addition to the LGBTI Inclusion Index\u2013related measures, section 2 presents many other important research priorities that have been mentioned by at least some activists in particular contexts, as listed in box 1: migration, conversion therapies, measures of stigma and public opinion, links to gender norms, and the impact of laws, policies, and programs. Additional funding opportunities for such research can be tailored to the needs expressed by local, national, or regional CSOs. Also, increasing the availability of general research funding would facilitate innovation and research into under-explored aspects of the LGBTI experience by social and health scientists who seek to more fully understand the lived experiences of LGBTI people. Invest in projects that LGBTI civil society groups have already identified as priorities: Many LGBTI NGOs have expressed interest in being more involved in the choice of research projects but lack the necessary funding to finance them. An investment in the priorities they identify may yield knowledge that they can tailor to their own efforts to influence policy.61 Additionally, some research projects are already under development by", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0a0412d7-eaff-4f62-aa5a-a6cf6e84c7d5": {"__data__": {"id_": "0a0412d7-eaff-4f62-aa5a-a6cf6e84c7d5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investing-research-revolution-lgbti-inclusion", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Investing in a research revolution for LGBTI inclusion", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investing-research-revolution-lgbti-inclusion", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "314039aaf0046f0e6f62aa6cd710750d9b329c40c20394544d8359ce7d731651"}}, "hash": "314039aaf0046f0e6f62aa6cd710750d9b329c40c20394544d8359ce7d731651", "text": "LGBTI NGOs, whether on their own or in concert with other researchers. Invest in researchers and activists to create a research agenda and pilot projects on intersex people: One particularly large gap that calls for a research initiative, including pilot research projects, concerns intersex people\u2019s lives and concerns. The UNDP-led LGBTI Inclusion Index validation meeting clarified that the current research and data strategies related to sexual orientation and gender identity questions will not be adequate for an understanding of the challenges faced by people with variations in sex characteristics. Already, intersex groups have called for unbiased and peer-reviewed research on the impact of both non-binary sex characteristics and nonconsensual \u201cnormalizing\u201d surgery on health outcomes\u2014including mental health.62 Additionally, nonmedical research on the social, economic, and health issues for intersex people is at a relatively early stage, with some recent projects showing promise.63 A concerted effort to identify intersex-specific research priorities and to begin pilot studies would provide useful knowledge as well as guidelines for the LGBTI Inclusion Index and other research projects. Look for projects to support that target other under-researched groups: Research gaps are broad and deep for all subgroups of the LGBTI population. However, as noted in section 2, some groups are especially under-researched, for example, transgender men and women as well as low-income LGBTI people. 61 This point was emphasized in consultations at the Uruguay conference. 62This goal may be challenging to achieve. In many contexts, the medical establishment tends to promote compulsory surgery at birth or in early childhood. In addition, there are inadequate policies to ensure that people born with variant sex characteristics are able to provide informed consent throughout their lives. This is another topic that was emphasized in consultation with LGBTI organizations and institutional partners at the Uruguay conference. 63 T. Jones and others, Intersex: Stories and Statistics from Australia (Cambridge, UK: OpenBook Publishers, 2016). 25 4. Conclusion: What Success Will Look Like If sufficient strategic investments are made in LGBTI research and data collection, the knowledge about LGBTI people will increase dramatically and empower countries and LGBTI people to move toward the achievement of many of the SDGs and the promise to promote inclusion and respect for human rights for all\u2014with no one left behind. There will be a broad and active infrastructure at the national and global level that is sustained by funding for priority research, including government participation in producing new data and studies. That research will inform and generate new programs, policies, and investments for LGBTI inclusion and human rights protections. The knowledge generated will be relevant, timely, and useful for decision making by LGBTI people, civil society groups, policy makers, development agencies, private philanthropy organizations, and businesses. The interactions between governments, multilateral and bilateral institutions, researchers, and CSOs will create a sustainable flow of research: Researchers in academia, government agencies, multilateral and bilateral development institutions, and LGBTI NGOs will be conducting quantitative and qualitative research on LGBTI people in every sizable country. They will have courses and materials to teach students and other researchers how to do more of that research. Researchers will have financial support, data, publication outlets, and access to existing research. Networks of researchers will provide expertise to the public, push each other to expand knowledge, and develop new methodologies to better answer difficult questions. Box 2: Recommendations for Strategic Investments Recommendation 1. Fund the development of capacity and partnerships between governments, LGBTI civil society groups, academics, multilateral institutions, and other stakeholders to create an infrastructure for LGBTI research and data collection. Recommendation 2.

Recommendation 3. Fund existing, new, or future research priorities identified by LGBTI civil society groups, whether related to local, national, regional, or global issues. 26 Policy makers, national statistical agencies, funders, human rights and development agencies, businesses, NGOs, media outlets, health professionals and agencies, and other end users of research will know about new problems and have new research-based strategies and evidence to address them. Research users will generate and suggest new questions and ideas for research, and some will be active participants in the new research projects.

The primary authors have met with researchers and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in a variety of countries and contexts to discuss LGBTI- related research, including through numerous meetings on these issues with stakeholders from around the globe. LGBTI and research stakeholders include those from the United States, Europe, South America, China, Kenya, and the Republic of Korea, and institutional stakeholders include a variety of institutions, such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Office of the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights (OHCHR), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Feedback was also received from OutRight Action International and the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex Association (ILGA), two ECOSOC-accredited global LGBTI organizations that work in multiple regions around the world. Altogether, these discussions included the challenges faced by researchers, the needs of civil society, and the resources required to build capacity. In addition, UNDP conducted an extensive consultation process with a variety of stakeholders to develop the LGBTI Inclusion Index. Input was also sought about the question of communicating the research priorities of LGBTI activists and civil society groups to scholars by requesting information on several listservs that included researchers, civil society organization leaders, activists, and funders. Less formally, there were in-person discussions about this topic with activists and academics from a variety of fields and geographic locations, including some from the Global South. Additionally, a draft of this report was circulated to stakeholders in LGBTI organizations, key institutions, the funding community, and researchers for feedback. Finally, the authors and institutional partners presented and discussed this paper at the 2016 conference, Global LGBTI Human Rights Conference: Non-Violence, Non-Discrimination, and Social Inclusion, in Montevideo, Uruguay in July 2016.64 Specifically, the authors and partners invited conference participants to a side event to present this paper\u2019s main arguments and gather feedback on research priorities, strategic investments, and any additional concerns. During these extensive discussions, over 40 conference participants joined in and represented a diversity of organizations and institutions from different regions, think tanks, governments, and bilateral aid agencies. This final version incorporates this significant feedback from conference participants. As per UNDP and World Bank quality assurance processes, this paper was separately peer reviewed by both institutions to ensure quality and accuracy. This final version incorporates edits and comments from the peer reviewers. 64 See the website, Global LGBTI Human Rights Conference at http://www.lgbtimontevideo2016.org/en/. 28 Acknowledgments This paper was written by Dr. M.

After decades of sustained advocacy and action in the area of policy and legal reform, a majority of countries in the Asia-Pacific region now have laws criminalizing violence against women, including sexual violence. Yet despite these achievements, a historic deficit in the punishment and moral sanctioning of such crimes remains. A United Nations study that interviewed more than 10,000 men in six countries across the Asia-Pacific region found alarmingly high levels of sexual violence, ranging from 10-62 percent across sites.2 Moreover, the majority of men who admitted to perpetrating rape faced no legal consequences and many did not even report feelings of guilt, suggesting that such violence remains largely tolerated and normalized in many of our societies. The obligation of States to exercise \u2018due diligence\u2019 to prevent, investigate and prosecute cases of violence against women and girls is well-established under international law. Yet implementation of legal commitments has been far too slow. Too often, the very infrastructure of justice \u2013 the police, the courts and the judiciary \u2013 fails to provide women and girls facing violence with adequate protection, redress and justice. In order to understand, and ultimately close, this gap between policy and practice, the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) have supported this comparative study on the policing and prosecution of sexual violence in Asia, with a particular focus on Thailand and Viet Nam.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "44cccfe5-8855-4a06-9cfa-7c75185a1068": {"__data__": {"id_": "44cccfe5-8855-4a06-9cfa-7c75185a1068", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Trial of Rape: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "af93991988f872a74e8e1a43f01122ff118fb350212b74c3baf8a806896ea733"}, "2": {"node_id": "c345ad5f-2fe8-45e2-a74d-e3237b9ef6b8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b375d5be0df79cbbbc9f76944a31dd0537918680683628f731669f5e95f80afb"}}, "hash": "5cff87a3dffe865e9fe1d14ed5978113969632f69f0a1d74c1c05ce8d6431927", "text": "We would like to thank the governments of Thailand and Viet Nam for supporting the study and providing useful data which contributed to the findings in the report.

New York. THE TRIAL OF RAPE: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in, Thailand and Viet Nam vi Foreword vii say they have experienced sexual assault, but of these, only 11 percent reported it.3 This under-reporting has many causes, including the shame and stigma which are often placed on the violated woman after an attack. The focus is often placed on her behaviour rather than that of her attacker: questioning what she was wearing, where she was and what she may have done to \u2018provoke\u2019 the attack. Victims may also refrain from reporting because of fear that those entrusted with administering justice will meet them with indifference, or even blame them for the abuses suffered. This study shows that such fears are often well-founded, with a steady attrition of cases throughout the justice cycle \u2013 from reporting and investigation to prosecution and trial \u2013 and hostile attitudes among many service providers. More importantly, the study \u2013 the first of its kind in the Asia-Pacific region \u2013 provides important new insights into where and why attrition occurs and how it can be reduced. When the actors tasked with facilitating access to justice instead \u2018counsel \u2018and pressure victims to settle cases out of court, or treat them without regard for their dignity or privacy, many women eventually give up on a system which is often unresponsive to their needs. When the criminal justice system fails to fulfill women\u2019s human rights, this contributes to perpetuating cultures of reconciliation, cultures of invisibility, and cultures of impunity. This impunity \u2013 an exemption from punishment and accountability \u2013 fuels violence against women, reducing the impact of advocacy and hard-fought policy achievements. However, we know what needs to be done. Reports of violations must be received by state actors in the administration of justice who are well-trained and who understand the full scope of their obligations. The justice sector must be able to monitor its performance, through rigorous collection and analysis of the responses to reported violations. We must ensure that victims and survivors receive all the support services that they are entitled to and that they have access to protection, redress and justice. And most of all, we must all challenge and transform the harmful norms and cultural values that allow such violence to continue. To that end, it is especially encouraging that there is now global consensus for a 2030 development framework that includes a strong and transformative gender equality goal with clear and ambitious targets for ending violence against women. Every woman or girl who experiences violence has the right to count on a criminal justice system that is free from gender stereotyping and discrimination, treats her with respect, maintains her dignity and effectively delivers impartial and unbiased justice that is free from outdated norms and misconceptions about the nature and roles of women and men. Ensuring well-functioning justice systems is not only a prerequisite for ensuring gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment, but is essential for the rule of law and for sustaining just, peaceful and prosperous societies for all.

Rather, it seeks to identify key factors which can impact on attrition for the purpose of understanding how such attrition can be reduced. The study was limited to female victims of rape and sexual assault, including attempted rape and sexual assault, seeking justice through the formal criminal justice system. As such, it does not include non-reported cases or cases processed through informal justice mechanisms. Research findings The research found that women reporting cases of rape in Thailand and Viet Nam encounter significant societal, legal, and institutional policies and practices that act as barriers to justice. These barriers, in turn, can inhibit reporting of sexual violence and reduce the likelihood that a woman will persist in seeking redress through the criminal justice system. In both countries, women\u2019s and girls\u2019 vulnerability to sexual violence is embedded in and supported by discriminatory social and cultural values, patterns and practices. That police, prosecutors, and judges are not immune to biases and stereotypes can be seen in their attitudes towards the offences, the victims and the alleged perpetrators. These attitudes, in turn, can determine the manner in which they apply laws in practice, how speedily they respond, and their determination to exercise due diligence as state actors. The study suggests that criminal justice system service providers are not systematically held accountable for providing rights-based, victim- centred services. Many women have limited knowledge and limited access to information about their rights and what they can and should expect as they navigate complex criminal justice systems and processes. Protections offered to victims of sexual violence can be inadequate, as in limited victim or witness protection programmes, and communication between criminal justice service providers and victims largely ceases once the initial report has been taken. Where support services are limited, victims and their families may choose to forego seeing their cases through to completion. In both countries, attrition is high at the initial contact and reporting stage. Many victims are turned away and urged to seek mediation or other forms of settlement outside of the formal criminal justice system. Victims are often required to tell their story multiple times or are treated with disrespect and insensitivity. Police may refuse to take their reports, or take reports and then fail to conduct investigations, conduct inadequate investigations, or delay investigations. Court proceedings can be long and drawn out, and often focus on physical or forensic evidence or the victim\u2019s credibility rather than the credibility of the incident or the victim\u2019s lack of consent. Significant delays plague many victims going through the administration of justice, which can start with late onset and completion of police investigation and carry through to delays in setting trial dates. The victim\u2019s character, behaviour or dress is often Executive Summary xiii called into question. There is little preparation or court support for the victim. In many cases, the Court acquits the accused. There are few, if any, women- or victim- friendly facilities in police stations, hospitals, medical facilities where forensic medical examinations are conducted, or in courts. While sexual violence investigations are complex and challenging incidents to investigate, there are no specialized investigative units, and receiving officers and investigators receive little or no specialized training and professional development. There are few female police and investigating officers. Data collection and analysis mechanisms are limited.

The inadequacies include limited disaggregation of demographic characteristics of victims and perpetrators and poor record-keeping on duration of cases and on outcomes of police investigations and prosecutions. In addition, there is limited monitoring and evaluation of programmes and responses, leaving the justice systems without an evidence base on which to build strategies, policies and practices for improving services. There are limited referral networks and coordination mechanisms within the justice system, and between government, justice system agencies, and civil society service providers, often resulting in uncoordinated and inconsistent services. Data systems from different parts of the criminal justice system that do not speak to one another, and that may even use different definitions, terminology or case file numbers, further hamper effective collaboration and increase the risk of information loss. Good and promising policies and practices have been introduced in both countries. These range from promising legislation, to increased political will and commitment to fund coordinated support services, the establishment of one stop crisis centres, and the development of protocols for gender- responsive policing. However, limited implementation and accountability for action and inaction means that the full potential of these practices have yet to be realized. Recommendations To address the above challenges and to strengthen the criminal justice sector response to sexual violence, the study has identified priority recommendations in the following key areas: 1. Establishing quality essential justice services for victims that prioritize their safety, protection and support. 2. Building institutional capacities to transform organizational cultures and create gender awareness and sensitivity. 3. Promoting comprehensive legal and policy frameworks. 4. Ensure approaches sensitive to sexual violence survivors are reflected in criminal justice policies, practices and resources 5. Developing effective internal and external oversight and accountability mechanisms. 6. Promoting specialized expertise at all stages of the criminal justice system. 7. Promoting an integrated and coordinated criminal justice, government and civil society response. 8. Developing effective monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. 9. Prioritizing resources, both human and financial, for effective delivery of services. THE TRIAL OF RAPE: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam xiv The multi-country research was conducted in 2014 and reflected the national laws at the time. Between 2014 to 2017, the following laws related to sexual assaults have been updated in Thailand and Viet Nam. Thailand Changes to the Thai Criminal Code under Section 277 In Act No.23 B.E. 2558, Paragraph 5, previously stated that in the case where offender and victim are minors, the court may grant a permission for them to marry and for the offender to be acquitted. The amended text now states that while the court may grant a permission for the two parties to be married, the offender may also receive punishment. The jurisdiction of the offence has been shifted to the Juvenile Court instead of the Criminal Court. Changes to the Thai Criminal Code under Section 285/1 An addition was made in the Criminal Law Amendment Act No.23 B.E. 2558 to prohibit the offender from being acquitted by claiming that an offender does not realize the fact that the child victim is not yet over 13 years of age. Viet Nam Changes under the 2015 Penal Code in comparison to the 1999 Penal Code The 2015 Penal Code has improved the handling of previous sexual violence offences by adding \u201cother sexual contacts\u201d as a constituent element of rape and forced sex crimes in addition to \u201csexual intercourse\u201d. This expanded the range of prohibited acts to include vaginal, anal and oral penetra- tion of a sexual nature of the body of another person with any bodily part or object. Editor\u2019s Note xv Editor\u2019s Note Rape: Under Article 141, rape is defined as an act by anyone who uses violence, threatens to use violence, deception, coercion or takes advantage of the victim\u2019s inability to self-defend the victim in order to have sexual intercourse or other sexual contact with the victim against the victim\u2019s will. Article 142 separately prohibits rape against persons under 16 years old. Having sex with persons under 13 years old is considered a statutory rape. Forced sex: Under Article 143, forced sex is construed as any act by any person who use violence, threat of use of violence or fraud, deception, intimidation, etc. to coerce their dependents or other- wise desperate persons to unwillingly have sexual intercourse or other sexual contacts absolutely against the will of the victim. Article 144 separately prohibits forced sex against persons between 13 and 16 years old.

Changes under the 2015 Criminal Procedure Code in comparison to the 2003 Criminal Procedure Code The 2015 Criminal Procedure Code introduced a new chapter on protection of informants, witnesses, victims and other participants of the procedural process. Under Chapter XXXIV, victims have the right to be informed of their right to protection, how to request protection, compensation for damage, restoration of honor and respect for their lawful rights and interests during the protection period. The protection measures under Article 486 include: \u00a8 Deploying forces, professional measures, using weapons, supporting tools and other instrument as caution, security measures \u00a8 Restricted traveling interactions \u00a8 Keeping the relevant information confidential \u00a8 Moving, maintaining confidentiality of living and working places, changing traceability, personal background, identification features \u00a8 Deterring, cautioning, defusing abusive acts, preventing and responding to abusive acts While the Code does not include any provision requiring the offender to stay away from places where the victim of violence is present, the Code stipulates one basis to impose temporary custody against the offender when he \u201cuses threats, exerts control over, seek revenge against witnesses or victims and their family members (Article 119). THE TRIAL OF RAPE: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam \u00a9 UN Women/ Krista Seddon Violence against women and girls remains the most pervasive violation of human rights.4 In Asia, as in the rest of the world, such violence is widespread, systemic and culturally entrenched, affecting women and girls regardless of context. Sexual violence \u2013 including rape and other forms of sexual assault \u2013 is often deemed socially acceptable, due to entrenched social and cultural norms that minimize the value of women\u2019s roles and reinforce their status as subordinate to men. Around the region, high societal tolerance for sexual violence results in low reporting, high attrition, and individual and institutional biases against victims. The persistent levels of sexual violence have devastating health, social, cultural and economic impacts on women and girls, their families, communities and society at large. Research suggests that if a rape or sexual assault victim can move beyond the social stigma of \u2018going public\u2019 with her experience and report the crime, she often experiences unequal access to justice compared to those reporting other non-sexual crimes. Systemic impunity in cases of sexual violence is a gap in responsive and accountable governance institutions and mechanisms. ntroduction I 4.

Introduction 1 THE TRIAL OF RAPE: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam 2 Attrition \u2013 the process by which cases fail to proceed through the justice system5 - on sexual violence cases remains high. Although some global attrition studies on sexual violence exist, this study, on the policing and prosecution of reported cases of rape and sexual assault in Thailand and Viet Nam, is the first comparative study on attrition in Asia. In recent years, there has been extensive progress in the region to strengthen the legislative frameworks around violence against women. There are now at least 33 out of 39 countries in Asia and the Pacific6 that have laws to criminalize such violence, although there are only around 14 countries in the region in which marital rape is a crime.7 Moreover, as in other regions, progress on implementing existing legislation and commitments and strengthening overall accountability has been far too slow. Key challenges include: inadequate resources for implementing existing laws and policies, capacity gaps amongst criminal justice actors (law enforcement, prosecution and the judiciary), flawed coordination and referral mechanisms on issues of human rights and violence against women, and limited availability of regulations and protocols establishing lines of ministerial responsibility. Earlier studies in Thailand and Viet Nam illustrate that police in many cases continue to \u201ccounsel\u201d and \u201csettle\u201d cases at the police station, rather than taking appropriate legal action in cases of domestic violence.8 States have an obligation under international law to exercise \u2018due diligence\u2019 in establishing effective measures to prevent, investigate and prosecute cases of violence against women. Yet gaps in, and weak implementation of, legal frameworks often result in inadequate protection, redress and justice for women and girls facing violence. Multiple data sources confirm that the percentage of women reporting cases of violence or accessing health, protection, support or legal services remains low and women mostly tend to report cases of severe physical violence.9,10,11 Even", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c2adf294-7ea0-48b3-a62e-0ad3f014f50e": {"__data__": {"id_": "c2adf294-7ea0-48b3-a62e-0ad3f014f50e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Trial of Rape: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c7c6bb677f12c36e5adab55cb18f9a89f79ca7824f805a2f40b425b2f0698aed"}, "3": {"node_id": "0bee78f5-31e1-4b33-8fc9-c7fc5986ffde", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "13e9a4ccd0ebbe8a5ce8049180dee9dee6c99884f9e4028c383e9fad046d36d1"}}, "hash": "8c84cb17f77472ab45b313890189aa18be5349044449d3f154b57f72c4f222bf", "text": "when cases are reported, the steps involved in accessing the formal legal system (the \u201cjustice chain\u201d) often breaks down, with high attrition rates and few cases resulting in conviction.12 The research conducted as part of this study reinforces these findings. 5.

Introduction 3 As noted in the 2011-2012 Progress of the World\u2019s Women report: \u201cIn rich and poor countries alike, the infrastructure of justice \u2013 the police, the courts and the judiciary \u2013 is failing women and girls, which manifests itself in poor services and hostile attitudes from the very people whose duty it is to fulfill women\u2019s human rights.\u201d13 To better understand this gap between policy and practice, and ultimately in order to design and implement more evidence-based programming with which to close it, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and UN Women have supported this comparative study on the policing and prosecution of sexual violence \u2013 with a particular focus on rape and sexual assault \u2013 in Asia. The background, research and findings of the study, conducted between October 2013 and September 2014, are found in this report. Findings are based on limited case file data that was available for access from the police, prosecution and courts of the country of study during this timeframe, plus a range of qualitative interviews. While marked gaps in available data exist, leading to substantial unknown or undetermined conclusions, the study represents an important first step in building a platform for dialogue on the topic. 12.

Background and objectives of the study 1.1 Background The study into the investigation, prosecution and punishment of sexual violence against women and girls in Thailand and Viet Nam, is the first comparative study on attrition of sexual violence in the Asia region. Understanding attrition as the process by which cases drop out of, or are lost by, the criminal justice system, the study sets out to research how rape and sexual violence cases are handled in these two countries, and, in doing so, identifies strategic entry points for reducing impunity for sexual violence and strengthening the enforcement of policy commitments.

The aim of the study is to expand the regional knowledge base on how to advance the implementation of laws and expand access to justice for women and girls who experience sexual violence and abuse. To this end, the study aims to identify strategic entry points for programming, to provide key duty bearers \u2013 especially law enforcement agencies, prosecution and the judiciary \u2013 with crucial knowledge around where and why attrition happens, and to provide concrete recommendations for how institutional capacity and accountability to meet legal and policy commitments can be strengthened. The overall objective is to contribute to ending violence against women and girls through strengthened state due diligence. Specifically, this comparative study seeks to: \u00a8 identify common deficits as well as good practices in Thailand and Viet Nam in the state legal response to violence against women; \u00a8 highlight substantive and institutional factors in the legal system that can cause attrition and impunity, thereby undermining women\u2019s and girls\u2019 access to justice and the implementation of laws on violence against women; and \u00a8 facilitate and guide future legal reform, policy-making and programming. Low conviction rates for sexual violence offences may indicate a failure of one or more aspects of the criminal justice system to uphold the rights of victims to access justice. The study therefore examines, where possible, the full range of components of the reporting, investigation and prosecution process, such as police investigations, committal proceedings and trials, as each step is important for determining the outcome of a case and each provides important information on where and how attrition could be reduced. 1.3 Scope This study focuses on female victims of rape and sexual assault. The scope of criminal offences studied have been limited to rape and sexual assault, including attempted rape/ sexual assault. Both countries have criminalized rape or forced sexual intercourse, however the definitions and criminal elements vary. This study does not include examination of other types of sexual violence, such as sexual harassment, stalking, voyeurism, trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation, or forced prostitution. Attrition refers to the process by which cases of rape and sexual assault fail to proceed through the criminal justice system; those cases that are discontinued and thus fail to reach trial and/or result in a conviction.14 Although it is recognized that globally, a high number (75 percent or more) of rapes do not ever enter the criminal justice system,15 the focus of the study is on reports of rape and sexual assault made to state authorities, especially to the police, which should trigger the administration of justice 14. Definition from Lovett and Kelly (2009) Different Systems, Similar Outcomes? Tracking Attrition in Reported Rape Cases Across Europe. Child and Women Abuse Studies Unit, London Metropolitan University. 15. The International Violence against Women Survey noted that less than 20 percent of women reported the last incident of violence they experienced to police: Johnson, H., Ollus, N., and Nevala, S. (2008) Violence against Women: An International Perspective (HEUNI). Other literature reviews estimate that rates of reporting range from 5 to 25 percent, meaning 75 percent or more of rape cases do not even enter the criminal justice system, see Kelly, L., and Lovett, J. and Regan, L. (2005) A Gap or a Chasm? Attrition in Reported Rape Cases (Home Office Research Study 293). Context and Background 7 in protecting victims and in prosecuting and punishing perpetrators. While under-reporting is a critical topic to be examined, it is beyond the scope of this particular study. Rather, the study seeks to understand how and why reported cases are dropped from, or exit the system. Such points of exit can be located within the police service, procuracies/prosecution services or in courts, and can occur at various stages, from the recording of the offence by police to final disposition or outcome. The study does not aim to provide nationally representative data on overall attrition rates, but rather to identify key trends related to attrition and the factors associated with attrition at each stage of the criminal justice process. It is essential to understand why cases are: \u00a8 not passing the reporting stage (for example, were they considered to be \u2018false allegations,\u2019 or did victims withdraw their complaint or refuse to proceed?); \u00a8 dropped at the investigative stage (is this due", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fa21ec99-76a1-4e8f-b7f7-3645ba08a750": {"__data__": {"id_": "fa21ec99-76a1-4e8f-b7f7-3645ba08a750", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Trial of Rape: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "39e890d01a3f9f1c7851b99ac019c9d4206cbb6bd2ada013aae8bbdcf58b4217"}}, "hash": "39e890d01a3f9f1c7851b99ac019c9d4206cbb6bd2ada013aae8bbdcf58b4217", "text": "to the cases being considered unsolved, unfounded, or not being classified as a crime, suspects not apprehended, arrest warrants denied, evidentiary challenges such as forensic examination or victim withdrawal?); \u00a8 discontinued by the prosecutors; or \u00a8 dropped at trial or the accused is acquitted. The study focuses on the key stakeholders within the criminal justice system, including police, prosecutors, judges, and other important stakeholders \u2013 such as victim services \u2013 that assist victims in navigating the criminal justice system, including civil society organizations, medical professionals/health centres, academics and leading researchers on the topic of violence against women. 1.4 What is included in the report? Chapter I: Context and Background sets out the context within which female victims of sexual violence find themselves navigating through the criminal justice system. The chapter explores global and regional prevalence of sexual violence, introduces the concept of attrition of sexual violence cases within the criminal justice system, and A focus on the formal crimi- nal justice system This study focuses on strengthening the performance of the formal crim- inal justice systems in Thailand and Viet Nam, while recognizing that customary, traditional or informal justice systems are also included in these jurisdictions. When the formal justice system is responsive to victim needs and priorities, and decisions appropriately reflect and resonate with the local context, the formal justice system can ensure meaningful social change and a reduction in the incidence of sexual violence is easier to achieve. Definitions used within this report This report uses the term \u2018victim\u2019 to refer to those who report sexual violence \u2013 specifically, rape and sexual assault \u2013 given that it reflects the terminology used in the legal process. When sharing the stories of those interviewed who have experi- enced sexual violence, we use the term \u2018survivor\u2019 to reflect the agency of these women in seeking justice and in sharing their stories. The term \u2018suspect\u2019 is used to describe the person who is alleged to have committed rape or sexual assault and the term \u2018accused\u2019 is used to describe an individual who has been charged. THE TRIAL OF RAPE: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam 8 presents the international legal and policy framework designed to protect women and girls\u2019 human rights. Chapter I also describes the methodology and framework used to gather and analyse data and information. Chapter II: Study Findings: Understanding Barriers to Justice and Attrition in Sexual Violence Cases explores the societal, legal, procedural and institutional factors that influence attrition and place barriers for women and girl victims of sexual violence. The chapter includes: an analysis of the laws related to sexual violence within both of the countries of study; exploration of the criminal justice system stakeholders and service providers and their roles; and a critical analysis of the criminal processes within each stage of the criminal justice system process in both of the countries of study, identifying where, how and why they impact attrition. A comparative analysis of the factors affecting a victim\u2019s experiences and decisions, and criminal justice system processes within both countries, lays the foundation for recommendations. Finally, Recommendations summarizes the study findings and makes broad regional recommendations, which are based on common trends and issues seen across both countries, as well as a consideration of entry points for change with a focus on the criminal justice system. The report also includes a Glossary, Appendices containing maps of the legal process in both countries, and References for further reading. 2.1 Sexual violence against women and girls: A global issue Sexual violence against women and girls is recognized as a form of violence against women. Although many forms of sexual violence exist, for the purpose of this study, the focus has been placed on rape and sexual assault.16 These forms of violence can take place in the domestic or public sphere by family members, friends, neighbours or strangers, to women and girls of any age, ability, culture, ethnicity, religion and sexuality. According to a 2013 World Health Organization (WHO) global review of available data, 35 percent of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence.17 Some country studies show that up to 70 percent of women experience physical or sexual violence perpetrated by men in their lifetimes, the majority by husbands, intimate partners or someone they know.18 It is estimated that 150 million girls under 18 have experienced sexual violence.19 2.

Context and Background 9 Gender-based power relations within society put many girls at a much higher risk for some forms of violence, and sexual violence in particular, than boys. A multi-country study reveals that the prevalence of forced first sex among adolescent girls younger than 15 years ranged between 11 percent and 48 percent globally.20 A United Nations study on men\u2019s use of violence in Asia and the Pacific revealed that 26-80 percent of men reported having perpetrated physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence and 10-40 percent of men reported committing non-partner rape, with sexual entitlement being the most commonly cited motivation.21 2.2 Sexual violence against women and girls in Asia Social and cultural norms condoning sexual violence in Asia As is the case in other regions, societies in Asia are predominantly patriarchal, marked by strict social norms related to women\u2019s and men\u2019s roles and expected conduct which continue to be held in both urban and rural areas. Understanding the gendered roles22 in Thailand and Viet Nam contributes to enhanced knowledge of the risks, victimization and realities women and girls face in reporting crimes of rape and sexual assault;23 how laws are applied by the various justice actors; the extent to which the justice institutions and structures replicate gender inequalities in society; and women\u2019s participation and advancement within the criminal justice system. In Thailand, commonly held beliefs among both men and women include that the wife is the husband\u2019s asset and that women ought to obey men, as illustrated by the expression that women are the hind legs of the elephant following men\u2019s front legs.24 Rape is sometimes legitimized, both within communities and by the media, based on a woman\u2019s past sexual history.25 There are two words for rape in Thai: kom-keun, which invokes the global understanding of forced intercourse without consent, and plam, a colloquial term denoting sex with force and without explicit consent that is more socially accepted, exacerbated by its regular appearance on Thai soap operas where \u2018bad girls\u2019 are punished with rape and then \u2018succumb\u2019 and \u2018fall in love\u2019 with their perpetrators.26 In Viet Nam, men are considered active agents in sexual relationships and women are expected to please their husbands by meeting their sexual demands.27 In both Thailand and Viet Nam, the importance of family is emphasized in the culture, laws and policies, and the law is implemented within the context of promoting the idea of \u2018harmony\u2019 (Thailand), and the \u2018happy family\u2019 (Viet Nam), which may discourage reporting of violence within the family. 20.

A 2003 WHO study on domestic violence and women\u2019s health34 found that 30 percent of ever-partnered women in Bangkok and 29 percent in Nakhonsawan reported that they had experienced sexual violence by an intimate partner. The same study suggested that 37 percent of physically or sexually abused women in Bangkok, and 46 percent in Nakhonsawan, never told anyone about the violence they had experienced, and if they did, it was usually to their parents or partner\u2019s family. Only 20 percent of physically abused women in Bangkok and 10 percent in Nakhonsawan ever turned to formal services (health, police, and religious/local leaders) for help. According to UNODC, the reporting rate rose from 7.7 per 100,000 in 2005 in Thailand, to 8.0 in 2006.35 According to the Thai Public Health Ministry, there were 31,866 incidents of rape reported in 2013.36 Similarly, the Thailand Development Research Institute37 estimates 30,000 cases of rape occurring each year in the country \u2013 a figure derived from a survey of 28.

From 2008 to 2013, on average, the number of cases reported to the police was approximately 4,000 per year. According to these statistics, 87 percent of rape cases therefore go unreported to police in Thailand. In recent years in Viet Nam, more research has focused on domestic violence. Sexual violence in the family, particularly marital rape, is often not reported to officials, however in a 2010 national study on domestic violence against women in Viet Nam, 10 percent of ever- married women reported in the interviews that they experienced sexual violence by husbands in their lifetime and 4 percent in the past 12 months. Women who reported sexual violence almost always also report physical violence.38 A survey conducted by the Viet Nam National Assembly Department of Social Affairs in 2006 found that 30 percent of women surveyed said they were forced into unwanted sex by their husbands.39 As in Thailand, little research on rape and sexual violence in the community exists. The 2010 national study on domestic violence compared partner and non-partner violence and found that women in Viet Nam are three times more likely to have experienced violence by partners rather than by someone else. About 2 percent of women reported sexual violence by someone other than a husband since they were 15 years old.40 Most women reported that the perpetrators were strangers and boyfriends and only rarely were family members, which aligns with cultural norms focused on family unity and harmony.

It\u2019s because when women are sexually attacked, they get blamed for \u2018asking for it\u2019, for being in the wrong place at the wrong time when they should have stayed home as \u2018good girls\u2019 do. Their dresses and life history are scrutinized to judge their characters to see if they are \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019 girls. If they have the courage to fight the social stigma as \u2018tainted women\u2019, and \u2018broken goods\u2019 to seek justice, they first get grilled by rude questioning in public by the police, then 38.

THE TRIAL OF RAPE: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam 12 by lawyers in court who often resort to digging into the victims\u2019 life stories to show they are morally loose women capable of blackmailing their clients. This is what the victims painfully describe as \u2018repeat rapes\u2019\u2026 In addition, the burden is also on the rape victims to prove that it\u2019s not consensual sex. Often, when they don\u2019t have severe injuries to show, the criminals get the benefit of the doubt. When the court cases take forever, most victims think it is simply not worth it to seek justice, and then go on to live with their traumas that often last a lifetime.\u201d43 Sanitsuda Ekachai, Editorial Pages Editor, Bangkok Post Although this quote is taken from an editorial piece written with a Thai rape victim in mind, it could easily be the case in most countries globally, including Viet Nam or other countries in the region. Rape represents one of the most brutal forms of physical and psychological violation. If a victim chooses to report her case to the police and follow through the criminal justice process (investigation, prosecution and trial), she can often expect to tell her story multiple times, each time having to relive traumatic events, thus being re-victimized. She may be subjected to scrutiny and invasive and degrading physical examinations, and unlike other crimes, is often forced to prove that the crime took place and that she is a legitimate victim, making it seem that she is the person under investigation. It is understandable, then, that attrition rates for rape and sexual assault cases remain high around the world. A review of global attrition studies Several attrition studies from other regions provide insights into how different criminal justice systems handle cases of sexual violence and offer points for comparison with the countries researched within this study.44 The studies reviewed focus on New Zealand, South Africa, the United States, and several European countries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "438408eb-a6e4-495a-b485-652362b56445": {"__data__": {"id_": "438408eb-a6e4-495a-b485-652362b56445", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Trial of Rape: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d71d8e9369ccdabc6207890e4196365c18d4f2f2b05976c8cd48bd12946acefb"}, "2": {"node_id": "e84a3d8f-6dc1-4d51-83d8-abed24a4dcae", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "410be832cde27e1b50b1c69c47bd09f8f5c8b3e73343c7969b4aa70afc568916"}}, "hash": "d4f2869383ecaff9a0c3da0d26a54689de5de9805a9775fc3ed1ee4bfdb217b0", "text": "Each features a multi-methodological approach including quantitative and qualitative research methods and applies a tiered approach to understanding attrition: first locating attrition points during the various stages of the criminal justice process and then exploring how attrition occurs.

Context and Background 13 Extensive under-reporting of rape and sexual assault cases According to a 2005 Australian study45 on women\u2019s decisions to report sexual assault and service responses, the \u2018dark figure\u2019 of sexual assaults is those cases that are not captured by police statistics because they are never reported. Research from South Africa suggests that rape is extensively under- reported; only one in nine women who had been raped reported to police.46 A recent survey in Europe found that, in total, victims had reported the most serious incident of partner violence to the police in 14 percent of cases and the most serious incident of non- partner violence in 13 percent of cases.47 The relationship between the victim and offender may constitute one of the biggest impediments to reporting, given that the majority of women are sexually assaulted by men they know. Literature suggests that the likelihood of a victim reporting to police decreases as the relational distance between victim and offender decreases. Police are most likely to be notified of sexual assaults perpetrated by strangers, followed by estranged partners or known non-intimate offenders.48 These victim-related barriers to reporting might include: belief that the incident was trivial and one she should deal with it on her own as a private matter; belief that the harm inflicted was unintentional; shame, embarrassment and self-blame or blame of others; and the desire to protect the offender, her family and her children.49 The criminal justice system can also impose barriers for victims such as: police unwillingness to file the case or not taking the case seriously; fear by the victim of not being believed or treated with hostility; and the 45.

Furthermore, perceptions of being treated poorly by the criminal justice system lead many victims to screen themselves out of law enforcement and legal proceedings at an early stage. Victims who are treated insensitively or unsym- pathetically often decide not to continue with the process. Victims want the violence to end and to be safe and protected. If they do not believe the criminal justice system can help them in that, they will likely not be cooperative. THE TRIAL OF RAPE: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam 14 victim\u2019s lack of knowledge of the legal process and how to report.50 Prevalence of high attrition rates and poor treatment of victims across all regions and countries studied Many studies revealed51 a pattern of attrition involving a high percentage of cases being \u2018no-crime\u2019 \u2013 meaning that the incident was classified as a \u2018false complaint\u2019 or cleared by the police as no crime disclosed \u2013 and an extremely small percentage returning a guilty verdict for rape or attempted rape. Indeed, a major focus of attrition studies rests on the low conviction rate for sexual violation cases and the high attrition that exists at all stages of the criminal justice process.52 Poor practices of police, prosecution and courts can also lead to early withdrawal of victims.53 Studies show that victim satisfaction is linked to the level of information they receive on criminal justice system procedures and throughout each stage of the criminal justice process.54 Stereotyping of rape victims and persistence of the \u2018classic\u2019 rape scenario Global literature suggests that there continues to be an excessive focus on the victim, her characteristics, sexual history, behaviour and perceived credibility, rather than on the action of the offender. This can result in re-victimization, victim withdrawal, and inappropriate attrition of cases not being classified as a crime.55 Scrutiny on the victim can be influenced by unrealistic stereotypes and myths held about rape and rape victims. In addition, the most marginalized victims\u2013 with physical or mental health issues, unemployed, and young unmarried women \u2013 are particularly disadvantaged by the criminal justice system.56 Layered atop these stereotypes is the ongoing pervasiveness of the notion of \u2018real rape,\u2019 first used by Susan Estrich in 1987 to describe sexual assaults committed by strangers, outdoors, and involving weapons and injury. As suggested by a 2001 study,57 while these four conditions are rare, they continue to be the template against which all reported rapes are measured: As powerfully suggested in a UK study, \u201cThe failure of CJS [the criminal justice system] to address stereotypes means that the processes involved in responding to reported rapes \u2013 from early investigation through to courtroom advocacy \u2013 can serve to reinforce, rather than challenge, narrow understandings of the crime of rape, who it happens to and who perpetrates it. The attrition process itself reflects, and reproduces, these patterns.\u201d58 Indeed, criminal justice actors take on 50. Ibid. 51.

The Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI)60 found that from 2009-2013, women victims of rape reported to the police in 4,000 cases annually. From those 4,000 cases, police averaged 2,400 arrests, illustrating that an average of 6 out of every 10 cases reported leads to arrest. TDRI also found that there could be as many as 30,000 rape incidents per year, which means that the unreported rape incidents could be as high as 87 percent. Different figures were found by the US State Department\u2019s human rights report on Thailand for 2013,61 which suggests that Thai police reported receiving 2,503 rape cases from January to September 2013 including one case in which the perpetrator killed the victim. Police arrested suspects in 1,456 of these cases. Additionally, between October 2012 and September 2013, there were 12,637 women (over 18) who reported abuse and sought assistance from the Ministry of Health\u2019s One Stop Crisis Centre (OSCC): Of these, 73 percent reported physical abuse and 18 percent reported sexual abuse. The Ministry of Social Development and Human Security recorded 450 cases of domestic violence nationwide in 2013. In only 134 cases, victims pursued criminal charges. Although information on the progression of these cases is largely unknown, 25 cases were under reconciliation procedures. In Viet Nam, statistics from the Criminal Police Department (Ministry of Public Security) show a steady increase in reporting of sexual offences over the five year period of 2008- 2012, with 947 reported cases in 2008 to 1,338 reported cases in 2012.62 These statistics only record two forms of sexual violence \u2013 rape of adults and having sex with a child \u2013 and showed that roughly three-quarters of sex offences reported involved child victims and only about 25 percent of the cases involve rape of women. 59.

Prosecution: states have a duty to exercise their criminal jurisdiction over those responsible for the violence. This duty must be exercised in an effective, prompt, impartial and thorough manner, which allows victims to take steps to try to stop the violence without fear of repercussions. 4. Punishment: states have an obligation to impose an appropriate sanction on perpetrators as a consequence of their having committed violence against women. 5.

Undertaken in Gauteng Province in 2003, Tracking Justice: The Attrition of Rape Cases through the Criminal Justice System in Gauteng analysed a sample of the reported rapes to comprehensively evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of policing and prosecution of sexual violence within this province. \u00a8 The in-depth, trans-European attrition study by Lovett and Kelly from 2003, entitled Different systems, similar outcomes? Tracking attrition in reported rape cases across Europe, which tracks data from 11 European countries with varying judicial systems and cultures. \u00a8 The Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs of New Zealand report from 2009 entitled Responding to Sexual Violence: Attrition in the New Zealand Criminal Justice System which analyses 1,955 police files from 2005 to 2007 tracking attrition through each stage of the criminal justice process. Context and Background 21 The study design integrates: \u00a8 Comprehensive desk review including global, regional and nationally available statistics, research, norms and standards on violence against women, sexual violence, attrition, and applicable criminal justice systems. \u00a8 Legal process and criminal justice actor/ stakeholder mapping in both countries. \u00a8 Review of an opportunistic sample of a total of 290 rape and sexual assault case files from Thailand and Viet Nam. \u00a8 Interviews and/or focus group discussions (FGDs) with a total of 213 criminal justice system stakeholders, service providers, survivors and representatives of key government ministries in the two countries of study.87 Common guiding issues for analysis included: \u00a8 Background information on international human rights standards for addressing sexual violence. \u00a8 Criminal justice system structures, processes and actors, and their role in contributing to or mitigating attrition of sexual violence cases. \u00a8 Policing standards, procedures and practices for handling rape and sexual assault cases. \u00a8 Prosecutorial response to reporting and pursuing a complaint, and committal hearings and trials.

However, while every effort was made to follow the intended research plan, a lack of full access to records to ensure randomness and systematic case tracking throughout the various stages of the criminal justice system required an adjustment to the original quantitative design. As a result, the quantitative component of the study ultimately consisted of a review of available cases, whether police and/or court files, to complement the qualitative findings by identifying key trends and providing additional insights into the current state of access to justice for women and girl victims of sexual violence. Available, accessible cases were analysed to confirm or challenge narratives provided via interviews and focus group discussions. The case review provides a partial profile of victims, suspects, and incidents. In the absence of consistent and available crime data and overall prevalence information on sexual violence against women and girls, the quantitative research serves as a complement to the qualitative research. Further details of study challenges and research limitations are described at the end of this section. The comparative framework developed for the regional study: \u00a8 maps and compares the legal frameworks and processes within Thailand and Viet Nam as they pertain to sexual violence; \u00a8 identifies and analyses potential trigger points for attrition stemming from each country\u2019s legal framework and procedures; \u00a8 identifies key patterns and trends associated with victim, suspect and incident profiles in each country; determines key trends related to attrition at each stage of the criminal justice process (reporting, investigation, pre- trial/prosecution, trial); and \u00a8 highlights commonalities and differences among victims\u2019 experiences with the criminal justice system and process in both countries of study. 87. This included 83 interviews in Thailand, and 31 interviews in Viet Nam including Government officials, criminal justice system practitioners, service providers, and survivors. THE TRIAL OF RAPE: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam 22 A victim/survivor-centred approach This study\u2019s approach is founded on the principles of gender equality and women\u2019s empow- erment, which informed the development of gender-sensitive, victim-centred qualitative and quantitative research methods. These methods were developed with the intention of consistency across both countries of study while acknowledging the need to remain sensitive to specific socio-political, legal and cultural contexts and differences that exist. Throughout the research process, and as will be discussed within the limitations of research section, such differences did impact the ability of national research teams to gather qual- ity data for analysis. It is important to focus on victims\u2019 needs and perspectives to bring to light their often-invis- ible experiences of the criminal justice process as well as to identify their specific needs and interests related to the criminal justice system.

As previously described, the revised methodology blended a case review and statistical analysis with key informant interviews and focus group discussions with key criminal justice actors, support services and survivors.

That is, a nonprobability sample \u2013 which is not random, having the potential for bias \u2013 that is based on what is readily available. and case exit points from the criminal justice system. Google Forms was leveraged as the platform for statistical analysis. Research teams reviewed police and court files that they were able to locate and access, which were of rapes and sexual assaults of women and girls that entered the criminal justice system between January 2008 and December 2012. Research sites were selected by national research teams in consultation with national partner institutions and UN partner agencies. Given the variable record systems and access points in both countries of study, the stratified sampling94 initially proposed could not be implemented. Opportunistic sampling95 became the method of case file collection at each of the identified study sites. In Thailand, researchers were able to access police records from 2008 to 2013 from various police contacts at stations in Bangkok, Chiang Mai and Songkhla. In Viet Nam, researchers were provided with case files selected by the district level police agency, procuracy and courts. While the research team visited some commune and ward police stations, systematic access to their records was not provided. To maintain consistency among both countries, researchers committed to analysing a minimum of 120 case files spread relatively evenly between two to three sites within each country. Data collection and entry was performed by designated researchers who were trained in quantitative research methods. Each case file was assigned a confidential tracking number to ensure anonymity and confidentiality was maintained. Throughout the study timeframe, researchers made continuous efforts to access prosecution and court records in Thailand, and local police records in Viet Nam, in attempts to randomize case selection. However, due to a number of challenges in this regard, full and equal data access could not be ensured within the project time frame. As a result, the quantitative component of this study does not allow for comparative analysis across both countries but, rather, serves to complement and triangulate the data obtained through the qualitative interviews and focus group discussions as well as the legal review. Researchers identified and interviewed key informants and facilitated focus group discussions with: senior representatives from relevant ministries and criminal justice agencies; criminal justice and health practitioners, and support service organizations. Efforts were made to ensure representation of both genders in interviews. However, as the criminal justice systems in both countries are male-dominated at all levels, this proved challenging. Survivor interviews were coordinated through reputable NGOs with the consent of the survivors, in Thailand. It was not possible to interview survivors in Viet Nam. Given the limited number of urban and rural sites selected in both countries for case review and qualitative research, study findings are not nationally representative and cannot be generalized to other regions in the countries without further research. Ethical Considerations The highest level of ethical standards was maintained throughout the study. Qualitative analysis included careful consideration of the risks and opportunities that research participants might experience by participating in this study, and established procedures that acknowledged and respected each research participant\u2019s identity, interests, confidentiality, and anonymity. Context and Background 25 Information collected, recorded, analysed and interpreted was carefully monitored for accuracy. All relevant laws and institutional policies were upheld, and information was gathered only with the express authorization of appropriate institutional representatives. All information gathered remains confidential. To protect victim information, each case reviewed was assigned a unique case file number, which remains on file only with the lead international researcher. National researchers participated in a workshop facilitated by the international research team that included a segment on research ethics and the guiding principles for this study. This session highlighted the importance and value of honesty, integrity, confidentiality and objectivity to the study.

National research teams included female and male researchers. Careful consideration was given to how the gender and identity of the researcher could affect the experiences of, and responses provided by, key informants, focus group participants, and survivors. Research challenges This section illustrates the challenges researchers faced in conducting planned research. The most significant challenges encountered were in accessing criminal justice case records and in linking police, prosecution and court records. Specific conclusions about when cases were discontinued, key decision makers in case conclusion, and the factors influencing these decisions could not be reached. Attrition rates calculated from the case review samples in each country provide a picture of attrition based only on the files reviewed, and are not reflective of the overall picture of attrition in each of the countries of study. Country specific research limitations included: General Thailand Viet Nam Study limited to specific urban areas. Findings cannot be generalized to other areas. Case sampling was opportunistic rather than random, based on availability and accessibility of case files. Varying record keeping practices of criminal justice agencies and information gaps in case files reviewed. Limited access to survivors. THE TRIAL OF RAPE: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam 26 Reservations in sharing official information by some Government officials posed barriers in interviewing key criminal justice agency actors. Political instability during time of study causing limited access to crim- inal justice agencies. File reviews were limited to police files. Availability of court files is in a brief summary form at the Court of First Instance level. Court cases cannot be traced back to the police level. The national partner was unable to obtain approval to have full access to all case files managed by the procuracy, which limited access to records to selected jurisdictions and sites. Case reviews are limited to district level police, prosecutor and court records. Researchers could not access local commune/ward police records for the case review component; however, local police officers were included in the qualitative interviews. Case files reviewed were pre-selected by criminal justice agencies, not by national researchers, resulting in questionable randomness and reliability. The national partner, a government ministry, could not interview victims. Additional researchers retained were also unable to organize interviews with victims. The national partner\u2019s qualitative research data was summarized and interpreted, not transcribed verbatim. Viet Nam As it is customary for judges not to grant interviews, participating judges limited their response to process issues. Thailand THE TRIAL OF RAPE: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam 28 \u00a9 UN Women/Panya Janjira The second part of the report focuses on the key trends and contributing factors identified in the study that can have a positive or a negative impact on attrition. Gaining an understanding of and comparing factors associated with attrition in Thailand and Viet Nam is complicated by specific contextual, societal, legal, procedural, and institutional factors that are often interrelated. For instance, the penal codes, procedural law, evidentiary rules, criminal justice institutions and practices in Thailand and Viet Nam cannot be simplistically compared, as each country has different legal systems, offence definitions, terminology variations, and procedures regarding how crimes are reported, recorded, investigated, prosecuted and adjudicated. Therefore, rather than listing specific causes of attrition, this section seeks to highlight common attrition factors, trends and patterns. A sound and comprehensive national legal and institutional framework that is enforced in a victim-centered and gender- sensitive manner is essential for enhancing a coordinated and integrated criminal justice system response to sexual violence. This section of the report conducts a comparative analysis of: \u00a8 How the social values, cultural patterns and practices shape the attitudes of criminal justice officials and the influence on attrition. A sound and comprehensive national legal and institutional framework that is enforced in a victim-centered and gender-sensitive manner is essential for enhancing a coordinated and integrated criminal justice system response to sexual violence.

The international norms and standards will be the basis for analysis as to how aspects of the legal and institutional frameworks either contribute to or reduce attrition. Unfortunately, many victims do not find the support necessary to see their cases through the criminal justice system. Nidd\u2019s account provides a snapshot into some of the common issues and contributing factors to rape and sexual assault case attrition. Sexual violence against women and girls are embedded in and supported by social values, cultural patterns and practices. The police, prosecutors and judges are not immune to such values and, as such, their attitudes can influence the way they apply the law in practice and their treatment of victims. International norms and standards calling for comprehensive national legal frameworks The updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures, Provision 14 (a) Member States are urged: (a) To review, evaluate and update their national laws\u2026. especially their crimi- nal laws, \u2026 to ensure and guarantee their value, comprehensiveness and effectiveness in eliminating all forms of violence against women and to remove provisions that allow for or condone violence against women or that increase the vulnerability or re-victimization of women who have been subject to violence. Commission on the Status of Women 57 Agreed Conclusions, call on States to: (c) adopt, as appropriate, review, and ensure the accelerated and effective implementation of laws and comprehensive measures that criminalize violence against women and girls and that provide multidisciplinary and gender-sensitive preventive and protection measures, such as emergency barring orders and protection orders, the investigation, submission for prosecution and appropriate punishment of perpetrators to end impunity, support serv- ices that empower victims and survivors, as well as access to appropriate civil remedies and redress. \u201cI was so embarrassed and scared. At the time, I also felt stupid for having trusted the person. I did not dare telling anyone. I only wanted to commit suicide.\u201d Study Findings: Understanding the Barriers to Justice and Attrition in Sexual Violence Cases 31 Nidd worked in a factory in Bangkok. She was raped by a co-worker who lured her into his room, pretending to be sick. She became pregnant after the rape incident. \u201cI was so embarrassed and scared. At the time, I also felt stupid for having trusted the person. I did not dare telling anyone. I only wanted to commit suicide.\u201d She learned about the Women and Men Progressive Foundation through her friend to whom she confided. She decided to seek help from the Foundation but was at first too shattered to want to go through the criminal justice system. However, after attending a series of support group and counselling sessions, Nidd decided to report to the police. \u201cI learned from other victims. Their experiences were worse than mine but they were so audacious to tell us their pain, to demonstrate how they were determined to fight, to go through the official process. So I told myself \u2018why don\u2019t you, Nidd?\u201d With the help of the Foundation, Nidd reported her case to the police. However, she suffered from inappropriate treatment by the police. \u201cThe first question that was put to me was \u2018why didn\u2019t you report earlier?\u2019 So I explained that I did not know how. I did not have legal knowledge. Then the other police officer asked me \u2018Why didn\u2019t you simply accept compensation from him (the offender)? You already have children, why you were asking for so many things?\u2019 I thought that was an insult. It was me who was raped and I had to be the one who understands and compromises?\u201d Nidd was interrogated four times by male inquiry officials. It took Nidd weeks to obtain a case number required for the compensation of victims according to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act (2001). She went to the police station more than 10 times for her case to be able to proceed. Throughout the process, Nidd lamented, the police tried to mediate and settle her case against her will.

They include the following, grouped as: \u00a8 Barriers to accessing justice. \u00a8 Attrition points within the criminal justice system. \u00a8 Contributing factors to attrition. The findings are listed below and will be elaborated within this section of the study. 1. Highlights of the study findings \u00a8 Discrimination and subordination of women \u00a8 Absent or limited monitoring systems to track state actions in response to reports \u00a8 Criminal justice service providers not held accountable for providing rights-based, victim-centered response and services \u00a8 Sexual violence against women is not a priority for action in the criminal justice system \u00a8 Reactive response to incidents rather than a strategic, comprehensive and holistic approach \u00a8 Lack of coordination within the justice system, and between the justice system, government and civil society service providers, results in limited, inconsistent service \u00a8 Gender biases and stereotyping amongst institutional service providers \u00a8 Focus on mediation or other forms of settlement outside of the criminal justice system \u00a8 Many women have limited knowledge and access to information about their rights and what they can and should expect from the criminal justice system Barriers to access to justice \u00a8 Initial contact stage: victims are turned away, deterred or discouraged at the initial reporting stage \u00a8 Reporting stage: victims are treated with disrespect and insensitivity; vic- tim is required to tell her story multiple times; reports are refused; reports are taken and investigation is not conducted or delayed; police encourage mediation and settlement; or the victim withdraws \u00a8 Investigation stage: no or inadequate investigation; limited access to or use of forensic evidence; lack of assistance, support or protection services; no or very limited communication between the criminal justice system service providers and the victim; investigators decide not to proceed; or the victim withdraws \u00a8 Pre-trial and trial stage: no or limited court support for the victim; long drawn-out proceedings; focus on physical or forensic evidence instead of victim\u2019s lack of consent; prosecutor or judge decides not to proceed; or the court acquits the accused Attrition points Study Findings: Understanding the Barriers to Justice and Attrition in Sexual Violence Cases 33 \u00a8 Societal/cultural: limited community support for victims, discriminatory gender- norms and stereotypes \u00a8 Legal: focus on the credibility of the victim rather than credibility of the incident; narrow interpretation of evidentiary rules; limited oversight and monitoring of enforcement/implementation of laws; or focus on mediation and settlement \u00a8 Process: lack of victim-centered procedures; lack of multi-disciplinary, coordinated responses; directives and decisions that reduce victim agency; victim inadequately prepared and fearful of giving testimony in court; delays; or expenses incurred by the victim \u00a8 Institutional: no women- or victim-friendly facilities; little specialized training and professional development; few female police and inves- tigating officers; limited information, assistance, support and commu- nication for victims navigating complex systems and processes; limited data collection and analysis to inform criminal justice system action; or limited internal accountability mechanisms Contributing factors Thailand Viet Nam \u00a8 Requirement to report within three months excludes many women. \u00a8 Limited investigation and over-emphasis on initial statement of victim taken by police as primary evidence used to convict or acquit by the courts. \u00a8 Although \u2018consent\u2019 is included in section 276 of the Criminal Code, the concept is not defined or clarified. \u00a8 Marital rape was only recently included in the Criminal Code with an ongoing cultural lag to recognize non-consensual intimate partner sex as rape. \u00a8 Formal denunciation required to proceed in court.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f13ea56-721e-49eb-b8b5-c73b05626fab": {"__data__": {"id_": "4f13ea56-721e-49eb-b8b5-c73b05626fab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Trial of Rape: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "57410cb2cd8833640d90c53e4b89cbcd28464dac37701d006cc113789132f1b4"}, "2": {"node_id": "ec46fa80-d517-4ea2-8e38-5284c26a1583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "259de62b381a1e30d5da120a1ef8a1d87c9106bd9470099ca2c8ac6d58538ed3"}}, "hash": "3f0a8436c079f26d119c1ff01d4d0cbd6e41c996cbd2e43b587dd0cd484ebf86", "text": "\u00a8 Formal denunciation required to proceed in court. \u00a8 Narrow definitions of rape and forced sexual intercourse, no offence covering sexual assault for women. \u00a8 Limited support to victims of non-partner sexual violence (the limited victim services are", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "af106794-64ba-4c2b-b9ef-45f3cdded9c3": {"__data__": {"id_": "af106794-64ba-4c2b-b9ef-45f3cdded9c3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Trial of Rape: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2b8152025a472ba32e469c5d21f30b935aebd98d7f79abaadede13a22d11b8a7"}}, "hash": "2b8152025a472ba32e469c5d21f30b935aebd98d7f79abaadede13a22d11b8a7", "text": "geared toward domestic violence victims). \u00a8 Focus on corroboration. Table 2. Factors that contribute to attrition and raise barriers for women to access justice 1.2 Country-specific findings There are a number of country-specific findings that are related to barriers to accessing justice, attrition points within the criminal justicesystem, and contributing factors to attrition. THE TRIAL OF RAPE: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam 34 In Thailand and Viet Nam, given that this is the first study focusing on attrition in sexual violence cases, it is difficult to comment on whether these findings are consistent with other national studies. However, research sponsored by UNODC in Viet Nam on the quality of criminal justice services available to victims of domestic violence found that most of the cases reported to police did not lead to a criminal charge against the suspect.96 The rates of attrition were the highest at the earlier stages of the criminal justice process, with 34 percent of the women interviewed reporting that they were told by local police to solve their problems within the family and that in only 12 percent of the cases were criminal charges instituted. Similar high attrition rates at the policing level are found in Thailand according to data provided by the Thai Royal Police and One Stop Crisis Centres (OSCC), where in 2013, there were 31,866 cases of rape reported to the OSCC and only 4,607 cases were reported to the police, with 1,295 of the latter resulting in issuing of an arrest warrant.97 1.3 Main findings from the case file reviews In both of the countries surveyed, quantitative data was collected from police and court files in order to complement the qualitative data on attrition presented by the informant interviews and focus group discussions with key stakeholders. There were 169 cases reviewed in Thailand, and 121 from Viet Nam, with a total regional case file review sample of 290. While the planned methodology was for randomized sampling and tracking for a quantitative retrospective case study, the reality was that the data was collected in an opportunistic manner, based on accessible information. Due to the concerns regarding the quality and variations in information available for analysis, the comparisons focus on victim and suspect demographics, and high- level summaries of the cases reviewed, for a descriptive purpose only. They are not meant to be nationally representative or to provide a comparative analysis of attrition rates between the two countries more broadly. 96.

Royal Thai Police 2014, One Stop Crisis Center (OSCC) 2014. 98. It should be noted that while the original quantitative methodology was to involve a random selection of 120 cases of sexual violence against women and children (both girls and boys) in Viet Nam, with the self-selection of cases by criminal justice agencies, the focus became exclusively on selecting cases involving female victims. Study Findings: Understanding the Barriers to Justice and Attrition in Sexual Violence Cases 35 Main findings. In both countries: \u00a8 The majority were female victims. \u00a8 Over 60 percent of the victims were under the age of 18. \u00a8 The highest percentage of victims was split almost evenly between those 13 and 17 years of age and victims over 18 years of age. Cases where the victim was over the age of forty were minimal. \u00a8 Nearly all of the victims were younger than the suspect. \u00a8 Only a very minimal number of case files indicated that victims had disabilities or had ingested alcohol or drugs. There were a significant number of case files that did not include any information on disabilities, or on alcohol/drug ingestion. Of the 169 cases reviewed, 166 involved female victims and 3 involved male victims. The average age was 22, while the median age was 17 (minors). Just over half of cases were of minors. A total of 66.3 percent were single and 51.5 percent were students. Victims were on average seven years younger than the suspect. In 1.7 percent of the cases, victims had some form of disability. A total of 21 percent reported ingestion of alcohol (with 8 percent reporting involuntary or mistaken ingestion) and 4 percent of cases reported ingestion of drugs. All the victims in the case review where gender was recorded were female.98 The over- whelming majority of female victims were girls under the age of 18 years (74 percent). The majority of victims were single, and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8d92294a-d17e-4003-b131-efffcd6707c2": {"__data__": {"id_": "8d92294a-d17e-4003-b131-efffcd6707c2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Trial of Rape: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dc65a7bbda8d218f43e7f563939317b554323eee4cc2871afe0f4ff8ad27006e"}}, "hash": "dc65a7bbda8d218f43e7f563939317b554323eee4cc2871afe0f4ff8ad27006e", "text": "at school or unemployed. This is similar to the breakdown in the national statistics from both police and court records. Victims were on average 10 years younger than the suspect. A total of 6 percent reported ingestion of alcohol, and less than 1 percent reported ingestion of drugs (which was recorded as involuntary/mistaken ingestion) Victim profile Thailand Viet Nam Main findings. In both countries: \u00a8 The majority of suspects were male. \u00a8 Most suspects were between the ages of 18 to 30, with very few suspects over the age of 40. \u00a8 A minimal number of cases involved suspects with disabilities. There were a significant number of cases that did not include suspect details. \u00a8 Recorded ingestion of alcohol by suspects was considerably higher than for victims in Viet Nam and Thailand, however, a significant number of cases provided no information on alcohol or drug use by the suspect. Almost all (98 percent) suspects were male (one suspect was female and one was transgendered) averaging 27 years of age with 79 percent over the age of 18. A total of 38 percent of suspects over 18, and 27 percent of suspects under 18 had some record of previous allegation of violence. Voluntary alcohol use was 42 percent for suspects compared to 13 percent for victims. Drug use was noted in a significantly higher propor- tion of suspects than in victims - 11 percent for suspects compared to 4 percent of victims. All suspects were male. Of the 73 percent of cases where age was recorded, 21 percent involved suspects under 18 years of age and 79 percent over 18 years old. Nearly half of all cases where age was recorded involved suspects between the ages of 18 to 25 years old. A total of 60 percent of suspects were single, 37 percent were unemployed and 25 percent had a previous criminal conviction. Alcohol use was indicated in 26 percent of the suspects, compared to 5 percent of the victims. There were no reports of drug ingestion.

Table 3. Good and promising practices 1.4 Country-specific good practice Good and promising practices to strengthen the criminal justice sector response to sexual violence were found in both countries. While implementation of promising policies and programmes often remains challenging, largely due to financial or human resource constraints, they do offer positive signs that attempts to improve practice are under way. Below is a list of some examples of country- specific good practice that could be further supported, scaled up, or considered for adaptation in other contexts: Main findings. In both countries: \u00a8 Between 86 percent and 91 percent of the suspects were known to the victim. \u00a8 Between 9 percent and 14 percent of cases involved complete strangers. \u00a8 The most common assault location is in a private space \u2013 most frequently the home of the victim and/or suspect, followed by another person\u2019s home or a hotel room. \u00a8 In the majority of cases, records indicated that the victim did not sustain physical injuries. \u00a8 The use of force was either not recorded, or there was no use of force indicated in at least three quarters of cases. \u00a8 Weapon use was indicated in only a very small percentage of all cases reviewed. A total of 66 percent of cases were rape cases, with 12 percent involving children who could not consent. In 32 percent of cases the suspect was an acquaintance, in 26 percent the suspect was a current or former intimate partner, and in 14 percent the suspect was a neighbour. Over half of victims who were between 13 and 17 years old reported that the suspect was a current or former partner. The majority of cases (95 percent) involved a single suspect.

A total of 68 percent of victims had no visible injuries, however adult victims were more likely to have visible injuries. Rape cases constituted 75 percent of those examined and 15 percent were sexual assaults or other types of sexual violence. The majority of cases involved sexual violence against girls: 65 percent of cases were statutory rape, rape of a child/minor, or forced sex of child/minor, and 6 percent sexual assault of children. The suspect was known to the victim in 86 percent of the cases, with the highest percentage of cases involving neighbours (25 percent) or acquaintances (14 percent). In only 14 percent of the cases was the suspect a complete stranger. There were no recorded cases of marital rape. The majority of sexual offences took place in private or semi-private space. Only 2 percent of cases involved a weapon, however physical injuries were documented in 24 percent of the cases and 6 percent of the cases involved gang rapes. Incident Profile Viet Nam Thailand Study Findings: Understanding the Barriers to Justice and Attrition in Sexual Violence Cases 37 The new Gender Equality Law (GEL) was officially announced on 8 March 2015, which guarantees individuals against direct and indirect discrimination on the basis of sex or sexuality. The law stipulates that policies, rules, regulations, orders, measures, projects or practices of public, private organizations or individuals that are gender discriminatory are not allowed, except for the purpose of eliminating barriers for equal enjoyment of rights and liberties, religious principles and national security. The GEL also establishes a Committee for the Promotion of Gender Equality, which is mandated to improve social and cultural patterns of behaviors in order to eliminate discriminatory gender biases and practices, as well as gender-based violence, with an aim to eliminate barriers to different rights. The Royal Thai Police, in partnership with UN Women, the Department of Women\u2019s Affairs and Family Development, and Friends of Women Foundation, has also been expanding the training of police inquiry officers on the protection of women victims of violence, domestic violence and trafficking to include 900 core police inquiry officers in all regions of Thailand. Based on the lessons learnt from these and previous trainings in recent years, special training modules are being developed to be institutionalized in the Royal Thai Police. As a direct result of this study, the Thailand Institute of Justice has allocated additional funding to expand the research and develop a toolbox and public campaign to inform both victims and duty bearers of their rights and obligations, as well as relevant laws and where support could be sought in the criminal justice system and national and local support services. Thailand 99. Under the purview of the Thailand Ministry of Social Development and Human Security, and collaborating with the Ministry of Health, the Royal Thai Police and the Ministry of Labour, an OSCC is an integrated system of government departments working together on sexual violence, teenage pregnancy, human trafficking and child labour. Concurrently, under the Ministry of Health, hospital-based OSCCs provided medical support and treatment, counselling, psychological treatment and rehabilitation, and played a role in training medical staff to understand rape issues from an integrated perspective. Currently there are hospital-based OSCCs nationwide. 100. According to UN Women, \u201cIn 2009 UN Women partnered with the National Human Rights Commission to establish gender-sensitive procedures for the effective implementation of Thailand\u2019s domestic violence legislation in the Thonburi Criminal Court\u2026[Thonburi court], a model Courtroom and waiting room, were designed to create a safe space that respected the privacy and reduce the trauma for women survivors of domestic violence.

Some of the key changes from current legislation being discussed include expanding the definition of rape/ forced sex and abolishing the element \u2018against the will of victim\u2019, explicitly criminalizing marital rape, and introducing a new offence of sexual assault. Gender-responsive criminal procedures also in debate including the possibility of a new chapter on protective measures for victims that would provide additional ground for allowing temporary detention of suspects who continue to use or threaten to use violence and letting victims provide testimony through CCTV rather than appearing in person during the trial, as well as expanded provisions on legal aid to VAW victims. Additional references have also been made to the need to protect the identity of victims in criminal proceedings, including amended evidentiary rules to keep victims\u2019 testimony confidential, and allowing judges to stop questioning that may affect victims\u2019 dignity or privacy. Current provisions which place de facto onus on victims to report cases and allow cases to be withdrawn upon victims\u2019 request are now being reconsidered. In Viet Nam, the government is also in the process of developing a new National Thematic Project (NTP) on GBV prevention and control which would address other forms of GBV beyond domestic violence. The NTP is currently in the process of being drafted and is expected to be submitted to the Prime Minister for approval by September 2015. The study finds indications that gender stereotypes regarding the status of women and girls, as well as myths and misconceptions about sexual violence, exist in both countries. These societal beliefs can be reflected in the communities as a whole, by criminal justice practitioners, and, at times, by the survivors of sexual violence themselves. Although this study focuses predominately on attrition on a woman\u2019s journey through the criminal justice system, it would be incomplete without acknowledgment of the significant number of women and girls who experience sexual violence and cannot report or choose not to report (or, in the case of girls, whose families choose not to report), and those who are thwarted in their attempts to do so. 2.1 Cultural context and impact on access to justice Traditional views of the role of women and girls in society The understanding of sexual violence, particularly surrounding the issue of consent, can be influenced by the cultural construction of femininity. In Viet Nam, the Taoist ideology of yin and yang suggests that women have a low sex drive, are sexually inferior to men and do not have their own sexual agency. In another study, a researcher noticed that \u201cyoung married men, whose wives had taken up residence with them, spoke happily of having a sexual outlet\u2026. I heard young married men excitedly tell how they had woken up in the night or early morning 2.

These roles and feelings toward women are the internal factors causing problems for women and violence in the family, especially with the present social problem of family institutions being smaller and more emotionally distant. The trend of the single-family units is increasing, caused by family members moving into the workforce, divorces, abandonment by the husband or male figure, and pregnancy causing women to be the caretakers of the family. Most of the people in the family are children and women, so they tend to be physically, mentally, sexually abused, molested, treated obscenely or even raped.\u201d103 Family honour and social stigma The process of reporting sexual violence is inextricably bound up with the ideas of family honour, kinship, and social belonging. In Thailand, for example, the family plays a critical role in supporting or discouraging a victim in her decision to report her case and proceed through the criminal justice process. As noted by a female inquiry officer from Songkhla province, Thailand: \u201cWe need to educate and empower families that their daughters could be victims of rape and it is not their fault \u2013 either of the family or of the victim\u2026and they need to report and take things forward to get justice, as a kind of honour for the family. But the reality is that families are too ashamed; they don\u2019t want the story to be known. \u2018Saving face\u2019 is more important than justice.\u201d In Viet Nam, earlier research shows that the decision to pursue a case through the criminal justice process constitutes an attempt to defend the honour of the family and that of the larger kin network.104 Where it is perceived that there is no honour to be defended or concern for stigma and shame against the family, then the victim will not receive support from family or kin network. A female academic commented \u201cThere is a concept of women\u2019s sexuality as a usable object that accrues or loses value depending on how it is used.\u201d This may explain why a high number of cases that are reported and processed through the criminal justice system involve girls under 16 years old. The study case review found 72 percent of the cases reviewed involved girls under the age of 16 years old. National statistics from both the police and courts show a similar breakdown between child rape and rape.

UN Women (2016) Gender Sterotypes in Laws and Court Decisions in Southeast Asia. Bangkok. The practice of informal negotiations and the impact on attrition The study found that the issue of family honour plays a prominent role in the disposition of rape cases through informal negotiations that take place outside the criminal justice system. The private settling of cases was an issue raised in both countries. It was common to hear of private settling of the cases by families of the victim and families of the perpetrator, without the participation of the authorities. However it was not unusual for the criminal justice authorities, at each stage, to encourage the victim to try to settle the matter. In Thailand, although police receive no formal mediation and settlement training, interviews revealed that police often took on this role and encouraged mediation, whether before a victim filed her case or after. The procedures on how cases are settled remain vague and inconsistent. Findings in Viet Nam suggest that police often encouraged the family of victims to negotiate rather than to proceed through criminal courts. One Vietnamese judge interviewed described a case where he adjourned the trial to allow for informal mediation between the two \u2018parties\u2019. According to a female social worker, many police officers interviewed recalled that in cases involving a girl where she appeared unhurt (for example her hymen remained intact and there was no serious bodily injury), the officers would tell the victim\u2019s family \u201cShe is okay now so it\u2019s better to protect her honor. If this becomes known when she grows up she will have difficulty finding a husband.\u201d The delay by the authorities in bringing a charge against the suspect serves as a signal to the victim and/or her family that the incident should be best dealt with informally between the parties concerned. The findings from Viet Nam also noted that some police participants complained that due to the practice of negotiations, reporting would be", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "66be9794-1dc0-4b81-a4dd-c0e26ad85774": {"__data__": {"id_": "66be9794-1dc0-4b81-a4dd-c0e26ad85774", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Trial of Rape: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6998fb7f901a3fcbf78a23a564aa386010a5b10f724238a713c06e6f3dae11cc"}, "3": {"node_id": "b60bb401-7aba-491c-b22d-5a7730dcc516", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fa2d5301093e6dc88dad549a9bad3b6c464cc437e732a665dc16001e1a823cf5"}}, "hash": "3b4285dc809cc387009e9951c5c765a8eac443ea6fd1e61e4362650ae7caf664", "text": "delayed, and in their opinion meant that physical evidence of sexual violence would be compromised and they would often not proceed due to the \u2018weak\u2019 case.

This research identified a multitude of reports that a number of criminal justice service providers are influenced by the socio-cultural norms and gender biases, myths and stereotypes which exist in both countries. These findings echo similar conclusions made by other studies that explore how such myths influence women and girls\u2019 access to justice and attrition of sexual violence cases.106 Study Findings: Understanding the Barriers to Justice and Attrition in Sexual Violence Cases 41 107.

In Thailand, the largest percentage of cases involved current or former intimate partners (26 percent). In Viet Nam, the highest percentage of cases involved neighbours (25 percent) or acquaintances (14 percent). In Thailand, only 9 percent of cases involved complete strangers, while In Viet Nam it was 14 percent. It is noteworthy that only 5 percent of cases reviewed in Viet Nam did not have any information regarding relationships between the victim and the suspect. 110. The next most common locations were outdoor public places, followed by semi-public places, such as workplaces, schools, hospitals and other institutional settings. 111. Weapon use is correlated with injury in a small percentage of cases overall. In Viet Nam, out of the 28 percent of cases that had documented injuries, weapon use was reported in less than 6 percent of those cases. In Thailand 30 percent of cases with injuries involved the use of a weapon. 112. Kelly, L. (2002) A Research Review on Reporting, Investigation and Prosecution of Rape Cases. London: HMCPSI. 113.

THE TRIAL OF RAPE: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam 42 Myth 115. Rape culture costs Thailand oh so dearly (09/01/2013) Sanitsuda Ekachai is Editorial Pages Editor, Bangkok Post 116. Story of a Thai survivor as recounted during a qualitative interview. Rape and sexual violence is only a problem when it happens to \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018innocent\u2019 women and girls. The study findings demonstrate that these beliefs are held by a number of criminal justice providers in all three countries. \u00a8 \u201cRaping a virgin is worse than raping a non-virgin\u201d according to a male police officer in Viet Nam. \u201cThis reflects the belief that once having been \u2018used\u2019, a female\u2019s sexual worth could not be much worse off by additional \u2018usage\u2019.\u201d (female academic, Viet Nam) \u00a8 \u201cWhen women are sexually attacked, they get blamed for \u2018asking for it\u2019, for being in the wrong place at the wrong time when they should have stayed home as \u2018good girls\u2019 do. Their dress and life history are scrutinized to judge their characters to see if they are \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019 girls. If they have the courage to fight the social stigma as \u2018tainted women\u2019, and \u2018broken goods\u2019 to seek justice, they first get grilled by rude questioning in public by the police, then by lawyers in court who often resort to digging into the victims\u2019 life stories to show they are morally loose women capable of blackmailing their clients.\u201d115 \u00a8 The Thai case of Nidd (page 31), who was asked by police, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you simply accept compensation from him (the offender)? You already have children, why you were asking for so many things?\u201d116 \u00a8 The findings from the case review in both countries show high numbers of girl victims as compared to adult women. In Viet Nam, the case review found 72 percent of the cases reported and processed through the criminal justice system involved victims under 16 years of age. One academic suggested that this could be indicative of a culture that views proceeding through the criminal justice system as a way to protect vulnerable children, while adult women are considered much less vulnerable. Alternatively, it is consistent with the belief expressed by numerous interviewees that only certain girls get raped, or that \u2018good girls\u2019 cannot be raped. \u00a8 \u201cRape is something that only happens to \u2018low class\u2019 people, uneducated or migrants.\u201d (female justice official, Viet Nam) Study Findings: Understanding the Barriers to Justice and Attrition in Sexual Violence Cases 43 \u201cAt the time of reporting sometimes it is difficult to tell a \u2018ca ve\u2019 (female sex worker) from a good woman. The investigator has to observe closely the person who reports the incident. In the case of a good woman, the person who reports the crime generally seems confused and rather timid during the process. If by looking at the way a subject dresses herself you can make a guess at her profession. If her attitude when answering questions about sexual matters are quite open by the way she speaks, then you have to reconsider the case. Because while cases reported by a \u2018ca ve\u2019 can be rape, it is possible that her accusation is at variance with what actually happened.\u201d Male police investigator, Viet Nam The archetype of the \u2018ideal\u2019 sexual assault victim functions to disqualify many complainants\u2019 accounts of their sexual violence experiences.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3e0cb6e-1da0-4757-8553-ec8c2388a1e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3e0cb6e-1da0-4757-8553-ec8c2388a1e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Trial of Rape: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "897781370ea06c39f01266da681fc22ee10c395a7539467d2b34abe21c97c25e"}, "2": {"node_id": "2e6b3e0c-3a85-46af-81b0-ee8526ca16c6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ffe49505dbeb48aac5c607e50a128e65dddb38a743d69f4c80fc628310cecc00"}}, "hash": "96b65bda03968896464a2441c47e0ddc9ed93c0262cf39d77f01010d4427a596", "text": "\u2018Bad victims\u2019 \u2013 those women whose lives, backgrounds, and characteristics depart from the narrow confines of \u2018ideal victims\u2019 in sexual assault cases \u2013 are the women whose accounts are subject to the most scrutiny, whose credibility is most attacked, and who are seen to be less deserving of the law\u2019s protection.117 Applying these biases to sexual violence victim interviews and investigations can lead to the exclusion of many women from participation in the criminal justice process, including: mature women working as domestic workers who are sexually violated by their bosses; women with physical or mental health disabilities; women who are educated and \u2018should know better\u2019; sex workers; women who speak openly about sexual matters; or women who are lesbians.118 The myth of what constitutes a \u2018real\u2019 or \u2018ideal\u2019 victim serves to reinforce attitudes", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a7964035-2225-4a5f-8e7e-59d0d4884b85": {"__data__": {"id_": "a7964035-2225-4a5f-8e7e-59d0d4884b85", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Trial of Rape: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "765bfb7168798951b8294eca3747ee3ce69cab911a6704e21cc0b8a8bbfb6c3b"}, "3": {"node_id": "9b02ea56-27df-4fb6-a3ed-e85529adc7eb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "00a8aab0831cf26b1810cbf9ee601c717c709dbdf9718944300bff4fb4299585"}}, "hash": "c33caae87ac19acc0d0e571548516a7a7450c5a3a4a6f3b3232d30b1510b258b", "text": "by criminal justice practitioners of how the \u2018ideal\u2019 victim should behave.

THE TRIAL OF RAPE: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam 44 This myth regards victims of sexual violence as \u2018asking for it\u2019 (i.e. sexy clothes incite men to sexual violence), \u2018wanting it\u2019, or putting themselves in dangerous situations (i.e. sex work or being intoxicated). In both countries, the study found that women were often blamed for the sexual violence they had suffered for reasons ranging from being a sex worker, to dressing provocatively, going out in the evening with a man, or even being alone on a bus at night. \u00a8 \u201cI know I may not look so decent, as good Thai girls of my age are supposed to look. I wore red lipstick and had this \u2018rang\u2019 (wild) persona. People think I was a \u2018rang\u2019 girl. But it did not mean I deserved to be raped. I did not ask those men to rape me. I begged them not to.\u201d (female rape survivor, Thailand) \u00a8 \u201cI used to blame myself for what had happened to me. I partied a lot at night, I trusted people too easily. I wore revealing dresses. What could I say to defend myself? I was raped. It was partly my fault.\u201d (female rape survivor, Thailand) \u00a8 \u201cCases involving female sex workers most often happen like this. First both parties agree to the deal, but later the client demands more, even causes pain and injury to the woman, or lets more people join in, like in a \u2018gang bang\u2019, without extra payment: that\u2019s why the woman reports to the police. It\u2019s revenge, because the client does not stick to the deal.\u201d (male criminal investigator, Viet Nam providing an explanation for why a sex worker could not be viewed as an innocent victim). \u00a8 \u201cYou were raped because of the way you dressed yourself, if not by this offender shall you be abused by another.\u201d (female social worker reporting a statement from a police officer handling a case of a rape victim who was 12 years of age, Viet Nam) \u00a8 \u201cA girl who is drunk or showing a lot of cleavage might be the cause of the offence.\u201d (male prosecutor, Viet Nam) Myth Some women deserve to be raped and sexually assaulted; it is their own fault. Such myths influence the attitudes of the criminal justice practitioners in their assessment of the victim\u2019s credibility. How justice service providers view and treat a victim will impact a victim\u2019s cooperation and the case as it progresses through the system. Study Findings: Understanding the Barriers to Justice and Attrition in Sexual Violence Cases 45 The study found this myth replicated in various beliefs, articulated by a number of criminal justice providers interviewed: \u00a8 \u201cThere is a prevailing suggestion that acts of sexual violence are more prone to occur in locations considered to be fraught with \u2018complexities\u2019 where residents are from different social backgrounds, or for example, there are significant numbers of migrant workers and ethnic minority populations.\u201d (justice official, Viet Nam) \u00a8 \u201cIt is commonly believed that men who live in happy, peaceful places or those with high education would not commit such \u2018unreasonable\u2019 acts like rape.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9b02ea56-27df-4fb6-a3ed-e85529adc7eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "9b02ea56-27df-4fb6-a3ed-e85529adc7eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Trial of Rape: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "765bfb7168798951b8294eca3747ee3ce69cab911a6704e21cc0b8a8bbfb6c3b"}, "2": {"node_id": "a7964035-2225-4a5f-8e7e-59d0d4884b85", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c33caae87ac19acc0d0e571548516a7a7450c5a3a4a6f3b3232d30b1510b258b"}}, "hash": "00a8aab0831cf26b1810cbf9ee601c717c709dbdf9718944300bff4fb4299585", "text": "This portrait reinforces the assumption that rape and other sex offences are prevalent among the poor and less educated and permits \u2018normal\u2019 people to safely distance themselves from these \u2018bad\u2019 events.\u201d (female academic, Viet Nam) \u00a8 \u201cWe see many cases where girls fall in love and have sex with (boys/men).

Moreover, other research has found that there is a predominant belief that if women do not satisfy their husbands, the latter could seek out sex workers.120 \u201cThe police and Women\u2019s Union do not believe rape can happen in marriage, so they try to solve these problems through reconciliation.\u201d (female academic, Viet Nam) Myth Husbands cannot rape or sexually assault their wives 119.

This myth follows the famous statement made by Sir Mathew Hale in the 18th century that rape is an \u201caccusation easily to be made and hard to be proved and harder to be defended by the party accused, tho never so innocent.\u201d121 \u00a8 A number of Vietnamese police officers interviewed were of the opinion that any reported rape from a \u2018ca ve\u2019 (sex worker) was false as they were likely trying to extort more money from their clients. From the case review, there were no recorded denunciations of such cases. Myth Women seeking to avenge slights or to extort money often fabricate sexual violence charges Police often have specific ideas about how a rape victim should behave, and if the alleged victim does not conform in the expected manner, they are less likely to proceed with the case on the grounds that there was no credible evidence.122 Many police officers interviewed expressed suspicion about delayed reports. \u00a8 Findings from Viet Nam reflect how the police view the fault of the victims for failing to report or for reporting the crime too late, where there will be no evidence. \u00a8 \u201cActs of rape generally take place at places like hotels, guesthouses, deserted places\u2026 between two persons. Therefore it\u2019s hard to find evidences. They are often not reported immediately, but only after one or two days, a week or even a month after the incident, therefore it\u2019s hard to collect physical evidence such as sperm, condoms, skin scratches, etc. Even victims often find these acts so horrible and that they wash themselves immediately after it happens. It\u2019s easier (to find physical evidences) with cases involving young girls or women who have sexual experience for the first time (virgins) by examination and assessment. With married women it is more challenging to find and prove the necessary evidences.\u201d (male criminal investigator, Viet Nam) \u00a8 Findings in Thailand reveal that often victims who are minors took a long time to tell their families about the incident and reporting to the police was further delayed by families due to the sensitivity of the issue and the psychological fragility of young victims.123 Myth A victim will report everything at the first available opportunity Study Findings: Understanding the Barriers to Justice and Attrition in Sexual Violence Cases 47 124. In Thailand, sexual offences fall into the category of general criminal offences as opposed to petty offences. In Viet Nam, rape falls under the category of serious crime and can be considered very serious crime if aggravating factors are present. 125.

Legal factors relating to the definition of crimes and the influence on attrition In 2007, Thailand passed the Domestic Violence Victim Protection Act which views domestic violence as unique since it happens among family members and close relatives. In both Thailand and Viet Nam, rape is recognized as a crime.124 However, the countries differ widely as to the definition of the elements of rape. The countries also vary considerably as to what other sexual offences are included in their Penal Codes and how sexual violence is dealt with in other laws, such as domestic violence or administrative sanctions. 3.1 Elements of sexual offences: country summaries The Thailand Criminal Code, as amended by Criminal Code Amendment Act 2007 The two main Thai offences dealing with sexual violence discussed in this report are rape and indecent assault. Thailand amended the offences relating to sexuality in 2007 to expand the definition of rape (s. 276) to include both females and males as victims and offenders, all types of penetration, and criminalization of marital rape. Children not yet over 15 years of age are deemed legally incapable of consenting to sexual intercourse or to any indecent act. The Court may inflict lesser punishment to offenders who are minors.125 The offender is prohibited from claiming that he/she does not realize the child victim is not yet over 13 years of age.126 In 2007, Thailand passed the Domestic Violence Victim Protection Act which views domestic violence as unique since it happens among family members and close relatives. The Act provides for different approaches, methods and procedures to the existing criminal justice approach, emphasizing rehabilitation of the offender over penalization, protection of the victim and restoring good family relationships. The Act defines domestic violence as physical and mental abuse and does not explicitly include sexual abuse.127 THE TRIAL OF RAPE: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam 48 Elements of Crime The Viet Nam 1999 Penal Code In Viet Nam, for adult women and girls aged 16 years and older who have experienced different forms of sexual violence, only rape and forcible sexual intercourse are currently codified as crimes (articles 111 and 113). The type of conduct and circumstances criminalized as forcible sexual intercourse would fall under a broad definition of rape in many countries. For girls who are under 16 years of age, in addition to rape and forcible sexual intercourse, indecent acts (coerced sexual acts) are included as crimes under the offence of child molestation.128 For women and girls aged 16 years and older who experience non-penetrative sexual violence, such violence would be considered a physical assault under article 104 of the Penal Code if there was an infirmity rate, or degree of injury that has been Thailand Elements of rape (s. 276) \u00a8 Sexual intercourse.

Study Findings: Understanding the Barriers to Justice and Attrition in Sexual Violence Cases 49 129. According to Inter-Circular 12/1995, issued by the Ministry of Health and MOLISA, permanent injury to \u2018sexual organs\u2019 has a basic infirmity rate of 21-25 percent for females less than 45 years old, which includes injuries resulting in scars to the vagina or vulva or which cause the woman to have difficulty in having sexual intercourse. For older females, the same injuries would result in an infirmity rate of 10-15 percent. For women who are below 44 years old and who have injuries such as cutting both ovaries and they have not born a child would result in an infirmity rate of 51-55 percent. 130. Section 277, the Thai Criminal Code prescribes the statutory rape provision of children over 13 years of age but not yet over 15 years of age while the offender is not yet of 18 years of age, irrespective of consent of such child victim, and if the Court has granted permission to both children to marry and the Court may also inflict lesser punishment to the juvenile offender. Furthermore, Section 276 para.4 where the spouse rapes his wife while the victim still intends to live together as a married couple, the court can inflict less punishment. assessed by a medical officer, over 11 percent, according to a Government circular, or if committed in aggravating circumstances which are set out in 104(1) (a-k).129 In Viet Nam, there are two crimes that can be classified as \u2018statutory rape\u2019 (meaning that sexual intercourse with a person below a statutory designated age is a crime): firstly, sexual intercourse with a girl under 13 years of age by anyone is a crime pursuant to article 112(4); and secondly, sexual intercourse by an adult with a child aged over 13 years of age and under 16 years is a crime pursuant to article 115. The Penal Code also criminalizes \u2018attempts\u2019 of these offences. In 2007, Viet Nam passed the Law on Domestic Violence Prevention and Control, which includes \u2018forced sex\u2019 as an act of domestic violence (article 2(1)(e)). This law does not establish new criminal offences, rather, it sets up the kinds of prohibited acts and competent agencies responsible for the management of activities related to prevention and combating violations. The legal source for handling and sanctioning such cases is a Government Decree relating to the law. The initial Decree 110 dealt with forced sex in the family, by the administrative sanction regime and involved fines. However, the recently passed Decree 167 does not include a reference to forced sex. The legal implications for administratively punishing perpetrators of forced sex in the family remain unclear. 3.2 A comparative analysis of sexual offences Tables 4 and 5 below compare aspects of the criminal substantive law relating to rape and other sexual offences for both women and girls. For the purposes of this comparison, the definition of adult follows the legal provisions in both countries, (16 years and over).130 However, both are States Parties to the Convention of the Rights of the Child, which provide specific protection for children under the age of 18 years. Currently, in Thailand and Viet Nam, sexual violence victims who are 16 years and older and not yet 18 years old are treated as adult victims, which has consequences for the range of punishment available, as well as specific support services available to child victims. They lack the special protection and gender- and age-sensitive criminal justice responses essential to address their special needs and vulnerabilities, and that are required by international law. The classification of the offences of rape and sexual assault can have implications for how these cases are handled pursuant to the criminal procedural laws (discussed in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "47f94f6b-41de-4511-ba81-0154e8a5f35f": {"__data__": {"id_": "47f94f6b-41de-4511-ba81-0154e8a5f35f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Trial of Rape: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "03bfdd7d511f9734e6c5d20f34e3bd854d133404d8497f6dd8debfa9117f50f2"}}, "hash": "03bfdd7d511f9734e6c5d20f34e3bd854d133404d8497f6dd8debfa9117f50f2", "text": "the following section), as well as reflecting how seriously society views the criminal conduct. In Thailand, sexual offences are treated as criminal, as opposed to petty or minor offences. Rape of \u2018adult\u2019 females is regarded as compoundable crimes. In other words, these offences are regarded as private wrongs and seen as less harmful to the public, as opposed to non-compoundable offences, or so-called offences against the state. Rape and sexual assault against children in Thailand are classified as non-compoundable crimes. In Viet Nam, the classification of rape and sexual assault can range from less serious crimes, serious, very serious to particularly serious crimes, largely depending on the injury level of the victim or aggravating factors.

THE TRIAL OF RAPE: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam 52 3.3 Legal factors influencing attrition Prohibited acts The way rape and sexual offences are defined in national criminal law or covered in other legal frameworks, such as administrative laws or domestic violence laws, is a starting point in identifying factors related to attrition in sexual violence cases. The legal definitions can have a direct impact on how reported cases of sexual violence are responded to and handled by the criminal justice system, in terms of investigation, prosecution and adjudication. How these crimes are defined also sends a message to the community on what is seen as acceptable and unacceptable behaviour and can in turn impact on the level of engagement and cooperation by the victims with the criminal justice system. In Viet Nam, a woman or girl who is 16 years or older and is a victim of a wide range of sexual violence acts, including anal rape, rape with an object or by any other part of the body, sexual assault, and unwanted sexual touching, will not be received as a", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "550bd14b-b47e-4f27-9540-2f65d1cdd35f": {"__data__": {"id_": "550bd14b-b47e-4f27-9540-2f65d1cdd35f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Trial of Rape: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7c68396bfef8ca627c58df608c9819d9f15c4581fad2a5a51130e8b8157a728d"}}, "hash": "7c68396bfef8ca627c58df608c9819d9f15c4581fad2a5a51130e8b8157a728d", "text": "victim of sexual violence crime by the criminal justice actors. Findings from Viet Nam noted cases of sexual violence using \u2018artificial\u2019 objects inserted into a woman\u2019s vagina, such as toothpaste tubes, chopsticks or a spoon handle that were not considered as rape or forced sex. These victims would only be able to proceed with a criminal case of physical assault under article 104 of the Penal Code if they suffered an injury that had been assessed by a medical officer to have an infirmity rate of 11 percent or over. However, if such acts are committed against girls under 16 years of age, they may be able to proceed with a charge of child molestation. In Viet Nam, the majority of criminal justice officials interviewed noted their reliance on the examination of the vagina and detection of sperm, and the challenges in cases involving sexually mature female victims and victims who delay in reporting, or contaminated the forensic evidence by washing after being raped. The study also found that while in theory the Vietnamese Penal Code covers attempted rape, some police officers were of the view that proof of penetration was necessary in order to proceed with a criminal investigation. As one investigator stated: \u201cTake the following case: a man rushed into the house of a girl when she was alone. He took a pair of scissors lying on the table, threatened her with them, then began to tear off her clothes. In the ensuing struggle she managed to free herself and ran out into the street, shouting for help. So how do we treat the case, shall we consider it as rape? The suspect will argue: \u2018This girl insulted me, I did it to scare her off so she won\u2019t do it again. I didn\u2019t rape her, no way\u2019.\u201d (male investigator, Viet Nam) Narrow definitions or interpretations of the prohibited acts which do not fully capture experiences of rape and sexual assault allow for the possibility that many victims of sexual violence cannot go forward with their cases because their experience may not fit into the legal definitions. Narrow definitions reveal traditional legal thinking about the nature of rape, considering penile penetration of the vagina having the potential to cause greater physical and psychological suffering than other forms of bodily penetration. Attrition alert Narrow definitions or interpretation may translate into high thresholds of evidentiary standards. Attrition alert Study Findings: Understanding the Barriers to Justice and Attrition in Sexual Violence Cases 53 In both Thailand and Viet Nam, the range of indecent acts is not defined by the law; however, guidance has been given by each Supreme Court. The Thai Supreme Court lists \u201cunwanted kissing, caressing, hugging, touching which is considered improper and embarrasses the other person publicly.\u201d The Vietnamese Supreme Court lists \u201cusing hands to touch or stimulate victim\u2019s genitals or applying the penis to other parts of the victims (mouth, chest, anus), or using the penis to rub against the victim\u2019s genitals without the intention to penetrate vagina or forcing victim to touch, massage, kiss offender\u2019s body or genitals.\u201d Both interpretations have serious limitations, with Thailand requiring public embarrassment and Viet Nam focusing on the involvement of the victim\u2019s or offender\u2019s genitals in the sexual touching. Guidance from international norms and standards. The updated UN Model Strategies and Practical Measures calls on all Member States to ensure that all forms of violence against women are criminalized and prohibited (Provision 14(b)). While there is no internationally agreed definition on the range of acts to be included when defining rape and sexual assault, guidance can be had from the Council of Europe Convention definition which provides for in Article 36: \u201csexual violence, including rape\u201d\u2026. following intentional conduct (a) engaging in non-consensual vaginal, anal or oral penetration of a sexual nature of the body of another person with any bodily part or object; (b) engaging in other non-consensual acts of a sexual nature with a person; (c) causing another person to engage in non-consensual acts of a sexual nature with a third person. UNODC\u2019s Blueprint for Action recommends criminalizing all forms of violence against women and girls as expansively as possible and that definitions ought not to condone myths or stereotypes. Consent The Thai and Vietnamese definitions focus on force, threats, or being unable to resist. Vietnamese police officers interviewed during this study said that if the victim cannot show signs of resistance, such as injuries, or calling on witnesses who have heard her cries for help at the moment of the rape, they will either view her as not being credible or, even when they do believe her,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c32c1a56-fedf-461f-9d95-77d863bd8339": {"__data__": {"id_": "c32c1a56-fedf-461f-9d95-77d863bd8339", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Trial of Rape: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cc0c29a31407d6166aa8d56a5a6cbf4016a647dc3cdc041b76eae3d06f8a2811"}}, "hash": "cc0c29a31407d6166aa8d56a5a6cbf4016a647dc3cdc041b76eae3d06f8a2811", "text": "say that there is not sufficient evidence according to their laws to proceed. Definitions of rape based on the use of force often results in the crime being made dependent on evidence of bodily injuries on the female victim. Attrition alert The lack of a comprehensive detailed legal definition of the acts that comprise rape and sexual/inde- cent assault allow substantial room for discretion by criminal justice officials. Attrition alert THE TRIAL OF RAPE: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam 54 The Vietnamese definition uses the term \u201cagainst one\u2019s will\u201d and the Thai definition looks for threats, harm or exploitation, both of which require active or earnest resistance on the part of the victim in order to negate consent. This ignores the common possibility that women submit to intercourse out of fear of greater harm, and fails to acknowledge the range of coercive circumstances in which women are sexually assaulted. In Thailand, another study of court decisions in rape cases found that when considering the issue of consent, the court focused on how long the victim took to report the rape; whether she could show injuries and her relationship with the suspect.132 Qualitative findings from Viet Nam indicated a tendency by criminal investigators to focus on the behaviour of the victim rather than the accused. As one investigator explained: \u201cOnce a ca-ve (sex worker) came to report she had been raped. I later observed that the guy (accused) was very tall; the girl was quite short. The girl said she was pushed against the wall and raped. I asked her how could this happen since the guy was much taller than her. She then said she did raise her legs. If she did so it was a voluntary act, how could it be rape?\u201d (male investigator, Viet Nam). The research revealed a propensity by criminal justice officials to apply traditional interpretations of behaviour constituting consent when there is some sort of relationship between the victim and perpetrator. The defence of consent should require evidence that there is at least some form of affirmative speech or action on the part of the victim, rather than from an inference of passivity or acquiescence. In Viet Nam, police officers frequently cited reported rape cases by minors against their boyfriends as being consensual sex and feel- ing sorry for the accused. As one police officer noted: \u201cI recall one case where a 12 year old girl had her (17 year old) boyfriend over to her house and they went into the bedroom. We had to proceed with the denunciation because she was under 13 years of age but they were boyfriend-girlfriend and in love, so I felt bad to have to proceed\u201d according to a male investi- gator. The research revealed a lack of consider- ation by criminal investigators that rape could actually take place in a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship (\u2018date rape\u2019). 132. Prechakul, P. Sexuality in the Court\u2019s Decision (Bangkok: Human Rights Commission: 2008) pp.43-59. The way sexual offences are defined can shift the focus to the victim\u2019s be- haviour rather than on the accused\u2019s actions. Attrition alert In non-stranger rape cases, a common defence is that the accused believed that the victim consented to the sexual act. Attrition alert Study Findings: Understanding the Barriers to Justice and Attrition in Sexual Violence Cases 55 Qualitative findings from Thailand showed that a prevalent attitude among the police and public in cases of rape that do not involve additional bodily harm or evidence of fighting back, gives the benefit of the doubt to the suspect by concurring that it might be the case of blackmailing (false allegation). In Thailand, statutory rape is defined to include girls under 16 years old, as they are defined as not legally capable of consenting. However, if the girl is under 16 years but married then she is considered able to consent to having sex with her husband. If the girl is over 13 years old but not yet over 15 years of age and the other party is not yet over 18, then there is no criminal liability imposed if both parties agree to marriage.

The UNODC\u2019s Blueprint for Action recommends that all sexual acts committed against non-consenting women, even if they do not show signs of resistance, are considered sexual violence and criminalized. The Blueprint for Action further recommends that for girls above the age considered to be legally competent to consent to sexual acts but below the age of 18 years old, states should incorporate the concept of abuse of position of trust or dependency in considering consent. Legal exemptions made to statutory rape, which fails to protect girls. Attrition alert Confusion over the issue of how to criminalize consensual sex involv- ing minors and the overlay of discriminatory attitudes of sexual agency of young girls In establishing sexual crimes against children, the laws in both countries are similar in how they define the age of consent, or in other words, the minimum age at which a person is considered to be legally competent to consent to sexual acts. However, Viet Nam and Thailand vary in how the type of sexual acts or relationship between the parties are interpreted, for example if there was a position of trust or dependency versus both parties being minors. In Viet Nam, the attitudes exhibited by the majority of criminal justice professionals inter- viewed was that sexually active minors are presumed to consent to sexual intercourse with \u2018their boyfriends\u2019, even adults. In Viet Nam, girls under 13 years of age are deemed not legally capable of consenting to having sexual intercourse with anyone, whereas girls aged over 14 and under 16 years of age are not legally capable of consenting to have sex with an adult, but can do so for boys under 18 years of age. The research illustrated limited understanding of grooming techniques, the vulnerabilities of minors and risk of sexual exploitation by adults of minors, as well the idea that rapes can occur in dating relationships.

Vethpisay, P. Rape: the study of elements of the act of rape (Master of Law thesis, Thammasart University, 2008) pp 16-17. Marital rape In Thailand, while the 2007 reforms criminalize marital rape, husbands who have consensual sexual intercourse with their wives who are under 16 years of age are exempt from the statutory rape offence. However, non-consensual sex in those situations would fall under the rape offence. In Viet Nam, the definition of rape does not distinguish between rape in or outside of marriage and therefore marital rape can be considered criminal behaviour. However, the 2007 Law on Domestic Violence Prevention and Control establishes \u2018forced sex\u2019 within the family as an act of domestic violence that is subject to administrative, rather than criminal punishment. Administrative punishment includes warnings, fines, forcing a public apology, or attending a re-education programme and is decided by the police or village/commune leaders rather than by the courts. In Viet Nam, the research revealed that no reported cases of marital rape have been received by the police, or in other words, no formal written denunciations have been processed by the police. Another study found that the vast majority of domestic violence cases are dealt with by grassroots reconciliation teams. This is despite the fact that the domestic violence law clearly provides that reconciliation should not be used in incidents of a criminal nature, unless the victim requests for an exemption from criminal proceedings, or incidents of violations of administrative laws subject to civil fines.133 The sanction regime established by the domestic violence law allows for cases to be dealt with outside the criminal justice system by the local police or village/commune leader and as such can be an avenue of attrition. Where the criminal law explicitly excludes marital rape, attrition happens at the outset. Attrition alert Where the legal framework in the countries allow for lesser punishment for rape in marriage in a non-criminal justice regime, attrition can take place when either the victim decides to use the administrative regime or when the police decide to proceed by way of administrative sanction and not criminal punishment.

If the woman chooses to remain with the husband, the mitigation of the husband\u2019s punishment from imprisonment to a sentence with conditions to control his behaviour, continues to minimize rape within marriage. Attrition alert Study Findings: Understanding the Barriers to Justice and Attrition in Sexual Violence Cases 57 The reforms to the Thai Criminal Code in 2007 explicitly criminalized marital rape, but provides that the court may impose a lesser punishment if the victim still wishes to live together as a couple. The wording seems to suggest that in order for the court to impose imprisonment in cases of marital rape, the victim must initiate divorce proceedings. This provision reflects the socio-cultural values of \u2018maintaining harmony\u2019 which prioritizes keeping the family together, the responsibilities of which often fall on the women, as \u2018good wives and good mothers\u2019. 135 Guidance from international norms and standards. The UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women refers to sexual violence within the family and makes a specific reference to marital rape. The Commission on the Status of Women 57th Session Agreed Conclusions endorsed criminalization of marital rape. The Council of Europe Convention includes in the definition of sexual violence that the provision also applies to acts committed against former or current spouses or partners as recognized by international law. In Thailand, the reforms in 2007 provide that both genders can be victims and offenders. However, the gender-neutral definition of rape in the Thai Criminal Code includes the phrase of \u201cact done with the intention to gratify the sexual desire of the offender,\u201d which evokes confusion between seeing rape as a sexual act as opposed to one of violence and control. In Viet Nam, gender-neutral language is used, however, the narrow interpretation of rape and forcible sexual intercourse implies that only women can be victims and males can be perpetrators. For child obscenity, victims and perpetrators can be either gender. The findings from this study were inconclusive as to the actual impact of gender-neutral versus gender sensitive language in the criminal provisions on attrition. The study found no specific anti-sexual violence policies in both Thailand and Viet Nam. 135. Boonyanait, N. Domestic Violence and Forgiveness in Restorative Justice in Somsavat, V ed Stance (Bangkok: Rong Phim Deun Tula: 2010), pp.166-168. Gender-neutral language may negate the reality that rape is a crime of power committed within the para- digm of social and physical inequality between the male and female. Such definitions of offences could have an impact on policies that aim to combat sexual violence as they may not have due consideration of the gendered power relations at stake. Attrition alert Location of sexual crimes within the Penal Codes In Thailand, the offences are located in the chapter dealing with \u201coffences related to sexuality\u201d. In Viet Nam, these offences are located in the section dealing with \u201ccrimes of infring- ing upon human life, health, dignity and honour.\u201d Requiring a time limit up to which a victim can report a case of sexual violence, can mean that when victims report to police after the time limit, the case will not proceed further. Attrition alert THE TRIAL OF RAPE: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam 58 Statute of limitation requirements In Thailand, the Criminal Code classifies rape as a crime against the person rather than a crime against the State. This means that the victim has three months in which to report the sexual offence to the police from the date the incident happened and was known. This feeds into the common belief that a victim of sexual violence will report everything at the first available opportunity. Civil society organizations in Thailand appreciate the need for the victim to feel safe and supported before reporting: \u201cIt is natural and very understandable for the victims to take time to decide to tell the story to someone, let alone to report to the police. They feel dirty and damaged because of what happened.

The legal process map design used in this report relies heavily on the designs created by Lovett, J., and Kelly, L. (2009) Different Systems, Similar Outcomes? Tracking Attrition in Reported Rape Cases Across Europe (Child and Women Abuse Studies Unit, London Metropolitan University. 4.1 Comparative analysis of legal processes and attrition influencers Thailand and Viet Nam have different criminal legal traditions and procedural approaches to rape and sexual assault. The legal systems in both countries have a mix of adversarial and inquisitorial elements. As such there are differing criminal processes, procedural and evidentiary laws, and roles played by the various criminal justice actors. Appendix 1 and 2 provide visual maps of the legal process depicting the typical pathway of rape and sexual offence cases in both countries and highlight the stages at which attrition might occur.136 Given the variations in criminal procedures in Thailand and Viet Nam, this part of the report focuses on the four common stages in the criminal justice process: reporting/initial contact; investigation; pre-trial processes/ prosecution and trial processes, as well as addressing the concern of pre-attrition and that of under-reporting. Throughout these stages, a comparative look at the legal processes in place will be summarized before examining the study\u2019s findings regarding attrition points, patterns and trends. As discussed earlier, while the limitations in the quantitative data meant that the study was unable to draw specific conclusions on attrition rates, the qualitative information provides indications as to the key decision-makers and factors influencing why cases failed to proceed. 4.2 Reporting/initial contact Police are the initial point of contact for victims of rape in both countries. Although processes and procedures vary from one country to another, police in both countries are responsi- ble for taking initial reports, conducting investi- gations, and preparing the case for charge. 4.

Summary of reporting procedures in each country Study Findings: Understanding the Barriers to Justice and Attrition in Sexual Violence Cases 61 Quantitative and qualitative findings from Thailand indicate high attrition rates at this stage. According to data from the OSCC, measured against reporting data from the Thai Royal Police, only 20 percent of cases reported to the OSCC reach the reporting stage, and of those cases, only 31 percent lead to the issuing of an arrest warrant. According to information gleaned from the case review, victims over the age of 18 typically reported the incident within the first week (26.9 percent of the victims aged 18 and over reported within 24 hours, and a further 43.6 percent reported the incidents within a week). Younger victims were more likely to report the incident at a later date. As previously noted, qualitative data has shed light on this situation: often victims who are minors took a long time to tell the family about the incident, and then the family took further time to report to the police due to sensitivity of the issue and the psychological fragility of young victims. In cases of rape where a family member is the perpetrator, it usually takes many months for the case to be reported. In most cases, the incident will go unreported as \u201cno one wants to admit that you have criminal in your family especially in sex related offence.\u201d137 Certainly, the three-month time limit for adults to report a case, from the date that the incident took place and was known, will automatically result in attrition at the reporting stage. In Viet Nam, the first potential point of attrition occurs when the victim first contacts the police or other justice official and makes a verbal report of rape or sexual violence, and a formal denunciation is not made and the case proceeds no further. It appears that the practice is not to record these verbal reports at the local police stations. The qualitative interviews and focus groups provided some indications that attrition could be high at this stage. For example, if the police determine that the reported behaviour does not meet the threshold of a crime, they can choose not to deal with the case or to do so administratively. The victim might decide not to proceed with a formal written denunciation for a number of reasons, including illiteracy, fear of the justice process, gender prejudices of the police, dissuasion by the attitude of the receiving police officer, or because she and the suspect agree to a financial settlement. A female academic stated \u201cThe police and Women\u2019s Union do not believe rape can happen within marriage, so they try to solve these problems through reconciliation.\u201d The next point of attrition is after the victim files a formal written denunciation. At this point, local authorities may decide not to proceed or not to refer the matter to the investigative body. Interviewees suggested the following reasons for attrition at this stage: the opinion of the police that the victim is lying when reporting rape, for example, sex workers trying to obtain money from a client; the police do not think that the victim behaves as they should have when reporting; there is no evidence of any use of force, such as tied arms and legs, beating or torn clothes; there is no evidence of the use of sleeping pills on the victim; the victim might withdraw when told of having to undergo a forensic examination; the victim and suspect might settle on compensation; or the victim might withdraw due to concerns about confidentiality and concerns that everyone will know. Initial reception for the victim Police are, with limited exceptions, the gatekeepers for entry to the criminal justice system. A negative initial experience with the police will significantly impact the victim\u2019s 137.

Respondents noted that treatment by police is in many cases unprofessional and degrading without regard for the trauma the woman has suffered. In both countries, interviewees reported that victims are often required to wait long hours in police stations \u2013 often staffed exclusively by men \u2013 for an officer to take their statement, and to be taken to hospital for examination. Study findings highlight cases where the traumatized victim has to sit in unfriendly spaces without privacy for many hours, and is unable to change clothes or wash or even use the toilet, otherwise she may be blamed for compromising the evidence. In Thailand, victims raised the concern that when they were waiting to make the report, the suspect was in the same room, and the public was able to overhear her conversation with the police. Additionally, the police officer and station assigned to a particular case is determined by where the victim reported, not necessarily where the victim lives. If this location is far from the victim\u2019s home, she must travel each time she is requested to do so, which can represent a huge cost and burden for her. Filing the initial incident report Interviews with victims, NGOs, government referral agencies, and medical service providers draw attention to the systemic institutional barriers that victims face in accessing police, and the pressure victims, and those agencies supporting them, must apply to get police to accept a report. Although reporting processes vary between the countries examined, a victim can encounter reporting challenges in each country. In Viet Nam a victim must file, sign or give a fingerprint in a written complaint or denunciation to start the criminal justice process. This can be particularly daunting if she cannot understand the language, read or write, or if she has disabilities that preclude her from doing so. Further, respondents noted that victims are often threatened not to denounce, and fear revenge if they do. Generally the local police take the initial report and conduct preliminary investigations. These officers, who function primarily as report takers, have no training in justice, investigation, evidence gathering or criminal procedure. They pass their \u2018findings\u2019 onto an experienced investigator from a centralized division who conducts the primary investigation. However, all information is later used as evidence for prosecution. The initial non-professional comments and findings could prove detrimental to the victim\u2019s case. International norms and standards relevant for initial contact/ reporting: \u00a8 Urge States to ensure that a victim reporting a crime of sexual violence must be treated with dignity and respect and confidentiality and privacy must be maintained throughout. \u00a8 Urge States to provide services that are prompt, professional, non-judgmental and victim-focused. \u00a8 Ensure police are responsible for facilitating access to health services, victim support, safety planning and protection services. \u00a8 Provide trained personnel to be available to assist and support the victim in filing her complaint. Study Findings: Understanding the Barriers to Justice and Attrition in Sexual Violence Cases 63 A victim and her family related that they were provided with copies of an incident report in a language they did not understand and could not read. It was noted that oftentimes, a victim is not informed of the steps she must follow in the formal filing process, how the process works, or what her rights are. Findings from Viet Nam showed that in certain regions, local police kept rape cases off the official record to lend credence to the official view that rape and other crimes were \u201cunder control\u201d in those \u201csensitive areas of special focus\u201d (a term referring to mountainous and remote areas). Interviews suggested that this practice could be related to the enhancement of promotion prospects for local police officers who are seen to be capable of maintaining security and preventing violent crime in their region. Onus on the victim Rape and sexual offences against women in Thailand and Viet Nam are classified as crimes that require the victim\u2019s consent in order to proceed. Sexual crimes against girls in Thailand are treated as crimes against the State. Classifying sexual offences as crimes against the person, or semi-public crimes, means that the onus is on the victim to lodge a formal complaint in order for the investigation to proceed. Such a classification allows the \u2018parties\u2019 to negotiate a settlement outside the criminal justice system. In both countries, the victim has the right to withdraw from the process.

In Viet Nam, if the victim withdraws her consent, she must sign an official form saying that she understands that she cannot re-submit the denunciation. Providing a statement In Viet Nam, the first potential point of attrition occurs when the victim first contacts the police or other justice official and makes a verbal report of rape or sexual violence, and a formal denunciation. The study found that in both countries, victims were often made to repeat their stories multiple times, a process which can be humiliating, exacerbate her trauma through secondary victimization,138 and increase the risk of attrition. When the repeated requests for statements is considered in conjunction with the fact that the victim\u2019s story is interpreted by the statement taker, complete with his/her bias, and its content is often not verified by the victim and can later be used to discredit her in court, it is easy to see why women may choose to disengage from the criminal justice system. Moreover, any conflicting or inconsistent statements are used to call into question a victim\u2019s credibility and reliability. A significant body of research on the dynamics of sexual violence has demonstrated that the trauma a victim has experienced can have a variety of negative effects on her ability to provide complete and accurate information about her assault. 139 Trauma research further suggests that victims \u201cmight often recall accurate information about the sexual assault after one or even two full sleep cycles.\u201d 140 However, many of the criminal justice professionals interviewed were not conversant with the physical, behavioural and psychological symptoms of rape trauma, the impacts this could have on the victim, or that such trauma may result in variations in her testimony. 138.

THE TRIAL OF RAPE: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam 64 Three survivors interviewed in Thailand described the uncomfortable setting of their interrogation, where any available desk or room in the police station was used without concern for privacy or safety. Respondents noted that questions asked by police were often biased and did not consider a victim\u2019s feelings or emotional state. Examples of questions offered by 15 female inquiry officers representing police stations in Bangkok, Chiang Mai and Songkhla include: \u201cWhat were you doing there at that time? It was late.\u201d, \u201cWhy did you go with him (the offender) in the first place?\u201d, \u201cWhat were you wearing when the incident happened?\u201d, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you shout or fight back?\u201d, and \u201cAre you sure you did not give him any signals that you were interested?\u201d Regardless of the level of gender awareness or sensitivity of a female police officer \u2013 as it cannot be assumed that just because an officer is female, she will be any more likely to treat a victim with respect and care \u2013 many victims noted that they felt more comfortable relaying their story to female officers, who are represented in significantly lower numbers than men within the police in both countries.141 One Thai survivor explained: \u201cI am a woman and I was raped. It was difficult to overcome shameful feelings; the feelings that my body was dirty. It was difficult for me to explain to male police officers. I was raped by men and I had to tell the story to men? No. I\u2019d rather talk to women, they have similar bodies as mine. I believe they could feel for me more. We are women.\u201d Male frontline officers interviewed in focus groups in Thailand and Viet Nam confirmed that they too felt uncomfortable having to question and discuss \u2018personal and intimate\u2019 matters with female victims, which is likely to affect the reporting and recording of cases. 141.

Unfortunately, these procedures are not provided for all victims of sexual violence, only children. Availability of effective protection measures Protection for women and girls who have experienced sexual violence is critical in its own right and as such, protection measures should be available independent of any initiation of a criminal case. Effective protection can empower victims to report and enable them to stay safely engaged with the criminal justice system. Safety considerations must be prioritized in all decisions throughout the criminal justice process, and should take into account the Study Findings: Understanding the Barriers to Justice and Attrition in Sexual Violence Cases 65 physical and emotional needs of the victim. In both countries, protection orders are only available to a woman if she is a victim of domestic violence. Judicial protection orders (restraining orders or no-contact measures) do not appear to be available to victims of sexual violence committed by acquaintances, boyfriends or strangers. The safety and protection of the sexual violence victim does not appear to be a priority consideration in criminal justice system processes. It does not appear that the justice systems in either country provide for access to immediate, urgent or long-term protection measures outside of domestic violence situations. None of the police interviewed in Thailand or Viet Nam referred to conducting risk assessments, assisting victims in developing safety plans, or working with other service providers to develop integrated protocols and referral networks that focus on safety and protection. Nor was the necessity of protection identified as a pressing issue by any of the criminal justice service providers interviewed. Table 8.

In Thailand, the police conduct the investigation after the victim signs a complaint. In Viet Nam, formal investigations require a decision to institute a criminal investigation, which is to be approved by the procuracy. Attrition at the investigation stage: What did the study find? In both Thailand and Viet Nam, the study found a high risk of attrition during the investigation stage. In Thailand, if OSCC data is compared against the Thai Royal Police data, only six percent of the cases reported to the OSCC result in the issuing of an arrest warrant. While Section 133 of the Criminal Procedure Code stipulates that an inquiry concerning a female victim must be conducted by a female inquiry officer, there are insufficient female officers in relation to the total number of police stations and reported incidents, hence it is likely that a victim will be questioned by a male officer. This procedure may cause the victim to change her statement, or to withdraw altogether for fear of stigmatization or judgment.

At this stage, there are a number of potential points of attrition in Viet Nam: firstly, when the investigating body decides not to formally initiate a criminal investigation, and secondly, when the investigating body decides to formally initiate a criminal case but the procuracy does not approve. After the investigation stage, the next potential point of attrition comes when the investigating body decides not to proceed further. During this stage, the victim may withdraw at any time. Findings from Viet Nam indicate that this is the main stage where attrition occurs. There appear to be differing levels of attrition depending on whether the victim was a girl or a woman. The quantitative case review found a rate of attrition of 27 percent in cases involving girl victims, compared to an attrition rate of 61 percent in cases 142.

In nearly 50 percent of the cases that were dropped by the police, the reason recorded was \u201cno offence\u201d, which according to interviews means that based on the evidence, no crime was committed or there was deficient evidence. In less than 1 percent of cases was false allegation recorded. In just over a third of the cases dropped at this stage (36 percent), the victims withdrew. All victims who withdrew were adults. The reasons cited for withdrawal included: victims and suspect negotiated a settlement; victims were afraid of stigma; or victims were concerned about their privacy. Sexual offence investigations are complex investigations, complicated further by the fact that often there are no independent witnesses or forensic evidence available, resulting in a focus on the credibility of the victim. Consent becomes a significant issue, and in both countries, the study found that there is often a reluctance to proceed without additional corroboration. Many officers interviewed noted that in cases where there was no visible evidence on the victims\u2019 bodies, the difficulty of proving a case was increased. Others mentioned the difficulty encountered when the sexual act of intercourse remains incomplete. In Thailand, the criminal code does not elaborate on the circumstances to determine consent, and a review of court decisions found that the main circumstantial factors used to determine consent included the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, the events leading up to the rape, and the physical appearance of the victim and the suspect.143 143.

It was noted that there are currently only two medical examiners with rape and sexual assault expertise; however, based on interviews with medical practitioners, this expertise is being gradually strengthened. In Viet Nam, while there are specialized facilities and medical staff to undertake forensic examinations, there are no specifically trained or designated forensic examiners for sexual violence. Furthermore, as far as is known \u2013 with the exception of the hospitals that follow WHO protocols \u2013 there are no specific guidelines for handling sexual violence cases, particularly when the report is of sexual abuse that did not occur recently. The qualitative findings from Viet Nam indicated that rape victims are often treated with insensitivity by medical and legal personnel: \u201cAt local level, the police can transfer the case to the authoritative forensic agency, but some forensic experts may not feel confident to perform the rape victim examination given their lack of expertise in these particular skills. The forensic experts would turn to the gynaecological nurses for assistance. Therefore it is not unusual to see a queue of four persons walking through the hospital, led by a male forensic expert. The victim trying to hide her face with a scarf and hat walks behind him, then the nurse, and the last person in the queue is the police holding a pile of paperwork. By looking at this any bystander can immediately tell that the girl or woman is the rape victim. Imagine that the victim was already traumatized from the rape, this way of treatment would even jeopardize her a thousand times more.\u201d Male forensic expert, Viet Nam International norms and standards relevant for initial contact/ reporting: \u00a8 Promote timely investigations that are conducted in a professional manner, meet evidentiary and investigative requirements, exhausting all available means to identify and arrest the suspect, considering throughout the women\u2019s and girls\u2019 safety, security and dignity. \u00a8 The UN Principles and Guidelines on Access to Legal Aid in Criminal Justice Systems 144 calls on States to ensure appropriate advice, assistance, care facilities and support to female victims of violence throughout the criminal justice process in a manner that prevents repeat victimization and secondary victimization. 144. GA res 67/187, annex. Study Findings: Understanding the Barriers to Justice and Attrition in Sexual Violence Cases 69 Another example from Viet Nam highlights further concerns regarding the treatment of victims of sexual violence: \u201cOnce, a male forensic expert did the examination. He somehow scared off the victim. She hastily put on her pants, and quickly ran away from the examination room to the nearby park. Maybe he did not explain the procedure to the victim sufficiently. For instance, why the victim needs to be fully naked? There were situations in which the women only agreed to be topless and wanted to keep their pants on. And how their collaborative attitudes would help us carry out the exam effectively? If she just tries to keep her leg closed how could we perform the tests?\u201d Male forensic expert, Viet Nam Evidence gathering processes In Thailand and Viet Nam, a rape must first be reported to the police before a forensic medical examination takes place. In Thailand, forensic examinations of the victim are mandatory irrespective of when the victim makes her report.145 The examination is to be done to the extent as necessary and expedient, inflicting least pain and not to harm the victim. If the victim does not consent, an adverse inference can be drawn. In Viet Nam, the forensic examination is not mandatory under the law, however when the investigators require an examination of the victim\u2019s body for traces of evidence, then the examination must be conducted by a female officer, or in the presence of another woman (for example a female nurse or female companion of the victim).146 Interviewees reported that medical examinations are rarely conducted within 24 hours. There is no contraception to prevent pregnancy, HIV prophylaxis or therapeutic care provided and many medical and psycho-social needs of survivors are not addressed or met. Hospitals are busy, and sexual violence victims often end up waiting, with limited opportunity to maintain privacy or confidentiality. Delays in accessing forensic services may result in changes to physical evidence (e.g. healing of injuries) or loss of forensic materials.147 Although medical research recommends collection within 72-96 hours of the assault to preserve evidence,148 a significant number of medical forensic examinations in Thailand and Viet Nam are completed beyond that time frame.

White (2007) The Uses and Impacts of Medico-legal Evidence in Sexual Assault Cases: A Global Review, WHO, p.13. THE TRIAL OF RAPE: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam 70 Medico-legal evidence gathering policies In Viet Nam, forensic evidence is the primary evidence considered when determining if an act constitutes an offence. The Viet Nam case review indicates that 95 percent of victims went for a forensic examination. Of these, 40 percent of cases involved over four days between the time of the incident and the date of reporting. Five cases were sent for forensic examinations despite reporting the incident of rape over a year later. If case reporting is delayed, and the possibility of gathering useful evidence is diminished, in some cases the investigation is suspended, and the case is concluded. There was confusion among interviewees about the necessity of having a forensic examination and the difficulties in cases progressing in the criminal justice system if the forensic examination failed to provide conclusive evidence of rape or forced sex. \u201cUp to now the police do not follow the rule strictly. When the rape victim revealed the incident\u2026 the concerned police often take the victim to the local family planning clinic or other healthcare facility, and ask the gynaecological nurses to perform the examination. These nurses and even practitioners in fact unwittingly destroy the possible evidence rather than making every effort to save anything that might contain the source of biological material left on the victim\u2019s body. They would clean the victim\u2019s private parts, so how could they find the perpetrator\u2019s sperm? They would even shave the victim\u2019s pubic hair, so how could they find and collect the perpetrator\u2019s loose pubic hair there? They at times did it with a dull blade, which would cause new nicks and scratches in the victim\u2019s private area. This practice would make it extremely challenging for the investigator to figure out which nicks were caused from the rape per se. If you would conduct a survey among the gynaecological nurses and practitioners I am sure they would not actually know what an intact and broken hymen looks like. I had read the case description at times written by these gynaecological practitioners, and found phrases that were ridiculous and non-sensical, such as \u2018hymen was broken in two pieces\u2019. Well the hymen is not a water tube that can be broken in two pieces. And \u2018the hymen was broken into rectangular shape\u2019 or \u2018the hymen was broken and one piece missing\u2019, and so on and so forth.\u201d Male forensic expert, Viet Nam Over-reliance on corroborating physical evidence Vietnamese police officers interviewed noted that they look for terms including \u201cforced\u201d, \u201ctying arms and legs\u201d, \u201cbeating\u201d, and \u201ctearing of clothes\u201d to substantiate a rape. They also stated that they look for indicators that the suspect took advantage of a victim\u2019s inability to resist, is ill or mentally ill, or used anaesthetic or sleeping pills so as to prevent victim resistance, though they acknowledged that such gestures and actions are much more difficult to substantiate. While the Code of Criminal Procedure does not preclude relying only on the statement of the victim, many officers felt that they would not proceed in a case where there was no forensic evidence or other witness statements. This reasoning reflects the continued gender stereotyping which requires some form of corroboration.

Under certain situations, victims may be able to access state-run legal aid assistance. Interviews with seven survivors in Thailand revealed that all victims felt they would have been more empowered if they had had legal knowledge. Knowledge that would have been useful included awareness of the 3-month period to report to the police after the incident occurs, an understanding of the importance of collecting forensic evidence immediately after the rape occurs, awareness of the right to request a female inquiry officer, and of the right to oppose bail for the accused. In Viet Nam, despite the fact that legal aid is available to support victims as witnesses in the process, researchers heard accounts that highlight the denial of the right of women to a fair trial, owing to a failure to receive legal assistance to pursue their cases. \u201cThe court did not allow social workers to be with the plaintiff during the trial in order to support her emotionally and possibly to speak on her behalf if needed.

In Thailand, this is done by a preliminary judge and in Viet Nam by an assigned judge.151 Study Findings: Understanding the Barriers to Justice and Attrition in Sexual Violence Cases 73 Attrition at the prosecution/pre-trial stage: What did the study find? Attrition at this stage involved decisions made by the prosecutor in both countries, not to file an indictment. Attrition also included those cases being dropped from the process by decisions made by the judiciary not to commit or refer the matter to trial in both Thailand and Viet Nam. Cases were also lost at this stage in situations where the victims withdrew. The study\u2019s findings indicated that pre-trial/ prosecutorial stage attrition rates in both countries was relatively low, and amounted to the fewest number of cases being dropped throughout the criminal justice process. According to the case review in Viet Nam, only 2 out of the 88 cases referred to the pre-trial stage were dropped. The case review found that the decision to drop these cases was made by the criminal justice officials (the procuracy or assigned judge) and not by the victim. Criminal justice practitioners explained that this low attrition rate was likely due to the fact that the procuracy is involved in the criminal investigation at an earlier stage, as they are required to approve the decision to institute a criminal case. Thus they have already influenced the decision to drop what they perceive as \u2018weak\u2019 cases during the investigation stage. One female prosecutor described her role as \u201csticking stamps, meaning approving that whatever is sent from the police passes through your desk.\u201d The findings also indicate that it is common for the assigned judges who review the dossier (the case file), to approve the case for trial: A female legal expert said \u201cThe judges just rely on the dossiers for their convenience. It is obviously easier for them. They would rather do that than making further effort to look into the case.\u201d Diagram 2. Main causes of attrition at pre-trial stage Lack of support Insensitive treatment Lengthy delays Gender bias Perceived weak cases Reluctant victims Decision not to prosecute Victim\u2019s decision to withdraw Common reasons for attrition While the attrition rates at this stage are difficult to calculate and compare across the countries, the qualitative interviews provide some common reasons for cases being dropped at this stage of the criminal justice process. Perceived weak cases: Assessing the evidence In both countries, prosecutors and judges act as gatekeepers to the courts, not allowing for what they consider as \u2018weak\u2019 cases to enter the next level. As far as is known, there are no prosecution policies that restrict prosecutorial discretion, for example, mandatory or pro-prosecution policies in cases involving sexual violence against women and girls. In both Thailand and Viet Nam, interviews with prosecutors and judges, as well as investigators and police, raise the issue of evidentiary challenges in sexual violence cases. These included: concerns about victim credibility; lack of forensic evidence; concerns that the victim delayed reporting or refused a medical THE TRIAL OF RAPE: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam 74 examination, or was intoxicated at the time of the incident; and lack of corroborating evidence. In Viet Nam, many interviewed officials described the burden of proof and finding physical evidence of sexual violence as being often impossible to meet, which means often that the case will not proceed. According to most Vietnamese officials interviewed, a victim statement cannot stand on its own.152 The lack of clear understanding of the evidentiary requirements needed to proceed with a prosecution was evident. There was little appreciation of the different evidentiary requirements for sexual violence cases, classified as \u2018consent\u2019 cases, versus \u2018identity\u2019 cases. There was also over-reliance on forensic evidence, even in cases where there is delayed reporting and likely contaminated or little forensic evidence available, or no visible physical injuries. In Thailand, where evidence collection and investigation is the responsibility of the inquiry officer, insufficient evidence or poor proces can lead to challenges for the prosecutor: \u201cWithout trust in the system and with increasing complexities of the system, it is becoming difficult to have a strong case with sound evidence for a rape case as the victim hesitates to speak or", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "798f4982-2edc-4a44-b96f-cb1ca1e877bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "798f4982-2edc-4a44-b96f-cb1ca1e877bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Trial of Rape: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7acab4a82391271b8524847a61e42307de7ed2dfa15d513bc25dea1034644734"}}, "hash": "7acab4a82391271b8524847a61e42307de7ed2dfa15d513bc25dea1034644734", "text": "fight further. We, the prosecutors, cannot do much because it is the inquiry official who interrogates and collects evidence. We are like a postman delivering a package to the court.\u201d Pro-bono lawyer of community NGO, Thailand Prosecutors need to ensure that they have all available relevant evidence before them prior to determining on filing an indictment and selecting the appropriate charge that reflects the gravity of the criminal conduct. As one NGO representative from Thailand explains, even when solid evidence is available, prosecutors can influence the decision to settle a case: \u201cPeople may think once the case reaches the prosecution stage with solid evidence, it will go through easily, but my experience supporting rape victims is somehow different. There was one case where a prosecutor called the victim and asked her to go to his office to receive money as compensation from the suspect\u2019s family. She did not go, but the prosecutor office kept calling and insisting that she accept the money. It is common, I think, as an offence that falls under Section 276 can be settled at all stages of the criminal justice system. And maybe it is Thai culture or may be it is easier for practitioners to just try to settle cases. Most victims I have worked with were first told to \u2018compromise\u2019 and \u2018accept\u2019. Is that what women are supposed to do? Accept?\u201d 152. Prof Huong\u2019s report p.42. International norms and standards relevant at the pre-trial stage \u00a8 Urge States to introduce criminal pre-trial processes that are non- biased and sensitive to the specific needs of victims and survivors of sexual violence. \u00a8 Provide that the primary respon- sibility for initiating prosecution is to be on the prosecution, not the victim. \u00a8 Promote the principle of offender accountability by ensuring the selection and approval of charges reflect the gravity of the conduct. Study Findings: Understanding the Barriers to Justice and Attrition in Sexual Violence Cases 75 Gender bias contributing to attrition rates at the prosecution stage Prosecutors may condone or falsely believe that women and girls bring on violence by their actions. There are a number of negative beliefs about sexual violence based on gender discrimination and stereotyping (see myths in section 2.2). If these myths are formally or informally embraced by prosecutors, this results in downplaying the perpetrator\u2019s responsibility and criminality while shifting the blame towards the victim. The victim\u2019s behaviour and personal characteristics then take centre stage rather than the perpetrator\u2019s actions. This generally results in suspicion of the victim\u2019s claim of sexual violence and little support or justice being provided to the victim. Gender biases can also result in prosecutors trivializing the sexual violence, and reducing charges against the perpetrator. Most of the prosecutors interviewed in Viet Nam said that they tended to raise doubt about the credibility of the rape allegation as a result of the inconsistent statements. It was noted that these seemingly inconsistent statements are bound to create unfavourable impressions with regard to the victim, except child victims. \u201cA problem in the investigative process is the inconsistency of statements made by victims of sexual offences who are women and children. For example at the precinct X, the victim said this was her first sexual experience but later she changed her story saying that there had been previous sexual encounters. This may be due to her confused mental state but it may result from agreement with the accused to reduce the seriousness of the crime.\u201d Insensitive treatment of victims If victims have an unsatisfactory or even hostile experience with the criminal justice system, they distrust the system or do not believe that the system can help them. In both countries, interviews with victims and civil society raised issues concerning the lack of trust and confidence in the criminal justice process and actors, as well as fears of not being believed or treated with disdain or contempt. In both countries there are no specific obligations on the criminal justice system service providers to keep the victim informed of progress of the investigation and any decisions they make. Interviewees noted that there is limited to no communication with justice system service providers, and that there is little opportunity for victims to provide input into decisions made at the reporting, investigative or court stage. The lack of victim-engagement strategies contributes to increased victim stress, humiliation and intimidation during the legal process. In Viet Nam, a social worker supporting a young girl who had been raped by her uncle- in-law re-iterated the frustration of the victim\u2019s mother with the prosecution process. \u201cThat day he (the accused) volunteered all the necessary information, he", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e9e3b3f0-a71e-49ae-b1ea-f078b7a1f25d": {"__data__": {"id_": "e9e3b3f0-a71e-49ae-b1ea-f078b7a1f25d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Trial of Rape: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "68abf43daf8d8b6ad82d4cb9dcc15e5d859113515d12cda254aa10d0a0b3476f"}}, "hash": "68abf43daf8d8b6ad82d4cb9dcc15e5d859113515d12cda254aa10d0a0b3476f", "text": "spoke the truth, but later denied everything.

But later they passed a completely different judgment\u2026. They gave him a much lighter sentence (charging him with child molestation rather than rape of a child).\u201d Female social worker explaining a mother\u2019s story, Viet Nam THE TRIAL OF RAPE: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam 76 Findings from Viet Nam indicate that prosecutors rarely have contact with the victims directly, summoning them only if they see a need to verify a seemingly contradictory statement. Lengthy delays and lack of preparation for trial The slow process of prosecution can cause fear and frustration among victims. In Thailand, there was little evidence of practices that promoted victims\u2019 agency and expedited hearings. Communication with victims on their case progress was often seen as non-existent in both countries. As one survivor in Thailand explains: \u201cI can easily sum up my experiences in the prosecution stage in three words; I don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t understand the law, I don\u2019t understand why it takes so long and I don\u2019t understand language used in correspondence from the prosecutor office. Of course I felt like quitting and leaving everything behind.\u201d Ongoing and extended delays result in victims no longer wanting to participate in proceedings. Interviews with victims and civil society noted that delays in trials continue to be a problem. In Thailand and Viet Nam there are no specific provisions that explicitly provide for the fast- tracking of sexual violence cases. Studies confirm that support and assistance to victims throughout the criminal justice system impacts on the continued participation of victims, increases the likelihood of successful prosecution and conviction, increases victim satisfaction irrespective of the criminal justice outcome, and reduces the effects of secondary victimization.153 Another study showed that the way victims are supported and treated in the criminal justice process is as important as the eventual outcome of the case.154 The confusing nature of criminal justice legal processes, together with lengthy court procedures and delays, may leave victims with little hope that their cases will ever go through. In both countries there are no specific criminal procedures in place to assist and support the victim through the investigative process, nor are there specific obligations on the police to keep the victim informed of the investigation and any decisions they make. The value of support is best explained by victims who have used support services. Victims surveyed showed that in those cases that resulted in acquittals \u2013 but where victims were supported throughout by a lawyer, a support worker, or civil society organization \u2013 while they were disappointed in the outcome, they did not regret pursuing the case. Victims in Thailand accessing NGOs such as the Women and Men Progressive Movement Foundation, Foundation for Women, and Friends of Women Foundation, often found the support they needed to enhance their legal awareness and work through the challenges associated with progressing through the criminal justice system. As one survivor explains: \u201cI was asked why do I trust an NGO so much. And if I trust an NGO, why do I have to come to the police and go through justice system. To be honest, I did not trust anyone but this NGO has supported me greatly. They provided me with legal advice, connected me to relevant organizations and staff have become my friends. They have helped me regain strength. They treated me with respect.\u201d 153. Lovett, J., Regan, L. and Kelly L.

It does not appear that the justice systems in either country provide for any reference to the potential need for protection measures as a consideration in court release or bail proceedings. 4.5 Trial processes The trial process stage of the criminal justice system focuses on those cases that have been referred to trial, whether by a preliminary judge in Thailand, or an assigned judge that reviews the case file in Viet Nam. Attrition at the trial stage: What did the study find? Attrition at this stage involves those cases where: the court acquits the accused; the accused absconds before trial and the prosecutor decides to discontinue the case; the victim decides to withdraw from the legal process, or retract her statement; or where the victim declines to cooperate for any reason, such as reaching an informal settlement. The study\u2019s findings indicate that attrition at trial varies greatly in both countries.

Summary of criminal procedural legal factors that impact on attrition: Pre-trial processes THE TRIAL OF RAPE: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam 78 In Thailand, the findings from the case review did not provide any indication regarding attrition rates at trial, as the case files sampled from the investigation stage could not be traced to the courts due to different case file numbers being used by different parts of the system and the lack of access to court records. However, according to a review of national statistics, 20-30 percent of cases that entered the trial stage resulted in acquittals. In Viet Nam, the quantitative sample of this study indicated very low attrition at this stage, with a high percentage of cases that were set for trial resulting in conviction. The case review found only 1 out of the 86 cases referred to trial that had resulted in an acquittal. Interviews with criminal justice practitioners confirmed that once a case was approved by the procuracy, it went to trial quickly and resulted in high conviction rates. Table 13.

Inverse relationship between conviction and age of the victim In Viet Nam, while the ratio of minor victims to adult victims amongst the sample cases reviewed was 69.4 percent minors to 30.6 percent adults, the cases of minors resulted in higher conviction rates. Victims under 13 years of age had an 81 percent conviction rate; victims between 13 and 16 years old resulted in a 92 percent conviction rate, while victims over 16 years only resulted in 37 percent of convictions. This predictor is similar to other attrition studies which find that conviction rates are generally higher for victims under 20 years.155 Victim\u2013offender relationship The quantitative data from this study did not provide clear predictions on whether the factor of the relationship between the victim and the accused is a good predictor of the probability of conviction. However, in other attrition studies, victim-offender relationships were a significant factor at almost all stages: the significant predictors were strangers and current partners or boyfriends.156 This means that attacks by strangers were more often associated with false complaints and no offence cases and the high attrition rate was due to their association with unidentified suspects. However, if prosecuted, stranger attacks were much more likely to result in a conviction, giving these cases a relatively high overall conviction rate. 155.

International norms and standards relevant at the trial stage \u00a8 Call for measures to prevent further hardship and trauma that may result from attending the trial itself and to ensure that trial processes maximize the victim\u2019s cooperation, promote her capacity to exert agency during the trial stage while ensuring that the burden or onus of seeking justice is on the State. \u00a8 Urge States to have criminal procedural and evidentiary laws that ensure a friendly and enabling courtroom environment for victims to feel safe and comfortable recounting what they have experienced; procedures to minimize re-victimization; and the application of evidentiary rules in a non-discriminatory manner. \u00a8 Call on all States to eliminate the requirement that the victim\u2019s testimony be corroborated; place restrictions on the introduction of the victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct; and establish legal provisions or the application of special measure for vulnerable and intimidated witnesses. Aggravating factors Consistent with other attrition studies, the qualitative interviews with criminal justice officials indicate that, generally where aggravating factors such as violence and injuries, use of weapons, or multiple accused are present, they felt this was a strong predictor of a case resulting in a conviction. In Viet Nam, many officials interviewed shared the view that cases of rape which showed signs of the perpetrator\u2019s use of violence, visible signs of resistance on the victim\u2019s part and bodily injuries to the victim, would more likely result in the perpetrator confessing and thereby being convicted. The 39 out of 121 cases reviewed in Viet Nam that were classified as gang rape, THE TRIAL OF RAPE: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam 80 violent rape or rape with a weapon, all resulted in conviction. Perceived negative attributes of the victim The high percentage of convictions in cases involving girl victims can have indications of perceived \u2018good character\u2019 victims versus \u2018bad character\u2019 victims. It was not clear whether perceived negative attributes of the victim, such as alcohol and drug use, criminal history, previous allegations, etc. were significant in terms of conviction rates. Nor was it clear if the victim refused a medical examination or delayed in reporting, these factors were seen as negative attributes of the victim. Available corroborative evidence Global studies have found that there are higher conviction rates in cases involving physical evidence, forensic evidence and witness statements. This was consistent with interviews with criminal justice officials in Viet Nam. Judicial biases In many countries, the criminal nature of sexual violence and expresse bias against its victims, condoning or falsely believing that women bring on violence by their actions, such as arguing with a spouse, dressing provocatively to go out, or walking alone at night.157 Interviews with the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "27c1f0e6-17b3-4165-8c1a-ec803dfd76ee": {"__data__": {"id_": "27c1f0e6-17b3-4165-8c1a-ec803dfd76ee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Trial of Rape: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bb23395d09a4383eac57278090ef03cc182f4dc036c43671a12645275c566b06"}}, "hash": "bb23395d09a4383eac57278090ef03cc182f4dc036c43671a12645275c566b06", "text": "judiciary in both countries found that many judges held preconceived beliefs about attributes or characteristics female victims should possess or how they should behave. In Thailand, judges consider the issue of consent generally through the determination of the past history between the victim and the suspect, which includes the victim\u2019s sexual history and her appearance at the time of incident. These judicial biases based on myths and stereotyping can impact on how the judge assesses the victim\u2019s testimony and her credibility, the offender\u2019s culpability, and whether the conduct in question is viewed as criminal in nature. Such biases can compromise the impartiality of the judge\u2019s decision and impair their ability to assess the facts, to misinterpret or misapply the laws and shape the legal results from the criminal trial. As seen from the statements above \u2013 where there is the belief that men are sexually active and women are sexually passive \u2013 the man is unable to control his hormonal urges and cannot be held responsible for his sexual misconduct, especially if provoked by what the woman is wearing or her behaviour. Where the victim is sexually active, or has acted immodestly, this can lead to victim blaming, believing that such women deserve rape and do not deserve the law\u2019s protection. Classifying victims based on stereotypes into categories of \u2018bad\u2019 victims versus \u2018ideal\u2019 or \u2018authentic\u2019 victims based on their lives, backgrounds and characteristics have implications when judges assess the victim\u2019s credibility. Such biases include the inference that a woman who is sexually active has the propensity to consent to sex and must have consented, or that women who dress and behave inappropriately provoked the sexual violence and should therefore accept the blame. This leads to belief that such women are less credible witnesses. Safeguards for victim while testifying Court procedures are reportedly the most daunting experiences for sexual violence victims. The complicated nature of legal procedures and laws, as well as the overly punitive and adversarial orientation of the justice system \u2013 without much reference to the victim\u2019s actual needs \u2013 can be seen as a major barrier to victims\u2019 engagement with the legal system, 157. Morley and Mullender (1994), as well as confirmed in Bott et al. (2005) Preventing and Responding to Gender Based Violence in Middle and Low Income Countries: A Global Review and Analysis (World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 3618). Study Findings: Understanding the Barriers to Justice and Attrition in Sexual Violence Cases 81 particularly in the absence of legal advocacy and support. The pressure to testify often serves as an additional stress factor for victims, and there is a need for court procedures that reduce experiences of intimidation, humiliation and stress. Both countries have legal provisions which allow for closed hearings. However, neither country studied, specifically allows support persons to be with the victim at the trial. On the positive side, both countries allow screens or other types of measures such as CCTV to protect young victims from seeing the accused when testifying. In Thailand, child victims can also be questioned through a social worker or other appropriate person. Despite the fact that trials are conducted differently in Thailand and Viet Nam, the victims and civil society groups in each country spoke about how daunting the experience of going to court and having to testify is for victims of sexual violence. For example: In Thailand: \u201cIn the case of a minor, the Court occasionally issues an order for the use of closed circuit television or video tape while questioning. The final deliberation on whether the case is sensitive and whether the equipment should be used belongs to the Court. However in reality, the equipment available at the court is of poor quality due to inadequate budget allocated for this purpose. More importantly, victims are not aware of their rights to request this method of questioning and hearing.\u201d Female researcher, Thailand In Viet Nam, according to a female academic, victims in Viet Nam who have to speak about their rape in court feel inhibited about talking publicly about sex-related matters and fear cross-examination, as they were worried about not being able to present their own case coherently but also to recall details of the acts of their assailants correctly (female academic, Viet Nam). NGOs have raised concern about the lack of safeguards for victims who have to testify in court: \u201cA judge can decide whether the trial is held in public or behind closed doors in order to preserve people\u2019s privacy. The onus is on the victim to make the request. However, some judges think that high profile rape trials should be held in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d0d0556b-b882-48e0-ac25-ac49f665f8cc": {"__data__": {"id_": "d0d0556b-b882-48e0-ac25-ac49f665f8cc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Trial of Rape: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "94210c2447930b455c416726614ca963ff0638735950bf344fad492fb0c374cf"}}, "hash": "94210c2447930b455c416726614ca963ff0638735950bf344fad492fb0c374cf", "text": "public for educational purposes (without the presence of the victim). It was not clear as to whether they consider the impact on the victim.\u201d Female NGO worker, Viet Nam Generally, the courtroom environment in both countries pays little heed to the victim\u2019s needs. The majority of courtrooms are staffed predominately with male judges and court staff who lack training on how to handle sexual violence cases and support victims. There are few special measures available to create an enabling courtroom environment. The main measure available in both countries is application for closed trials. However, victims reported that this is not always in place. If a victim does not feel safe and secure when providing her testimony or answering the court\u2019s questions, she can appear hesitant or be viewed as providing inconsistent statements. Application of evidentiary rules As in many countries, victims of sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam are often treated unlike other crime victims. The interpretation of evidentiary rules in these countries illustrates how difficult it is for the victim to establish her credibility, to fend off inquiry and speculation regarding her character, to challenge the admission of irrelevant or highly prejudicial THE TRIAL OF RAPE: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam 82 evidence, and to counter the over-reliance on corroborative evidence. Rape myths often invite judgment and skepticism and have historically served to justify unique case treatment evidenced in corroboration requirements, consent and resistance standards, the admissibility of victim character evidence, sexual history of the victim and drawing adverse inference when reporting is delayed. Even when the corroboration requirement has been removed from the law or there has been strict application of sexual history evidence, it remains the case that for no other crime is the credibility of the victim so subject to preconceived notions as in cases of sexual violence. In principle, evidentiary rules should promote evidence-building that focuses on the credibility of the allegation, rather than the credibility of the victim. While a victim\u2019s complaint should be regarded as credible and valid unless the contrary is clearly indicated, in practice, reliable testimony from the victim is often not seen as sufficient to secure a conviction. Rather, many judges look for medical and/or circumstantial evidence for additional proof of injury. In Thailand and Viet Nam, there are no explicit prohibitions against corroborative warning, or using evidence of the victim\u2019s past sexual history or adverse inference if reporting is delayed. However, the study indicates that in Table 14.

They also found that the suspect and/or his family may lobby or bribe police or prosecutors to get the case dropped or have reduced charges laid (e.g. reducing a rape against a child charge to an obscenity charge). It was noted that when the police or prosecutor receives the bribe, they would then pressure the victim and her family to accept the suspect\u2019s offer for compensation so that the matter can be settled outside of the criminal justice system. There were a variety of reasons associated with the practices of these officials, including their perceptions and attitudes towards rape and rape victims.

The study in Viet Nam reported a case from a female academic where a young woman was raped by a police officer whose duty it was to protect her from such a crime. The woman had committed a petty crime and was locked up in a cell, in a helpless position with no one around to intervene when she was raped. The offending police officer was protected by his superior, who proposed a deal: the victim would be allowed to be released and not charged with petty crime if her mother dropped the rape case. Perpetration of sexual violence by police is not an isolated to this case and has also been found in other countries.165 Accountability for service provider action or inaction requires ongoing supervision, management, and evaluation. Failure to do so can result in deferrals, delays, lost files and acquittals, and create situations where although the victim may be interested in proceeding, police are unable to continue or conclude an investigation. Viet Nam and Thailand do not yet have clear directions in place for police regarding mandatory registration of initial incident reports. The need for investigation planning, investigative guidelines, case management processes, and case monitoring and evaluation were not addressed or identified as an issue in any of the interviews with service providers. Several criminal justice system interviewees did, however, comment on shortcomings and gaps in police responses and investigations; ranging from a lack of response, to delayed response, to No or inadequate mechanisms to lodge and follow-up on complaints about poor, slow or inadequate criminal justice services leave a victim feeling helpless and without options for pursuing justice that is owed to her. Attrition alert Failure to implement and utilize mechanisms to address violence and sexual violence by service providers who are responsible for protecting, supporting and assisting victims, increases fear and distrust of the justice system and justice service providers, and increases distrust of and decreases confidence in the system\u2019s \u2013 and indeed the States\u2019 - ability to respond and protect its citizens.

Attrition alert Study Findings: Understanding the Barriers to Justice and Attrition in Sexual Violence Cases 87 inadequate investigation, insufficient protocols with medical and forensic facilities, and a lack of preparation for court. Experiences shared by NGOs and victims also highlighted the need for quality control measures. For example, an NGO representative in Viet Nam relayed an incident where her client repeatedly tried to get police to take her complaint after her 8-year-old child was raped by a neighbour, only to be told by police that she was crazy, that there was no evidence, and that she should stop bothering them as there was no evidence of any crime. The case file review also identified information gaps in police and court records and files. Gaps in both Thai and Vietnamese case files reviewed included: no indication of the age of the victim, whether or not the victim suffered injuries, the victim\u2019s relationship with the suspect, or whether the suspect was interviewed. Institutional capacity and resources A lack of institutional resources can place the onus on the victims, as well as police in some countries, to cover the costs of necessary services, such as forensic examination. Such costs for accessing the system can be prohibitive to the victim. The findings from Thailand showed that forensic costs were not being included in Universal Healthcare Coverage and were thus born by the women. The findings from Viet Nam showed that in order to carry out a DNA test, the investigator in charge of the case must get formal approval from his superior who then decides to send the request to the Institute of Criminal Science of Ministry of Public Security. The investigator then has to pay out-of-pocket for the test expenses (for example, a bone test to determine the age of the victim, or psychiatric examination). Some investigating officers were concerned that if the victim dropped the case, officers would be likely to have to cover the costs. Thus the study found that the red-tape procedures and the reluctant attitude on the part of investigators, due to having to pay for the test in advance and the burden of paperwork for reimbursement, resulted in DNA testing being a rare option among investigators. A female prosecutor commented \u201cSince I began to work in this office in 2004, I never came across a case involving a DNA request. The same happened when I worked in district S.\u201d Thailand\u2019s procedural laws recommend that victims\u2019 statements be taken by a female police officer. Recognizing that it is important to provide victims with an option to speak to a female officer, the reality in both countries is that there are insufficient women in the justice system trained to fulfill receiving and investigation functions. In Thailand, statistically, there are only seven female inquiry officials for the whole of Provincial Police Region 5 (Northern Thailand) and just four in Region 4 (Southern Thailand).166 Police women appear to work in silos and are marginalized within the police structure as they are tasked with singlehandedly dealing with crimes relating to sexual violence.167 Service providers require appropriate organizational structures, workloads, and resources in order to provide appropriate levels of victim- focused responses to sexual violence, or project future requirements for services. Without such foundations, victims are at risk of not receiving the services they need and deserve. Attrition alert Requiring female officers to take statements and investigate cases of sexual violence when there are very limited numbers of female officers available, can result in long waits and poor service for the victim.

One senior female inquiry officer who has \u201cfought her way up the career ladder\u201d stated \u201cI enjoy working with women and girls and feel like I can help them as they are vulnerable. But the structure of the Royal Thai Police does not pay reward to such function. The exam and evaluation judge you from broader skills and general cases you are dealing with; how can female police officers pass the exam and triumph in the evaluation if we are already set to deal with sex-related offenses?\u201d In Viet Nam, where the legal framework does not contain a provision requiring a female police officer to take the statement of sexual violence victims, the study found that there has been attention paid to increasing female police recruits. However, another study raised the concern that many female police recruits were being assigned to office tasks including filing, production of identity cards, vehicle registration, and logistical work instead of field positions, resulting in few female criminal investigators in Viet Nam.168 Although hiring more women will help to ensure women can choose to be interviewed by a female officer, this alone will not increase service effectiveness. The key to effective service provision rests in justice organizations ensuring that police officers, prosecutors, judges and other service providers \u2013 regardless of their gender \u2013 have the training and the competency to work in a sensitive, victim- focused manner with women. Courts in Thailand and Viet Nam are staffed predominately with male judges and court staff who lack training on how to handle sexual violence cases and provide support to victims. This disparity can also contribute to a lack of attention on women\u2019s issues. In Thailand, the Thonburi Criminal Court is a pioneering model offering a range of women-friendly services. These include women-friendly courtroom facilities with a separate partitioned testimony area and a closed circuit TV, so that women can testify without confronting alleged abusers. The court also installed a \u2018witness room\u2019 as a safe waiting area outside the courtroom for women. Guidelines were established for domestic violence cases, which are classified separately from other cases, and all judges and court staff receive training on violence against women and the domestic violence law. Having investigators, prosecutors and judges with limited experience, and limited understanding of the dynamics and complexities of sexual violence providing services, can lead to inadequate service and poor decisions. Attrition alert Directives, standards, policies, and tools must be supported by ongoing professional development for service providers. Without the appropriate knowledge, skills and abilities, services providers will not be able to provide appropriate services for victims of sexual violence. Attrition alert Study Findings: Understanding the Barriers to Justice and Attrition in Sexual Violence Cases 89 Sexual violence investigations and prosecutions are often complex and require service providers who have specialist knowledge, skills and abilities. None of the criminal justice service providers interviewed had received any specialized sexual violence training. Infrastructure Availability and accessibility to police stations, courts and NGOs that provide support services in the major centres was not highlighted as a significant issue by criminal justice system service providers interviewed. In Thailand, the police officer and station assigned to a case is determined by where the victim reported, not necessarily where the victim lives, therefore if this is far from a victim\u2019s home, she must travel each time she is requested to do so, even if this imposes significant cost and burden on her. If accessing police is physically challenging, time consuming, expensive and a good reception and assistance are not likely to be received, victims may not report or continue their journey through the criminal justice system. Attrition alert Biases of and stereotyping by criminal justice personnel on other criminal justice personnel The study highlighted the need to constantly be aware of and challenge any biases of and stereotyping by criminal justice personnel, to ensure that sexual violence does not become exclusively a \u2018woman problem\u2019. In Viet Nam, for example, an interviewee noted \u201cIt would be better to have women investigators but there are too few of them, because it\u2019s hard for women to do \u2018street work\u2019 (i.e., going out to investigate a criminal case), spending long nights.

A male judge commented \u201cFemale judges do it better than male judges. They seem to be more gentle, use better words, especially in cases involving children. They would appear as if in the role of a mother, a sister towards the child victim.\u201d In Thailand, the reverse was heard, where some male judges felt that it would not be proper for young female judges to hear accounts of sexual activities and would be immodest. THE TRIAL OF RAPE: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam 90 There were no specialized sexual violence investigative units identified in either country; however, in Thailand, a Children, Women and Family Protection Center and an Anti-Human Trafficking Center have been established in the Royal Thai Police.169 Thailand is also piloting specialized courts for domestic violence cases, but does not have any courts focusing on sexual violence cases outside the family setting. Despite a few specialized courts, in many regions in both countries, physical facilities, such as the waiting room, or the questioning rooms in Thai courts, are often sub-standard with limited rooms available at the court. Interview respondents also noted that where rooms are available, their arrangements and set-up often fail to take into account the victim\u2019s privacy and discretion. Monitoring and Evaluation Ongoing monitoring and assessment of the impacts of policies and practices on women and men within the organization and persons to whom services are delivered, is key to ensuring that the criminal justice system understands and continues to promote gender- and victim-sensitive practices. A strong evidence base is required to provide States, justice service providers and the public with the needed information to improve policy and programme development and to demonstrate accountability. There were no indications from interviews about how statistics and statistical reports are used by managers and executives to identify emerging trends, service gaps, or to assist in strategic planning and implementation in either country of study, and there were limited publically available statistical records relating to sexual violence investigation and prosecution found in Viet Nam. For example, the statistics from the Unit of Criminal Investigation only covers two types of sexual violence offences: adult rape (article 111 of the Penal Code) and having sex with a child (article 115 of the Penal Code). The statistics were not disaggregated by sex or age or any other characteristics. While the commitment shown by both countries in initiating these studies is commendable, more comprehensive data collection, sharing and analysis, as well as monitoring of responses and outcomes, is still needed to guide more evidence-based policy and practice. A lack of dedicated and specialized investigative units and courts can result in a lack of expertise among criminal justice providers in addressing sexual violence cases in a sensitive and effective manner.

Good practice in Thailand In Thailand, the One Stop Crisis Centre (OSCC) represents an integrated system of government departments working on sexual violence, teenage pregnancy, human trafficking and child labour. Under the umbrella of sexual violence, the Thailand Ministry of Social Development and Human Security is a key agent responsible for operating and overseeing OSCCs nationwide. The OSCCs were established to decrease steps and complications that victims deal with when visiting the hospital. Thus, the creation of OSCCs was aimed at preventing\u2018re-victimization\u2019 of the victim.171 Aside from medical support and treatment, in Thailand, hospital-based OSCCs provide support in the areas of counselling, psychological treatment as well as rehabilitation. They also play a role in training medical staff to understand issues of rape through an integrated approach. The OSCC works with other organizations, such as the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security, as well as emergency homes at provincial and district levels if the victim needs temporary shelter. Currently there are 750 OSCCs nationwide. In 2013, Thailand launched an integrated One Stop Crisis Center (OSCC 1300) with a hotline number 1300, under the responsibility of the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security with collaboration from the Ministry of Health, the Royal Thai Police and the Ministry of Labour. The Khon Kaen hospital received the 2014 United Nations Public Service Award for its One Stop Crisis Centre under the category Promoting gender-responsive delivery of public services. The hospital-based OSCC at Pathumthani hospital is also held as an example of best practice and is recognized for its success in supporting, treating and rehabilitating sexual violence victims. However, the issue of limited budget and insufficient resources to respond to increasing rates of reported cases and the management of OSCC remains a major challenge for its effectiveness in helping victims of sexual violence. These challenges, according to interviewed practitioners, are likely to have negative effects on the confidence of victims, who may not see OSCCs as an effective support mechanism, while many victims are not even aware of the existence of OSCCs.172 170.

The study is intended to support the development and implementation of criminal justice laws, policies, codes, procedures, programmes and practices for countries in the region, and to be particularly relevant for the countries subject to the study, Thailand and Viet Nam. This study is the first comparative study of attrition in reported cases of sexual violence in Asia, and also the first attrition studies in Thailand and Viet Nam. Despite challenges in the implementation of the planned methodology, the study contributes to a better understanding of the policing and prosecution of sexual violence and the impact that the handling of their cases by the criminal justice system has had on the women who have suffered from rape and sexual assault. It is recognized that sexual violence is a highly complex phenomenon, rooted in gender-based discrimination and historical gender inequality that cannot be solved by the criminal justice system alone. A comprehensive, integrated, multisectoral criminal justice response, one that is victim- centered and ensures offender accountability, is an essential component in preventing and addressing the persistent impunity for sexual violence. Sexual violence is a highly complex phenomenon, rooted in gender-based discrimination and historical gender inequality Recommendations THE TRIAL OF RAPE: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam 94 The recommendations outlined in this section are meant to support States in implementing their national and international policy commitments to realizing women\u2019s human rights and ending violence against women, through strengthening States\u2019 capacity to exercise due diligence in the prevention, investigation and prosecution of such violence. The recommendations are aimed at complementing efforts undertaken at the international, regional and national level that provide guidance on responding to sexual violence.

The recommendations are divided into two parts. Firstly, nine broad regional recommendations are set out, based on the main common trends and issues identified across both countries. Secondly, a consideration of entry points for change is included, predominately focused on the criminal justice system. It should be noted that country-specific issues and recommendations are covered in the country reports prepared by the national research teams. Underlying these recommendations must be an ongoing commitment to further research on the topic. Facilitating further research of attrition in justice system responses to sexual violence in the region will improve understanding of the issues, develop an evidence-based foundation for needed changes in policies and programmes, and identify priorities for moving forward. Recommendations 95 Key Findings Examples of programmes and approaches Women and girls faced numerous barriers to reporting sexual violence as well as throughout the progress of their cases. For example, many victims reported being treated with disrespect and insensitivity, victims are required to tell their stories multiple times, reports are refused or are taken but investigation is not conducted or delays, or police encourage meditation and settlement. Critical gaps in the provision of victim-centered justice services were found at all stages of the criminal justice system. Specific quality justice services need to be developed and delivered that address the barriers to victims\u2019 committed participation in the criminal justice process: to overcome victim disengagement; to reduce attrition rates; and to enhance the criminal justice response to sexual violence. \u00a8 Ensure that voices of criminal justice providers, and providers from the disciplines of health, psycho-social support/social welfare, etc., are included in debates about attrition and how services can and should be improved. \u00a8 Promote, develop and establish strategic, comprehensive and coordinated action plans with a range of response agencies to increase awareness of, respond to and prevent sexual violence against women and girls. \u00a8 Identify, promote and build on leading practices. \u00a8 Ensure that justice services are available to every victim regardless of her place of residence, nationality, ethnicity, caste, class, sexual identity, etc. \u00a8 Enhance legal aid programmes and work with lawyers associations to promote availability of legal representation for victims. \u00a8 Establish and implement victim support, protection and safety policies and practices. \u00a8 Develop policies of mandatory recording of any complaint of sexual violence, and place the onus on the police to make and file a report and provide the victim with the police case file number. \u00a8 Develop policies to ensure victims are not deferred or delayed, asked to wait to make a report, or be in any other way impeded in their effort to bring their case to the attention of justice authorities. \u00a8 Develop and implement policies to prioritize response to and investigation of sexual violence complaints that reduce secondary victimization (traumatizing survivors again due to insensitive reporting procedures). \u00a8 Consider pro-arrest and pro-prosecution policies. 1 Establish quality essential justice services for victims that prioritize their safety, protection and support173 173. UN Women and UNFPA, in partnership with UNODC and UNDP, have developed standards and guidelines for the provision of police and justice services for violence against women as part of the Joint Global Programme on Essential Services for Women and Girls who have been Subjected to Violence; and have developed draft Guidelines for Essential Services and Quality Standards for Essential Justice Services to Respond to Violence against Women and Girls. These essential services cover: prevention; initial contact; assessment and investigation; pre- trial processes; trial processes; accountability and reparations; post-trial processes; safety and protection; assistance and support; communication and information and coordination. http://www.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/publications/2015/12/essential-services-package-for-women-and-girls-subject-to-violence THE TRIAL OF RAPE: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam 96 Key Findings Key Findings Examples of programmes and approaches In both countries, women reported experiencing victim-blaming, humiliating treatment, and discrimination by criminal justice service providers.

UN Women (2016) Gender Stereotypes in Laws and Court Decisions in Southeast Asia: A Reference for Justice Actors. Bangkok 175. Ibid. Recommendations 97 Key Findings Examples of programmes and approaches Criminal justice agencies are male-dominated institutions which promote an institutional culture of negative bias and attitudes that infiltrate procedures and practice. Discrimination against the victims/survivors of sexual violence has been found in the investigative and court processes. There were situations where the processes are based on gender stereotypical assumptions even though the formal laws being applied do not contain such discrimination. In such cases, decisions by the police and juridical actors are based on bias gender norms rather than on an unprejudiced consideration of the evidence presented, thus violating the rights of the victims/survivors.178 \u00a8 Facilitate and guide future legal reform, policy making and programming within the region, and sharing of good practices. \u00a8 Ensure legislation is comprehensive and multidisciplinary, criminalizing all forms of violence against women, and encompassing issues of prevention, protection, survivor empowerment and support, as well as adequate punishment of perpetrators and availability of remedies for survivors.176 \u00a8 Codify victims\u2019 rights. Legislation should include the rights of victims in the criminal justice system as well as minimum standards for victims who decide not to participate in or face obstacles in accessing the criminal justice process. This should include specific rights as participants in the criminal justice system, such as the right to receive information, the right to access to justice, and the right to compensation, as well as remedies when any of the rights are violated. \u00a8 Examine the content of laws and policies, rules of evidence and procedure, and jurisprudence or previous court decisions and ascertain whether they contain gender stereotypes.

Recommendations 99 Key Findings Examples of programmes and approaches Criminal justice service providers identified the need for training and specialization in handling sexual violence cases. Thailand has no specialized sexual violence police investigative units, but the Royal Police Cadet Academy started admitting female students in 2009 to increase female police inquiry offers for crimes against women and children, while a Children, Women and Family Protection Center and an Anti-Human Trafficking Center within the Royal Thai Police were set up in 2012. \u00a8 Legislation/subsidiary legislation should ensure the designation or strengthening of specialized police units and specialized prosecutor units focused on sexual violence, and provide adequate funding for their work and specialized training for their staff. \u00a8 Ensure that complainants/survivors have the of option of communicating with female police officers or prosecutors. \u00a8 Provide for the creation of specialized courts or special court proceedings guaranteeing timely and efficient handling of cases. \u00a8 Ensure that officers assigned to specialized courts receive specialized training and that measures are in place to minimize stress and fatigue of such officers. \u00a8 Ensure police are responsible for facilitating access to health services, victim support, safety planning and protection services.181 \u00a8 Provide trained personnel to be available to assist and support the victim in filing her complaints. \u00a8 Facilitate the creation of specialized and multidisciplinary units in relevant criminal justice institutions. \u00a8 Support the development of linkages and relationships, jointly developed protocols, and action plans for coordinated responses, between justice specialists, governments and civil society specialists (e.g. \u2018One stop centres\u2019 or specialized courts). 6 Promote specialized expertise at all stages of the criminal justice system 181. Ibid. THE TRIAL OF RAPE: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam 100 Key Findings In both countries, there were limitations in the quantity and quality of criminal administrative data on sexual violence crimes available to the public and other criminal justice agencies. In both countries, research teams faced challenges in accessing information on how cases are recorded, tracked throughout the system, and closed. This was due to lack of official approval to access all police, prosecution and court records. Additionally, researchers noted inconsistencies in case file record keeping and completion. In both countries, there is a lack of regular and systematic collection of prevalence data on sexual violence (no victimization surveys) and little information on costs and impacts of sexual violence. 8 Develop effective monitoring and evaluation mechanisms Examples of programmes and approaches \u00a8 Establish a coordination mechanism that promotes effective working relationships among the key criminal justice stakeholders and ensures clear information flow and referral pathways. \u00a8 Establish a coordination and clear referral pathways between the justice system and the other essential services for survivors including the health and welfare services.182 \u00a8 Engage and nurture relationships and partnerships with a broad range of stakeholders, including criminal justice institutions, civil society organizations and the private sector, to work collaboratively to identify how and where they can have maximum impact. \u00a8 Make sexual violence investigations a priority and coordinate the investigations with support, legal and health service providers. \u00a8 Adopt an interdisciplinary approach in investigation and adjudication.183 Key Findings The study found that various criminal justice institutions often work in silos with unclear communication protocols or practices and referral pathways among criminal justice agencies or with other non-justice sector agencies, such as health and social welfare agencies.

THE TRIAL OF RAPE: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam 104 Terminology can often differ between countries and languages. This is evident in Thailand, for example, where the term \u2018attrition\u2019 does not exist. For the purpose of this study, global understandings of terms have been used while recognizing their specific and varied applications in the countries of study. Accused describes an individual who has been charged with rape or sexual assault. Acquittal refers to the conclusion of a case at trial where the offender was found not guilty. Attrition is the process by which cases of rape and sexual assault fail to proceed through the criminal justice system; those cases that are discontinued and thus fail to reach trial and/or result in conviction.185 Case refers to any recorded incident of sexual violence irrespective of the outcome or formal designation of initiating criminal proceedings. It is the unit of measure in this study and refers to a reported incident involving sexual violence against a victim that is documented in a single police file. This can include a single offence or a group of related offences. Charges laid refers to formal charges being laid against at least one alleged offender (in other words, the suspect becomes the accused and is being prosecuted). lossary G 185. Definition from Lovett and Kelly (2009) Different systems, Similar Outcomes? Tracking Attrition in Reported Rape Cases Across Europe. Child and Women Abuse Studies Unit, London Metropolitan University. Glossary 105 Civile partie is a Latin term for plaintiff and in civil law traditions refers to situations where the victim has standing as a party in the criminal case. Conviction refers to the conclusion of a case where the offender pleads guilty or was found guilty by the court. Criminal justice system refers to the formal systems that are the responsibility of the State and its agents. They include government support laws, and institutions such as the police, prosecution services, courts, and prisons that have the responsibility to enforce and apply the laws of the State and to administer the sanctions imposed for violations of laws. Discontinuance refers to the interruption or termination of a legal action. Domestic violence is defined differently in each country\u2019s domestic violence legislation but basically includes violence perpetrated by intimate partners and other family members and manifested through physical, sexual, psychological and economic violence. False allegation or false complaint means the alleged victim was charged with or warned in relation to making a false complaint. Forensic evidence or medico-legal evidence uses the definition set out by WHO as \u201cdocumented extra and ano-genital injuries and emotional state as well as those samples and specimens that are taken from the victim\u2019s body or clothing solely for legal purposes. Such evidence includes saliva, seminal fluid, head hair, pubic hair, blood, urine, fibre, debris and soil.\u201d186 The WHO has developed guidelines for medico-legal care for victims of sexual violence.187 No offence or no-crime refers to incidents established as a \u2018false complaint\u2019 or cleared by the police as no offence disclosed. Offender is used in this report irrespective of the outcome of the case, so includes alleged offender, suspect or defendant. This does not imply that all recorded sexual offences have been substantiated. One Stop Centres bring together medical, law enforcement, legal and victim support professionals in one location to provide a full range of care for victims and gather and process the related medico-legal evidence. Opportunistic sampling which is also known as grab or convenience sampling is a type of non-probability sampling which involves the sample being drawn from cases that are selected because they are readily available and convenient. Pre-attrition refers to situations where the victim does not contact police or other authorities and never enters the criminal justice system as a reported", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e6ed4ace-a3a2-4bd6-9041-13445a8565d7": {"__data__": {"id_": "e6ed4ace-a3a2-4bd6-9041-13445a8565d7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Trial of Rape: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a5e2e50da99d6c18e6feb28d4a9ae262039b79863b5b059c36f70d1af3357cef"}, "3": {"node_id": "bcc2f6f3-e210-48e6-b6b9-f57125748e40", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trial-rape-understanding-criminal-justice-system-response-sexual-violence-thailand-and-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ed6b867e420c315b5ff6a6ba5a2e9b9f282eeedb6448d3d5ca25c6a0b23b27d8"}}, "hash": "5880fbb1728d0ad77a61c9dd8226adacda193d06a1706d82c0d46f465ab0c53c", "text": "case. Rape is a subcategory of sexual violence and usually includes the physically forced or otherwise coerced or nonconsensual penetration of the vulva or anus with a penis, other body part, or object, although the legal definition of rape varies from country to country and, in some countries, may also include oral penetration. 186.

THE TRIAL OF RAPE: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam THE TRIAL OF RAPE: Understanding the criminal justice system response to sexual violence in Thailand and Viet Nam 106 Secondary victimization is the victim-blaming attitudes, behaviors, and practices engaged in by community service providers, which results in additional trauma for sexual assault survivors.188 Sexual assault is a subcategory of sexual violence and usually refers to any involuntary sexual act in which a person is threatened, coerced or forced to engage against their will, or any non-consensual sexual touching of a person. The legal definition of sexual assault varies from country to country. Sexual assault crisis centres can be community-based or hospital-based and provide a combination of services, including helpline, advocacy support and counselling. Sexual offence includes rape and other sexual violence that has been criminalized in the two countries, as well as alleged sexual violations. Sexual violence is any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, unwanted sexual comments or advances, or acts to traffic, or otherwise directed against a person\u2019s sexuality, using coercion, by any person, regardless of their relationship to the victim, in any setting, including, but not limited to, home and work.189 Stratified sample is a sample drawn from several separate parts of the population in order that it should be representative. Survivor refers to those women and girls who have experienced sexual violence and sought justice and/or shared their stories. Suspect is the person alleged to have committed rape or sexual assault. Victim is used in this report irrespective of the outcome of the case, so includes complainants. Victim means a person recorded as the victim of sexual offence, including those cases subsequently deemed no offence or false allegations. The term victim is used as this is the common terminology for analysis of criminal justice data and is not intended to negate other terms such as \u2018survivors\u2019. Violence against women is a broad umbrella term, defined by the United Nations as \u201cany act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or mental harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life.\u201d190 It includes many different forms of violence against women and girls, such as intimate partner violence, non-partner sexual violence, trafficking, and harmful practices such as female genital mutilation. 188.

Understanding of what prog- ress means has shifted, driven by unprecedented globalization, climate change and unsustain- able pressures on environmental resources. While poverty rates have declined and social improve- ments have come for 700 million people across Asia and the Pacif- ic over a decade, the region is still home to more than two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor. We can do better and do more. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development gives the world and the Asia and the Pacific region a vision of a new development paradigm, one that carefully balances the three critical elements of our economies, societies and environment. It is an ambitious plan, and realizing it will depend on our ability to keep up with the rate of change in the world today. UNDP has taken up that challenge as a trusted devel- opment partner and service provider to countries across Asia and the Pacific. Innovation is key, and not just as an add-on but as fundamental to the way we work and what we offer the countries we serve. BREAKING THE MOULD UNDP\u2019s innovation journey in Asia and the Pacific has gone far. Our goal was to break the mould, disrupt conventional thinking and imagine the changes we want to see.

Realizing that entry points within existing projects are often key for innovations to take off, we diagnosed existing country programme portfolios, identifying scope for innovation and designing pipelines for projects responding to emerging trends. We devised experiments in promising specializations, such as innovative finance, big data and policy innovation labs. The results so far have been transformative, as this collec- tion of stories on current experiences highlights. There have been many new solutions, many firsts. Over 100 non-traditional partners have joined us. We have garnered regional and interna- tional awards as well as widespread media recognition. THE FUTURE IS NOW The stories on the following pages show how UNDP is support- ing governments in Asia and the Pacific in using innovation to reach people, improve well-being, provide services and mobilize financing as never before. In each case, new thinking has been the starting point, and the definition of innovation has been broad and responsive to circumstances in individual countries. Some solutions draw on cutting-edge technology; others are about behaviour change; some are a mix of both. All are producing advances that collectively cut across the 2030 Agenda and the achievement of its 17 Sustainable Development Goals. pr eface Haoliang Xu Assistant Administrator and Director UNDP Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific (RBAP) 3 an innovation journey Several development organizations are going through challenging times. Not simply because of a shortage of funding but also be- cause they\u2019re struggling to comprehend, engage, design or deliver in a rapidly evolving development landscape. This has led to ques- tions about the relevance and legitimacy of these organizations. While not being a panacea, innovation is often seen as an opportunity to recover lost ground and to become more attuned to and fit to tackle development challenges facing middle-income and low-income countries. UNDP ASIA-PACIFIC AND INNOVATION In Asia and the Pacific, UNDP\u2019s deliberate focus on innovation began three years ago. It may have started out as an add-on, but now it is daily practice, an integral part of UNDP\u2019s work across the region. Our goal is to seek out novel ideas, scale-up innovative solutions that are being piloted and keep driving for new ideas supported by innovative financing. This publication is a testimony to our progress and learning so far, but it is also an indicator of how we can and will deal with future challenges by making innovation the new normal. WHY INNOVATION? While examples of innovative work are extremely diverse, some common lessons and trends have emerged. At UNDP, we have moved from viewing new technologies as a panacea to all social ills to using tech to empower people and overcome inequalities. By channelling innovation, our work demonstrates the impor- tance of focusing on local priorities, relying on local assets and investing in local solutions. This local focus has enabled us to not only overcome the \u2018tyranny of experts\u2019 but also to identify and engage with citizen-innovators. As a result, our role has often changed from solution provider to solution enabler, and has al- lowed us to pay more attention to the complexity of development challenges and be more systematic about scaling up opportuni- ties for locally driven development solutions. This publication also highlights how this approach has brought new partnerships and new understanding associated with those expanded partnerships. We are mapping avenues for new resources and co-designing innovative financing to support new development solutions. Importantly, our work has highlighted the importance of data. While they have undeniable value in monitoring results and mea- suring impact, new data have proven to be an important enabler in terms of engaging and empowering citizens and communities, and fighting gender stereotypes. INNOVATION AND THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS These aspects of innovation are critical to achieving the Sustain- able Development Goals, as the complexity of the challenge to achieve the SDGs will need an extraordinary level of cooperation and collaboration. To cope with disruptive technologies, and to meet growing public needs and demands for better services, we 4 will need funding that goes above and beyond public budgets available in the region, so we can scale up innovative solutions. Only then will we be able to ensure that we can meet the goals and \u2018leave no one behind\u2019. INNOVATION AS THE FUTURE We have observed four key pivots, often complementary, around which UNDP in the Asia and the Pacific region can build its strategy.

While this list may not seem exhaustive, we aim to test and integrate 4IR\u2014Fourth Industrial Revolution\u2014technologies in helping governments and other partners to deliver on SDG commitments. The Regional Innovation Centre we aim to set up in Bangkok will further augment our resources to co-design, test, adapt and scale up new development solutions underpinned by artificial intelligence and other technological innovations in different countries in the region. We also will be looking to build national capacity to deploy and sustain these innovations. As someone mentioned, the closer technologies are to us, the more they are about us. Another exciting feature and priority for us will be to nurture emerging models of distributed expertise reflecting the special- ization of some UNDP country offices in fields like innovative finance and public sector innovation, among others. This model reflects our understanding that for innovations to be sustainable, they should be generated and tested on the frontline where the most development work takes place. People driving them should be empowered to innovate. Finally, to become an organization that is sustainable and innovative, we need to ensure that out new culture embraces the \u2018front office\u2019 (design and implementation by programme teams) as well as the \u2018back office\u2019 (human resources, procurement, etc.). We will continuously be looking at how to identify and bring in new skills, how we can adapt our organizational procedures to iterative approaches in development, and how we engage all players, be they private sector companies, funds, or other entities. Truly exciting development times lie ahead. 5 INNOVATE. CREATE. CHANGE. New ideas that power SDG progress in Asia and The Pacific 6 Among Bangladesh\u2019s 1 million teachers in over 145,000 prima- ry and secondary schools, it took only one to come up with an innovative idea that could permanently improve the quality of teaching\u2014and education for the country\u2019s 30 million students. Afroza Nasreen Sultana, an assistant teacher at Rangpur Dis- trict School, looked at the cost-intensive nature of traditional face-to-face teacher training methods and wondered if there was a better way. Limited infrastructure and resource constraints meant it could take up to six years to update the knowledge and skills of every teacher in the system. Sultana\u2019s solution was relatively simple: create an online platform that would connect teachers in need of guidance and training with talented, high-perform- ing peers. This triggered development of the online Teachers\u2019 Portal, which now links nearly 236,000 primary or secondary school teachers with teacher-educators and mentors accessible seven days a week. Sultana is on the vanguard of a revolution in public ser- vice delivery in Bangladesh, part of a new generation of civil servants reinventing how they think about their jobs. Through training initiated with UNDP support, they are learning that quality services start with considering the needs of us- ers. Instead of rubber-stamping bureaucratic processes, they are empowered to engage with users, innovate, and improve quality and responsiveness. In one district, a junior land officer became a local hero by building a covered waiting area for poor, aged clients, and using automation to make information more readily available, thus cutting chances for corruption. An agricultural extension officer, faced with the constraints of having only 46 field offi- cers to advise 80,000 farmers on plant diseases, developed an online database with over 1,000 pictures of common problems. Farmers can freely consult it whenever they need, often with the assistance of tech-savvy children.

The country as a whole is already on the way. Recently, it moved from low to low-middle income status. Human devel- opment indicators, which reflect income, health and education, are twice the level of what would normally be expected for a nation with Bangladesh\u2019s level of per capita income.

Technology meant the centres could operate with a light footprint, requiring basic computer equipment and an Internet connection to file forms and access information. This made it relatively easy and cost-effective to establish new centres close to where people live. A further innovation was to straddle public and private elements by combining the mandate and infrastructure of the public sector, and the entrepreneurial zeal and efficiency of private individuals. From the start, each centre was run by local entrepreneurs and located within local council offices. The councils covered the rent and equipment. The entrepreneurs paid everyday ex- penses such as utility charges and Internet bills, and generated revenues by providing a mix of free and fee-based services. Free public services included getting digitized land records, birth registrations, passports and applications for other government services. Fee-based private services comprised mobile financial services, insurance and job-related training. Putting the centres in council offices took advantage of the fact that as the lowest tier of the government administra- tion, they are familiar to almost everyone, and spread across the country. But a deliberate choice was made to keep centre operations apart from the existing government bureaucracy. Incentivized by the need to earn revenue, entrepreneurs pro- actively worked to attract and retain service users by offering efficiency and reliability. By 2010, the centres had proven so popular that they went national. Nearly 5,300 now operate in every union council, municipality and city corporation, delivering over 5 million services every month. More than 300 million services have been provided since 2010, while the time to obtain them has fallen by 85 percent. In monetary terms, the centres have saved What\u2019s the big idea?

An emphasis on ongoing innovation means the centres constantly evolve and improve. The introduction of banking at 1,804 of the best-performing centres, for example, gave approximately 1 million \u201cunbanked\u201d people their first access to savings accounts, loans and similar financial services in 2016.

C U L T I VA T I N G A C U L T U R E O F I N N O V A T I O N Bangladesh\u2019s national Access to Information Programme, or a2i, has propelled the expansion of the Digital Centres, and embodies the Government\u2019s commitment to innovation in public services. Situated in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, the programme encourages a whole-of-government approach, call- ing on all public organizations to join a digital transformation. Common web portals now provide comprehensive information on 400 public services. More than 25,000 websites of various local and national government entities are connected through a national portal that generates over 90 million hits per month. While some ministries were initially reluctant to digitize service delivery, the broad popularity of the Digital Centres has boosted the number of public e-services from only a hand- ful in 2010 to over 100 in 2017, with potentially hundreds more in the pipeline. Further support comes from regular updates in laws and policies. The ame ment of the ICT Act, for example, encouraged government ministries and agencies to incorporate the latest technology for communication and improved management of government records. All of these drivers of change and innovation will only go so far without making an equal investment in the people who will carry them forward. Towards that end, around 409,000 service providers have been trained to implement new digital services, while several thousand in key positions have gone through specialized courses designed around leading global practices built on the power of human empathy. Government officers now anonymously visit service points to stand in \u2018cit- izens\u2019 shoes\u2019.

Local demands and urgent priorities are many and multiply all the time\u2014clean streets, air quality, better livelihoods, business development, safety\u2014the list is long. It can be hard to take time to understand the merits of linking local plans and actions to the global goals. Yet sus- tainable development is where the future of the world lies, in its careful balancing of people and the planet. Success greatly depends on China, home to a fifth of the world\u2019s population. Progress rests significantly on local officials taking sustainable approaches to providing local services, managing local econo- mies, and caring for natural resources important to livelihoods and the quality of local life. Towards \u2018localizing\u2019 the SDGs, UNDP came up with an innovative plan. If local authorities are not yet familiar with the SDGs, the goals could come to them, in ways that are relevant and make practical contributions to solving local development concerns. T H E S T A R T I N G P O I N T: L O C A L P R I O R I T I E S As a longstanding international partner in China, UNDP has provided important support to implementing past global agendas through collaboration with national institutions. Demand for that expertise is now shifting to other arenas, including some regions, where capacities and knowledge may be unevenly dis- tributed. Further, since different regions face sometimes widely varying development issues, they need to tailor sustainable development strategies to their distinctive needs. UNDP has worked with the Government to devise a pilot China GOING LOCAL WITH GLOBAL GOALS UNDP experts and public servants in Qinghai Province take part in training on how to use the SDGs to orient local development planning around sustainability. 10 model for localizing the SDGs, now being tested in 8 provinces covering 40 counties, and has partnered with a number of top Chinese universities to fine-tune it. The model is rooted in a core idea behind the goals\u2014that countries including China have agreed on common objectives, but the ways of achieving those are many. The point is to move in the right directions, acting across the social, economic and environmental di- mensions of sustainable development, and using the most appropriate local means. The SDG localization model diverges from some past practices. It involves exploration and mutual learning, not a set of prescriptions. It starts with local officials performing a careful assessment of their challenges and hopes for the future. This then shapes customized training for local public servants on how they can use the SDGs to strengthen local development planning, including by orienting it around sustainability. Since officials typically work within separate departments, the sessions often provide a first opportunity for them to come together around sustainable development as an overarching vision, and to understand how different people can work to- gether and accelerate progress. Q U A L I T Y A N D I N C L U S I O N The Wulong district of Chongqing Municipality in south-west China was among the first local governments to try the SDG localization model. District authorities have struggled to find a way to boost economic development in a mountainous region where poverty rates are persistently high. New ideas are needed. UNDP experts worked closely with local authorities to first assess key challenges. Surveying local resources, it was clear that good forest coverage, scenic vistas and limited pollution would lend themselves to developing eco-tourism, which could also become a source of jobs for local people with otherwise limited livelihood options. Designed carefully, the process could minimize environmental impacts. In the training that followed the assessment, local author- ities discussed SDGs on ending poverty, decent work, and sustainable consumption and production, and how these issues relate to each other and might be addressed", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c2062dc-5ea3-4796-bf2a-26064b010fed": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c2062dc-5ea3-4796-bf2a-26064b010fed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovate-create-change-partnership-series-3", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Innovate.

Lili Xie, the District\u2019s Development and Reform Com- mission Director, describes the training as \u201clinked to the most pressing and challenging issues Wulong is facing, providing very good guidance as we work on locally implementing the Five-Year Plan and promote sustainable development.\u201d Subsequently, the district requested\u2014and financed\u2014a full report on introducing all of the SDGs in local planning as well as the district\u2019s current status on each goal. A process is now underway of integrating these findings in local planning, such as through establishing village ecotourism pilots, and managing local forest, land and water resources to strength prospects for ecotourism. I N T E G R A T I N G T H E I S S U E S The city of Deyang is located in Sichuan Province. It too has piloted the SDG localization model to address its own very different issues. A long legacy of manufacturing heavy equip- ment has left it with higher levels of income but also intensive pollution. The aftermath of a devastating earthquake in 2008 required significant reconstruction. Traditionally, the city has taken on issues such as eco- nomic growth, cleaner industry, better quality of life and environmental renewal piece by piece. Through the SDG localization assessment and follow-up dialogue with local officials, awareness grew of how local resources might be more effectively used through closer coordination and integration of different initiatives. Local officials are now considering developing a for- ward-looking strategy acting on several SDG aims, such as sustainable and inclusive industrialization, and low-carbon development. Plans are under discussion, for example, to develop industry to produce goods required for emergency preparedness and response. This would build on local disaster recovery experiences as well as the manufacturing tradition, but as a relatively clean business. The industry would create jobs, and could be accompanied by measures to educate local people on emergency preparedness, given that Deyang remains vulnerable to earthquakes. A N A T I O N A L C O M M I T M E N T T O I N N O VA T I O N I N S D G I M P L E M E N T A T I O N The SDG localization model complements China\u2019s SDG Inno- vative Pilot Zone initiative, the first overarching national move towards SDG implementation. Ten pilot zones, comprising clusters of cities within provinces, are expected by 2020. Before SDG training begins, a pre-assessment process explores local development conditions. Across 10 pilot SDG zones, comprising clusters of cities, city managers will innovate and scale up proven strategies. 12 Jiangsu Province has taken a lead in setting up a man- agement centre to oversee all SDG work, and is developing legislation to smooth SDG implementation by reducing bu- reaucracy and improving government responsiveness. Across the 10 zones, managers in each city will be encour- aged to innovate and scale up proven strategies. A national expert committee guides the initiative. UNDP serves on it as the only participating international organization, and also acts as an advisor to Jiangsu Province as well as to two other pilot zones, Guangxi Province and the city of Shenzhen. As the process moves ahead, UNDP will systematically share expertise and highlight new possibilities for localizing the SDGs, such as the use of big data as a complementary poverty measurement tool. Many other opportunities for in- novation lie ahead, through technology as well as through the commitment of local officials to adopting new development concepts and tools.

Their chance to survive and thrive depends heavily on vaccination against illness, death or life- long disability. It\u2019s a mammoth task. Immunizing all newborns plus 126 million children under five and 30 million pregnant women who also need protection requires 650 million doses of vaccines annually. These must flow through 27,000 distribution points before they are used in 9 million vaccination sessions. They must cover India\u2019s diverse terrain, reaching mountains, deserts and remote islands, among other places. They travel through a supply chain involving planes, trains, buses, motorbikes and people on foot. Keeping track of the world\u2019s largest immunization pro- gramme used to happen on paper. Inevitably, health-care staff did not always know where vaccines were. Or if there were enough vaccines. Or if vaccines had been reliably stored at temperatures that keep them viable. It was a problem tailor-made for technological innova- tion\u2014and in 2015, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, supported by UNDP, began to roll one out: the Electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network, eVIN for short. It is making health care more efficient and better in quality, protecting the futures of millions of women and children. T R A C K I N G A T E V E R Y L E V E L UNDP, with a significant grant from Gavi, the Vaccine Alli- ance, and with support from the Government of India, brought to the project its experience as one of the world\u2019s largest pro- curers of health commodities and its expertise in the supply chains essential to distribution. For vaccines to reach and protect children, they must move through a cold chain that starts where vaccines are produced and extends all the way to the final shot in a child\u2019s arm. At each point, people who The sound management of vaccines protects the health and lives of tens of millions of children in India, like this child at an immunization session in Dibrugarh, Assam. 14 manage the cold chain have to know not only where vaccines are, but also if they have been stored at the right temperatures to prevent spoilage. The eVIN system, for the first time, makes it possible for managers in India to see and monitor the cold chain as a whole. It does this by equipping all vaccine and cold chain managers with smartphones and an app that feeds real-time data into a cloud-based server linked to a web interface. After every vaccination session, for example, updates on vaccine supplies and usage rates are immediately accessible for review by pro- gramme managers even if they are located far away from the vaccination site. Other data feed in from temperature loggers that monitor stored vaccines. If a risk arises, such as from a power cut, the loggers immediately send an SMS to managers, who can take quick action to protect the vaccines. Dr. Pradeep Haldar, the Deputy Commissioner (Im- munization) in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, remembers how the manual system could only generate a picture of vaccine use and storage at the state level, with lim- ited information of what was happening in districts and local communities. Today, he says, eVIN means seeing the entire picture. \u201cIt is the state level, the district level, the block level, the primary health centre level and every cold chain point that the state has.\u201d eVIN has now reached all 371 districts in 12 states that have 60 percent of Indian children under age two and have traditionally struggled with some of the biggest gaps in immu- nization. Nearly 10,500 vaccine stores and cold chain points have adopted digitized vaccine inventories and record-keeping. Each month, they log over 2 million vaccine transactions on eVIN, along with 80 million temperature samples. With the cost of rolling out eVIN at less than 2 percent of the funds India spends on procuring vaccines, the return on investment is already obvious. Vaccine availability has pushed past 95 percent, from 80 percent. Stockouts have fallen by 70 percent, while the average time to replenish supplies has shrunk to two days from five. E M P O W E R I N G P E O P L E T O S T R E N G T H E N S Y S T E M S If eVIN has been innovative in introducing new technology, its success also rests on emphasizing two other critical ingredients: people and processes.

REDUCED INEQUALITIES GOOD HEALTH AND WELL-BEING Nearly 10,500 vaccine stores and cold chain points each month log over 2 million vaccine transactions on eVIN. 15 efforts are thousands of cold chain handlers. Even the best technology would fall flat without getting them on board. Before the eVIN roll-out began, UNDP helped states assess their preparedness through surveying cold chain net- works, and elaborating details on personnel and processes. This provided the basis for training that has accompanied each stage of introducing the new system. More than 17,000 government staff, including vaccine store keepers, data entry operators and cold chain handlers, have taken part. State immunization systems were further strengthened by deploying vaccine and cold chain managers in all districts. They helped in estimating vaccine requirements, supervising cold chain handlers and coordinating with cold chain tech- nicians. Specialized assistance guided the introduction of the Rotavirus vaccine and the reallocation of cold chain equipment to meet new requirements. Dr. Nandini Pathak, a district immunization officer from the state of Madhya Pradesh, points out that 50 percent of cold chain handlers are above the age of 50. Many had never used a smartphone before. Training coupled with the app\u2019s simplicity have been critical, allowing nearly 100 percent compliance with entry recording. \u201cWhen I first got the smartphone, I was wondering if I would be able to do it. I was very nervous,\u201d recalls Jesamma John, a cold chain handler at in the state of Rajasthan. \u201cBut I got the confidence. Now we know the vaccine condition even while sitting at home. If the alarm goes, we can call staff to go and check the condition.\u201d T R A N S F O R M I N G S E R V I C E D E L I V E R Y Initially, financing from Gavi helped catalyse development of eVIN, but financing is now embedded in the health budgets of state governments, a clear endorsement of the system\u2019s success. Other recognition has come through regional and na- tional awards. eVIN won the prestigious GSMA Asia Mobile Award 2017 for an Outstanding Mobile Contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals. In India, eVIN was selected as one of the best practices in health at the National Summit on Good, Replicable and Innovative Practices by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Interest in the system has taken off in other countries as well. Delegations from five countries\u2014Bangladesh, Indonesia, Nepal, the Philippines and Thailand\u2014came to India this year to learn about eVIN and how they might set up similar systems. Within India, the Ministry of Health will soon begin rolling the system out across the entire country, covering all 36 states and union territories. Its potential in ensuring the safe and predictable supply of vaccines has been proven. As important, through the systematic collection and open sharing of data, eVIN has brought about an unprecedented level of transparency and accountability for providing health care. On eVIN smartphones and computer screens, and among the people who use them, a transformation in service delivery has begun. Reaching every child with vaccines, always an essential commitment to human life and well-being, is now also a measurable achievement. At the district vaccine store in Bahraich, Uttar Pradesh, cold chain handler Ramesh Kumar Kanojia uses an app to track the supply of vaccines to different villages. 16 Living in the arid hills of the island of Sumba\u2014in one of poorest parts of Indonesia\u2014Ibu Veronica used to walk 12 kilometres every day to the well closest to her village. The five litres of water she could collect and carry home were not enough for cooking, let alone for washing. So her life changed significantly for the better when a solar-powered pump came to her village. In a community with no electrical or other sources of power, the pump provides a steady and readily available supply of clean water. \u201cWe have enough water to shower every day, cook and grow vegetables, and I don\u2019t have to walk a long way to fetch it,\u201d Veronica says.

Only 40 percent of households have safe access to water there, even as the area depends heavily on agriculture and is increasingly vulnerable to drought and other markers of climate change. All of these elements drive and sustain high poverty rates. UNDP works with the Government of Indonesia, with funding from the Global Environment Facility, to help vul- nerable communities across East Nusa Tenggara improve water supplies. Need is great and resources are limited, however. So, while encouraging the use of traditional channels, such as expanded public budgets for water services and additional infrastructure financing through a state-owned regional bank, UNDP has also collaborated with a variety of partners to explore new funding options offered by technology. One of the most recently built wells, in the village of Napu, was not paid for by international donors or public money, but through the generosity of ordinary Indonesians mobilized by a crowd- funding campaign. Indonesia HARNESSING TECHNOLOGY AND TRADITION TO FILL FINANCING GAPS Children clean up using water from a pump installed in their village. Among other benefits, it means they go to school instead of being sent long distances to fetch water. Crowdfunding has expanded resources for essential development projects like this. 17 H E L P I N G E A C H O T H E R Close to the heart of many Indonesians is the traditional notion of gotong royong or helping each other. Traditionally, it meant members of a community gathering to accomplish a task, such as fixing a neighbour\u2019s home or building a bridge. Rapid urbanization has left many of these activities behind, but the spirit of gotong royong remains. Amid growing prosperity, there are more opportunities to act on this principle, while technology can easily bring together those who have and want to give with those who are in need. For the Napu well, UNDP drew together diverse partners to launch its first crowdfunding campaign in Asia and the Pa- cific, #BringWater4Life. Actor Reza Rahadian and jazz singer Eva Celia championed the cause. A local NGO, Koppesda, was charged with construction. An online appeal went out across social media and at kitabisa.com, a website dedicated to online funding for social causes. The campaign told a compelling, heartfelt story, asking people to image walking barefoot for hours over treacherous terrain for a glass of water. It appealed for just $10 to break the cycle of poverty and offer a better future for the people of Napu. Within two months, 398 people responded, exceeding the fundraising target by providing $26,000 for the new well. \u201cWe were able to influence people to be aware of this issue. And there is a sense of ownership and solidarity that is shared by everyone involved,\u201d says Rahadian. A second crowdfunding campaign in mid-2017 raised funds from 216 donors to protect the iconic\u2014and highly endangered\u2014Sumatran tiger. In the works is a crowdfunding microsite hosted by kitabisa.com that will field ongoing calls for support related to achieving the Sustainable De- velopment Goals.

Some prospects with strong possibilities are already advancing. In the district of Musi Banyuasin, for example, a sovereign wealth fund is being established to collect revenues from extractive industries to support sustainable development. An arena with significant potential is social finance, which involves investing in enterprises that produce social and en- vironmental benefits as well as profits. A recent impact and investment event organized with the Indonesian financial reg- ulator and supported by Angel Investment Network Indonesia (ANGIN) and UNDP drew more than 200 participants who exchanged ideas and information on emerging trends. A related collaboration between UNDP, Pulse Lab Jakarta and ANGIN has trained teams of young entrepreneurs to pitch their ideas on sustainable cities to government representatives and social impact investors. One team has already won seed funding for an app that enables people with disabilities to find public facilities, based on maps generated through crowdsourcing data. With ANGIN, UNDP is also a partner in CONNEC- TOR.ID, which links social enterprises to capital from a range of sources such as banks, venture capital firms, angel investors, foundations or crowdfunding sites. A blended fund for investing in social businesses in agriculture, for instance, is a resource for enterprises that are too big for microloans but not developed enough to access loans from banks. In parallel, the enterprises are helped with developing skills to manage the financial and technical aspects of their business so that over time, they can prepare for other sources of finance. A N E W T A K E O N T R A D I T I O N As frontiers for finance continue to open, UNDP is working with its partners to advance a new take on some traditional sources, such as zakat, the mandatory giving to the poor and destitute that is one of the five pillars of Islam. Each year, across the Muslim world, zakat adds up to as much as $1 trillion. With Indonesia the largest Muslim-majority country, zakat could become a powerful form of wealth transfer to people left out of development. The National Board of Zakat or BAZNAS, responsible for the disbursement of formal zakat contributions, has teamed up with UNDP to see how it can back achievement of the SDGs. New solar-powered water wells are built in poor communities by appealing to the traditional notion of gotong royong or helping each other. A blended fund for investing in social businesses in agriculture is a resource for enterprises that are too big for microloans but not developed enough to access loans from banks. 19 An initial contribution of $350,000 has already gone towards a micro-hydro power plant in Jambi province, improving access to electricity in an area with a large deficit. The partnership also aims to encourage giving in part by putting collecting institutions under the supervision of the national financial services authority and thus increasing their credibility. Technological advances such as online banking and mobile money are making it increasingly easy for people to contribute and distribute zakat. Planned rollouts of innovative Islamic finance instruments include exploring a virtual trust fund facility to direct global Islamic funding into SDG measures, and a platform for social loans and crowdfunding. The high ambitions of the SDGs are achievable, and the sources of finance are there, with the right instruments and incentives to channel new resources to the goals. As singer Eva Celia commented at the close of the Napu crowdfunding campaign, \u201cI hope this is just the first out of hundreds of other steps we can take for positive change in Indonesia. This is our home and we have to make the best of it.\u201d Young entrepreneurs are learning to pitch ideas to social impact investors. 20 For a poor and rural woman in Myanmar, isolation can be a lifelong disadvantage\u2014even a danger. It often means not having the knowledge and skills to improve livelihoods and escape poverty. Or suffering domestic abuse without realizing that help is available. This has been a perennial problem, for generations. But now a solution is at hand. It\u2019s as simple as an inexpensive mobile phone and an app, designed by rural women, for rural women. Cellular signals jump across distances and surmount isolation and information gaps in ways never possible before. More than a decade ago, Daw Cho Aye, a small betel nut grower in Mon State, joined one of a number of village self- help group supported by UNDP.

Nor did she shy away from a leap into the world of tech- nology in 2015, when she and other self-help group members were asked to help develop the app. Called iWomen Inspiring Women, it connects rural women across Myanmar to higher levels of knowledge, self-confidence and leadership skills. \u201cThe app (lets us) express ourselves, pursue our ambitions, learn and share with others what we have learned,\u201d Daw Cho Aye says. \u201cOur vision is to build a national network that receives the recognition of the whole country and that can be relied upon by the community.\u201d Says Nin Sar, one of thousands of new and avid users: \u201cAs long as iWomen is with us, we do not need to be scared.

Myanmar FOR RURAL WOMEN, AN APP AND AN AIM FOR EMPOWERMENT Rural women have become the main drivers and users of an app that helps overcome some of the disadvantages of poor, remote locations. They build confidence, connect with other women, and find information to protect themselves and improve their livelihoods. 21 H U M A N - C E N T R E D D E S I G N Just a few short years ago, a mobile phone in Myanmar cost $1,000 or more, explaining why only a tiny 1.5 percent of people had one. But costs plummeted quickly and usage soared, to over 60 percent of the population by 2016. Even people in rural areas now have access to a dynamic world of information through mobile technology. As a longstanding supporter of rural women in Myanmar, UNDP has partnered with the May Doe Kabar National Net- work of Rural Women to implement a series of programmes to back their leadership in communities, empower them through legal awareness and stop the scourge of gender-based violence. The network links 22,000 women members of 2,000 local self- help groups, now present across eight states. Leaders of the groups are often on the forefront of pushing against traditional gender boundaries and norms, despite resis- tance in families and communities. Many have said that one of their biggest sources of inspiration and motivation to keep going has been meeting with women facing the same issues in other places. But physical meetings occur only so often and involve only a few women at a time. Broader and more regular links required technology\u2014and innovation. Enter the iWomen Inspiring Women app, the brainchild of a group of tech women in Myanmar, rural women members of the May Doe Kabar network and passionate UNDP innovators. The beta version of the app rolled out in 2015, developed through a human-centred design process strongly rooted in engagement with end users. During an intensive testing period, the app went through four rounds of review by rural women users, helping make it fast and intuitive to use. Testers rated the functions they liked or did not, developed an app motto, suggested content and added audio messages to include women who are not literate. App functions, named by the testers, include \u201cBe In- spired,\u201d with stories from women in Myanmar and abroad, \u201cBe Knowledgeable,\u201d with useful resources, \u201cBe Together,\u201d with a locator for other women\u2019s groups, and \u201cSister Apps,\u201d with a comprehensive list of Myanmar language apps, including news streams from all major national media. The \u201cTalk Together\u201d feature allows users to interact and exchange questions and answers. A monthly theme takes up topics such as ending violence and managing money wisely\u2014a predictable feature that encourages users to regularly check in for new and useful information.

They included the BBC \u201cYoung Bright Stars\u201d Radio Programme, which attracts 8 million listeners with weekly stories of inspiration of people below the age of 30, and the Mizzima News TV Programme, which produces features on women leaders. Collaboration among Myanmar cartoonists, award-winning Facebook sticker designers and rural women leaders produced a cartoon series and set of stickers with em- powering messages. Part of the rollout also centred on helping women gain skills to use the app, particularly those who had never oper- ated a smart phone. The iWomen app team, a series of young volunteers and a set of experienced rural women fanned out across communities to offer over 200 training sessions to nearly 5,000 women in eight states. Some problems arose along the way, but the iWomen team tackled these creatively. To address the lack of connectivity and equipment in some areas, particularly poorer ones, app content can be downloaded and read offline, where it can also be shared by multiple users. A free iWomen hotline provides technical assistance. And to lower barriers to obtaining phones, an agreement has been struck with a phone retailer to offer discounted devices to May Doe Kabar members, along with an optional monthly payment plan. In 2015, its first year, the app attracted 800 initial users. Rapid take-off meant that by 2017, over 9,000 people were tapping into it. The eventual goal is to link 10,000 members of the May Doe Kabar network as well as the wider pool of rural women at large. T E C H N O L O G Y I S I N O U R H A N D S Before reaching its current form, the app passed through 10 iterations, but new uses are still constantly evolving. At the end of 2016, during the international 16 Days of Activism to End Violence against Women, for example, iWomen ran a survey asking users about domestic violence\u2014an issue where data often don\u2019t exist. The survey was intended as a pilot for future data-gathering exercises on issues central to gender equality. In response, over 1,000 women shared stories on gen- der-based violence. The Myanmar Department of Social Welfare is now using what they said about the frequency of violence and its most common forms to shape a Prevention and Protection of Violence Against Women Bill and related policy measures, and as a basis for working with other ministries to encourage them to take the diverse measures required to stop and respond to violence. \u201cWe have technology in our hands now,\u201d exults Daw Nyo Nyo San, a user who lives in Shan State. A widowed mother of three, she farms for a living, but women\u2019s leadership has become her passion. Her biggest dream is to continue seeking out technologies for rural women\u2019s development. \u201cWe know how to establish networks for support,\u201d she says. \u201cAs rural women, we help each other work for a brighter future.\u201d Intensive testing of the app involved four rounds of review by rural women users. 23 Nepal FROM BRICKS TO APPS, LOCAL CREATIVITY MITIGATES THE COSTS OF CRISIS The earth moved, violently, and in seconds, nearly a million homes were damaged or destroyed. Centuries old buildings made of wood crumbled. Clouds of dust hung over mounds of debris. For those who survived the 2015 earthquake, the aftermath was one of trauma and a struggle to survive. At first, those with no homes found shelter only in makeshift tents or by huddling under tarps as rains came pouring down. It took eight months before Sunita Rumba could return to her village after being displaced to the outskirts of Kath- mandu. Every home in her community had been damaged or destroyed. Her own, tilted on a severe angle, was unsafe. She and her family initially lived in a tin shed. So it was with great relief that she joined a UNDP-sup- ported programme training people on making a new kind of earthquake-resistant bricks to rebuild their homes. It was an opportunity not only to regain her own home, but also to earn an income from selling the bricks while contributing to a safer community. \u201cAt a time when the earthquake had destroyed everything and our economic condition was deteriorating, this programme meant we were able to establish ourselves as entrepreneurs,\u201d she says. \u201cAll of us have to rebuild our homes. Now they can be earthquake resistant and also affordable.\u201d The bricks are made from stone", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ccf040c-b70d-4c8b-a311-04a7ecbf9ef7": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ccf040c-b70d-4c8b-a311-04a7ecbf9ef7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovate-create-change-partnership-series-3", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Innovate.

Steel rods held in place by cement paste run through the centres. Houses built from them have a much lower chance of falling or cracking if another earthquake strikes. Training has equipped masons with skills for earthquake-resistant construction that draws mainly on local materials. 24 B U I L D I N G F O R R E S I L I E N C E Nepal is situated in one of the most seismically active regions of the world. But this is just one of the factors that make its people vulnerable to crisis. Poverty rates are high, and the moun- tainous terrain hinders travel and communication, access to services and economic opportunities. A disaster like the 2015 quake leaves many people with few or no resources to cope. The quake was a tragedy and, as the worst of its kind in several generations, a wakeup call to build differently so that people and their dwellings will be more resilient to risks. A home that collapses may not just kill or injure its residents, but set off a long chain of events that can include loss of education and livelihoods, vulnerability to gender-based violence, food insecurity, the destruction of bonds that sustain communities and so on. The effects can extend across generations, fuelling development deficits even beyond the immediate costs of recov- ery, and putting national aspirations to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals out of reach. Nepal cannot yet afford the costly, high-tech engineering that protects against earthquakes in some parts of the world. But it does have local innovations\u2014and a national commit- ment to applying them to safeguard and accelerate its develop- ment. In the recovery from the earthquake, UNDP has worked with national engineers and experts on a series of techniques, like the interlocking bricks, that are safer, use local materials and help preserve local environmental resources. Several of these innovations now feature in the national catalogue of officially tested and endorsed construction tech- niques. Besides the interlocking bricks, they include the random rubble technique, which uses stones and mud supported on both sides by galvanized iron wires and mesh. The technique is low What\u2019s the big idea?

SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND COMMUNITIES LIFE ON LAND A man observes a model of an earthquake-resistant house at a mobile exhibition to raise awareness on safer reconstruction techniques. 25 in cost, since the stones and mud can readily be found in rural areas, and the wires are easy to transport over long distances. It avoids the traditional reliance on wood from forests that are already under severe pressure from overuse. Another technique involves compacting broken bricks and rubble with soil, sand and cement. This recycles what would otherwise be waste materials, and achieves a level of strength comparable to normal bricks. So-called debris blocks can then be used for construction resilient to quakes through vertical and horizontal supports such as rebar or galvanized wire. Adopting new building techniques depends partly on availability and affordability, with both considerations an integral part of innovations supported by UNDP. Uptake also advances through supportive building codes that require people to make construction safer. Three municipalities are implementing an electronic build- ing permit system, known as e-BPS, with plans in place for wider replication. Building permits are filed and monitored on the web, where a system checks compliance with building codes and by-laws. It rejects applications that do not comply, reducing the chances of human error and manipulation. The system allows quick access to data on applications per ward, types of buildings, the status of buildings and so on, infor- mation essential to ongoing efforts to mitigate and prepare for earthquakes and other risks.

Initial collaboration with the Microsoft Innovations Cen- ter in Nepal centred on a plan for engineers to conduct safety assessments by carrying laptops, GPS devices, cameras and an internet dongle. All of this equipment would have been costly, at around $2,000, and hard to lug to remote locations across difficult terrain. Drilling deeper, working around the clock in a marathon three-day session, a team of innovators came up with a better solution: an app that could run on cheap, easy-to-carry mobile phones. The app taps into the phones\u2019 GPS capabilities, which allowed engineers to take precise coordinates for each building. They recorded property owner details and phone numbers, took pictures of the damage, and, where necessary, secured signed authorizations for demolition. Other functions included calcula- tions of the volume of debris and the time removal would take, as well as the identification of hazards such as medical or biological waste. This information guided the order and sequence of the work, and any necessary protections. All data were stored in the cloud, making them secure and readily accessible among field staff as well as those overseeing the entire recovery effort in Kathmandu. Within months of the quake, over 2,000 safe demolitions had been conducted, and $11 million worth of recyclable materials reclaimed. Further, the demolition app helped people regain their livelihoods by managing nearly 800 community members enrolled in a cash-for-work initiative to clear communities of debris. Each worker was given a card with a barcode, which engineers scanned to track attendance and earnings. Data were uploaded through the app, facilitating timely electronic payment transfers. As important as these accomplishments were, the app has even greater potential. It could transform practices in disaster response, offering an unprecedented quantity of readily accessible data to inform recovery as well as the shift to long-term reconstruction. It could also be a major step towards moving beyond the rudimentary, often paper-based record-keeping systems still prevalent in poorer countries like Nepal. A similar approach could be used for census data, property records, and many other issues. More accurate and transparent records would protect the rights of individuals, and guide strategic development choices propel- ling the significant advances demanded in the era of the SDGs. Through an app developed with Microsoft, over 2,000 safe demolitions took place within months of the quake. 26 All it took was a single anonymous SMS text to 16321. Soon investigators from the Internal Audit and Compliance Di- vision of Papua New Guinea\u2019s Department of Finance were probing allegations of illegal payments, misappropriation of funds and official misconduct. Their diligent pursuit uncovered transgressions by district treasury and administration officials. An arrest followed, and the case is now in court. No one will ever know who sent the text. But without it, the case might never have come to light. Since 2014, over 30,000 such texts have been sent from nearly 5,000 users. Most are likely staff within the Department of Finance concerned about corruption and the abuse of power. In the past, they might have dropped a note in a complaints box or looked for a receptive authority, two methods that can work. But these are also inefficient and come with the risk of exposure, reducing the likelihood people will use them. Technology, however, offers a better way. Through Phones against Corruption, the complaints process is as easy as send- ing a confidential text message from a mobile phone. Anyone with a concern can express it, wherever they are, and without repercussions. Says Secretary of Finance Dr. Ken Ngangan, \u201cWe are accountable for public money going to the different sectors, provinces and districts, and this initiative will help us\u2026min- imize the risk of corruption.

Since 2014, over 30,000 texts flagging concerns about corruption have been sent from nearly 5,000 users. 27 O V E R C O M I N G A B A R R I E R T O D E V E L O P M E N T Corruption has been a steep barrier to development in Papua New Guinea, draining off resources that people need for health, education, infrastructure and other", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "77b9d76b-9b4d-455b-a616-8e25ddfe1142": {"__data__": {"id_": "77b9d76b-9b4d-455b-a616-8e25ddfe1142", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovate-create-change-partnership-series-3", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Innovate.

Among the 175 countries on Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Index, Papua New Guinea ranks 144th. The need to curb corrupt practices has long been clear; how to do so has been more complicated. UNDP has worked closely with national partners in supporting the reform of public financial management. The adoption of integrated financial management has put greater controls in place towards improved accountability. Phones against Corruption complements these broader strategies by engaging the thousands of civil servants who steward public re- sources each day and may be the first to catch suspect practices. As a staff member of the Internal Audit and Compliance Division in the Department of Finance noted: \u201cPeople like po- lice, Ombudsman\u2019s Commission, auditors, Auditors General, we are looking at the same fellow here...the same giant. How are we going to tackle this fellow? Phones against Corruption is another way\u2026of fighting the big giant.\u201d Reporting corruption by text message is a simple but effective solution in a country where more than 40 percent of people have a mobile phone, but broadband access is still fairly limited. No Internet access is required, nor is it necessary to download an app. SMS costs are prepaid, and phone numbers are encrypted so they remain anonymous. Even the most basic mobile phone will do as a device. Users can select either TokPisin, a widely spoken language, or English. Once a text message is sent, a series of questions prompt users to report where and when the case occurred, if financial resources are involved and a brief description. The exchange ends with feedback on reporting and case prog- ress\u2014crucial to building trust among users that reports are taken seriously. W H I S T L E B L O W E R S M A K E A D I F F E R E N C E Phones against Corruption began as a pilot among 1,400 staff in the Ministry of Finance. It was part of a push for innova- tive ideas to tackle corruption in the disbursement of funds to subnational governments for implementing the Services Improvement Programme. In the roll-out of the initiative, workshops, live demonstrations, and regular emails and news- letters encouraged people to use the system. As early adopters saw that reports were being scrutinized and acted on, confidentially, word spread. An independent survey confirmed that 90 percent of users were willing to use the system again; 76 percent were confident that action would be taken by authorities. Almost 90 percent of reports have What\u2019s the big idea?

REDUCED INEQUALITIES PEACE, JUSTICE AND STRONG INSTITUTIONS 28 come from provincial areas, where corruption may be more pervasive due to a perception that it is harder to get caught there than in the capital. Notions like that might not be around for long, however. The courts are currently hearing five serious cases of corruption and have delivered judgements on two involving the misappro- priation of $2 million in public resources. Another 250 cases are under investigation, covering a variety of provincial and district administrations, the police, correctional services, the electoral commission, the National Broadcasting Commission, several universities, and departments including health, educa- tion and foreign affairs. S C A L I N G U P N A T I O N A L L Y A N D B E Y O N D The proven merits of Phone against Corruption have con- vinced the Department of Finance to scale it up. A first step has been developing a robust system to manage large flows of data. As that comes online, plans call for extending the system to 20,000 staff in the national and subnational offices of 43 departments. Recognition has also come from outside Papua New Guinea. Several neighouring Pacific countries have expressed interest. The Solomon Islands is already moving forward with its own adaptation\u2014a system for reporting all kinds of crime, based in the police department. In 2016, Phones against Corruption received a regional Govinsider Innovation Award as the best citizen engagement project. Siim Sikkut, who chaired the judging panel, referred to the initiative as \u201cinspiring,\u201d and hope it would encourage \u201cpublic servants across Asia to continue innovating, and push the boundaries of public service delivery.\u201d The Department of Finance has", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ac1afbe-2344-4bba-ba91-d067781fa348": {"__data__": {"id_": "4ac1afbe-2344-4bba-ba91-d067781fa348", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovate-create-change-partnership-series-3", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Innovate.

Answering questions from the kids about why only Dad takes them to school. Preparing dinner while Mom enjoys an evening out drinking with her friends. Or imagine the sinking look of dismay on the face of a 55-year-old man, told by his 30-year-old female boss that it is time to retire. His qualifications are impeccable. His health is perfect. The office would not be where it is today without him. But the law requires him to leave\u2014five years earlier than his female colleagues. Normal? Yes\u2014for women across Viet Nam. But might the normal in fact be\u2026abnormal? That\u2019s the provocative question asked by a novel campaign that cleverly uses role reversals to challenge longstanding assumptions about gender roles. And in thinking about the \u2018abnormal\u2019 normal, a further challenge: What actions can people from all walks of life take to correct the imbalance? To create a \u2018new\u2019 normal, one grounded in gender equality? C H A N G I N G M I N D S E T S As is the case in many countries, Viet Nam has made progress on gender equality. It has a law on gender equality, legal sanc- tions against gender-based violence, and a National Strategy on Gender Equality that sets a minimum target of 35 percent for women\u2019s representation in elected office, among other measures. Yet as is also true in many countries, stereotypes and gender norms continue to hold back aspirations for change. Viet Nam CAMPAIGNING FOR A \u2018NEW\u2019 NORMAL At the launch of the #HowAbnormal campaign at the Commerce University of Hanoi, students learned about the powerful roles of gender norms and made online pledges to overturn gender discrimination. At 13 of the nation\u2019s largest universities, 30,000 students took part in activities aimed at eliminating gender prejudice. 30 Longstanding, mostly unquestioned norms confine wom- en and men to certain roles, positions and careers, for instance. Few women reach senior government positions, while women are still legally required to retire at age 55, compared to 60 for men. Laws to curb domestic violence only go so far when discriminatory gender norms continue to pressure women not to report abuse. These shortfalls deprive women of their rights\u2014and limit their contributions to a more inclusive, sus- tainable society and economy. UNDP has been a longstanding partner in Viet Nam\u2019s efforts to put in place laws and policies essential to advancing gender equality. But since mindsets matter so profoundly for change to take root, it has also teamed up with UN and nation- al partners to shine a spotlight on discriminatory stereotypes and behaviours. In asking \u201cHow abnormal is the normal?\u201d, the #HowAb- normal campaign deliberately disrupts how people normally think. Can women be \u2018fit\u2019 leaders? Should people use sex-se- lective abortions because of the preference for sons? Should violence and harassment be tolerated? Is it right that women are solely responsible for childcare, while men engage in \u2018manly\u2019 activities such as drinking and sports? These are some of the conversations that the campaign has sparked across the country, particularly among young people. In films, at universities, in online pledge drives and other forums, they have brought energy, creativity and innovation into an effort that could transform the \u2018norm\u2019 for an entire generation. E M P O W E R I N G A N E W G E N E R A T I O N Throughout 2016, the #HowAbnormal campaign targeted both men and women through a variety of communications channels. As a launching point, seven films ran online and at special sessions at universities, with excerpts receiving wide coverage on national television stations. The films showed women in roles traditionally enjoyed by men\u2014such as being preferred over sons at birth, taking on leadership functions, leaving all the housework to men, and enjoying life drinking and socializing outside the home.

At the Viet Nam Military Medical Academy, Le Van Duc participated in one of the days and found it had made him aware of new ways of thinking. \u201cI used to think that sons were more important than daughters. But now I understand that it does not matter. All children are equal in a modern society,\u201d he commented. \u201cPeople should change the old-fash- ioned perception.\u201d Nguyen Phi Hung, a student at the Viet Nam Academy of Traditional Medicine, which also hosted a festival day, said he now would find it \u201ctotally normal\u201d to work for a women employer, and that women can do any job, even those tradi- tionally done by men. \u201cWe students are very interested in this campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we would like to deliver a message to everybody. Stereotypes can be abolished. People are willing to help others to do so.\u201d M A I N T A I N I N G M O M E N T U M While the #HowAbnormal campaign ended in 2016, momen- tum carried over into 2017 as a photo exhibition inspired by the campaign has travelled to universities and centres of culture, and garnered a National Press Award for reporting on youth movements. Entitled \u201cWomen can do,\u201d it showcased striking photos shot by journalist Nguyen Thi Quynh Hoa that told a story of women as dynamic leaders and contributors to society. The exhibit depicted Vietnamese women in four fields: the first airplane captain, the female footballer receiving the Golden Ball Award in 2014, the best female student from the main school for firefighters, and a female CEO of a multinational corporation. Photos from the exhibit as well as campaign videos have become part of a new girls\u2019 education push by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the Ministry of Education and Training, used to raise awareness among education officials, teachers, students, parents and others on gender equality. Other lasting headway may come through an online pledge drive, which topped 17,000 signatories, including many university leaders and students, who committed to taking actions to break neg- ative gender stereotypes and create a new normal. If all these people act together, the remaining barriers to gender equality could topple quickly. As Le Van Duc pointed out, applying a traditional saying in a call to the latest gener- ation, \u201cMany hands make light work.\u201d Students at Sao Do University in the Red River Delta region danced in a flashmob calling attention to ending gender stereotypes. An online pledge drive topped 17,000 signatories, including many university leaders and students, who committed to taking actions to break negative gender stereotypes and create a new normal. 32 Every natural disaster brings graphic coverage of the toll these tragedies take. The lives lost, and homes and crops destroyed. The children who will never know their parents, or have a fu- ture derailed because they can no longer go to school. Relief and rebuilding efforts may require massive infusions of funds. Infrastructure and services can take years to fully restore. All of these risks can be mitigated, but not without some degree of advance planning. While Asia and the Pacific is the most disaster-prone region in the world, it also has come up short on risk reduction. Immediate development priorities weigh heavily on many countries. Risk reduction takes specialized technical expertise, and can be time and resource-intensive\u2014or at least so it used to be. Across the region, UNDP is working with partners and advocating new technology with the power to revolutionize how people think about disaster risks and what they can do about them.

S E E I N G W H A T H A S N O T B E E N S E E N The journey began in 2015 with an exercise in foresight. UNDP called together nearly 200 experts from governments, the United Nations, civil society and academia for 10 days to see what others do not see. Using Futurescaper, an online foresight intelligence platform, and with the recently agreed Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction in mind, participants considered major challenges, why these are important and what happens when the challenges are overcome. The exercise, covering a diverse region, identified over 500 challenges and priorities for action, with key areas including inadequate data, capacity gaps and institutional barriers. Par- ticipants agreed on a number of traditional means to move forward, such as greater awareness and advocacy, and better coordination. Some were quick to point to the new future opening through apps, drones and GIS-based technology. But Regional TECHNOLOGY TRANSFORMS PROTECTION AGAINST DISASTER Drones have taken to the skies over the Maldives, snapping photographs for maps essential for defining disaster risk management options. 33 only 20 percent could identify innovations that might apply to disaster risk reduction. It was a moment of revelation, and UNDP committed to championing potential innovations that could show some of the ways forward. G E T T I N G A L L T H E I N F O One initial emphasis has been on data, among the most critical inputs for decisions and plans to reduce risks. While a lot of data are produced, they are not consistently useful or relevant for managing disaster risks. Inaccurate risk assessments and improper hazard and vulnerability analysis can lead quickly in one direction: uninformed policy decisions with potentially harmful effects on people\u2019s lives. The foresight exercise pinpointed two sources of data to harness. One source entailed traditional databases like those maintained by governments, which could provide a strong foundation for risk reduction measures if the quality could be improved. UNDP helped bring together two partners, Tohoku University\u2019s International Research Institute of Disaster Sci- ence, a key think tank involved in the Sendai meeting, and Fujitsu, a leading Japanese tech company. They agreed to set up a Global Centre for Disaster Statistics in Sendai to host a global disaster loss and damage database and provide stake- holders a universal and open platform to increase capacity in analysis and collaboration through cloud computing. Seven Asia and the Pacific countries with a strong interest in disaster risk reduction stepped forward as initial participants in the database, hoping to boost capacities to gather, store and analyse risk-related data, including those linked to Sendai Framework and SDG resilience indicators. The fact that the database is in the cloud is a major step\u2014current practice too often involves people compiling numbers on a laptop, where data are vulnerable to loss and hard to share. The cloud means that people can crunch large quantities of data, in real time, across many development sectors, and even across countries to understand cross-border risks. As the initiative evolves, it will be open to countries around the world. A second source of data is the new digital world of social media interactions and techniques such as crowdsourcing and perception surveys. Private sector companies already use these big data for marketing and advertising. They could also be applied to disaster risk reduction, including to understand perceptions and behaviours that can put people at risk\u2014or protect them from it. One initial obstacle has been language, however. Only a small percentage of people across the region interact in English, and the rest use a widely diverse mixture of tongues.

For a large UNDP-supported tsunami programme in 18 countries, know- ing what people are talking about will guide public awareness campaigns, the structure of evacuation drills, the use of celeb- rities and politicians as spokespeople, and so on. Further, it will be relatively easy to conduct rapid assessments of whether perceptions and behaviours have actually changed in response to measures like these. A future possibility is Chatbots, which can ask people for information, such as photos or messages about a disaster that can then be plotted on an open map platform as a kind of living situation report. E Y E S F R O M T H E S K Y Innovation for disaster risk reduction is evolving through the use of other technologies as well, including under UNDP collaboration with DJI, China\u2019s leading drone company, on a regional drive to use drones for development. In 2017, drones took to the skies over the Maldives, one of the most geograph- ically vulnerable countries in the world, since much of it sits only a metre or so above sea level. Drones can snap aerial photographs for developing 3D and topographical maps, which in turn allow close tracking of shifts in sand dunes and coral reefs, flooding patterns, and manmade changes linked to economic development, among other infor- mation essential to defining disaster risk management options, and even forecasting and preparing for potential losses. More traditional risk assessments have involved intensive use of GIS technology, with typically a bevy of international experts to manage it. After the 2004 tsunami, such an assess- ment of 11 islands cost over $1 million. With drones, a lighter, faster process that would still fully inform effective risk reduction decisions on the 11 islands would not exceed $300,000. Given that the Maldives has 160 islands, savings could be huge. A 3D map based on a drone feed has already been devel- oped\u2014in the course of one day\u2014for the village of Maibadhoo, which was severely affected by the tsunami. The map has helped identify safe areas in case of flooding, and pinpoint pockets of erosion that pose future threats. In late 2017, UNDP will train people from 20 islands to start using the drones for their own maps, as well as helping national authorities develop capacities for central data management. Looking ahead, there is much more to explore. Virtual reality films, for example, one of which has already been shot on post-earthquake Nepal, can give viewers a visceral un- derstanding of disaster impacts. They can build empathy and commitment among people from far-away donors to policy- makers in capitals who may be relatively protected from crisis. The technology is already widely used in China, where there is interest in establishing a centre to produce films oriented around development aims. One thing is clear. Innovations build on each other, ush- ering in new ways of thinking and unleashing creative dis- ruption. For a region that needs to catch up on disaster risk reduction\u2014and fast in the era of climate change\u2014they offer a transformative journey to a safer future. Virtual reality films, like this one on the stark reality of life after the 2015 earthquake in Nepal, build empathy and support for humanitarian response.

Introduction 1.1 Context for Development Finance Assessments and Integrated Financing Solutions agenda 2030, with its ambition of being transformational, will present significant challenges for governments, in particular for their traditional fiscal planning, budget capacities and performance. the third international conference on Financing for Development held in addis ababa in July 2015 opened the discussions on how to mobilise the unprecedented amounts of financial resources that will be required to achieve the sustainable Development goals (sDgs). it is expected that countries are facing an increasingly complex landscape of development finance to manage at the national level, as domestic public and private resources increase, and the sources of external resources diversify. the sDgs will demand both significant increases in capacity and resources as well as changes in the way existing resources are used and prioritised. it is also recognised that financing the sDgs", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "624da60a-d567-47c5-af37-5e35c3fd698b": {"__data__": {"id_": "624da60a-d567-47c5-af37-5e35c3fd698b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-development-finance-tool-linking-finance-results", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals - Development Finance as a tool for Linking Finance with Results", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-development-finance-tool-linking-finance-results", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e184ddde7c4ea4bca2d8abbf04f64766dcb044e1407d4fe58e83fc8db193cccd"}, "3": {"node_id": "57b49c54-0fdc-4306-b68f-69eb1fd8ebc4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-development-finance-tool-linking-finance-results", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2f058988c68d77ab98312b021bfdb7b37c7a33e4aa1962c1338f14a238cacedd"}}, "hash": "8b3c69d7bdde8b713fca82818e00fb15a66c877f857abac70276916953c859a4", "text": "will not happen through global financing agendas alone but instead be built from a bottom-up, holistic country-level approach. Financing is growing and diversifying rapidly. this opens up opportunities to meet the scale of the sustainable development challenges ahead with greater volumes of financing that can be channelled into rising levels of investment. it also presents opportunities to respond to the breadth of the sustainable development agenda with a wider and more diverse pool of financing types, each of which has varying characteristics and comparative strengths in contributing to different result areas. greater volumes of finance offer more potential to address the scale of the challenges; greater diversity of finance offers more potential to address the integrated, interconnected nature of sustainable development challenges. as an example, the financing landscape across the asia-pacific region is rapidly evolving as evidenced in the 2016 ap-DeF regional report, Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in the Era of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda which highlights the dramatic variations in different country contexts (Figure 1.1).

Both phases are framed by the concept of an inFF. phase 1 (DFa) focuses on establishing the baseline of an inFF, through both quantitative (mapping of finance flows) and qualitative (analysis of policy and institutional context) assessment of the financing landscape and the strength of the government\u2019s existing financing strategies, policies, and institutional structures to meet key financing challenges. Following the DFa, and building on its findings and recommendations, in phase 2 (integrated Financing solutions), action-oriented support is provided towards strengthening the inFF. this may entail deeper analytical work around specific areas of the inFF, capacity building support, and implementation of specific financing solutions as linked to the inFF.

This conceptual model can prompt governments to assess their financing frameworks as a whole and guide thinking about reforms that are needed to strengthen them. a conceptual model for understanding and assessing inFFs has been developed in detail, together with illustrative country examples, in Building Integrated National Financing Frameworks: Country Experiences. the concept covers six building blocks and, critically, the way that they interact and work together in a single, integrated system: 1.

A clear vision for results that the country wants to achieve is the foundation of an integrated national financing framework on which financing plans and targets are built. it sets out the sustainable development outcomes and impact that the country wants to realise and is typically articulated in a national development plan or long-term vision. it should set out a realistic formulation to consider the affordability and financial resources needed to achieve the goals, and therefore needs to include reference to the costs of achieving the vision. 3. An overarching financing strategy takes the long-term vision for results and develops proposals for the types of investments needed to meet the costs. it provides the framework within which specific financing policies to mobilise resources can be developed and operationalised, and should also take into account issues of the absorptive capacity of government institutions to deliver finance to achieve the vision for results. For many countries, the overarching financing strategy would be a significant extension of existing medium-term financing framework approaches. 4. Specific financing policies are articulated to mobilise different types of finance1, in a scale and manner consistent with the overarching financing strategy. they govern the mobilisation and use of different types of finance, and cover a range of policies such as medium-term expenditure frameworks, tax revenue strategies, and national aid policies. 5. A robust monitoring, evaluation and learning system is an essential ingredient of a results-focused financing strategy. systems that can effectively monitor progress from government efforts to mobilise financing, to the outcomes of investments mobilised and the results they contribute toward can inform more effective approaches to the use of finance. 6. An enabling environment for accountability and dialogue is essential to build the trust necessary to mobilise financing from stakeholders outside government, to make sure policies are being designed and delivered effectively and to ensure a voice for citizens, civil society, business, development partners and other actors in development. 1 Figure 1.4 highlights the broad categories of finance that would be covered by a financing strategy and financing policies, and the general degree of direct or indirect influence government has over the way they are invested. it is intended to make the point that the government\u2019s overarching financing strategy must balance approaches toward resources over which government is the decision maker with resources in which it is a partner and those in which it is not involved in decision making but can influence indirectly through policy and other factors such as regulating the business environment. there are exceptions to this where government has more or less direct influence over particular flows within these categories. Development Finance assessment anD integrateD Financing solutions 6 as illustrated in Figure 1.5, the DFa helps government to answer two key questions: \u2022 What financing challenges and opportunities will the country face in achieving sustainable development priorities? \u2022 How can government build an integrated national financing framework that will help it overcome the challenges and leverage opportunities? taking direction from the DFa government oversight team, the DFa also identifies one or two areas for more in-depth analysis, which could be analysis of a particular finance flow; analysis of financing challenges around a particular national development priority; or analysis of a particular building block of the inFF. Figure 1.5: Analytical Entry Points of the Development Finance Assessment critically, DFas are government-led and are tailored to the context and priorities of the country, under the guidance of a national oversight team. a core added value of the DFa is that it brings together diverse actors around a collective assessment of the financing challenges and opportunities faced by a country. these actors may include different parts of government, private and public sector actors, and experts, practitioners and development partners with various roles related to financing sustainable development. Support Government\u2019s capacity to develop Integrated National Financing Frameworks (INFFs) designed to catalyse the resources needed to achieve their national development priorities and results in the context of the 2030 Agenda, and to develop targeted, evidence-based policies and sound institutional solutions to implement them.

policy, the Vientiane Partnership Declaration 9 Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in the Era of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda 1.3 UNDP's Role in Supporting Country SDG Implementation with the Development Finance Assessment and Integrated Financing Solutions the Development Finance assessment and integrated Financing solutions approach was developed by unDp in response to demand from governments for support on establishing integrated national financing frameworks to manage different sources of finance towards achieving the sDgs. in additional to supporting implementation of DFas and integrated Financing solutions at the country level, unDp plays a critical role in fostering evidence-based dialogue, bringing in regional perspectives and facilitating experience sharing across countries. in contrast to some other international agencies focusing on specific finance flows, unDp\u2019s comparative advantage, in addition to its approach to sustainable development, lies in looking at how the interface among different finance flows can make a difference for sustainable development and ensuring that the potential of each critical flow of resources can be harnessed to support the implementation of the sDgs when matched with adequate policy and institutional reforms. such an approach focuses on policy development, strengthening institutions and systems needed to mobilise resources and maximise their use for development impact. in taking forward DFas and integrated Financing solutions in the asia-pacific and now in africa and latin america, unDp will consider a range of other tools when assessing how best to support governments to translate the 2030 agenda into their own plans and to strengthen the management of their development financing resources. importantly, the DFa and integrated Financing solutions approach has been developed not only as a part of unDp\u2019s broader offer of support to governments on agenda 2030, but also within the context of the un Development system\u2019s overall framework for engagement, the maps. the DFa and integrated Financing solutions can be usefully linked to maps support and specific assessments related to the sDgs, such as the rapid integrated assessment (ria), by focusing on the specific financing challenges and opportunities that a country will face in planning for and implementing the sDgs. maps, which stands for mainstreaming, acceleration and policy support, frames the un Development system\u2019s support to un country teams\u2019 (unct) engagement in the implementation of the 2030 agenda, through their respective un Development assistance Frameworks (unDaFs). the maps provides a shared resource for the unct\u2019s substantive engagement with governments and partners on the sDgs, paying special attention to the crosscutting elements of partnerships, data and accountability: Frameworks (unDaFs). the maps provides a shared resource for the unct\u2019s substantive engagement with governments and partners on the sDgs, paying special attention to the crosscutting elements of partnerships, data and accountability: \u2022 Mainstreaming means landing the new post-2015 agenda at the national and local levels, and integrating into national, sub-national, and local plans for development; and subsequently into budget allocations. \u2022 Acceleration means targeting national (and un) resources at priority areas identified in the mainstreaming process, paying special attention to synergies and trade-offs across sectors (reflecting the integrated nature of the agenda), bottlenecks, financing and partnerships, and measurement. \u2022 Policy Support means making sure that the skills and expertise held in the un Development system is made available in a timely way and at the lowest cost possible. the DFa and integrated Financing solutions can be a useful approach to complement maps, including maps missions. the value of the DFa being integrated into the maps approach and support is already recognised, specifically in the cases of cambodia and timor-leste.

Analysis of focus area The focus areas are related either to a particular finance flow, national development priority, or a specific building block of the integrated national fi- nancing framework. They are chosen on the basis of the priorities for the government, the potential for significant impact or constraints to mobilising fi- nancing for sustainable development results and/or the need for data and analysis that the DFA can provide.

Focus on linking finance with results: the DFa develops policy options and institutional reforms for government to consider maximising the use of existing resources to finance their development priorities. as such, the DFa introduces the integrated national financing framework as a practical and conceptual framework that will help governments work through the complexities of managing and effectively using different types of finance to meet national results and the sDgs. iii. An action-oriented diagnostic tool: establishing an integrated national financing framework is an ambitious long-term endeavour. the DFa is a useful tool that helps government establish a baseline for developing an integrated national financing framework and roadmap for implementing the recommendations emerging from the assessment, drawing on various resources and support available, including that of integrated Financing solutions, which is a second phase of support following the DFa. iv. Focus on the role of both the public and private sector in an integrated national financing framework: the DFa is unique among complementary tools and processes related to finance in that it considers, using the inFF concept, the need for coherence between public and private sources of finance in achieving development results. For example, the DFa focuses on analysing the degree to which the private sector development strategy it is integrated into the government\u2019s overarching financing strategy. v. Emphasis on stakeholder engagement: in addition to being a robust assessment tool, the DFa is also a process which brings together different stakeholders and partners, under the overall leadership of the government oversight team, and encourages dialogue and engagement around the concept of an inFF. Building on these principles the DFa establishes an analytical evidence base of the financing challenges and opportunities the country will face. it undertakes an assessment of the government\u2019s existing financing strategy and the policies and institutional structures used to implement it. it assesses these using the integrated national financing framework concept and provides recommendations to help government develop and deliver an integrated overall financing strategy. 13 Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in the Era of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda Figure 2.2: Sources of Data and Analysis Linked to INFF Building Blocks Note: Some of these tools may be relevant to more than one building block as the above is indicative to illustrate that the DFA draws on such existing assessments and can be complementary to other ongoing assessments related to a country\u2019s efforts to strengthen their INFF.

The Development Finance Assessment and Integrated Financing Solutions approach reflects this, as the DFA (Phase 1) focuses on producing an evidence-based common understanding of a particular country\u2019s financing context, leading to the formulation of action-oriented solutions (Phase 2) for strengthening an Integrated National Financing Framework (INFF). indeed, it is important to emphasise that both phase 1 and phase 2 of the approach are built around the analytical lens of the inFF concept and the six building blocks which have been identified. However, and critically, both the guiding principle and the practical approach for phase 2 is to maintain a focus on coherence- across different inFF building blocks, across different types of finance, and between different institutions and stakeholders within and outside government. While a particular financing strategy or solution may be quite specific to a finance flow or a development result, its relationship with other building blocks of the inFF will need to be considered.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8efb6f28-326e-466e-8165-3f57a78b3528": {"__data__": {"id_": "8efb6f28-326e-466e-8165-3f57a78b3528", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-development-finance-tool-linking-finance-results", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals -

through the role of the government oversight team during the DFa process- the requisite ownership and participatory engagement across the government to ensure that the implementation of recommendations and integrated solutions for strengthening an inFF following the DFa has the best possible chance of being successful and garnering traction with relevant stakeholders. For this reason, following the DFa, during phase 2 with the implementation of integrated Financing solutions, there may be value in continuing the role of the inter-ministerial oversight team (ot). the continued involvement of the ot can help ensure that the implementation of financing solutions which may be in the remit of a particular sector or branch of government are still considered from a holistic perspective in terms of how they may relate to or impact other policies, reform initiatives, or finance-related efforts.

But we take the well-being of the planet equally seriously. We are concerned about the poverty of resources as well as the state of financial poverty we are passing on to our children. We know that household poverty goes hand in hand with energy poverty\u2014and that sustainable energy is essential for sustainable development. To help families move out of poverty while protecting the planet from an impoverishment of resources, we need to learn to live more efficiently. We need to learn different ways of doing basic things, like the construction of buildings and the type of cooking equipment we use. Sometimes the technology and all the technical talk of change seem overwhelming. Yet, we all need to learn new things\u2014and we need to make huge changes\u2014if our planet is going to survive us. This book of impact stories combined with games aims to help people understand some of the terminology and the simple changes we can make now in the way we use energy resources that could make a healthier world for our children. We are using these games to tell you about UNDP\u2019s work and how this work is changing government policies and the decisions of energy end users (industries and households). We even hope you will play these games with children so they can remind you of the importance of what needs to be done, and so you can have a little fun while learning something new. UNDP partners with people at all levels of society to help build nations that can withstand crisis and drive and sustain the kind of growth that improves the quality of life for everyone. In more than 170 countries and territories, we offer a global perspective and local insight to help empower lives and build resilient nations. www.undp.org The Global Environment Facility (GEF) was established on the eve of the 1992 Rio Earth Summit to help tackle our planet\u2019s most pressing environmental problems. Since then, the GEF has provided US$14.5 billion in grants and mobilized $75.4 billion in additional financing for almost 4,000 projects. The GEF has become an international partnership of 183 countries, international institutions, civil society organizations and private sector to address global environmental issues. www.thegef.org FUN?

It is possibly the single most universal ambition connecting all of us. But it has implications for households, communities, cities, nations and, ultimately, the planet. Our built world\u2014 the things we create\u2014can help overcome poverty and social injustice, or it can exacerbate the inequities. Poverty is now recognized as encompassing income as well as energy, nutrition and knowledge poverty Which is why UNDP includes the environment in its programming. Projects that address biodiversity loss, ecosystem degradation or climate change, for example, also address critical development issues, such as food security, poor health and income poverty. One issue cannot be sustainably tackled without investing in the other.2 Climate change mitigation is central to these efforts. By supporting access to clean and affordable energy systems and services and promoting low-emission and climate-resilient urban and transport infrastructure, UNDP is simultaneously supporting the eradication of poverty and a significant reduction in inequalities and the exclusion of millions of households. Sustainable development enables both the planet and people to thrive. UNDP works with many partners on sustainable energy and climate change mitigation, including the Global Environment Facility (GEF).

The UNDP sustainable energy portfolio spans more than 110 countries, with close to 260 sustainable energy projects representing around $1 billion in grant financing and leveraging nearly $6 billion in co- financing from the public and private sectors. Over the past 20 years, UNDP has mobilized around $2 billion in grant financing for sustainable energy projects in addition to 4,000 community-level small grant projects, totalling more than $130 million in grant financing.3 UNDP-GEF\u2019s work on sustainable, affordable and efficient energy services and climate change mitigation links with every one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which nearly 200 countries agreed to in 2015 for achievement by 2030. These goals are intended to balance the growth needs of the global population with the environment\u2019s need for protection. For example, efficiency in transport or the production of goods means a heavy reduction of required energy and financial resources. These types of transformations benefit the planet and thus all of us who will always depend on resources to sustain our lifestyle choices. But we all need to make adjustments in those choices\u2014to more efficient and cleaner systems. So connecting the dots eventually goes full circle, benefiting everyone. and even the poverty of natural resources driven by degradation and the impacts of climate change.1 The presence of one form of poverty can mean the presence of many other forms of poverty. It takes knowledge, experience and resources for people to build a better life for themselves. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) works to connect countries to opportunities that build their ability to reduce poverty and inequality through sustainable development. 1.

HOW WE WORK TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE CHANGE A LIGHT, CHANGE A BRICK, CHANGE A LANE, CHANGE THE PLANET AND CHANGE COUNTLESS LIVES For nearly three decades, UNDP\u2019s global Energy, Infrastructure, Transport and Technology (EITT) team has worked to attract and direct public and private investment to help communities develop and sustainably use energy, climate-resilient infrastructure and low-carbon transport to overcome all forms of poverty while reducing dirty and dangerous emissions. That seems like a mouthful of ambition. But there is true change taking place. Through the EITT projects, UNDP helps governments and agencies spot the barriers to reaching their targets for reducing emissions goals and making interventions attractive for investment. We help unscramble systems or find new technologies to put in place, with the training to know how it works best. We connect governments and agencies with funding sources and knowledge so they can build towards self-sufficiency. We partner with different sectors of an economy to help them cross long-held boundaries and work together to build multidimensional projects that promote equity between the sexes, between geographical regions and between economic strata. And in the maze of climate change challenges, we help governments in the transformation of their energy sector to create employment and livelihood opportunities while delivering basic services. In nearly all project sites, the projects go beyond training and set up demonstration models to illustrate how new ideas would actually play out. The EITT projects seek to transform energy and urban transport systems in developing countries\u2014though market-based principles while taking into account the needs of the poor and pay attention to gender equality and social inclusion by being affordable and fair.

Jennings, A Guide to Low-Carbon Transport (Durban, GEF, UNDP, Government of South Africa, 2011). | 6. OECD, 2011, in ibid. To move out of poverty, most people need to move. Get somewhere. But the hustling and bustling to and from jobs, livelihoods, health care and markets for basic needs has created chaos on our roads and pollution above the fray. OUR MOBILITY S PROJECT IMPACT In turn, that pollution is harming people, creating more need for health care and sending households into debt. Economies are dependent on, maybe even synonymous with, transport to provide access to raw materials, employees, suppliers, customers and consumers. But the transport sector accounts for 13 per cent of all greenhouse gas emissions and 23 per cent of energy-related emissions. Road transport is responsible for 74 per cent of all transport emissions globally; private cars account for a large portion of that.5 Unless the way we move through cities changes, experts6 predict a 120 per cent growth of global transport emissions by 2050 (from 2000 levels). Transport-related CO2 emissions are expected to increase 57 per cent worldwide between 2005 and 2030. Even though the largest contribution comes from transport in industrialized countries, much of the growth in emissions will come from developing countries (approximately 80 per cent of the predicted increase). There is a need for urban centres to reduce the number of private vehicles with single or even double occupants. Public transport that is clean, efficient, reliable and safe is considered integral to a country\u2019s sustainable development goals. Giving people access to energy-efficient mass transit will help them move to where they need to go without impacting their health and will add to the reduction of dangerous emissions. Governments with the private sector need to provide modern, clean, safe and reliable mass transit options. But individuals also need to shift away from dependency on their automobiles. Some cities are experimenting with different approaches to encourage people to reduce the number of cars on the road through car-sharing or bicycle-sharing schemes.

Some days the wait was unbearable or she could not get a seat and missed a class altogether. But it was her only option because she could not afford a taxi. Nor was it a comfortable option because although the van had a women\u2019s section, men were allowed to sit there if no other seat was available. If the women\u2019s section was full, Nimra would have to sit next to a man, something not encouraged in her culture. Then in 2014 a transit miracle appeared on the road: The Rawalpindi-Islamabad Metro Bus Service. \u201cIt brought a huge difference to my life,\u201d says Nimra. \u201cThere is a large number of buses available and every 5 minutes a bus comes to my stop\u2014I do not wait for long. It is comfortable in that it has a separate section dedicated for women so I can travel in a dignified manner.\u201d Plus, with a fare lower than the vans charge, Nimra has cut her monthly travel expenses in half.

Because of the railways\u2019 massive energy requirement, the Government wanted to launch a long-term Energy Efficiency and Conservation Programme (2010\u20132032) to reduce energy consumption by 10 per cent, with an overall goal to also reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by 8.5 per cent. It will contribute towards attaining national targets on energy efficiency. UNDP-GEF helped the Government develop guidelines, manuals and procedures for training on conducting an energy audit of the energy-intensive operations (production units, traction substations, workshops, production units, maintenance depots and buildings), with which the Indian Railways trained its engineers. Energy auditing is the inspection, survey and analysis of energy flows for the purpose of energy conservation in a building, process or system to reduce the amount of energy input into the system without negatively affecting the outputs.

But because there are heaps of them scuttling along the congested roads, with young office workers clinging to the vinyl rooftops or standing on a poor excuse for a bumper once the tiny space inside is stuffed, and because they still pollute despite the use of natural gas, the question represents a dilemma: Is it possible for the country to provide transportation that is affordable, safe and good for the environment? This type of question is becoming stock study in the new curriculum at the Institute of Urban Transport (IUT), which was established in 1997 under the Ministry of Urban Development but strengthened through the UNDP-GEF Sustainable Urban Transport Project (2009\u2013 2015). According to Kamal Nagar, Officer on Special Duty (Transport) for the city of Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh State, who represents the IUT as a project partner, the project has changed not only India\u2019s institutional approach to urban transport, it is now trickling down across state planning. Nagar describes transport planning prior to the project as \u201cunsophisticated\u201d. Before 2006, he says, \u201cwe never had a policy on urban transport.\u201d In 2005, for instance, when Kanika Kalra received a Master\u2019s degree in urban transport planning in 2005\u2014 from the country\u2019s only college offering such a specialty, there was no position anywhere within India. Since the UNDP project and other partners\u2019 contributions, she says, \u201cThings are different. There is a huge demand for these skills now.\u201d From a study visit to Singapore Land Transport Authority for high-level state officials, Nagar brought back to India a new perspective on the \u201ccrucial\u201d integration of transport planning with land use planning. \u201cWe are now doing something similar in our state but customizing, trying to adapt it to local conditions,\u201d he says. Among the many changes he has initiated so far is the Madhya Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation Ltd, a state company to manage the Mass Rapid Transit System in Bhopal and Indore cities. Nagar says he learned from the study visit the importance of sustainability in all terms: \u201cenvironmental, social and economic. We are trying our level best but still have many targets to achieve.\u201d The project also helped IUT transition into a knowledge management centre, which Kalra now heads,to train state officials on urban transport planning and to research how good practices from around the work can be adapted into appropriate climate change mitigation strategies for India. IUT has also launched the country\u2019s first database on urban transport statistics, the lack of which previously had severely constrained the ability to make viable urban transport plans or assess the impact of different initiatives. Says Nagar, \u201cIUT has done three important things: First, they have become the training arm of the Ministry of Urban Development and are running capacity building and training workshops, and second, they have prepared analysis on policies and best practices globally and in India that have been a catalyst for people in public transport. And they bring together all urban mobility officials to brainstorm on issues regarding urban transport.\u201d GAMES ABOUT CHANGE\u2014AN ACTIVITY BOOK 18 PROJECT IMPACT 2 According to the International Energy Agency, the building sector commercial and residential) is the biggest consumer of the world\u2019s energy use, at 41 per cent.

In peak times, such as when there is an influenza outbreak, the generator has to be switched on as often as three times a week. Access to 24-hour power will mean we can treat our patients immediately. It may even save lives.\u201d Electricity is required to store life-saving vaccines and medicines at the appropriate temperature. It is also essential to power the equipment used for the treatment of acute medical issues. While the Nui Health Clinic has a back-up generator for such emergencies, Viliamu, explains that a mechanic has to be called upon to switch on the generator when it\u2019s needed, a process that can take around an hour or longer. With many water pumps requiring electricity to operate, another health benefit stemming from the project is improved access to clean water for cooking, bathing and sanitation. With the island\u2019s previous diesel sometimes out of order for up to two weeks, schoolchildren will soon have lights at night to study by and access to the internet.8 In Bangladesh, Md. Nasiruddin said a solar lantern gave his family \u201ca new hope for life\u201d. For 47 years, his village had no electricity. His three children were used to kerosene or hurricane lamps for studying, which are inefficient, potentially dangerous and a major source of greenhouse gases. \u201cI was very worried when I saw that my children were studying with a small lamp or candle with difficulties.\u201d The darkness, he said, was very expensive. \u201cWe could not go out for any work at night. In short, all our work just stopped when the sun went down.\u201d In 2015, he bought a solar lantern system for 3,000 taka. The system has a 4.9 Wp Panel, 3 No of LED bulbs, a torchlight and a mobile charging facility, made possible through the UNDP-GEF Development of Sustainable Renewable Energy Generation Project. \u201cAfter buying this lantern, my children could easily continue their study with the powerful LED bulbs,\u201d he said, adding that it had a positive influence on their performance in school.9 \u201cA new hope for life.\u201d \u201cNo one in the village has ever done anything like this.\u201d \u201cAccess to 24-hour power will mean we can treat our patients immediately.\u201d In India, the once unthinkable was achieved when four families in Rajasthan State allowed their daughters to leave home and live among strangers. The four women had only attended school up to class five or eight; none had ever travelled much further than a neighbouring village and never without a male escort. Now, thanks to training through the UNDP-GEF Scale Up of Access to Clean Energy for Rural Productive and Domestic Uses Project, they are \u201cbarefoot solar engineers\u201d. \u201cNo one in the village has ever done anything like this, said Bhagwati. \u201cPeople said that boys should get the training. Then we were told that the project would only train girls. It took people a long time to accept this.\u201d After two months of campus courses and a month of field training, the four young women, all married, learned to assemble and install solar-powered lights and lanterns. Now, they undertake regular checks in the village, respond to complaints, repair faulty lights and maintain the batteries that power them. Each family with a light contributes to a village fund from which their woman barefoot engineer is paid a salary ranging from 1,000 rupees to 1,350 rupees a month. And the villages are full of little girls who trail the barefoot engineer and watch in awe as she fiddles with wires and fuses, hoping to someday be an engineer.10 8.

Engaging building products manufacturers in the process ensured availability of materials in the local market. \u2022 By 2013, more than 2,000 persons had been trained on energy efficiency in buildings and houses, including staff of the Construction Development Centre who are responsible for building code compliance checks. \u2022 The project developed 42 designs of energy-efficient houses; almost 15,000 homes and apartments were built by 2014 that complied with the building energy standards. Seventy-three-year-old Dolgormaa traded in her heat-losing ger\u2014a traditional Mongolian felt or fur covered yurt\u2014for one of the energy-efficient houses built as a demonstration model through the UNDP- GEF Building Energy Efficiency Project (BEEP). She lives there now with her 12-year-old grandson. Her heating consumption is 60 per cent less than other houses in her neighbourhood. The house cost $11,000 to build, for which she was given $2,500 from the Millennium Challenge Account-Mongolia (a grant programme established by the governments of Mongolia and the United States to reduce poverty through economic growth) and her six sons and daughters contributed the rest of the finances needed. In 2015, her family added an extension for a shower and toilet that includes a solar hot water heater, a water supply tank and a biological wastewater treatment unit. The house is one of the many benefits of the BEEP activities, which started in 2009 to help the Government of Mongolia reduce its annual growth rate of greenhouse gas emissions from the building sector by improving its energy efficiency in new construction. This required updating standards and expanding knowledge of energy-efficient technologies. In 2009, some building standards in Mongolia were still only available in Russian, a legacy of the former Soviet Union system. It was a crazy expectation for compliance. In addition to being poorly understood, such standards were outdated and intended for Russian conditions, which varied considerably from the Mongolian context in which winter temperatures over an eight-month period are -10\u00baC to -30\u00baC in the daytime (late December and early January) but can drop to as low as -40\u00baC at night (the typical temperature in Moscow is -10\u00baC). Along with the complex and outdated building code system that was difficult to update, poorly understood and thus difficult to comply with, the building sector struggled with its lack of knowledge about and commercial availability of energy-efficient building technologies; inadequate technical skills to design, build and ensure enhanced building code compliance; a low level of awareness on the benefits of and practical means to achieve more energy-efficient buildings, including improved insulation levels of windows, doors; and limited awareness of and inadequate access to energy-efficiency financing. An additional concern of the Government was the use of coal and the consequential air pollution. The aggregated CO2 emission from Mongolia was 13 million tonnes in 2011\u2014an increase of about 5 million tonnes from the 2006 level.11 The Government wanted to find solutions to reduce the environmental stress on the capital. Although the building codes and government personnel were targeted in the project, other activities focused on addressing the situation of households living in gers that had relocated to squatter areas of the capital city from the country\u2019s hinterlands. While a vast majority of the residential (and commercial) buildings are connected to a district heating system, the ger areas have no such luck. Families living in a ger use biomass and coal as fuel for their cook stoves, which also heat the living space. The project\u2019s component on accessing energy-efficient financing led to investment of $2 million by Xac Bank, which intends to extend home loans to 100 middle- and low-income (ger-dwelling) families to build a similar energy-efficient home. Although loan distribution has been slow, the financing component helped to create awareness among the small home construction companies and private sector banks on the potential for investment in building energy efficiency. This helped to catalyse builders to construct provide similar-styled but standard- compliant houses of their own design.

The government corporation continues the work of the MBIPV project: building new markets for green products, addressing the energy industry\u2019s competency, addressing the policy perspectives and promoting renewable energy. \u201cA lot of the knowledge and lessons of the MBIPV Project were translated into the operations of this organization,\u201d says Haris. The MBIPV Project, he adds, dramatically changed what was possible in the country\u2019s commercial and home building industry. The MBIPV Project was pivotal in putting an enabling and regulatory framework in place to promote renewable energy and photovoltaic technology that is centred on a feed-in tariff scheme (generators of renewable power are paid for solar energy they channel into the national power supply) and established an agency to administer the scheme. The project catalysed solar technology acceptance among the public, policy makers, financiers and the building industry. The Project helped develop the Renewable Energy Bill, gazetted in 2011, that specified the feed-in tariff and the establishment of a Renewable Energy Fund (a levy of 1 per cent on top of the normal electricity tariff) to cover the feed-in tariff. Introduced by the project, the SURIA 1000 Programme became a pioneering financial incentive scheme for solar energy. It provides attractive financial discounts on the photovoltaic system, at 25-75 per cent to home owners. The scheme requires the photovoltaic system be installed (integrated) as part of the building and energy generated was sold to the utility via a net-metre. The goal of Suria 1000 is to allow anyone in Malaysia to have a BIPV system in their house, to generate their own electricity and to connect it to the national grid (power supply). Unfortunately\u2014in a good way\u2014the solar power take-up under the feed-in tariff scheme was so successful, the quotas were soon reached, and the Government had to switch back to the net-metring scheme to allow homeowners to benefit from solar energy. \u201cOur satisfaction is seeing things happening in Malaysia,\u201d says Haris, sitting in the demonstration building that is considered unique in the region with its slab cooling system and heavy use of daylight along with the solar ceiling. \u201cWhen we go to the airport and see all the energy efficiency applications, we see solar panels on the roof\u2014if we did not do all the work we did through the [MBIPV] Project, it would just be a normal airport today.

Reporting from Ruoqi Zhu and Teng Yue, and based on a story from UNDP China website, \u201cA light bulb moment: Promoting energy efficient lighting\u201d, see www.cn.undp.org/content/china/en/home/ourwork/environmentandenergy/successstories/a-light-bulb- moment--promoting-energy-efficient-lighting.html \u2022 Throughout the project implementation, 4 million energy-efficiency light bulbs were installed in schools in China, leading in certain cases to a reduction of 40% of coal used. \u2022 Switching to LED lights lowered small business and household utility bills, improved business opportunities and even helped reduce poverty in some areas. \u2022 For companies interested in developing their corporate social responsibility strategies, the project provided advice on balancing environmental sustainability with the demands of modern business practices. Transforming China\u2019s lighting industry has assumed international significance. Imagine if a city like New York or Paris decided to eliminate all its cars and factories or to switch off its entire energy use to avoid its carbon emissions. Something akin to that is what China\u2019s transformational UNDP-GEF Green Lights Project set out to achieve\u2014but for the whole country, and thus cutting China\u2019s electricity consumption by 48 billion kWh per year. The bold move aimed to reduce China\u2019s CO2 emissions by up to 48 million tonnes annually. One of the most significant drains on energy demands is lighting, with most conventional incandescent light bulbs typically requiring four times the energy of their more efficient counterparts. In China, continued use of these light bulbs translates into some 12 per cent of the national energy supply and generates high levels of carbon emissions that lead to tremendous pollution. The UNDP-GEF Green Lights Project (2009\u20132012) partnered with the National Development and Reform Commission to help Chinese manufacturers increase their capability to produce energy-saving lamps and help them to meet national targets on phasing out the production and sale of incandescent lamps. To achieve this, the project assisted in the development of energy-efficient industrial supply chains by working with light bulb production companies to replace or modernize outdated technologies. To complement the process, imports and sales of incandescent light bulbs were to be eliminated over a period of a three-year phase-out, beginning in 2012 and including the banning of incandescence light bulbs that exceed 100 watts. Those of 60 watts and above were banned as of October 2014, while incandescent lights of 15 watts or higher were banned as of 2016. On an individual scale, the impact is likely a replacement of five light bulbs per household. For institutions, the number will be larger, such Beijing Jiaotong University, which joined the project as a demonstration of the impact changing light bulbs can make. The university has since replaced 100,000 T8 light bulbs with the new energy-efficient LED T5 models. \u201cWe had a limited budget for light bulb replacement,\u201d explains Wang Haidong, Energy Management Department Head of the University\u2019s Logistics Group.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d006307c-ae02-4fd7-8f67-e6e394b6da23": {"__data__": {"id_": "d006307c-ae02-4fd7-8f67-e6e394b6da23", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/games-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Games of Change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/games-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3e380bdc0db5ae03d94e53b2c0ee7aff5420c563f8bb371d411b292b6779e0cf"}, "2": {"node_id": "2435f356-0a31-4a78-818d-a8c1b61c483c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/games-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "93bd2d1de21198f07da26ed42cb1ce7a57dd4d5f6f186a9be8eed5abac71d014"}}, "hash": "f3243406176d9cdf6c5dde908edf3c039d28b0ed6bb7ed010e23b73ad1f6c592", "text": "With subsidies provided by the Project, the school could begin to think about energy efficiency it was not in a position to do otherwise.

It is pitch black in this part of the forest. Each of them has a battery-operated lantern. But each lantern has a different lamp wattage. The higher the wattage, the higher is the illumination. Boy George\u2019s lamp is rated at 90W, Boy Yeur at 80W, Boy Cott at 60W, Boy Hood at 40W and Boy Friend at 20W. If one or two of the scouts use their lantern, the resulting intense light may attract the crocodiles in the swamp and attack them. Their scout master had earlier advised them to use lanterns with total lamp wattage of at least 40W but not more than 100W.

When his mother took control of the hospital, Siriphot took off for America to study lighting design in New York City, after which he worked for an interior designer who attracted jobs across the country. In America, all those jobs had to follow the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, or LEED, standard that encourages energy- and resource-efficient buildings. When his mother asked him to come home and help expand the hospital, Siriphot was agreeable.

Story from AnuruddhaKariyawasam, SLSEA and Stanley Prashanthan, UNDP. Meet Ranjani, the 35-year-old wife of a fisherman in Mirissa village in Sri Lanka\u2019s Matara district. Through the UNDP-FAO- GEF Biomass Energy Project (providing technical and financial requirements), the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority provides villagers with energy-efficient SaviruJeewa biomass dryers that are manufactured by local entrepreneurs. With a single dryer, Ranjani and four women from her village now produce dried fish and maldive fish (a cooking additive) without having to bother about the stray dogs, crows or the weather. The demand for their product is high. Excess fish during peak harvest time are no longer wasted. The five women have signed an agreement to share the labour, cost and profit of working with the machine. The new dryer helps Ranjani and her group produce around 500 kg in one drying cycle. Boosting her income by 200 per cent\u2014she now earns about 40,000 rupees a month (having previously earned 10,000\u201315,000 rupees), which is sufficient to buy nutritious food for three daily meals plus put a portion into a savings account. Through exposure to the project\u2019s training, the women have a new appreciation for resource protection and clean living and thus environmental conservation. The village\u2019s living conditions have improved. The women have grown as entrepreneurs with new skills in marketing and understanding of product diversification to generate more income. The women get along better working with the dryer because it is easy to handle and their incomes have increased. Other villagers have learned from the women how to better organize businesses.15 In China, Cai Yaling lives in a demonstration model village in Hebei Province that was transformed through the Market Transformation of Energy Efficient Bricks and Rural Buildings Project. She says that the project has changed her life immensely. \u201cOur living conditions in the village have improved greatly from this project. Before, some of us had to go into the mountains to get wood for fire; it was so tiring and wasted a lot of time. The smoke got everywhere and the fires could be dangerous.Now we can spend much more time on other things. In addition, using the liquid from the biogas on our field is very effective. We\u2019ve saved on fertilizers and our produce are better quality. It also helps to lower the levels of pollution in our land. I haven\u2019t countedexactly how much we have saved, but roughly every month we spend at least 50 yuan ($8) less.\u201d16 \u201cOur living conditions in the village have improved greatly from this project.\u201d \u201cThe old stoves wasted a lot of time, fuel and energy.\u201d \u201cThe women have grown as entrepreneurs.\u201d In India, Kumaresan makes rotis to serve with dahl and other specialities at his small eatery on a lane in Tamil Nadu.

Through the UNDP Access to Clean Energy project, Technology Informatics Design Endeavour, up to 300 energy-efficient Pyro stoves were supplied to small artisans and cooks in semi-rural areas and thus increase the profit margin and reduce the carbon footprint. In southern India, some 800,000 of eateries consume about 130 million tonnes of fuel wood a year and emit 200 million tonnes of CO2 per year.

Reporting by Thomas Gillman, UNDP Samoa MCO intern and quotes from \u2018Tonga Solar Pump System Initiative Part 1\u2019 film, by OfaSefana, UNDP Samoa. Tiny drips of fuel oil often contaminated the drinking water in Ha\u2019apai, a district in the north-western part of Tonga. The increasing variance in rainfall and potential droughts was compounding the problem of an unreliable water supply. Pumps often broke down. And there was no community involvement in managing the water source. Ha\u2019apai thus became a good spot for the UNDP-GEF Pacific Islands Greenhouse Gas Abatement Through Renewable Energy (PIGGAREP) project. Through the project, solar pump systems on water dugout wells were installed in 13 remote villages. Sixty- five people were trained on how to operate the pumps, with the Geology Department of Tonga officers trained on monitoring the water to ensure its quality. The move away from diesel pumps has distinctly lessened the chances for contamination through diesel spill or leaks. Each village contributes an agreed monthly fee, paying into a designated bank account to be used for future maintenance. Two youths were trained, provided them with complete set of appropriate tools and employed to look after each system and provide reporting obligations to the department of energy. A renewable energy service company was set up to manage the operation of all government off-grid initiatives, which include solar pump systems, a solar streetlight system, solar home systems, solar freezer systems and solar micro-grid systems. Most remote villages in Tonga, especially in the outer islands, are heavily dependent on underground water. Around 80 per cent of the pumps in Ha\u2019apai villages remain diesel powered, 11 per cent are powered by electricity and 9 per cent powered by solar power, excluding those that were recently commissioned under the project. For back-up, diesel based engines remain on standby for cloudy days. Since December 2014 when the pumps were installed, the fuel and electricity use in these 13 villages is estimated to have been reduced by more than half. This project was funded by Denmark through an initiative called SIDS DOCK that works to connect the energy sector in small island developing states with the global market for finance and sustainable energy technologies. Diesel use has reduced dramatically in the Tonga project area, with one village avoiding it completely by waiting until the pump turns on at 8 a.m. to 9 a.m. and by using rain water harvested during rainy days. The water supply usually lasts until around midnight in all villages (less so in a few villages that have leaks in their village piping network). \u201cWe usually use 20 litres of diesel in two days but now 20 litres is used for more than a week,\u201d says Vaea Taufoou, the Town Officer of Faleloa village. \u201cWe only use diesel one hour every morning and solar takes over till sunset.\u201d Alani Kavakiholeva, the town officer of Fotua village echoes a similar impact. \u201cWe only heard about solar pumps but now we\u2019ve witnessed its capabilities. The money we saved from diesel is now used for other community needs, particularly for fittings for the water supply network.\u201d18 \u2022 The PIGGAREP project helped 14 Pacific countries remove barriers to installing renewable energy technologies. \u2022 The project changed life within villages by reducing reliance on diesel fuels, which had to be transported to each island, while creating job opportunities. \u2022 The new pumping systems allow villagers to enjoy clean drinking water and they ensure self- reliance through the use of renewable energy.

When Pema Choki was 22 and a mother of two boys, her husband from an arranged marriage walked out on them. They never heard from him again. She had a tenth grade education and had never worked. For 12 years she struggled with her meagre earnings to afford the basic necessities for her and the two boys. Then she heard about a project looking for rural entrepreneurs to make, sell and repair improved cookstoves. Bhutan has one of the highest per capita consumption of fuel wood in the world, at almost 1.3 tonnes per person. The Sustainable Rural Biomass Energy (SBRE) Project (2013\u20132016) was initiated to reduce the fuel wood consumption and greenhouse gas emissions and help improve the health, income and productive time for rural households. Nearly 70 per cent of Bhutanese who live in rural areas use fuel wood as a main source of energy. Women in Bhutan typically stay at home. Pema Choki had two boys and no choice. She embraced the work typically meant for men. She travelled around her village, walking up to two days to reach households and convince them that they needed a cookstove to improve their welfare. In the evening hours, she continued her previous teaching work before returning home to her chores. \u201cIt was a challenging job in the beginning, as I lacked technical background. But I picked it up so easily because I took keen interest in it. I persevered, drawing moral support from the organizations that trained me,\u201d she said. \u201cI have now constructed more than 100 cook stoves in my community and people are impressed with my work. They even come from distant villages for a stove. I am happy that people are becoming aware and that traditional concepts are gradually changing. \u201d Her monthly income increased by 3,000\u20134,000 ngultrum ($45\u2013$60). \u201cI am hopeful that a day will come when the government will provide good facilities to and space for women like me. I believe that we have equal rights to live, and share the same roof of the world with other living beings. We are strong and independent, so we can work and act for ourselves. It is not by birth that the fate of women gets sealed but by lack of opportunity. \u201cShe challenges for her rights and she pleads with other fellow men to respect, support and empower women\u201d.19 GAMES ABOUT CHANGE\u2014AN ACTIVITY BOOK 19.

In the dry season, it was easy. But the monsoon period left their mother extremely anxious. They lived on the slope of a hill, opposite to their school in central Nepal. They wanted to relocate their home to the same side of the river as the school. There was never enough money to make the move to safer conditions. That dangerous situation changed in 2013 with the installation of a lift-irrigation system. Irrigation was only possible because of a micro hydropower plant that UNDP had helped install in the district five years earlier. While the power it supplied had a dramatic impact on many households, they were largely the families that lived near the town market and could set up or increase their milling, carpentry, cold stores, poultry raising, restaurant or lodging businesses. Ability to irrigate let the Margars grow three crops of vegetables a year instead of just one. They could shift from subsistence to a livelihood selling vegetables. The family went from growing only beans once a year to diversifying into cauliflower, cabbage, peas, tomatoes, green leaves along with their beans. Earnings of all the households increased, but for some it jumped sixfold, to NPR120,000 a season, with up to three seasons of crops now possible. The first thing the Margars did with the additional income was to build a home safely near the children\u2019s school. Since 1996 and first through the Rural Energy Development Programme, UNDP has helped communities install 445 micro hydropower plants, with a total capacity of 10 megawatts providing electricity access to more than 100,000 households. Four micro hydropower plants have been installed in the Malekhu Khola River Basin and now provide electricity to more than 700 households (of 900 in total). In addition to domestic purposes, electricity is being used for various productive purposes like milling, poultry raising, carpentry, cold stores and, since 2013, for lifting water for irrigation.20 LIFT-IRRIGATION LIFTS FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY IN NEPAL 40 41 \u2022 There are more than 2,000 such micro hydropower plants in Nepal. If all were used to power lift-irrigation systems to provide water to small landholders, the impact would transform the country\u2019s agriculture sector. \u2022 At 1 million rupees (around $9,000) per system, it would be possible to lift water with every micro hydropower plant currently in the country for domestic and irrigation uses to the more than 100,000 households.

Story by Joshua Simon. \u2022 The PIGGAREP Project helped replace the Palmerston Island\u2019s diesel generator with solar power, saving nearly $18,000 a year on diesel fuel. \u2022 The island\u2019s administration council intends to use the saved funds towards the development of agricultural, environmental, health and human resource development as well as the maintenance of the solar energy station and the future replacement of the solar energy battery banks and other components. \u201cIt is fair to say,\u201d begins Joshua Simon, a teacher in the Palmerston Island Lucky School, \u201cthat every individual on the island benefits daily by the consistent and reliable 24-hour solar power.\u201d It is his way of sizing up the impact of the UNDP-GEF Pacific Island Greenhouse Gas Abatement through Renewable Energy Project (PIGGAREP) Project. The Palmerston Island Solar Power Site, one of the project\u2019s activities, began operating in February 2015, replacing an unreliable 30-year-old 32kW HR3 Lister diesel generator. In total, 53.55 kW of solar power was installed through 210 panels.

Both the groceries and the added freight costs represent a significant expense to the majority of the households, whose only source of income is the sale of frozen fish. With only 12 hours of power per day coming from the main island diesel generator, only available in the mornings (6 hours) and evenings (6 hours), a large amount of the limited household budget was spent on fuel to run small generators to keep away both their food and livelihood from spoiling. The loss of a single freezer would be devastating and would threaten a family\u2019s immediate and future survival. The island\u2019s power generator broke down often. Sometimes for a few hours and sometimes for however long it took for the next boat to arrive with the necessary parts, which could be several weeks. Families would combine their food and fish into as few freezers as possible and contribute fuel towards running a few small generators. Power, a basic amenity that is taken for granted by so many people worldwide, wasn\u2019t something the residents of Palmerston could count on. Mama Aka, an 83-year-old great-grandmother recalls in her whispered voice, \u201cThere was a lot of prayer in those times, my dear.\u201d Before the solar power project, there were huge costs and logistical concerns involved with the purchase, shipping and storage of fuel for both the island and household generators. The main power generator consumed between 18,000 and 22,000 litres of diesel fuel annually. In the first year of the solar plant\u2019s operation, total diesel use was about 1,000 litres, a savings of nearly $18,000, with efforts being made to save power by introducing energy-efficient appliances (freezers, lights, etc.). The island\u2019s 60 families still buy fuel, albeit in much smaller quantities, and what they used to store for their home generators can now be used in their boats. This means that they can spend more time fishing and thus bring in more income. Because the power is now constant and their freezers are always cold enough to freeze their catch properly, they no longer have to schedule when they go fishing around when the power is on. Jock, an ever-smiling mother of eight children who lives in a bright blue house by a beach, says, \u201cWe used to have to hurry and try to get the fish cleaned and prepared before the power went out so that they would freeze right. We can catch so much more fish now. \u201dConsistent solar power has brought both savings and new financial opportunity to the people of Palmerston. Across the island, everyone has something different to say about how the new solar project has benefited and improved their quality of life.21 1.

Leandro Leviste was only 12 years old when UNDP began a long series of trainings to convince politicians and government officials on the policies required for power sector transformation in the Philippines. The goal was to secure the use of renewable energy to replace dependence on fossil fuels for economic growth and coping with constant power shortages. The Capacity Building to Remove Barriers to Renewable Energy Development (CBRED) Project supported by UNDP-GEF had a profound impact. Although it is credited with helping lawmakers adopt the Renewable Energy Act in 2008, its more dazzling influence led to the creation of a feed-in tariff system that better enabled a 21-year-old Leandro Leviste to set up a solar business that installed the largest solar powered rooftop in a commercial establishment in South-East Asia in 2014. Unlike other solar rooftop plants that are dedicated for self-use by a single building, the rooftop of the SM North Edsa shopping mall connects to the Luzon grid, thus contributing additional capacity to the power supply for a large area surrounding Metro Manila. Composed of 5,760 solar panels and 60 inverters covering more than 12,000 square metres, the solar rooftop produces enough power to energize 1,000 households or 150,000 10-watt light bulbs or charge 214,285 cellular phones. The power generated could offset 1,200 tonnes of CO22\u2014the equivalent of planting 6,000 trees per year.22 Within the shopping mall, the solar panels power 16,000 light fixtures, 59 escalators and 20 elevators, or 5 per cent of the total electricity required. Electricity rates in the Philippines are among the highest in Asia, and Leviste was convinced that solar power could bring them down. \u201cIn terms of innovation, solar power is nothing new,\u201d he told Forbes magazine, adding that it\u2019s more important to find a business model that works. His company, Solar Philippines Commercial Rooftop Projects, buys its panels from many suppliers and provides its customers with financing, engineering and installation.23 The Renewable Energy Act established a feed-in tariff system as an incentive that requires electric power industry companies to source electricity from renewable energy at a guaranteed fixed price for a given period of time. With a variety of other fiscal and non-fiscal incentives, the renewable energy law encourages national and local interest in the use of renewable energy. To help developers with insufficient collateral or inadequate capital, the CBRED Project set up a Loan Guarantee Fund to serve as collateral for a bank loan for renewable energy projects. During the project period, only two developers advanced quickly enough beyond their inception phase to rely on the fund (and due to the small capital available).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01c6f455-1209-45cd-881a-b0510acff4ad": {"__data__": {"id_": "01c6f455-1209-45cd-881a-b0510acff4ad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/games-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Games of Change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/games-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ee1d7494426b8a060b44c24cde4804187bf29774c75a0a31897ad1ef06ed2572"}, "2": {"node_id": "be723737-3d49-416c-a42c-fda43b322512", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/games-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5fce72f6b7a3cc409049716e19324801185a5488db8a3edc8d65c12f1c18c8b0"}}, "hash": "db2ed4eb23137ed5a12fe1b27d964bce75f28b46d3d06a8e63f5fe1b2f9ff6bb", "text": "But the fund, which the Government now manages and with partnership with other guarantee programmes, has since grown in available collateral and in projects, currently at five but with an additional 10 projects in the pipeline for a loan guarantee.

BANGLADESH | CHINA | INDIA | INDONESIA | MALAYSIA | MONGOLIA | SRI LANKA | VIET NAM Adopting energy-efficient technologies could, by 2030, reduce global projected electricity consumption of building and industry by 14 per cent. Investments in energy productivity can contribute to job creation. Energy efficiency is an opportunity that is not capital intensive, reduces consumption of water and other resources, contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and is not prone to catastrophic failure. Energy efficiency can reduce the financial burden of energy consumers, decrease net import dependency for importers or enhance exports for exporters and improve local economic competiveness and employment.24 The unreliability of energy production and distribution and the cost of fossil fuels impact country finances greatly. Regular power blackouts disrupt industry and lead to reduced and inefficient production and increasing expenses. The dependence on imported fossil fuels leaves least developed countries and small island developing States particularly vulnerable to volatile prices. There is an urgent need for our daily-use products to be produced more efficiently through low-carbon and sustainable technologies.

As a 30-year old widow with four daughters, she struggled in extreme poverty after their hand-to-mouth existence disintegrated when her landless farming husband died. With no education, skills or options she tried working as a housemaid, but it paid so little her daughters often went hungry. Then the Improving Kiln Efficiency in the Brick Making Industry Project worked with Banalata Refractory to promote the Hybrid Hoffman Kiln (HHK) technology as an energy efficient alternative for brick production because it reduces air pollution and enhances profit by lessening energy use and allowing year-round production. The project set out to hire women workers. \u201cAt first I was sceptical, women don\u2019t usually work in brickfields and it\u2019s not safe for them. \u201dBut, in just four years, her salary increased from the starting 2,500 taka a month to 3,500 taka. Three daughters have now married and the fourth dreams of being a doctor. And Razia is no longer looked at as the widow of her village, but instead as a respected senior member of her community sought out for advice. The brickmaking technology introduced by UNDP reduces carbon emissions by 40 per cent compared with traditional brick manufacturing.25 In China, Wang Jingli and her family moved into a rural house made of energy-efficient bricks after nearly 30 years in her mountainous Wangyu village in Hebei Province, much of it without adequate drainage, central heating and public green spaces. Like the other residents, Wang Jingli relied on firewood and coal to stay warm, to cook and to keep electricity bills manageable. Through the Market Transformation of Energy Efficient Bricks and Rural Buildings project, the energy- efficient bricks help retain warmth during the winter and cool the house during the summer. At no more than 1,200 yuan, the annual energy bill per household is now more affordable than it used to be. Which is an utter delight for Wang Jingli\u2019s 90-year-old mother who can\u2019t bear cold weather. The energy-efficient bricks have reduced the overall energy demand in Wangyu village by nearly 50 per cent.26 The annual energy bill per household is now more affordable than it used to be.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2d247c84-b5c3-450f-b1a7-4d639d9e9b58": {"__data__": {"id_": "2d247c84-b5c3-450f-b1a7-4d639d9e9b58", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/games-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Games of Change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/games-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "778d867c2c9d6e8274f4183a2b1afe1fb1a6cb69e11d65bdad103ea2ca9ad62c"}, "2": {"node_id": "75dc8611-8560-4ab2-b7b3-5eccdc43b6ad", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/games-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ceeb49605f959e401ee2ee29aa423287e7f44ead06391399e90b44bde2b1c176"}}, "hash": "de31a79ae6b998e21187a6c193faa23eb8989162e99cd817032f48bacd383939", "text": "Bangladesh bank \u201cis aiming at rechannelling...

At the same time, productivity increased from 10.5 tonnes of steel per hour to more than 13 tonnes and annual greenhouse gas emissions reduced by more than 63 per cent from 8,400 tCO2 to about 3,000 tCO2. \u2022 Against an investment of 150 million rupees (about $231,000), the company saved 58 million rupees (about $89,000) a month (at 2013 prices): a payback period of just about three months. \u2022 The project enabled Indian steel mills to compete in the global market, which not only means survival of the industry but job security for tens of thousands of workers. \u201cIt was really tough\u2014we were not able to recover costs. We had not been making any profit for a year,\u201d says Sandeep Goel, the director of a family-run steel mill in Raipur State in central India. \u201cThe direct rolling saved us from dying down.\u201d While Goel was staring day after day into the dark abyss of possible mill closure and the loss of jobs for some 200 workers, he looked for ways to dramatically cut expenses. Then he found the answer in the furnace. Rather, the solution was to eliminate the furnace and all the pollution it caused. It was an immensely innovative and costly consideration, and not something that had been done before. \u201cWe had no clue if it was even possible to eliminate the reheating furnace,\u201d he says. But it was necessary\u2014the furnace required 40 litres of oil to heat 1 tonne of ballast and consumed up to 30 per cent of the operating expenses. He and his engineers could not find any documentation on shifting from diesel-fired steel. Nor could they find any technical consultant who knew what to do.

The continuous-castor method heats the ballast from the inside and thus it is smoother, more uniform and stronger because the grains of steel are more compact.

In August 2015, both foreign investors signed huge deals with the Government of Indonesia to commit to the development of wind power projects worth $657 million. They are building wind farms with technology designed to harness low-speed wind, which is the nature of air flow at the equator. PACE Energy is targeting the construction on its first wind farm in 2018, installing around 50 turbines (at 150 MW) in Banten Province, followed by smaller farms, at around 30 turbines (100 MW) in South Sulawesi Province and 15 turbines (50 MW) in Nusa Tenggara Timur Province. These are all areas that have limited grid-supplied electricity currently. WHyPGen\u2019s work influenced the government electric company, PLN, and Directorate-General of New Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation, ESDM-EBTKE, to be more open to renewable energy, particularly wind power, and confident in signing power purchase agreements with private companies in 2015. Murti says the WHyPGen Project helped state officials learn how to evaluate the economics of a wind project proposal. \u201cIn 2010 to 2012, almost no one believed Indonesia had the potential to develop wind power,\u201d says Murti, now Project Manager at PACE Energy. The lack of wind data measurement and failure of the pilot projects stoked wind energy scepticism. There seemed to be no potential for a wind power industry. Now it\u2019s a \u201ccrowded\u201d field with more than five companies investing in wind power, says Murti. She also says that project developed the training curriculum so that when the wind industry finally emerged, local experts would be ready to be involved in the industry. Of the 14 employees at PACE, for example, 12 are Indonesian. Murti joined the WHyPGen Project after working in energy conservation because \u201cI realized it\u2019s very exciting to see something new happening in Indonesia. Promoting renewables means we can have more sustainable power in the future and not be dependent on oil imports,\u201d says Murti. \u201cThis is my vocation. I want to see a real wind farm in Indonesia. All that we were working for with WHyPGen I want to come to pass.\u201d The main obstacles to improving the renewable energy sector in Indonesia are the high initial costs, high interest rates for loans for renewable energy projects because they are considered high risk and a lengthy permit process. In 2015, the Government of Indonesia raised its target to increase the share of renewable energy in the total energy mix to 23 per cent by 2025 from the then 6 per cent. In addition to providing jobs for the construction of turbines, wind power encourages tourism. In a Yogyakarta Province fishing village, where a demonstration farm was built, Jumali, a shop owner, says the new electricity has encouraged tourism: \u201cBefore we had this local power, this beach area had an income of 25 million rupiah [a year].

The hills of southern India are alive with luminous green tea estates often described as serene and majestic. For workers on those estates, however, the undulating hills have not always been serene for job security. In 2008, tea estate workers like Manogaran, the supervisor of the Kaikatty Tea Industrial Cooperative Society in the Nilgiri hills, were extremely worried. Employed at the cooperative for more than 30 years, he had known no other job but had recently heard the cooperative would shut down amid rising losses. He was not alone\u2014 spread over 2,000 acres, the cooperative is a lifeline for 1,500 members, most of them women. But Indian tea companies were losing out in the global market on price for Oolong and black tea, which the Nilgiri hills are known for. Many companies feared extinction. More than 60 per cent of the local economy relies on revenue from the tea sector, which employs more than 300,000 people. South India, where the Nilgiri hills are located, contributes more than 45 per cent to India\u2019s tea exports; India is the world\u2019s second-largest producer and exporter of tea (after China). Much of the region\u2019s tea comes from 60,000 small tea growers who own one hectare of land and sell tea leaf to 100 small-scale factories nearby that process the leaf into tea. On average, these bought-leaf factories consume 9 million kg of firewood annually, much of it transported to the Nilgiri hills from more than 400 km away. Roughly 30 per cent of production costs are attributed to energy requirements. Through a UNDP-GEF Energy Conservation in Small- Sector Tea Processing Units Project with the Tea Board of the Ministry of Commerce, the cooperative underwent an energy audit that highlighted many opportunities where greater energy efficiency could reduce production costs. Accepting the recommendations, the cooperative turned its prospects around within two years by saving tremendously on its energy bill. According to V. Arunachalam, the head of the Kaikatty cooperative, \u201cBefore we began investing in energy conservation measures, we viewed it as an exercise that meant choosing between profitability and the climate.\u201d Today his view is different. \u201cEnergy efficiency in the tea sector has meant we can do justice both to the hills and the local community, which thrives on tea.\u201d Added R. Ambalavanan, the Executive Director of the Tea Board of India, \u201cThe growing shortage of fuel and climate change has created a sustainability challenge for the tea sector. Translating findings from energy audits into actual concrete measures is the key to the adoption of energy conservation practices as part of business strategy.\u201d More than $2.5 million, much of it as private equity, was channelled into a range of energy-saving measures, both in thermal and electric energy. This included installing more efficient motors, investing in wood chippers to enhance efficiency in burning firewood, modifying blades in the drying process and using renewable energy sources, such as biomass and hydropower. Carbon dioxide emissions were reduced by around 263,952 tonnes during the project duration. On average, the tea produced with energy conservation measures generate 0.27 kg CO2 less (10 per cent) than previously (3.8 kg CO2 per kg of tea processed). The experiences of small tea processers have resonated with the larger, export-oriented tea estates.

But more importantly, the air his village breathes became safer\u2014clear and fresh. Before, the village was covered with dust and filled with smoke to the point people could hardly see each other. Hop owns a small-scale ceramic workshop in northern Viet Nam\u2019s Bat Trang village, an ancient centre of traditional porcelain and pottery that is a popular tourist attraction. The production in this village has grown rapidly in this, the seventh, century\u2014but at the expense of the environment. Hop\u2019s workshop and all others around used only coal-burning kilns, causing serious air pollution. More than 70 per cent of the villagers were diagnosed with respiratory diseases. \u201cI felt so scared each time I started the kiln, dust was everywhere,\u201d Hop says. The small and medium-sized enterprises within Viet Nam\u2019s industrial sector account for more than 96 per cent of all enterprises and half of all employment (and around 40 per cent of GDP). When the Government asked UNDP-GEF to help SMEs transform from highly energy-inefficient and polluting businesses to energy efficient enterprises with greatly reduced pollution emissions, what it got in return was a transformational component targeting the banking and financial sector. The Viet Nam Promoting Energy Conservation in Small and Medium Enterprises (PECSME) Project (2006- 2011) offered training and technical know-how to SMEs making bricks, ceramics, textiles, paper and food products; energy efficiency equipment manufacturers; and local communities making ceramics and bricks. The project\u2019s specialists worked not only with businesses but government agencies, financial institutions, universities, NGOs and energy efficiency service providers to remove barriers to the widespread adoption of energy conservation measures and practices. In the banking and financial sector, for instance, credit officers were trained on the risk, benefits and evaluation of energy-efficient and energy conservation projects so that they would be willing to finance SMEs through loan guarantees. The project\u2019s transformational elements included tax and financial incentives used by 543 SMEs, training for 350 Department of Science and Technology officers from selected provinces on the economic and environment benefits of energy efficiency and energy conservation and training for 895 SME entrepreneurs from five industrial sectors on benefit-cost and financial analysis of energy efficiency and energy conservation. Hop was one of those SME entrepreneurs. As a demonstration to bankers of what could be achieved, the project also provided short-term loans to Hop and the other entrepreneurs in the village to switch to kilns that use liquefied petroleum gas. This has helped reduce the overall energy consumption in Bat Trang by 10\u201315 per cent. The more modern kilns have significantly reduced air pollution and improved the quality of ceramics produced. Hop said that as a result of the switch, there is now a lot less smoke in his workshop and he feels his health and that of his family has improved. As has his business. \u201cSince we changed to the gas kiln, our house is cleaner and we breathe in fresh air,\u201d Hop says. \u201cThe gas kiln requires higher technique and skills but it gives more stable and quality products\u2014I am now able to produce big vases,\u201d he says with a grin the size of, well, a crown. Because, since the gas kiln let Hop go huge he has becomethe \u201cking of big vases\u201d.29 SPOT 10 DIFFERENCES IN THESE TWO VASES HOP\u2019S VASE PROJECT IMPACT 59 GAMES ABOUT CHANGE\u2014AN ACTIVITY BOOK THE FINAL WORD ON IMPACT Our work is technical.

The connections featured here are only a few of the many ways our work on climate change mitigation and sustainable energy are changing the way people live, use resources and work their way out of poverty. Although it\u2019s difficult to total up the impact on people\u2019s lives or even greenhouse gas reductions from the projects singled out in this book (some of them remain ongoing), the numbers from just the past four years alone give a glimpse of the magnitude of change taking place: But this work began nearly three decades ago the world over. Change to date is exceptionally greater. Over the past 16 years,UNDP has invested a total of$1.9 billion into sustainable energy projects in 153 countries or territories. To help governments in Asia and Pacific reach their climate change commitments and their 2020 targets, GEF has currently committed to providing $355 million to UNDP-supported energy projects.With this exponential growth in investments, forthcoming change should be staggering. With each phase of the funding to date, what governments and private sector businesses have wanted in terms of support has evolved. These days, for instance, there is little need for awareness on why change is necessary. Instead, they now want to know their technological options. What is particularly rewarding to see is the integration of energy plans within development plans (rather than the previous stand-alone strategies) in most of the countries where we work. UNDP\u2019s portfolio of mitigation and adaptation projects supports all the mechanisms under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change process, including nationally appropriate mitigation actions, national adaptation programmes of action, national adaptation plans, low-emission development strategies and climate finance readiness plans. By scaling up resources and tools to strengthen developing country capacities, the Paris Agreement can promote lasting, country- driven change. Although the current low oil prices that threaten the incentives to take action against fossil fuel use have become a new challenge in our work, the speed at which the Paris Agreement is moving towards becoming a ratified treaty reflects S 58 61 60 GAMES ABOUT CHANGE\u2014AN ACTIVITY BOOK GAMES ABOUT CHANGE\u2014AN ACTIVITY BOOK \u2022 From 2012 to 2015, the GEF alone channeled $101 million through UNDP to fund 97 climate change mitigation and sustainable energy projects in 27 countries in Asia and the Pacific, reaching 933 communities, impacting more than 1.7 million people and leading to the direct reduction of 422 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent. countries\u2019 acceptance of the problems and the need for immediate solutions. UNDP has developed an exceptional understanding of the challenges that developing countries face from the changing climate and the solutions needed to implement the historic and game-changing Paris Agreement, within the context of their development goals. Equally significant is having a specific goal among the new Sustainable Development Goals that targets universal access to affordable and clean energy by 2030 (SDG 7) and taking action to combat climate change and its impacts (SDG 13). That means the provision of electricity and cooking energy to the 1.1 billion people currently without (and contributes towards SDG 10 on reduced inequalities). Achieving that goal will have profound impact on nearly all the other 16 goals. As our stories illustrate, providing homes with electricity helps young people study better and stay in school (SDG 4 on quality education) and helps their parents increase their income with more productive livelihoods (SDG 1 on poverty and SDG 2 on no hunger); it helps reduce pollution in homes and thus the related illnesses that kill more than 4 million people each year (SDG 3 on good health and well-being) and it helps improve households\u2019 access to a safe water supply or improved sanitation (SDG 6 on clean water and sanitation); it helps reduce pollution in cities (SDG 11 on sustainable cities and communities); and it helps industries save money on their energy bills and create jobs (SDG 8 on decent work and economic growth). By helping industries, hotels, hospitals and even shopping malls create products or services with heavily reduced carbon emissions helps individuals contribute towards climate change mitigation (SDG 12 on responsible consumption and SDG 13 on combatting climate change and its impacts). With UNDP committed to helping governments reach those goals, we hope the next book will tell a bigger story about our changed world.

This report draws from 10 ASEAN country specific Development Finance Assessments, and from a specific China-ASEAN study. All studies were overseen and supported by UNDP, with generous support from China, while the ASEAN Secretariat facilitated government consultations on the report. The report was written by Tim Strawson from Development Initiatives under the guidance of Tom Beloe (Governance, Climate Change Finance and Development Effectiveness Advisor) and Emily Davis (Policy Specialist, Development Finance and Effectiveness) from the UNDP Bangkok Regional Hub. The Development Finance Assessment methodology has been developed by the Asia-Pacific Development Effectiveness Facility (AP-DEF) managed by UNDP with generous support from the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The report was supported with inputs from a team at Development Initiatives including Sam Ashby, Jordan Beecher, Katie Brooker, Cecilia Caio, Zach Christensen, Daniel Coppard, Sarah Dalrymple, Harold Evans, Matthew Johnson, R\u00e9mi de Lassus, Alex Millar, Niklas Rieger, Alexandra Spencer, Dan Walton, Richard Watts and Sheena Wynne as well as Joseph Bell, Vu Cuong, Greg De Paepe, Jake Jooshandeh and Junjie Zhai (independent consultants). Chapter 3 of the report is based on a paper authored by Prof Zhang Chun from the Shanghai Institute for International Studies. The author would like to recognize the valuable comments on earlier drafts of the report received from ASEAN Secretariat, ASEAN government representatives and participants at the August 2017 ASEAN-China-UNDP Symposium on Financing the Implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, as well as colleagues from UNDP including: Cengiz Cihan, Ashley Palmer, Andrew Parker, Michaela Prokop, Richard Marshall, Jakob Schemel, Bishwa Nath Tiwari and Zheng Yuan. iii Strengthening integrated national financing frameworks to deliver the 2030 Agenda H.E. Mr. Vongthep Arthakaivalvatee Deputy Secretary-General of ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community Haoliang Xu UN Assistant Secretary-General and UNDP Director of Asia-Pacific H.E. Mr. Xu Bu Ambassador of the People\u2019s Republic of China to ASEAN Foreword Realizing and financing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 is a daunting task by all accounts. But only through partnerships can we strengthen global efforts toward eradicating poverty, and meeting the other 16 goals that cut across it. Nowhere is that case for partnerships more critical than in the ASEAN region, because the force of partnerships here, like the one between ASEAN, China and UNDP, will ripple across the region serving as a model for change across the world. ASEAN countries face new challenges and mega trends, such as urbanization, rapid technological advances and emerging demographic shifts, which will shape the region\u2019s development landscape, and therefore, its future. ASEAN, China and UNDP have been working together to support the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in ASEAN countries and on 21\u201322 August 2017 we held the ASEAN-China-UNDP Symposium on Financing the Implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in Chang Rai, Thailand. Working together with ASEAN and with generous support from China, UNDP prepared this report for the Symposium. In the report we hear how the scale and mix of financing in the ASEAN region is changing, and what challenges and opportunities await. The regional story is complemented also by findings from the national level studies which were also undertaken as a part of the preparations and follow up to the Symposium.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6e6e3c6f-e45a-4724-ae92-4693947509bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "6e6e3c6f-e45a-4724-ae92-4693947509bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN-China-UNDP Financing the Sustainable Development Goals in ASEAN", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "92bd8a8cfcbbdc414ac0acccaea2375b0847d95da090a01d2ede9613dee7f3be"}, "2": {"node_id": "650d7dbb-9b71-4c53-b73e-8675775a62eb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "43d2cdf1b84da67f961d62e883a8eb18cb8a444dea2e5fe7a1c6efbc8953a643"}}, "hash": "2d6fd08e5ddb7bfad552f495ccdbeab1a21b784a1a2a814ff2f8134e439c1f86", "text": "According to this regional study, extreme poverty has fallen significantly across ASEAN, however, there still remain many working poor for whom vulnerability of falling back into poverty is high. Among other recommendations, the study encouraged countries to establish a stronger basis for financing policies through the systematic costing of development plans and policies and establishing comprehensive long-term financing strategies. The good news is that overall, finance is growing and diversifying rapidly \u2013 domestic resources, intra-regional flows and finance from China and other countries outside the region are being scaled up.

Extreme poverty is falling rapidly across much of the region, from 17 percent of the regional population in 2005 to 7 percent in 2013. Progress is being made in key areas of health such as maternal mortality and tuberculosis prevalence, which are falling in almost all countries. Access to education has grown and is now above 95 percent at primary level in all countries. Yet the scale of the challenges ahead to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is significant. Even in the countries and regions where extreme poverty has fallen significantly, there remain many working poor, vulnerability to falling back into poverty is high and a \u2018missing middle\u2019 is experiencing rising incomes, but lacks access to basic services. Ninety percent of people have access to improved water sources though only 72 percent to improved sanitation sources. Access to health care and quality secondary education remain challenges in many", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c0ff34ed-9fc8-4612-ba03-2ec04b7fe310": {"__data__": {"id_": "c0ff34ed-9fc8-4612-ba03-2ec04b7fe310", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN-China-UNDP Financing the Sustainable Development Goals in ASEAN", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4ba92998ccb4583bb6c6c56a1dfb53ca57aefa87d5b4f569c4a9d7a039ccbc49"}, "3": {"node_id": "1a1f3826-a092-4bd7-ae9e-068c8600748a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3f003a0d46f681871752d64d23640ff5779731ebc385672162792a8631f91507"}}, "hash": "028992b8f60e52b7e3074271bad05c97edb85c6b01fe83d89ad1db81d90abe03", "text": "parts of the region; only four countries have achieved universal health coverage and in six countries secondary school enrolment rates are at or below 75 percent. Many countries have a way to go in moving to greener growth paths, indeed emissions per capita are rising in six countries. Myanmar, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Thailand and others are at key junctures in their economic development paths. The extent to which they are able to move into higher value-added activities, and how this happens, will have a significant bearing on how far economic growth continues to drive wider sustainable development progress. The interconnectedness of the 2030 Agenda highlights the complexity of the challenges that remain. The 2030 Agenda and ASEAN 2025 (\u2018Vision 2025\u2019) encapsulate a vision of progress across the economic, environmental and social dimensions of sustainable development in which there are many interlinkages. Climate change, for example, cuts across the whole 2030 Agenda and climate or environmental shocks can derail progress toward many of the SDGs. ASEAN is among the most disaster-prone regions in the world: four ASEAN countries are among the ten countries most exposed to natural hazards worldwide. Progress in gender equality too can be a catalyst for progress across many other SDGs, including nutrition, education and health care \u2013 yet significant progress is needed on gender equality in the region. While trends are positive, most ASEAN countries score as more unequal than the global average on the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\u2019s Gender Inequality Index. Mobilising the right scale and mix of finance \u2013 and leveraging the synergies between flows \u2013 is essential for achieving the SDGs. Increasing domestic revenue mobilization and managing public debt effectively can create the fiscal space for governments to invest in social protection, health care, education, green infrastructure and other key services and infrastructure. Mobilising private investments by improving the business environment, using incentive schemes, guarantees, public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) or other instruments designed to \u2018crowd in\u2019 and maximize the impact of private investment, can create decent jobs and drive growth, skills development and innovation. International public finance can support investments in services and infrastructure to reach the poorest people and those isolated from public services, and be a catalyst for investments that can expedite progress. Countries will need to harness all these resources, ensure that they work to their comparative advantages, and are brought together in a mix and sequence that leverages the synergies between them.

This offers significant potential to drive regional progress toward Vision 2025 and the 2030 Agenda \u2013 if it can be mobilized and channelled into investments that will yield sustainable development results. At the regional level, all resource types \u2013 domestic and international, public and private \u2013 are growing in volume. Domestic public and private resources are growing most rapidly, each increasing by around US$200 billion between 2007 and 2015. Countries are aiming to use an increasingly diverse set of instruments such as blended finance, impact investing, PPPs, borrowing and bond issuances. These instruments can help mobilize additional resources but bring a greater management challenge. Countries need to find ways to move beyond traditional planning and budgeting to more holistic structures for mobilising sustainable development results from all types of finance. Yet despite resource growth at the aggregate level, key finance flows remain scarce and are growing slowly for some countries \u2013 this will constrain the ability to achieve SDG results. Finance landscapes at the country level vary widely within the region (see figure). Domestic revenues are rising in all countries, yet remain below $600 per person in six countries. Domestic private finance will be a key driver of progress, though accounts for 35 percent of total financing in ASEAN-5 countries compared with 22 percent in the \u2018CLMV\u2019 countries of Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Viet Nam.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1a1f3826-a092-4bd7-ae9e-068c8600748a": {"__data__": {"id_": "1a1f3826-a092-4bd7-ae9e-068c8600748a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN-China-UNDP Financing the Sustainable Development Goals in ASEAN", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4ba92998ccb4583bb6c6c56a1dfb53ca57aefa87d5b4f569c4a9d7a039ccbc49"}, "2": {"node_id": "c0ff34ed-9fc8-4612-ba03-2ec04b7fe310", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "028992b8f60e52b7e3074271bad05c97edb85c6b01fe83d89ad1db81d90abe03"}}, "hash": "3f003a0d46f681871752d64d23640ff5779731ebc385672162792a8631f91507", "text": "With diverse finance landscapes, countries across the region face a range of challenges and opportunities to finance sustainable development ASEAN CLMV ASEAN-5 Domestic public 39% Private borrowing (intl) Domestic public 36% Private borrowing (intl) Domestic public 39% Private borrowing (intl) FDI FDI FDI Revenue Revenue Revenue 22% Domestic private Public borrowing (domestic) International public 8% International private 18% Commercial investment ODA OOFs Public borrowing (intl) Remittances 35% Domestic private International public 7% International private 22% Public borrowing (domestic) Commercial investment ODA OOFs Public borrowing(intl) Remittances 32% Domestic private International public 7% International private 35% Commercial investment ODA OOFs Public borrowing (intl) Remittances Portfolio equity Source: Numerous national and international sources: see Annex, data notes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "06244900-1d6a-43cf-933b-dd060f22d4db": {"__data__": {"id_": "06244900-1d6a-43cf-933b-dd060f22d4db", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN-China-UNDP Financing the Sustainable Development Goals in ASEAN", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1ee926e184533236f39766ea19090b0b323fec8e4bdf86878888ab2bd2e4e910"}}, "hash": "1ee926e184533236f39766ea19090b0b323fec8e4bdf86878888ab2bd2e4e910", "text": "Notes: CLMV countries = Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Viet Nam. ASEAN-5 countries = Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. 3 Strengthening integrated national financing frameworks to deliver the 2030 Agenda Low levels of domestic revenue mobilization limit the ability of governments to fund services and public investment. While domestic revenues are rising, they remain below $600 per person (less than $2 a day) in six ASEAN countries.1 This compares with over $15,000 in high-income countries. Revenues this low limit the services and public investments that government can offer. In Cambodia for example, over 70 percent of public investment is funded from international sources. Even where revenues are growing, countries must ensure that models of revenue mobilization are inclusive and \u2018sustainable development friendly\u2019, that is, designed considering their distributional impact or incentives on other aspects of sustainable development, for example tax on carbon emissions and overall growth. Volatility in natural resource revenues also impacts on revenue mobilization and the ability to plan public investment, particularly in some resource-rich countries. Stimulating sufficient quantities of quality private investment is a key challenge to unlocking private contributions toward the SDGs. Private investment has been highly volatile in contexts such as Myanmar and Lao PDR, characterized by low underlying levels of investment and major one-off projects, typically in energy or natural resources. In Thailand private investment is growing but has plateaued as a proportion of national income; in Viet Nam it remains roughly constant in absolute terms but is declining relative to growing national income. Foreign direct investment (FDI) to the region is growing but remains highly concentrated: half goes to Singapore. Both the quantity and quality of private investment are a concern for policymakers \u2013 stimulating a sufficient volume of investment to create jobs and grow new industries in Cambodia, Myanmar and Lao PDR, for example, while attracting investments in Thailand and elsewhere that can help drive a shift into higher value-added industry (and out of a middle-income trap). In all contexts, managing the trade-offs between attracting or stimulating private investment, for example with incentives or relaxed regulations, while maximising its sustainable development impact \u2013 the jobs created, skills developed, innovation spurred on, green growth generated and so on \u2013 is a challenge. At the regional level, and beyond, it is important to manage competition between countries for investment, to ensure many of the benefits are not lost in a \u2018race to the bottom\u2019. Using international public finance catalytically, by planning for future reductions in concessional finance in particular, is the key to ensuring it contributes effectively to the SDGs in the region. International public finance can play a vital role by continuing to support investment and service delivery in some CLMV contexts, and catalysing support for investment in niche areas such as climate finance and global and regional public goods across the region. For many countries access to international concessional financing is falling, or is likely to in the future, and it is important to take steps to prepare for this transition, including investing in domestic capacity building and accessing alternative domestic sources of funding. At the same time, however, countries should prepare to take advantage of new opportunities such as the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. The increasing growth of South-South cooperation and investment in the region, particularly from China, offers an opportunity to narrow financing gaps in areas such as infrastructure. Chinese investment to the region has grown rapidly in recent years and China and ASEAN have set a target of two- way investment reaching $150 billion by 2020. The Belt and Road Initiative and growth of funds such as the China-ASEAN Investment Cooperation Fund offer significant potential for funding of infrastructure and related areas. Ensuring that this growing portfolio of investment is aligned to regional and national development priorities will be vital for maximising its contribution to the SDGs. 1 These six countries are: Cambodia (government revenues equivalent to $210 per person in 2015), Indonesia ($505), Lao PDR ($330), Myanmar ($210), Philippines ($495) and Viet Nam ($490). Financing the SuStainable Development goalS in aSean 4 Country contexts vary and ultimately efforts to strengthen the financing of the implementation of national development priorities and the SDGs will need to be country driven. Governments can strengthen their policy and institutional frameworks to manage these challenges. Mobilising sufficient resources, leveraging the synergies between them, and ensuring that investments of all types are contributing toward the SDGs are the overarching challenges for governments in financing for sustainable development.

The Addis Ababa Action Agenda, to which all ASEAN countries are signatories, calls for integrated national financing frameworks to be at the heart of efforts to support cohesive, nationally- owned sustainable development strategies. The Inter-Agency Task Force on Financing for Development recognises this impetus as one of two main elements of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.2 Integrated national financing frameworks bring together six elements of a cohesive, holistic financing strategy: leadership and institutional coherence, a vision for results, a financing strategy, financing policies for specific flows, monitoring and evaluation, and accountability and dialogue. All ASEAN countries are making progress in strengthening aspects of an integrated national financing framework and though policy and institutional contexts vary widely, there are opportunities for reform that can increase overall effectiveness in all countries. The extent of coordinated, senior-level leadership over financing in government differs considerably. In many cases there are clear mechanisms for managing public finance investments in sustainable development, but there are few examples of this extending to policy toward private sector development. Most countries have clear visions for results in national development plans, but vastly different degrees of understanding and consensus about them among key stakeholders. Few are costed and the strength of the links between long-term visions and medium and short-term plans and implementation varies widely. In the Philippines, cabinet-level committees scrutinize budget proposals to ensure alignment between annual budgets and the medium- term vision. No ASEAN governments have developed comprehensive financing strategies, though some have taken steps toward such a strategy or have developed comprehensive financing strategies at the sector or thematic level. Indonesia\u2019s green budgeting and planning policy is one example at the thematic level. Despite its crucial role in driving forward progress, finance does not feature centrally in many national monitoring frameworks and where it does the focus is on public finance. Finally, platforms for public\u2013private dialogue could be strengthened in most contexts as a means for developing more responsive and targeted policy for stimulating impactful private sector development. Malaysia has developed an innovative system of \u2018Labs\u2019 for multi-stakeholder consultative planning and Myanmar has recently set up a private sector development committee to coordinate public\u2013private dialogue. The report highlights recommendations about how countries could strengthen the policies and institutional structures that govern their approach to finance, as well as specific steps to mobilize and maximize the impact of finance on the SDGs. 2 United Nations, Report of the Inter-agency Task Force on Financing for Development 2017, UN, New York, 2017, page 1. https:// developmentfinance.un.org/sites/developmentfinance.un.org/files/Report_IATF-2017.pdf 5 Strengthening integrated national financing frameworks to deliver the 2030 Agenda Recommendations to mobilize greater volumes of finance Establish a code of conduct for tax competition in FDI promotion, to reduce losses to tax revenue. Harmful tax incentives are a feature of intra-regional competition for foreign investment and could be reduced by establishing a code of conduct for tax competition in FDI promotion. Countries in the region often compete with one another for foreign investment and while much of this may be healthy competition, the use of harmful tax practices is common. Evidence shows that tax incentives are often fairly low on the list of priorities for investors choosing where to locate their investment, and they are costly for governments in terms of foregone revenues. In line with the practice among some other regional groupings, ASEAN could establish a code of conduct in which countries agree not to compete using the most harmful practices. There is scope for such a code to be designed in a way that removes the most harmful tax incentive competition, building on international initiatives such as the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) inclusive framework, without reducing ASEAN countries\u2019 competitiveness with respect to other countries in the rest of Asia or worldwide. Strengthen the capacity of tax authorities to raise revenue with support from Tax Inspectors Without Borders. The ability to develop, implement and enforce effective tax policy is limited by low capacity in tax or revenue authorities in several countries. This has an impact on the revenues that countries are able to collect. In 2015 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and UNDP launched the Tax Inspectors Without Borders initiative to meet the need among many countries for capacity building support. Two countries in the region, Cambodia and Viet Nam, are already engaging with the initiative; other countries could consider doing so too.

The cost of intra-regional transfers varies significantly, from less than 3 percent in some corridors to more than 14 percent in others. Other international groupings, notably the G20,3 have established targets to reduce the cost of transferring remittances to a maximum of 5 percent. ASEAN could consider establishing a similar target, while ensuring costs remain unchanged where they are already below 5 percent. Establish a regional framework for coordinating to reduce illicit finance. Illicit finance is a major drain on resources, impacting public revenues and reducing investment levels. Some countries in the region have signed up to international initiatives such as the BEPS initiative. Yet not all ASEAN countries are active in this agenda and implementation of measures to reduce illicit finance is at an early stage. To expedite this and broaden coverage across the region, ASEAN countries could consider a regional agreement to implement certain measures such as the automatic exchange of tax information and sharing of country- by-country reports within the region as a first step. 3 See: G20, \u20182014 Brisbane.

Private investment has important impacts on many aspects of sustainable development, though governments often emphasize economic gains and job creation over others such as skills development, technology and innovation, resilience and environmental protection. Establishing more holistic policy that addresses the contributions from private investment on these wider aspects of sustainable development can help maximize its impact. Relatedly, governments could centralize or strengthen coordination on policy toward the business environment to ensure that reforms in one area are not limited by lack of progress in others. With Chinese investment set to be scaled up in coming years, now is the time for the region to agree a framework with China that can maximize its sustainable development impact. ASEAN and China have agreed to develop a joint vision for the China-ASEAN strategic partnership to 2030 and work toward a target of two-way investment totalling $150 billion by 2020.4 This represents a significant scaling up of current levels: Chinese investment in ASEAN totalled $14.6 billion in 2015. Ensuring the strategies that govern how this financing is invested align with existing ASEAN regional and national strategies is essential for enhancing its effectiveness. Putting in place a strong, jointly managed monitoring and review framework is important to make sure that the impact of investments is understood and maximized. Such a framework should monitor the impact on all aspects of sustainable development and align with SDG indicators. The joint vision for 2030 could also consider measures to channel investment to the ASEAN countries most in need of infrastructure and other investment. Domestic revenue mobilisation is critical for ensuring sufficient resources are available for public services and investment \u2013 countries should plan for and monitor the impact of revenue models on sustainable development outcomes as well as on the revenues they raise. Tax and revenue systems can have significant distributional impacts and create incentives that shift the way resources are invested and business models operate. Governments should link the objectives of their revenue authorities and revenue strategies not only to volumes of revenue raised, but also to measures of distributional and wider sustainable development impacts in line with their national development plans. Governments should plan ahead for the time when international public finance (including climate finance) is likely to be scaled back. As countries graduate from least developed country status or move up income groups they face reduced access to international concessional public finance. Planning ahead is vital to manage the transition sustainably. Building the political will to fund the continuation of key initiatives takes time \u2013 and building the technical capacity in areas such as climate adaptation and mitigation can take even longer. It is wise to use international public finance, while it is available, to develop the capacity needed for the long term. 4 This commitment was made at the 23rd China-ASEAN Senior Officials\u2019 Consultations held in Guiyang, Guangxi on 19 May 2017. 7 Strengthening integrated national financing frameworks to deliver the 2030 Agenda Recommendations to strengthen integrated national financing frameworks Governments should establish a stronger basis for financing policies by systematically costing development plans and policies, and establishing comprehensive, long-term financing strategies.

Building on such cost estimates, countries could develop overarching financing strategies that outline the investments and spending that are needed from all resources and types of finance. These would outline the types of finance instruments required, provide a basis for managing trade-offs between debt and non-debt instruments, and address changes of a more structural nature that need to be implemented to unlock new sources of finance. Countries can strengthen platforms for engaging in dialogue with non-state actors and systems for monitoring the impact and contributions of all types of finance. Dialogue is essential for building trust and shared ownership between government and business, civil society, development partners and other actors. Establishing platforms for systematic dialogue with these actors about the roles they can play in driving forward sustainable development progress and about how government can support them in this is important for refining and strengthening government policy. Developing mechanisms for monitoring the investments made by all resources, the outcomes those investments generate and the contribution those outcomes make toward headline sustainable development targets would further help governments across the region understand and develop policy to maximize the impact of all types of finance. Countries should complete full development finance assessment processes. The development finance assessment and integrated financing solutions process has been designed to help governments identify areas for strengthening their management of all resources for the SDGs, using the lens of the integrated national financing framework. The development finance assessment offers a \u2018big picture\u2019 perspective that aggregates and assesses analysis across all types of finance and the policy and institutional structures used to govern them. This can be followed by ongoing support for priority reforms designed to generate and realign resources, avoid future expenditures, deliver better and strengthen transparency and accountability.5 At the regional level, ASEAN should establish an integrated national financing framework peer review mechanism, and a knowledge sharing platform on financing for sustainable development, to facilitate deeper dialogue and lesson sharing that strengthens the approach to financing across the ASEAN region. Experiences of financing across the region are rich and varied, and there is clearly strong demand for deeper intra-regional dialogue and sharing of knowledge, lessons and experience. Indeed, many governments indicated a desire during the project to learn how their regional neighbours have approached common financing challenges, policies and institutional reform priorities. An integrated national financing framework peer review mechanism would facilitate direct knowledge sharing between the ministries responsible for managing financing strategies in governments across the region. It would involve peer review teams undertaking a detailed review of the processes, systems and policies governing a country\u2019s overall financing strategy. These teams would include a small group 5 See more at: AP-DEF and UNDP, Development Finance Assessment and Integrated Financing Solutions, 2017. http:// procurement-notices.undp.org/view_file.cfm?doc_id=117734 Financing the SuStainable Development goalS in aSean 8 of senior officials responsible for designing and overseeing the implementation of policy in their own governments, with a spread of officials from multiple governments and specialists covering all areas of financing. Peer reviews would be requested by governments but there would be value in all countries undertaking them, both to learn and to share lessons. Similar mechanisms have been effective in helping OECD countries strengthen budgeting systems, African countries strengthen governance and Pacific Islands countries strengthen mechanisms for public finance management and development effectiveness. Establishing a knowledge sharing platform on financing for sustainable development that captures trends in financing alongside analysis of policy and institutional issues in the region could further strengthen the exchange of experiences and information. Such a platform would help policymakers better understand trends in the financing landscape and the challenges and opportunities that their neighbours face. It would provide a platform for sharing debate on policy approaches and understanding where and why particular policy or institutional reform approaches have or have not worked in a neighbouring context. 9 Strengthening integrated national financing frameworks to deliver the 2030 Agenda Introduction The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is a diverse and rapidly changing region. Progress is being made at pace across many aspects of sustainable development, though challenges remain if countries are to realize the visions of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and ASEAN 2025. Vulnerability is high and access to health care and education and other services is unequal, even among much of the emerging middle class. Transitioning to green growth paths will require investment and structural adjustment. Realising the visions of the 2030 Agenda and ASEAN 2025 (\u2018Vision 2025\u2019) necessitates the right scale and mix of finance.

The current finance landscape in the region offers both opportunities and challenges for financing sustainable development. Overall, finance is growing and diversifying rapidly \u2013 domestic resources, intra-regional flows and finance from China and other countries outside the region are being scaled up. Yet the scale and mix of resources available is uneven across the region \u2013 for some countries expediting growth in revenues or stimulating private investment from a low base will be key challenges. The Addis Ababa Action Agenda calls for countries to establish integrated national financing frameworks that can support cohesive, nationally-owned sustainable development strategies. An integrated national financing framework offers a prompt for governments to review the policies and institutional structures that they have in place, and guide on how to do so. It can also be used to support reforms designed to strengthen a holistic approach toward managing and mobilising all types of financing \u2013 domestic, international, public, private \u2013 for sustainable development results. This report draws together findings from a series of development finance assessments undertaken as part of a project to contribute to the ASEAN-China-UNDP Symposium on Financing the implementation of the SDGs in ASEAN, which was held in Chiang Rai, Thailand, in August 2017. The assessments undertaken in ASEAN member states analysed the finance challenges and opportunities that countries face. They used the lens of the integrated national financing framework to assess the policies and institutional structures that governments have in place for financing the Sustainable Development Goal (SDGs). These assessments and this report build on complementary work by the Asian Development Bank, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and others, that focus on particular parts of the financing landscape. The report and assessments add value by drawing together analysis of the finance landscape as a whole and using the lens of the integrated national financing framework to focus on the steps that governments can take to finance implementation of the SDGs. The analysis and recommendations presented aim to inform dialogue and thinking about how to strengthen the approach toward financing for the SDGs and Vision 2025 across the region. Recommendations are given at the end of the report about steps that can be taken at the country and regional level to support this objective. Financing the SuStainable Development goalS in aSean 10 PART I: ASEAN REGIONAL CONTEXT Chapter 1: The sustainable development outlook Home to over 600 million people, ASEAN is a diverse and rapidly changing region. Rapid advances are being made across the economic, environmental and social dimensions of sustainable development, though significant challenges remain. The 2030 Agenda sets a vision of progress across these three dimensions through 17 SDGs. This agenda provides an ambitious framework for the ASEAN region to strive toward, and aligns closely with the region\u2019s Vision 2025. At the time of writing in 2017 many countries are still in the process of building or adapting structures to enable comprehensive reporting on SDG progress. Four countries from the region have published initial voluntary national reviews of progress against the SDGs.6 This chapter outlines the key trends and outlook against the social, economic and environmental dimensions of the 2030 Agenda and SDG targets and considers where finance is a constraint to further progress. It analyses the challenge of leaving no one behind in the ASEAN region and assesses the implications of demographic trends. It also presents an overview of policy priorities at the regional level compared with the 2030 Agenda. This chapter thereby forms a basis for analysis through the rest of the report about the finance that could be available to address the challenges of this sustainable development outlook and the policies and institutional structures that governments can use to mobilize that finance. Social development The social development dimensions of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs overlap strongly with the objectives of the ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community (see chapter 2). ASEAN countries are making rapid progress in areas such as poverty reduction while in others, such as nutrition, aspects of health, education and gender equality, the region has a long way to go or remains behind others globally. Limits to the financing available for these priorities both individually and, given the significant interconnections between them, collectively, may constrain further progress.

Poverty rates are falling in Indonesia by an average 10 to 15 percent a year,10 with over 40 million people lifted out of poverty between 2006 and 2014. In Viet Nam poverty rates fell from over 30 percent of the population before 2004 to 3 percent in 2014, though the pace of poverty reduction has slowed since 2010. An estimated 36 million people in the region still live below the international poverty line11 (5 percent of the global total). Almost 90 percent of these people live in Indonesia or the Philippines. Poverty rates are on a downward but fluctuating trend in the Philippines having decreased, from 17 percent in 2005 to 12 percent in 2013, a trend that national measures show has continued since.12 Despite rapid progress against income-based measures of poverty, many people remain vulnerable to falling back into extreme poverty. Financing is vital in building resilience and protecting the progress already made, through mechanisms such as social protection measures or in stimulating the kind of private investment that can create decent jobs.
