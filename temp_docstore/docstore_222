The guideline states that MSM, transgender, and transsexual people have the right to comprehensive access to HIV services free of stigma and discrimination. Although there is a supportive national policy, however, there are no administrative penalties or other prescribed sanctions against people who commit acts of discrimination. The Government of Indonesia is addressing HIV issues affecting MSM and waria through the development of an MSM programme as a component of the National HIV and AIDS Strategy and Action Plan 2010\u20132014. The National AIDS Commission engages with the Indonesian national network of MSM and transgender people, GWL\u2013INA, which participated in the development of the Action Plan. GWL- INA advocates for comprehensive HIV programming for MSM and transgender people, and for building community knowledge about health and rights. GWL-INA members represent the network in national consultations and is a member of the National AIDS Commission. Legal recognition of transgender status Legal recognition of transgender people is required to support their status as equal citizens. Transgender people are more likely to access HIV prevention, treatment, care, and support services if laws and policies recognize their gender identity rights. Further, the ability to be identified in legal documents according to a person\u2019s gender identity reduces the stigma associated with transgender status. Notably, the laws of Indonesia and Singapore enable post-operative transgender people to change their gender on identity documents and to marry.72 However, transgender people are not given legal status in Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, or Timor-Leste. Laws of the Philippines and Viet Nam enable post-operative intersex73 people to change their legal gender, but this does not extend to male-to-female or female-to-male transgender people.74 In Malaysia, in theory the National Registration Regulations enable post-operative transgender people to change their legal gender status with appropriate medical evidence.

In Viet Nam, drug use is not a criminal offence but is an administrative violation, resulting in detention for compulsory detoxification for one to two years. In Cambodia, although drug possession is illegal, police are directed not to arrest people for possession of small quantities of drugs for personal use in HIV \u2018hot spot\u2019 areas (see discussion of the Police Community Partnership Initiative, chapter 8.1). Effective responses to HIV among people who inject drugs require support from laws that facilitate harm reduction interventions, particularly legal frameworks for needle and syringe programmes and opioid substitution therapy (OST). Although the overall legal framework relating to illicit drugs in ASEAN states is informed by a \u2018war on drugs\u2019 approach in which drug possession and/or use is criminalized, laws and policies increasingly also support harm reduction approaches. Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam are implementing OST programmes, such as methadone maintenance therapy or buprenorphine maintenance. Needle and syringe programmes also operate in these countries, although the scale of these programmes varies. Cambodia, Lao PDR, the Philippines, and Thailand have only small-scale needle and syringe programmes. In Thailand, the pilot needle and syringe programme is implemented by PSI, an international NGO. Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Viet Nam have well-established programmes that are being scaled- up as components of the national HIV response, supported by government policy.

Provisions of the Cambodian Law on the Control of Drugs 2012 that address harm reduction measures to prevent HIV and other harms are: \u2022 Article 100, which provides that the state shall ensure the provision of services and national policies to reduce health, social, and economic harms on individuals, communities, and societies due to drugs. \u2022 Article 4, which defines \u201charm reduction service\u201d as a service, programme, or any activity with the benefit of reducing harms caused by drug abuse to human health, communities, the economy, and society as a whole. \u2022 Article 56, which provides a legal framework for authorization of needle and syringe programmes. Article 56 also makes it an offence for the keeping or transporting of equipment used for consumption of narcotics, with penalties of fines and/or imprisonment from one to five years. Article 56 specifies that the offence does not apply to the provision of health care services or harm reduction services for drug users authorized by a competent authority. Indonesia introduced a legal framework for needle and syringe programmes through the Decision of the Minister of Health Number 576 of 2006 regarding the Technical Guideline for Narcotics Harm Reduction and the Regulation of the Coordinating Minister on People\u2019s Welfare Number 02 on Harm Reduction of 2007. Further support was provided by the recognition of the treatment needs of people who use drugs in the Narcotics Law 2009 and circulars issued by the Supreme Court to the judiciary supporting diversion of drug users to treatment rather than sentencing to imprisonment.87 Since 2005 the Government of Malaysia has taken a series of measures to ensure the engagement of law enforcement personnel in the national harm reduction response. In 2005 a National Task Force on Harm Reduction was established to provide oversight of the national programme, with representatives from the National Anti-Drugs Agency, the Ministry of Health, Royal Malaysian Police, Prisons Department, academics, and NGOs. A standard operating procedure was developed between the Malaysian Ministry of Health and the Royal Malaysian Police to guide police in dealing with drug users attending methadone clinics and needle syringe exchange sites.88 National Needle and Syringe Exchange Programme Guidelines for Police were issued in Malaysia in 2006, encouraging police to be 86 Kamarulzaman, A.

Thailand\u2019s Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act BE 2545 (2002) provides alternatives to prison with the aim of diverting people convicted of minor drug offences into treatment programmes. Although the Office of Narcotics Control Board supports expansion of the country\u2019s pilot needle and syringe programme, there is no legal framework for needle and syringe distribution as a harm reduction approach. The Narcotics Law Reform Subcommittee of the Law Reform Commission of Thailand is assessing options for introducing a national harm reduction legal and policy framework.90 In the Philippines, the proposed new Revised Philippine HIV and AIDS Policy and Program Act of 2013 (House Bill 1593) seeks to introduce harm reduction as a component of the national HIV response by inclusion of the following provisions: \u2022 \u2018Harm reduction\u2019 refers to evidence-based policies, programmes and approaches that aim to reduce the harmful consequences on health, social relations, and economic conditions that are associated with the use of psychoactive substances [section 3]. \u2022 Harm reduction: The Department of the Interior and Local Government and the Department of Health shall establish a human rights and evidence-based HIV prevention policy and programme for people who use and inject drugs [section 8(f)].

Indonesia and Malaysia have introduced prison MMT programmes, and a small pilot programme has been implemented in Fang Prison, in Thailand\u2019s Chiang Mai province.94 Malaysia established MMT programmes in two prisons in the states of Kelantan (2008) and Selangor (2009). Standard operating procedures were established between the Prisons Department and Ministry of Health. Community-based MMT programmes were also established to integrate treatment activities after the prisoners\u2019 release. A study of Malaysia\u2019s prison MMT programme recommended that MMT should be provided throughout the period of incarceration to ensure continuity of care for programme participants, to ensure adequate MMT dosing before release from prison, and to avoid the risky injection of opioids within prisons. The study found that linking prisoners to MMT in the community requires strong relationships between prison clinics and community-based clinics and improved communication between prison and police authorities.95 Kerobokan Prison in Bali, Indonesia, provides prisoners with access to condoms, MMT, antiretroviral therapy, and bleach to clean injecting equipment (in the absence of sterile needles and syringes).96 MMT is available in at least four other prisons in Indonesia.97 Laws that impede needle and syringe distribution In some countries, possession of needles and syringes without authorization is a criminal offence (see Table 4). In Thailand, possession of needles and syringes can be used as evidence of the offence of instigating another person to use narcotics. These offences are an obstacle to implementation of needle and syringe programmes because they place people at risk of arrest for distributing or carrying clean injecting equipment. 94 Macdonald, V. and Nacapew, S., op cit. 95 Wickersham, J. et al., op cit. 96 Lai, G., Asmin, F., Birgin, R.

Regional roundtable participants have included representatives from UN agencies as well as the governments of Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam.102 Malaysia is investing in evidence-informed, community-based treatment approaches through establishing voluntary \u2018Cure and Care Clinics\u2019 to replace compulsory centres. These clinics provide drug treatment alternatives and HIV-prevention, care, treatment, and support services. Cambodia is scaling-up community-based drug treatment, while maintaining some provisional drug treatment and rehabilitation centres. In Hanoi, Viet Nam, a pilot drug referral programme involves referral of some people who inject drugs to local community-based methadone programmes as an alternative to compulsory drug treatment centres.103 In 2012 the United Nations called on governments to implement voluntary, evidence-informed, and rights-based health and social services to address drug use in the community.

Age restrictions on access to harm reduction services There is often a lack of clarity about the legal rights of young people to access services related to drug use without parental involvement. At the same time, it is well understood that some young people will be deterred from accessing harm reduction services if they fear disclosure of their drug use to their parents or guardians. In Viet Nam, these competing issues have been addressed by the 2007 Decree on Implementation of the Law on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, which states that treatment of addiction with substitution drugs is provided only to persons who voluntarily commit in writing to adhere to the treatment guidelines. For persons under 16 years, their parents or lawful guardians shall express their consent and commit in writing to adhere to the treatment guidelines.105 Viet Nam\u2019s Decree Regulating Substitution Treatment of Opioid Addiction of 2012 provides further detail in relation to parental consent for OST for opiate dependent persons under 16 years.106 104 Committee on the Rights of the Child (2013), General Comment No. 15 (2013) on the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health (article 24), CRC/C/GC/15. 105 Article 10(2) Decree No. 108/2007/Nd-Cp of June 26, 2007, Detailing the Implementation of a Number of Articles of the Law on HIV/AIDS Prevention And Control. 106 Decree No: 96/2012/ND-CP, articles 5, 7, and 8. 43 TABLE 5 Age of legal capacity to consent independently to an HIV test Country Age Legal restrictions Cambodia Law on the Prevention and Control of HIV/AIDS (2002), article 19. 18, subject to exception if in minor\u2019s best interest.

This subject shall include the causes, modes of transmission, means of prevention, consequences of HIV/AIDS, and fact about STIs, especially focusing on the life skills in accordance with promoting social value through introduction into the curriculum of all educational establishments, including non-formal education systems. 2 Organize workshops and trainings of trainers on HIV/AIDS prevention and control for teachers and other instructors who will be assigned to teach on the subject. 3 Mobilize communities, associations, and organizations for their involvement in the design and implementation of HIV/AIDS education and information dissemination programmes. Indonesia In 1997, Indonesia\u2019s Ministry of Education and Culture issued a decree on HIV education in schools requiring all levels of the education system to improve knowledge on HIV, to improve awareness of healthy and responsible behaviours, and to engage in activities to prevent the disease. 108 The decree further required HIV prevention education to be integrated into relevant subject matters in the curriculum of elementary to secondary education and through extra-curricular activities. The decree also recommended that teachers and education administrators be trained on HIV. However, since the Regional Autonomy Law of 1999 came into force, the education system has been decentralized, which has limited the impact of the 1997 decree. In 2008 a further decree was issued requiring HIV and drug abuse prevention as mandatory educational activities.109 The Philippines Section 4 of the Philippines AIDS Prevention and Control Act of 1998 (RA 8504) provides as follows: HIV/AIDS Education in Schools: 108 Ministry of Education and Culture, Decree No. 9/U/1997 on HIV Prevention through Education. 109 Ministry of Education and Culture, Decree No. 39 on Guidance and Supervision of Student Activities.

These generally relate to applicants for permanent residence, work visas, or other long-term visas, or to people seeking to renew work visas. TABLE 7 HIV-related travel or migration restrictions Brunei Darussalam HIV testing is required for long-term work visas and student visas. An HIV test is normally required prior to departure at an authorized facility in the sending country for new applicants and repeated upon arrival within a few weeks in Brunei Darussalam. An HIV test is required every two years for foreign workers. An application for a long-term work or student visa will be rejected and the visa may be cancelled if the HIV test is positive. Registered spouses and children of Bruneian citizens are exempted from this requirement. Foreigners who are known to have HIV are not restricted from visiting Brunei Darussalam on a short-term visa. Indonesia As of 2010, a drug test and HIV test may be required by the Education Department to obtain or renew a visa to work as a teacher, as required by Regulation 5(3) of the Regulation of the Minister of Education Number 66/2009. Malaysia According to the Immigration Act 1959/63 (section 8), prohibited immigrants include \u201cany person suffering from a contagious or infectious disease which makes his presence in Malaysia dangerous to the community\u201d and any person who refuses to submit to a medical examination after being required to do so. There are no restrictions for entry for short-term visits. HIV tests are required for migrant workers. Migrant workers who want to work in Malaysia must present a negative HIV test result in their home country, and after their arrival in Malaysia they may be required to undergo a second test. Unskilled migrant workers are required to be tested for HIV annually. If the test is positive, the worker may be deported with three days\u2019 notice. Singapore HIV testing is required for stays beyond 30 days, and applicants for the following visa types: Social Visit Pass, Employment Pass, Long Term Immigration Pass, and Permanent Residence. Prohibited immigrants are defined by the Immigration Act 1959/1963 [section 8(3)(ba)] to include persons with HIV. 49 Protective measures The Philippine AIDS Prevention and Control Act 1998 makes it unlawful to refuse entry into the Philippines on the grounds of HIV. Section 48 of the Act (Restrictions on Travel and Habitation) provides: HIV is not among the dangerous, loathsome or contagious diseases referred to in the Immigration Code (Section 29). The freedom of abode, lodging and travel of a person with HIV shall not be abridged. No person shall be quarantined, placed in isolation, or refused lawful entry into or deported from Philippine territory on account of his/her actual, perceived or suspected HIV status. Cambodia\u2019s Law on Prevention and Control of HIV/AIDS (2002) states: It is strictly prohibited to undertake compulsory HIV testing for the exercise of freedom of abode or travel (article 20). A person with HIV/AIDS shall have full right to freedom of abode and travel. No person shall be quarantined, placed in isolation or refused abode, accompany or expulsion due to the actual, perceived or suspected HIV/AIDS status of that person or his/her family members (article 38). Thailand does not impose HIV-related travel restrictions and provides universal health coverage. Thailand removed HIV from the list of prohibited diseases for long-term visas in 1992.110 In 2013, Thailand introduced a policy to provide health care services to migrant workers (including anti-retroviral drugs for people living with HIV). Migrant workers can apply for health insurance for an annual fee of 2,800 baht (about USD$86).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "03a869c9-7d39-4b49-952b-19142554d19f": {"__data__": {"id_": "03a869c9-7d39-4b49-952b-19142554d19f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-law-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV and the Law in South-East Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-law-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "12fdc57cbe6d7c9366fc9b93af47eacd3d5b8d127f2c2ead1c3103675d97bead"}, "2": {"node_id": "aabf5fb1-4f21-4e23-a855-b8c7b33985ed", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-law-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cd83865ab8975af2499cbc02f35d96bec24a8ca2575dac66260f0cabad8d693a"}}, "hash": "123774a6e5d1d3bd023dcf5bfe40e7f53c99755ce336f9c63e42c5399caecb3b", "text": "It is estimated that two to three million migrants, mainly from Myanmar, Cambodia, and Lao PDR, are living in Thailand.111 There is no evidence that travel restrictions prevent HIV transmission or protect public health.

Laws, policies, and law enforcement practices that are helpful to HIV responses and protection of the human rights of people living with HIV and other key populations include: Protective laws and policies i Comprehensive national HIV laws in Cambodia, Lao PDR, the Philippines, and Viet Nam provide people living with HIV with protection from discrimination, prohibition of compulsory testing, and rights to confidentiality. These national HIV laws also provide a framework for HIV prevention, including education and the prevention of mother-to-child transmission.115 ii Some countries have developed national polices to address the needs and rights of specific key populations, such as Cambodia\u2019s National Guideline for STI and HIV/AIDS Responses Among MSM, Transgender and Transsexual People and the Philippines\u2019 Comprehensive Package of Services for Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) and Transgender Populations. Cambodia includes the needs of people living with HIV, orphans and vulnerable children, and key populations in national social protection policies. Cambodia\u2019s National Social Protection Strategy for the Poor and Vulnerable (2011\u20132015) includes home-based care and referral support for people living with HIV and a comprehensive package of care for vulnerable women and children, including poor female-headed households. iii Ministerial decrees in Indonesia protect people living with HIV from discrimination in the workplace and from health care services.116 iv Legislation in Timor-Leste prohibits compulsory HIV testing and discrimination on the grounds of health status in the workplace.117 v Legislation in Brunei Darussalam and Singapore provides protections to people living with HIV from breach of confidentiality in the context of health care.118 115 See Cambodia, Law on the Prevention and Control of HIV/AIDS of 2002; Lao PDR, Law on HIV/AIDS Control and Prevention of 2010; Philippines, Philippine AIDS Prevention and Control Act 1998 (Republic Act 8504); and Viet Nam, Law on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, 2006. 116 Decree of the Minister of Manpower and Transmigration on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control in the Workplace, No: Kep. 68/Men/2004; Health Ministerial Regulation No. 21/2013 on the HIV and AIDS Response. 117 Labour Code (2012), articles 6(2) and 72. 118 Infectious Diseases Act (Brunei Darussalam), section 26; Infectious Diseases Act (Singapore), section 25. 52 HIV AND THE LAW IN SOUTH-EAST ASIA CHAPTEr 8: CONCLUSIONS vi Legislation provides that young people can consent to an HIV test independent of their parents at the age of 14 in Lao PDR119 and 16 in Viet Nam.120 The law in Viet Nam provides that persons under 16 can access OST with parental consent.121 vii Legislation in Viet Nam requires the Government to implement harm reduction interventions, including needle and syringe programmes for people who inject drugs and condom programmes for key populations, and to protects outreach workers and peer educators from prosecution (see p.56 \u201cLegal protections of HIV educators and outreach workers\u201d).122 Viet Nam also regulates community availability of OST.123 viii In 2012, Viet Nam introduced a law to phase out compulsory detention of sex workers in rehabilitation centres by 2013.124 ix Malaysia is phasing out compulsory drug rehabilitation centres in favour of voluntary treatment as the preferred approach for managing drug dependence. x Some countries have introduced administrative measures to ensure law enforcement practices support condom programming.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "df8faa2c-a42d-424a-b14e-c5f18c1c2aa9": {"__data__": {"id_": "df8faa2c-a42d-424a-b14e-c5f18c1c2aa9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-law-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV and the Law in South-East Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-law-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "00224e18daed886c5ede76ba3ae95c8f00b0eebef89e012a3ad4c3af33ddbbe8"}, "2": {"node_id": "1960f3af-01bb-4a88-b1a9-ffac889bc039", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-law-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9ee44ac2a23cdd1f74aad46957441fc1f701367993dddcf0b2a12e78f0480a75"}}, "hash": "ff45d9c2c01128e2fc304234ccd8277b2244cf0957472eeec7b34530fcc65116", "text": "x Some countries have introduced administrative measures to ensure law enforcement practices support condom programming.

PCPI creates partnerships through capacity building and facilitates dialogue during coordination meetings at the community level. Sensitization workshops and trainings for police are co-facilitated by government and FHI 360. Police conduct coordination meetings every two months at the post level and quarterly meetings at the sub-district and municipal levels to address barriers to HIV efforts. 127 UNAIDS (2013), National HIV Legal Review Report (unpub. draft). 128 International Development Law Organization (2010), Stakeholder report: Rapid needs assessment of the legal needs of people living with HIV and key populations in Jakarta, Rome: IDLO. 129 UNAIDS (2014), National HIV Legal Review Report (in print). 130 UNDP (2013), Sex work and the law in Asia and the Pacific, Bangkok: UNDP, p. 5. 54 HIV AND THE LAW IN SOUTH-EAST ASIA CHAPTEr 8: CONCLUSIONS In the HIV \u2018hot spot\u2019 areas where PCPI is implemented, police are directed not to arrest people for possession of small quantities of drugs for their personal use.

The programme builds upon an initiative to educate junior police cadets that started in 2012. Higher-level police officers are also being targeted to ensure sustainable integration of HIV and related human rights issues into the police training curriculum.134 To date, 40 police have been trained to provide training to junior police cadets, and focus group discussions were held with 60 commissioned police officers from multiple levels to inform the learning programme for senior police officers.

The Police Chief Commander in Nay Pyi Taw approved the initiative before it commenced, which made local police officers more willing to participate in the initiative, which educated police on issues related to condoms, HIV prevention, and the welfare and health needs of key populations. An Advocacy Information Pack was developed for sex workers, MSM, and transgender people, and education was provided to key populations on their right to carry condoms. Partnerships between local police, communities, and health programmes were aimed to encourage condom use and to reduce HIV transmission in key populations. Peer outreach workers assisted in educating police by describing examples of situations in which detention and arrest impeded HIV-prevention efforts and where good relationships with police assisted the distribution of condoms. The initiative resulted in increased communication between police and MSM, and some police even requested help to distribute condoms in their townships because sex workers had no access to condoms. Police agreed not to use condoms as evidence for arrest, and they acquired basic knowledge and skills in providing health and other referral information. Outreach staff reported less police harassment and more recognition of their work by police in the field. 136 See AIDS Project Management Group (2010), MSM Transgender Six City Project: Reference Guide, Bangkok: UNDP, p. 211. Legal protections for HIV educators and outreach workers Viet Nam Viet Nam provides the following legal protections to outreach workers and peer educators: Outreach workers are those who directly participate in implementing harm reduction intervention measures in the prevention of HIV transmission and are granted cards as provided by law. They include peer communicators and other volunteers. Outreach workers who participate in programs or projects on harm reduction interventions in the prevention of HIV transmission are entitled to: a Benefits and allowances from these programs and projects; b Protection by law when providing condoms, clean needles and syringes or treatment of addiction to opiate substances with substitution drugs for the following: 1 Sex workers and their customers; 2 Addicts to opiate substances; 3 HIV-infected persons; 4 Persons having homosexual relations; 5 Mobile population groups; 6 Persons having sexual relations with those specified above. The Philippines The Philippines is currently considering a bill that proposes to introduce the following provision: Immunity for HIV Educators, Licensed Social Workers, and Other HIV and AIDS Service Providers. Any person involved in the provision of HIV and AIDS services including peer educators shall be immune from suit, arrest or prosecution, and from civil, criminal or administrative liability, on the basis of their delivery of such services (as provided by the Act), or in relation to the legitimate exercise of protective custody of children, whenever applicable. The Department of Justice, the Department of Interior and Local Government and the Philippine National Police, in coordination with the Philippine National AIDS Council, shall develop the mechanism for the implementation of this provision.

Further, in some countries peer educators and outreach workers have also been harassed or arrested by police. Police violence against key populations contributes to HIV vulnerability and drives key populations underground, making them difficult for health services to reach them. iii Confiscation of condoms and needles and syringes Confiscation of condoms and/or needles and syringes by police as evidence of illegal conduct or to justify harassment and extortion is a widespread problem that denies key populations access to the vital means of HIV prevention. iv Mandatory or compulsory testing Mandatory or compulsory testing is generally inconsistent with a human rights-based approach to HIV because it violates the human rights to autonomy and privacy, and exposes people to the risk of discrimination. Laws and policies of several countries require HIV testing of migrants (Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia and Singapore). Premarital HIV testing is required of Muslim couples in Malaysia. v Compulsory rehabilitation centres Compulsory detention of sex workers and people who use drugs for the purpose of rehabilitation continues to be implemented in some countries. These centres are often stigmatizing, and detainees are vulnerable to human rights abuses, such as compulsory medical examinations and forced labour. There is generally very limited access to professional psychological support or HIV-prevention, treatment, care, and support services in these centres. Voluntary, community-based programmes are preferable to compulsory centres. 58 HIV AND THE LAW IN SOUTH-EAST ASIA CHAPTEr 8: CONCLUSIONS vi Lack of anti-discrimination laws Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and Timor-Leste do not have HIV-specific anti-discrimination laws. Only the Philippines has taken legislative action to address discrimination on the grounds of sexuality or transgender status, although this is limited to a few localities. Introduction of comprehensive discrimination protections for people living with HIV, and protections that also address discrimination on the grounds of sexuality and gender identity, would help to combat stigma and support increased access to health and HIV services. 60 HIV AND THE LAW IN SOUTH-EAST ASIA CHAPTEr 9: COUNTrY ExAMPLES Of PrOTECTIVE LEgISLATION 9.1 Laws prohibiting HIV-related discrimination 9.1.1 Cambodia Law on the Prevention and Control of HIV/AIDS 2002 Article 36 Discrimination in any form at pre- and post-employment, including hiring, promotion and assignment, or living in society based on the actual, perceived or suspected HIV/ AIDS status of an individual or his/her family members is strictly prohibited.

To ensure an effective, sustainable response to HIV that is consistent with human rights obligations, countries must ensure that in places of detention: 1 Necessary health care is available, including HIV-prevention and care services, regardless of laws criminalizing same-sex acts or harm reduction. 2 Such care includes provision of condoms, comprehensive harm reduction services, voluntary and evidence-based treatment for drug dependence, and antiretroviral therapy. 3 Any treatment offered must satisfy international standards of quality of care in detention settings. Health care services, including those specifically related to drug use and HIV, must be evidence-based, voluntary, and offered only where clinically indicated. Migrants To ensure an effective, sustainable response to HIV that is consistent with human rights obligations: 1 In matters relating to HIV and the law, countries should offer the same standard of protection to migrants, visitors, and residents who are not citizens as they do to their own citizens. 2 Countries must repeal travel and other restrictions that prohibit people living with HIV from entering a country and/or regulations that mandate HIV tests for foreigners within a country. 3 Countries must implement regulatory reform to allow for legal registration of migrants with health services and to ensure that migrants can access the same quality of HIV-prevention, treatment, and care services and commodities that are available to citizens. All HIV testing and STI screening for migrants 81 must be informed and voluntary, and all treatment and prophylaxis for migrants must be ethical and medically indicated.

should not be considered to be a condition that poses a threat to public health in relation to travel because, although it is infectious, the human immunodeficiency virus cannot be transmitted by the mere presence of a person with HIV in a country or by casual contact (through the air, or from common vehicles such as food or water). HIV is transmitted through specific behaviours, which are almost always private. Prevention thus requires voluntary acts and cannot be imposed. Restrictive measures can in fact run counter to public health interests, since exclusion of HIV-infected non-nationals adds to the climate of stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV and AIDS, and may thus deter nationals and non-nationals alike from coming forward to utilize HIV- prevention and care services. Moreover, restrictions against non-nationals living with HIV may create the misleading public impression that HIV/AIDS is a \u201cforeign\u201d problem that can be controlled through measures such as border controls, rather than through sound public health education and other prevention methods. 141 UNAIDS and International Organization for Migration (2004), UNAIDS IOM statement on HIV/AIDS-related travel restrictions, Geneva: UNAIDS and IOM. 85 Any HIV testing related to entry and stay should be done voluntarily, on the basis of informed consent. Adequate pre- and post-test counselling should be carried out, and confidentiality strictly protected. Restrictions against entry or stay that are based on health conditions, including HIV/AIDS, should be implemented in such a way that human rights obligations are met, including the principle of non- discrimination, non-refoulement142 of refugees, the right to privacy, protection of the family, protection of the rights of migrants, and protection of the best interests of the child. Compelling humanitarian needs should also be given due weight. Any health-related travel restriction should only be imposed on the basis of an individual interview/ examination. In case of exclusion, persons should be informed orally and in writing of the reasons for the exclusion. Comparable health conditions should be treated alike in terms of concerns about potential economic costs relating to the person with the condition. Those living with HIV/AIDS who seek entry for short- term or long-term stays should not be singled out for exclusion on this financial basis. Exclusion on the basis of possible costs to health care and social assistance related to a health condition should only be considered where it is shown, through individual assessment, that the person requires such health and social assistance; is likely in fact to use it in the relatively near future; has no other means of meeting such costs (e.g., through private or employment-based insurance, private resources, support from community groups); and that these costs will not be offset through benefits that exceed them, such as specific skills, talents, contribution to the labour force, payment of taxes, contribution to cultural diversity, and the capacity for revenue or job creation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a550915e-f8c1-45e8-b786-2ae98753026d": {"__data__": {"id_": "a550915e-f8c1-45e8-b786-2ae98753026d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-law-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV and the Law in South-East Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-law-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "954e2f66c7ee6e7a7af66e7561641c8055aa1f517bdd4d7d7d3e7f7a12a2af1c"}, "2": {"node_id": "4a89bfe0-352c-40cc-8616-63311f68e69e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-law-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f55e6284d5f7d73f7f5dfcd6cc7ca8d1177fcbd09296270c918da1a9c118c439"}}, "hash": "fd1d89cce6baa0fc2df8d0c51a31af70e11ba4e796e6084b455ca627a87f7ecc", "text": "If a person living with HIV/AIDS is subject to expulsion (deportation), such expulsion (deportation) should be consistent with international legal obligations, including entitlement to due process of law and access to the appropriate means to challenge the expulsion.

ILO, OHCHR, UNDP, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF, UNODC, UN Women, WFP, WHO, and UNAIDS, March 2012. United Nations entities call on States to close compulsory drug detention and rehabilitation centres and implement voluntary, evidence-informed, and rights-based health and social services in the community. The continued existence of compulsory drug detention and rehabilitation centres, where people who are suspected of using drugs or being dependent on drugs, people who have engaged in sex work, or children who have been victims of sexual exploitation are detained without due process in the name of \u201ctreatment\u201d or \u201crehabilitation\u201d, is a serious concern. Compulsory drug detention and rehabilitation centres raise human rights issues and threaten the health of detainees, including through increased vulnerability to HIV and tuberculosis (TB) infection. Criteria for detention of individuals in these centres vary within and among countries. However, such detention often takes place without the benefit of sufficient due process, legal safeguards, or judicial review. The deprivation of liberty without due process is an unacceptable violation of internationally recognized human rights standards. Furthermore, detention in these centres has been reported to involve physical and sexual violence, forced labour, sub-standard conditions, denial of health care, and other measures that violate human rights. There is no evidence that these centres represent a favourable or effective environment for the treatment of drug dependence, for the rehabilitation of individuals who have engaged in sex work, or for children who have been victims of sexual exploitation, abuse, or the lack of adequate care and protection. The UN entities which have signed on to this statement call on States that operate compulsory drug detention and rehabilitation centres to close them without delay and to release the individuals detained. Upon release, appropriate health care services should be provided to those in need of such services, on a voluntary basis, at community level. These services should include evidence-informed drug dependence treatment; HIV and TB prevention, treatment, care, and support; as well as health, legal, and social services to address physical and sexual violence and enable reintegration. The UN stands ready to work with States as they take steps to close compulsory drug detention and rehabilitation centres and to implement voluntary, ambulatory, residential, and evidence-informed alternatives in the community. 87 Where a State is unable to close the centres rapidly, without undue delay, we urge that the following be established immediately: \u2022 A process to review the detention of those in the centres to ensure that there is no arbitrary detention and that any detention is conducted according to relevant international standards of due process and provides alternatives to imprisonment. This review will allow the identification of those who should be released immediately and those who should be referred for voluntary, evidence-informed treatment programmes within the community. \u2022 A process to review conditions in compulsory drug detention and rehabilitation centres with a view to immediately improving those conditions so as to meet relevant international standards applicable in closed settings, including access to quality and evidence-informed health care, social and education services, and the elimination of inhumane and degrading treatment and forced labour, until the centres are closed. \u2022 Provision of health care services pending closure of the centres, including for treatment of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), TB, and opportunistic infections, as well as health and legal services to respond to physical and sexual violence. \u2022 Judicial and other independent oversight and reporting over the review and closure process of the centres. \u2022 A moratoria on further admission into compulsory drug detention and rehabilitation centres of people who use drugs, people who have engaged in sex work, and children who have been the victims of sexual exploitation. Evidence demonstrates that the most effective responses to drug dependence and the health- related harms associated with it, such as HIV infection, require treating drug dependence as a health condition through evidence-informed and rights-based approaches, which in many cases need to be", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d1d31b0-8932-47b2-9505-7dac6c17007d": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d1d31b0-8932-47b2-9505-7dac6c17007d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-law-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV and the Law in South-East Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-law-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "599115557723c31f03ef98ab14694feed36e936305662b9bc35fe237c4f4c993"}}, "hash": "599115557723c31f03ef98ab14694feed36e936305662b9bc35fe237c4f4c993", "text": "established. All health care interventions, including drug dependence treatment, should be carried out on a voluntary basis with informed consent, except in clearly defined exceptional circumstances in conformity with international human rights law that guarantees such provisions are not subject to abuse. Responses to drug use and health- related harms associated with it should include evidenced- informed prevention and treatment of HIV, other STIs, and TB, for those engaged in drug use. Where sex workers benefit from due process, protection from discrimination and violence, and access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support, they have been able to dramatically reduce their vulnerability and that of their clients to HIV and other STIs. In the case of children under the age of 18 years, the most effective and appropriate responses are those that are family-based and build on the strengths of local communities.

Children who are, or have been, involved in sex work should be treated as child survivors of commercial sexual exploitation, in accordance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) and the ILO Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No 182), not as offenders liable to criminal penalties. Those children who are dependent on drugs should benefit from rights-based and evidence-informed programmes to facilitate their recovery and reintegration into families and communities. States increasingly acknowledge the concerns associated with these compulsory drug detention and rehabilitation centres, including their lack of effectiveness in preventing relapse, their high costs, and their potential negative impact on efforts to ensure universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care, and support. We note with appreciation that some countries are in the process of scaling-down the number of such centres and building greater capacity for voluntary, evidence-informed, community- based approaches. These positive steps are critical to expanding understanding and building support for an approach to drug dependence, sex work and child sexual exploitation that is based on available scientific and medical evidence, ensures the protection of human rights and enhances public health. We are committed to work with countries to find alternatives to compulsory drug detention and rehabilitation centres, including through technical assistance, capacity building, and advocacy. Forms of support might include the following: \u2022 Sharing of information and good practices on voluntary, evidence-informed, and community- and rights-based programmes for people who use drugs, those who engage in sex work, and children who have been victims of sexual exploitation.. \u2022 Dialogue with policy makers to increase support for voluntary, evidence-informed, and rights-based treatment and programmes for drug dependence. \u2022 Multisectoral collaboration among law enforcement, health, judiciary, human rights, social welfare, and drug control institutions to assist in developing frameworks of action to support voluntary and community-based services for people who use drugs, those who engage in sex work, and children who have been victims of sexual exploitation; and. \u2022 Establishment of services to address the root causes of vulnerability, such as (e.g. poverty, gender inequality, and the lack of sufficient family and community support structures). 89 10.5 Report of the Special Rapporteur on Torture Report of the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, Juan E. M\u00e9ndez, 1 February 2013 143 Compulsory detention for medical reasons Para 87. The Special Rapporteur calls upon all States to: a Close compulsory drug detention and rehabilitation centres without delay and implement voluntary, evidence-based and rights-based health and social services in the community. Undertake investigations to ensure that abuses, including torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, are not taking place in privately run centres for the treatment of drug dependence; b Cease support for the operation of existing drug detention centres or the creation of new centres. Any decision to provide funding should be made only following careful risk assessment. If provided, any such funds should be clearly time limited and provided only on the conditions that the authorities (a) commit to a rapid process for closing drug detention centres and reallocating said resources to scaling up voluntary, community-based, evidence-based services for treatment of drug dependence; and (b) replace punitive approaches and compulsory elements to drug treatment with other, evidence-based efforts to prevent HIV and other drug-related harms.

At any given point in time, there are an estimated 54 million people on the move outside of their home countries within Asia and beyond, and almost half that number, are estimated to be women. Asia is one of the largest suppliers of international migrant women who serve as domestic workers1. Outside Asia, the countries of the Arab States region are the primary destination for a majority of migrant workers from the Philippines, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. The economic gains generated by migrant workers to both countries of origin and host countries are considerable reaching almost 8% of GDP in Sri Lanka and as high as 17% of the national GDP in the Philippines. Yet, there is a major disconnect between the economic contribution of migrant workers and the poor conditions and meager support many receive throughout their migration journey. A key issue of concern with cross border and overseas migration is HIV and AIDS. In recent years, an increasing number of migrant workers from Asia have been diagnosed with HIV in various countries in the Arab States. Deportations due to HIV status have resulted in severe economic loss for migrant workers and their families, who have been declared by local authorities as \u201cunfit\u201d to work abroad. Governments from Asian countries have also been concerned about this issue. The Ministers of Health from the Governments of Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, India, the Philippines and Bangladesh called for a meeting on the issue at the time of the World Health Assembly of 2007 highlighting the need to engage in inter regional dialogue with countries from the Arab States region to find ways to reduce the risks and vulnerabilities to HIV that migrant workers face.. The purpose of this study was commissioned to shed light on the complex relationship between migration and HIV vulnerability, with a special focus on the vulnerabilities faced by Asian migrant women. Through in-depth and focus group discussions, the study discloses the vulnerabilities that Asian migrant women encounter throughout the migration cycle. They often leave for overseas work under unsafe conditions, live in very difficult circumstances, and are often targets of sexual exploitation and violence before they depart, during their transit and stay in host countries and on return to their countries of origin. With little or no access to health services and social protection, these factors combine to make Asian women migrants highly vulnerable to HIV. Confronted with inadequate policies and legislation that are not enforceable in host countries, migrant women often have limited or no access to justice and redress mechanisms, especially in Gulf countries. If they are found HIV positive, they face deportation and back in their countries of origin they experience discrimination and social isolation in addition to the difficulty of finding alternative livelihoods. As the research shows, there are several good practices from both countries of origin and host countries that are making a difference to migrant\u2019s lives, from the bilateral agreements negotiated between the Philippines and host countries, to social protection afforded to migrants in Lebanon. It is the intention of this study to highlight emerging good practice, deepen our understanding of the linkages between HIV and migration to inform and shape more effective policy and programme responses for Asian migrant women that will ensure safe mobility with dignity, equity and justice.

Background The Arab States are the primary destinations for many migrant workers3 from various countries in Asia, including Bangladesh, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka. Of these migrants, many are women. For example, in 2005, 59 percent of Sri Lankan migrant workers were women, of which 90 percent were domestic workers, largely in the Arab States4. Since 2000, women have comprised 90 percent of the yearly deployment of new hires5 for service workers from the Philippines, of which 30 percent are employed as domestic help6. Similarly, between 1991 and 2007, 60 percent of women migrants from Bangladesh left to find employment in the Arab States7. Women migrants from the region generate substantial economic benefits both to their countries of origin and their host countries. Remittances from Filipinos working in the Arab States in 2007 amounted to $2.17 billion8. In Bangladesh, migrant workers sent back close to $1.4 billion from Saudi Arabia and $637 million from the UAe. Current remittances by migrant workers from Sri Lanka amount to $3 billion9. In terms of benefits to the host countries, women migrant workers supply much needed assistance in the domestic help sector while contributing to the countries\u2019 wealth generation process. Despite this substantial contribution, migrant workers, especially women, often migrate under unsafe conditions, live in very difficult circumstances, and are targets of sexual exploitation and violence. In addition, in all host countries studied, domestic workers are formally discriminated against, falling outside the ambit of local labour laws that protect the rights of migrant workers in other sectors. Hence, legislation and enforcement governing the scope of work, number of working hours, minimum wages, and leave and other entitlements of these domestic workers are practically non-existent. Unsafe migration, duress in the workplace, sexual exploitation (both in the home and host country), lack of legal coverage, and limited or no access to health and social services tend to make women migrants, especially in the domestic sector, particularly vulnerable to HIV. While migration is not a direct risk factor for HIV infection, there are economic, socio-cultural, and political factors in the migration process that make migrant workers particularly vulnerable. As it is often the case in countries with low HIV prevalence, such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka, migrant workers represent a large percentage of those identified as living with HIV, primarily as a result of compulsory HIV testing prior to departure and/or upon arrival. Cases of HIV among domestic workers have been recorded in a number of migrant-sending countries, including Indonesia, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka, among others. In the Philippines, according to the National HIV Registry of the Department of Health, 34 percent of the registered people living with HIV (PLHIV) were Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs); moreover, as of December 2007, women domestic workers comprised 17 percent of HIV cases among OFWs. The 2008 report of the Commission on AIDS in Asia notes that the HIV epidemic in the region depends to a considerable extent on what happens when men have disposable income and are traveling for work or are working overseas, as they constitute the largest demand for commercial sex10. 2. Purpose of the study In August 2007 the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), in close partnership with the Coordination of Action Research for AIDS and Mobility in Asia (CARAM-Asia), the Caritas Lebanon Migrant Center, and development partners such as the Joint UN Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS), International Organization for Migration (IOM), and the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFeM), conducted a qualitative study to deepen the understanding on the nexus between migration and HIV. The specific focus of the study was A.

The decision to focus primarily on women domestic workers was motivated by indicative data from the Philippines, which shows that 17 percent of HIV cases among OFWs are domestic workers (while 8 percent are entertainers),11 and by the unique nature of their work (considered as unskilled and with low wages), their working conditions, and their living arrangements (which restricts access to economic and social resources). This regional study utilized qualitative methods in data collection and analysis. Initial desk reviews were undertaken by the in-country research teams to compile existing literature on migration, including those identifying HIV and AIDS patterns and trends among women migrant workers to the Arab States. Relevant information on national policies, legislation, and programmes were also compiled. This was followed by focus group discussions (FGDs) and one-on-one in-depth interviews with 448 women migrant workers and 142 men migrant workers over a period of nine months, focusing on pre-departure, migration, and return experiences. One-on-one interviews were conducted with selected participants from FGDs and involved more in-depth discussions of migrant experiences and risks. Research participants included migrants living with HIV who had returned from the Arab States. Migrant and migrant returnee participants (who had not been home more than three years) were selected with the assistance of local NGOs in origin and host countries. In addition, key interviews were conducted with senior officials of the ministries of Health, Labour, and Foreign Affairs, as well as representatives of the National AIDS Authority, Bureau of Foreign employment, and the various embassies. Other key informants interviewed included service providers, relevant NGOs, and recruitment agencies in both origin and host countries. Interviews with key informants focused upon the realities of migrants and the respondent\u2019s perceptions/ on the vulnerabilities faced by migrant workers in four countries of origin: Bangladesh, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka; and in three host countries: Bahrain, Lebanon, and specifically Dubai in the United Arab emirates (UAe). In Bangladesh, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka the research concentrated on female migrant workers; in Pakistan, where women make up only 1 percent of migrant workers, the study focused on men migrant workers and the impact on their spouses upon their return. 2.1 Objectives By analyzing the economic, socio-cultural, and political factors that influence the vulnerability of migrant workers to HIV - especially women migrant workers - this study aims to aid the design of appropriate rights-based HIV prevention programmes. It also intends to identify emerging challenges and trends in the response to HIV and migration issues in host countries, particularly in the area of human rights and public health. The specific objectives of this study are: 1) Identify links between migration conditions and HIV vulnerability, with a focus on women. 2) Generate data on existing HIV responses, as well as challenges and gaps in both origin and host countries, with regards to prevention, care, and support. 3) Propose research, policy, and programme recommendations related to HIV prevention, care and support for women migrant workers. 2.2 Methodology Women migrant workers from three countries of origin (Bangladesh, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka) working in the domestic sector in three host countries (Bahrain, Lebanon, and Dubai, UAe), and men migrant workers from Pakistan working in two of the host countries (Bahrain and Dubai, UAe), were chosen as the focus for this seminal report on migration and HIV in Asia and the Arab States. The study initially began as a response to a satellite meeting on migration and HIV held during the 2007 World Health Assembly (WHA), which called for more research on the HIV vulnerabilities faced by migrant workers.

The situation was even more difficult in host countries because domestic workers were largely confined to their workplace and restricted by their contracts, though the researchers sought the support of NGOs wherever they existed. In addition, the reluctance to speak on record by officials and agents in some locations inhibited access to information for this study.

Key Findings Limited preparedness and poor access to information and services render migrant women vulnerable to HIV. The study found that the four countries of origin require migrant workers to go through a pre-departure training or briefing before they emigrate. However, the nature and extent of this training varies widely; in some cases, women migrant workers do not receive sexual and reproductive health information that includes awareness on HIV. Furthermore, attendance at pre-departure trainings is low: in Bangladesh only 9 percent of the respondents attended the pre-departure briefing; in Pakistan only 17 percent said they had undergone any pre-departure orientation. In Sri Lanka and the Philippines the percentages were higher, with 70 and 71 percent of respondents, respectively, saying they had attended these trainings/orientations. Knowledge among migrants concerning HIV and AIDS was found to vary from country to country. Although HIV training is part of the mandatory pre-departure migration programmes in Sri Lanka and the Philippines, over 50 percent of the Sri Lankan respondents believed that HIV could be transmitted by mosquitoes, and over 25 percent did not know that condoms could provide protection from HIV. Among the Filipino migrants interviewed in the host countries, 84 percent were aware that HIV is sexually transmitted and that using condoms can help to prevent its spread. However, 14 percent also had misconceptions, e.g., that HIV can OVeRVIeW 13 be transmitted through kissing or mosquito bites. Ninety-six percent of Bangladeshi domestic workers interviewed onsite did not receive training on HIV before they left the country. While half of them had heard of HIV through the media or from co-workers, none had in-depth knowledge on HIV prevention and safer-sex practices. In Pakistan, 88 percent of respondents did not have any information related to HIV and AIDS before traveling abroad. Illegal and excessive fees are charged by recruiting agents and sub-agents to most migrant workers, pushing them into greater economic debt. The combination of excessive recruitment fees and poor wages often push migrant workers into debt traps, which, in turn, can lead to sexual exploitation12. In Pakistan, for example, the majority of respondents shared that the hiring agents charged them an enormous sum for their visas. The cost of overseas employment depends on the type of visa and the nature of work. A company-sponsored visa to Saudi Arabia could cost as much as $2,900, whereas an open visa (or Azad visa) would cost around $1,450. The latter, usually arranged through friends and relatives, is said to leave migrants at risk of deportation or harassment by law enforcement agencies given that its legality is circumspect13. In Sri Lanka, a large majority of the women were unaware of the legal cap of $50 fixed by the Sri Lankan Bureau of Foreign employment (SLBFe) on fees charged by hiring agents. Some women reported paying as much as $345 for the \u201copportunity\u201d to work abroad. For Filipino domestic workers, the placement fees for Bahrain ranged from $62.50 to as high as $375. For those who 12 None of the four sending countries or the three receiving countries have ratified the ILO Convention 181 on private employment agencies, which clearly indicates that no fees for labour migration can be transferred to the worker. Of the sending countries to Arab States, only ethiopia is one of the 21 signatories to this convention. 13 Adnan Sattar, \u201cMigration - Trafficking Nexus: The Case of Pakistan\u201d (2007).

Although wages vary, depending on the migrants\u2019 countries of origin and on the host countries where they work (see Box 4, p. 39), they often do not receive an income that allows them both to support family members at home and service their debts. Furthermore, a common complaint is that of non - or under-payment of wages. Large debts, low wages, and callous employers who do not pay their workers on time or pay them less than the agreed amount contribute to a crippling financial burden on the female migrant worker, which can motivate high-risk behavior and increase the worker\u2019s vulnerability to HIV. Domestic workers, like other migrants, are tested for HIV without consent, counseling, or confidentiality, and are deported if found HIV-positive. To obtain a work permit, migrant workers need to undergo a medical test, which includes testing for HIV. Often the testing happens without counseling or informed consent. Moreover, employers or hiring agents are informed of the results before the migrant workers themselves. If the workers are tested and diagnosed with HIV in the host country, they are subject to deportation. In the Philippines, 62 percent of respondents interviewed onsite14 underwent an HIV test prior to departure. Those who went through other visa schemes, such as a sponsorship or visitor visa, did not go through HIV testing prior to departure but still underwent medical testing when they applied for a work permit in the host country. Female domestic workers are only recognized as official employees when it comes to pre- employment HIV testing, but they are not protected by the basic labour rights of migrants as their jobs are not recognized by labour laws. While domestic and non-domestic workers are subject to similar requirements and testing processes in the pre-employment phase to obtain a work permit, domestic workers are excluded from the protective cover of local labour laws in many countries around the world, including the host countries covered in this study. This anomaly is attributable to reluctance on the part of governments to regulate the behaviors of residents within their homes. In fact, privacy laws that \u201cprotect the sanctity of the household\u201d in the host countries also prevent interventions at the household level. As a result, domestic workers often complain of an excessive workload and disproportionate pay. Disproportionate workload and non-payment or minimal payment are the most common complaints. Those who flee abusive working conditions are immediately rendered \u2018illegal\u2019 by host countries, exposing them to greater risk of abuse, including sexual exploitation and increased vulnerability to HIV. The Sri Lanka Country Report notes that 33 percent of the respondents suffered from non-payment or underpayment of wages as well as physical abuse, and almost all Filipino domestic workers interviewed were not allowed days off. Bangladeshi migrant workers reported irregular payment of salaries, long working hours, physical beatings, and sexual abuse. Overall, the most common abuses reported were long working hours, excessive workload, low salary, inadequate food, late and non- payment of wages, verbal and physical abuse, and sexual harassment. 14 \u201cOnsite\u201d refers to the place of employment or the destination site. For the purpose of this research, it collectively refers to the three host countries: Bahrain, Lebanon, and the UAe. OVeRVIeW 15 Migrant workers who flee abusive working conditions are immediately rendered \u201cillegal\u201d by host countries, as mandated by the kafala (sponsorship) programme15. Illegal/irregular status increases the potential for systematic abuse, and the study found that many women domestic workers who leave their homes are sexually exploited and some are coerced into sex work. The Sri Lankan respondents and NGO officials reported that these \u201crunaway\u201d women, who lack valid work or residence permits, are especially susceptible to being abused by taxi drivers, other migrants, or may even fall victim of organized crime. Since their legal status deprives them of access to judicial protection or redress mechanisms, these workers are often at the mercy of the people from whom they seek support or shelter. In the absence of local mechanisms within host countries to address the abuse of migrant workers, embassies and consulates can play a critical role. However, embassies and/or consulates, where they exist, are often understaffed or ill-prepared to address the wide range of migrant needs. At the time of this research, there were 80 women in the shelter in the Philippine Overseas Labour Office in Bahrain and 54 in Dubai, UAe. Many women reported enduring verbal, physical, and in some cases sexual abuse.

OVeRVIeW 15 See Box 1, p. 25, for explanation on the Kafala programme. 16 Deportation of HIV-positive migrants by host countries and the absence of reintegration programmes in countries of origin can be devastating for the health, well-being, and livelihoods of migrants and their families. There is little or no assistance for returning HIV-positive migrants to reintegrate into their countries of origin. There is minimal institutional or systematic effort to ensure that these migrants have access to counseling and HIV-care services or to guide them towards alternative income-generation opportunities. Mandatory deportation of migrants who are HIV-positive imposes substantial economic costs on the affected worker, owing primarily, to a loss of livelihood. In addition, they are often stigmatized and discriminated against by their families, fellow migrant workers, and their immediate communities. The impossibility of returning HIV-positive migrants to migrate again by regular channels, coupled with the disconnect from their communities, puts them at substantial risk of being trafficked. This study identified a large lacuna in terms of efforts to reintegrate returning migrant workers, a gap that government agencies and civil society organizations (CSOs) are best positioned to fill. Host countries and countries of origin have an equal responsibility to provide protective policies and programmes. The study shows that the degree of vulnerability among migrants also depends on the involvement and policies of the countries of origin. Women from countries with protective policies and programmes are better equipped to deal with the challenges they are apt to face than are women from other countries. Bilateral agreements on migrant welfare between countries of origin and host countries are especially important for the protection and wellbeing of woman migrants. There are a number of good practices among the countries studied that others can learn from. However, it was also noted that there is considerable room for improvement. The Philippines, for example, has enacted legislation to protect the rights of Filipino migrant workers as well as to make mandatory the inclusion of HIV orientation in the pre-departure training. It has also signed on to various international declarations, such as the 1990 UN Convention for the Protection of Migrant Workers and Members of their Families. Since 2004, all its foreign service personnel are required to undergo an HIV and AIDS seminar conducted by ACHIeVe in partnership with the Foreign Service Institute, the training arm of the Department of Foreign Affairs. To support migrant workers in need, the government also maintains a 24-hour hotline at the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration. Other measures to protect migrant workers, such as the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Philippines and the UAe for the standardization of the recruitment and placement of Filipino manpower in the UAe, have been recently instituted. Yet another recent development has been the establishment of the National Center for Reintegration, which is tasked to address the reintegration needs of returning migrant workers, including those that have been found HIV-positive. Host countries have also shown a resolve to strengthen the protection accorded to migrant workers in general, and domestic workers in particular. In April 2007, the UAe issued a standardized contract for domestic workers that explicitly spells out their rights and entitlements, including medical aid (see Box 6, p. 34). In addition, a new labour law to protect domestic workers from potential abuse was issued in October 2007. In Bahrain, the newly established Labour Market Regulatory Authority has amended existing laws to accord greater freedom to migrant workers to change jobs following completion of their initial contracts. Similarly, in Lebanon, a draft for a standardized unified contract was submitted to the Ministry of Labour (MoL) by a National Steering Committee that includes government agencies, NGOs, and placement agencies, and is supported by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). The same committee has been working with the MoL in drafting of a specific law for domestic workers. In addition, a 2003 MoL law regulates practices of recruitment agents by requiring them to be licensed; licenses can be obtained and maintained only upon the satisfaction of stringent performance criteria (see Box 5, p. 32).

OVeRVIeW 17 Banning women from migration pushes migration underground, placing women at even greater risk of exploitation and vulnerability to HIV. Less positive are the so-called protectionist policies of countries of origin, such as restrictions on the movement of women. While these may be aimed at protecting women from potential harm, they can also push women into illegal channels of migration and thereby heighten HIV vulnerability. For instance, in Bangladesh where migration of women was banned from 1998 to 2005, such policies did not deter women from leaving the country, with the result that they became illegal migrants, the cost of their migration increased, and it became more difficult for them to seek justice and get help in times of crisis16. Nepal encountered similar problems when it banned the movement of women migrants in 2007. even the ban on Filipino workers to Iraq and Lebanon has not stopped the irregular flow of migrants into these countries. 16 Therese Blanchet, \u201cDoing Bidesh: Cross-Border Labour Migration and Trafficking of Women from Bangladesh\u201d (Dhaka, November 2003). OVeRVIeW 18 4. Recommendations In order to address HIV and AIDS issues among women domestic workers in the Arab States, there is a need to address the major economic, socio-cultural, and political factors that render them vulnerable. Thus, the thrust of any policy and/or programmatic response to HIV issues among women migrant workers should be on making their migration safe, wherein the migrants make their decisions based on informed choices and are protected from various forms of exploitation. Safe migration entails access to information and services that protect migrants from HIV and any related stigma or discrimination during all phases of the migration cycle. Human rights, as stipulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that cover, for example, the right to security of a person, freedom of movement, the right to free choice of employment, and the right to rest and leisure should be promoted through the provision of information and services that improve the migrants\u2019 decision-making and cognitive and behavioral coping skills, as well as their control over their body and health. Human rights violations put women migrant workers at risk of acquiring HIV, and can lead to further abuse and exploitation by employers, recruiting agents, and others. Conversely, the promotion of human rights lowers the risk of acquiring HIV. 4.1 Countries of Origin and Host Countries Both origin and host countries should consider ratifying the ILO Convention 181 on the monitoring and regulation of private employment agencies, which clearly indicates that no fees for labour migration can be transferred onto the worker. Upon ratification they can further harmonize their national laws for better regulation and monitoring of recruitment and placement agencies. Urgent reforms to existing labour laws must be made to bring domestic workers\u2019 rights and working conditions on par with migrant and native workers employed in other sectors. The standardization of domestic worker contracts, explicitly outlining the rights and obligation of the worker, will minimize the potential for abuse. The merits of mandatory testing of migrant workers need to be carefully reviewed. Regional dialogue with the vision of promoting the voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) of migrant workers must be initiated and intensified, and the confidentiality of test results must be protected. 4.2 Countries of Origin Countries of origin must lobby for bilateral or multilateral agreements with host countries for the standardization of contracts for their migrant workers, especially for those working as domestic help. HIV awareness and prevention programmes must be scaled- up during the pre-departure orientation of potential migrant workers. It is also imperative that the rates of attendance at these orientation sessions be boosted beyond existing levels. Initiatives must be undertaken to promote safe and informed migration, and greater advocacy is needed to promote better social acceptance of migrant women workers. Pre-departure programmes should include information on migrant workers\u2019 rights and responsibilities, country specific information, and adequate host language instruction in order to facilitate better communication and understanding between employers and employees. Recruitment agents must be monitored more comprehensively, and there must be stricter enforcement of existing laws to prevent economic and physical exploitation of prospective migrant workers. Placement fees need to be standardized, and knowledge of what these fees are must be effectively disseminated among the potential migrant population. Government agencies and CSOs must urgently address the need for effective reintegration mechanisms for returning migrant workers. Such reintegration programmes need to be holistic, encompassing the economic, social, and psychological concerns that returning migrants face.

The embassies of countries of origin must proactively protect the rights, and promote the well-being, of their migrant workers in the host countries. embassy staff, labour attaches, and social affairs officers must be trained to be sensitive to the needs of women migrant workers, especially those who test positive for HIV. Training and outreach to embassy staff should occur collectively, with representatives from as many migrant countries of origin as possible. embassy officials are apt to respond more positively and effectively to a common standard. 4.3 Host Countries Legislation must be enacted to outline the responsibilities of recruitment agents in the host country. Systematic monitoring and enforcement will reduce the exploitation of women migrant workers by these agents. The sponsorship programme (or Kafala system), which renders a domestic worker\u2019s status \u201cillegal/irregular\u201d if she is living outside her sponsor\u2019s home, needs to be critically assessed. Accordingly, appropriate policy reforms must be suggested, debated, and implemented. Domestic migrant workers should be permitted to contact embassies/NGOs from their places of employment, and embassies and NGOs should be given access to domestic migrant workers within private homes. At the same time, embassies and NGOs should provide information to employers on their rights and responsibilities vis-\u00e0-vis their migrant domestic help. NGOs should partner with prominent local individuals who are already sensitive to the issues of migrant workers and who could be called upon to be public advocates for safer migrant mobility. OVeRVIeW Migrant workers should be allowed to form their own associations, and to become members of trade unions. Upon arrival in the host country, migrants should be given information on their rights and responsibilities, country-specific sensitization training, and information on available public and health services, inclusive of sexual and reproductive health. embassies, government bodies, and NGOs should share the responsibility of disseminating such information. 22 B. Regional Analysis Asian populations have traditionally been mobile. However, since the Arab oil boom in the 1970s the trend of Asian emigrants moving to countries in the Arab region has become increasingly noticeable. These emigrants have included highly educated professionals, entrepreneurs (e.g., shopkeepers who set up independent businesses), and semi and low-skilled workers (in the service sector, factory workers, and workers in elementary occupations17). Nonetheless, there has been a recent upsurge in interest among several key stakeholders in the specific problems faced by low and semi-skilled emigrants, which demonstrates the need for greater protection of this category of migrant workers by governments, civil societies, and international agencies alike. Particularly, discussions on the need to increase protection for low skilled-women migrant workers to the Arab region has motivated several initiatives related to policy, programme, and dialogue by the state, civil society, and international agencies. This research seeks to contextualize the existing initiatives within a conceptual framework that sees the women migrant worker as being vulnerable to contracting HIV. By highlighting this vulnerability, this research aims at promoting greater inter- regional dialogue and cooperation, which might result in safer migration processes. Migration in itself is not a risk factor for HIV infection. However, migration contributes to the migrant worker\u2019s vulnerability to HIV. Though the terms risk and vulnerability are often used synonymously, they are different but inter-related. Risk is the probability that an individual could become ill (contract HIV) within a given period of time18. Vulnerability, on the other hand, has been conceptualized as a \u201cquality of life experience or capacity that can elicit various responses in an individual that may or may not lead to harmful outcomes.\u201d19 Vulnerability modifies the risk posed to an individual, either by increasing the probability of a negative health outcome (by exacerbating the risk conditions) or by reducing the probability of a negative health outcome (through positive responses). UNAIDS states that: Vulnerability results from a range of factors that reduce the ability of individuals and communities to avoid HIV infection. These may include: (i) personal factors, such as the lack of knowledge and skills required to protect oneself and others; (ii) factors pertaining to the quality and coverage of services, such as inaccessibility of services due to distance, cost and other factors; (iii) societal factors such as social and cultural norms, practices, beliefs and laws that stigmatize and disempower certain populations, and act as barriers to essential HIV prevention messages. These factors, alone or in combination, may create or exacerbate individual vulnerability and, as a result, collective vulnerability to HIV. 20 To make migrant workers resilient to HIV infection, policy and programmatic responses are imperative. Augmenting their individual capacities to resist infection would also necessitate enabling systemic responses by", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9cca52fd-db22-4476-9d2e-6c3a6ae8a5f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "9cca52fd-db22-4476-9d2e-6c3a6ae8a5f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV Vulnerabilities of Migrant Women: from Asia to the Arab States", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7d209e788cae8a266ecfd0152c54570fedba2759d3e030769a7493c56b09ea72"}, "3": {"node_id": "7842ada1-7bd6-48c7-82ce-cbf4edc02e2f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cfb9f459eed46db97e5566eae52db53db9ae8edc0878064aa01d20a9ebd4bb6c"}}, "hash": "7a54e446ef86956caad457e61fedad9dba2a5b9b1afc6b3eddb02c5e17596e64", "text": "providing facilitative environments to migrant workers that increase their access to cultural, legal, medical, and social resources. Reducing the HIV vulnerability and risk of migrant workers entails the protection and promotion of their human rights in all stages of migration. The need to uphold migrants\u2019 rights in the context of migration and HIV is more necessary and compelling owing to the diminished control that migrants have over their lives as \u201coutsiders\u201d in host countries, and because they tend to fall between the cracks of national policies and programmes related to HIV in both origin and host countries. The following analysis on migration and HIV is an inter-regional analysis as it provides an in-depth summary of the research findings from both Asian and Arab States. It begins with an overview of report findings on the nature of Asian women\u2019s labour migration from Asia to the Arab States (and of men\u2019s in the case of Pakistan) from pre-migration through post-arrival and reintegration. It then provides an analysis of actions already taken by governments, NGOs, and the international community to address migrant vulnerabilities and assesses their results. It concludes with recommendations for origin and host countries, NGOs, international agencies, and donors.

Pre-Migration and Pre-Departure The pre-migration and pre-departure experiences of the migrant workers interviewed in this study share many aspects that increase their HIV vulnerability. These include structural causes of socio-economic development, subordination of women in the economic sector, individual and familial economic deprivation, and a lack of information regarding migration and its costs (both monetary and social), which is frequently exploited by unscrupulous recruiting agents and other intermediaries. 1.1 Migration - Gains and Costs: The marginalization of the migrant worker as described above contrasts sharply with the size (and consequent significance) of migrant remittances accruing to countries of origin, as shown in Table 2 and Figures 1 and 2. Potential foreign exchange earnings have traditionally been a motivating factor for individuals to migrate, and for countries of origin to allow (or even promote) emigration. Recent statistics on migrant remittances show to what extent this potential is justified. For all the four countries of origin of this study there has been a sharp increase in inward remittance flows in recent times. While the increase in remittances to the Philippines and Pakistan increased steadily over the 4-year period (Figure 1), remittances to Bangladesh climbed steeply in the same period. The increase in remittances indicated in Figures 1 and 2 have been attributed to mounting out-migration to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, which are experiencing an economic boom due to high commodity prices and are thus fuelling an expanding demand for migrant labour. In Sri Lanka, for example, migrant remittances grew at a higher rate in 2007 for the third consecutive year 21. This was attributed to an 8 percent raise in emigration of migrant workers; better wages in the Arab nations, such as Saudi Arabia, UAe, Kuwait, and Qatar; increased migration to high-wage ReGIONAL ANALYSIS 24 e-estimate 1 3.6% of GDP in 2006; 214.6% of GDP in 2006; 38.8% of GDP in 2006; 44.0% of GDP in 2006; 57.6% of GDP in 2006 Source: Migration and Remittances Factbook 2008 http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTDECPROSPECTS/0,,contentMDK:21352016~isCURL:Y~menuPK:3145470~pagePK:64165401~piPK:64165026~theSitePK :476883,00.html.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7842ada1-7bd6-48c7-82ce-cbf4edc02e2f": {"__data__": {"id_": "7842ada1-7bd6-48c7-82ce-cbf4edc02e2f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV Vulnerabilities of Migrant Women: from Asia to the Arab States", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7d209e788cae8a266ecfd0152c54570fedba2759d3e030769a7493c56b09ea72"}, "2": {"node_id": "9cca52fd-db22-4476-9d2e-6c3a6ae8a5f8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7a54e446ef86956caad457e61fedad9dba2a5b9b1afc6b3eddb02c5e17596e64"}}, "hash": "cfb9f459eed46db97e5566eae52db53db9ae8edc0878064aa01d20a9ebd4bb6c", "text": "* Source: Annual Report 2007 of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Table 2: Inward Remittance Flows in US$ Million 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007e South Asia 17.2 19.2 24.1 30.4 28.7 33.2 39.91 Philippines 6,212 6,164 9,735 10,243 11,471 13,566 14,9232 Bangladesh 1,968 2,105 2,858 3,192 3,584 4,314 5,4283 6,400 Pakistan 1,075 1,461 3,554 3,964 3,945 4,280 5,1214 6,100 Sri Lanka 1,166 1,185 1,309 1,438 1,590 2,088 2,0885 2,502* Figure 1: Remittances to some Asian Countries Figure 2: Remittances in selected Asian Countries - Year on Year growth of 3 month moving average of remittances Source: World Bank.

In addition, migration seems to contribute to economic dispossession (for example, selling land to go abroad) and exploitation. More significantly, women migrants are exposed to conditions that escalate their vulnerability to HIV infection, amongst other sexual and reproductive health problems. 1.2 The Economics of Survival This research revealed that the overwhelming majority of participants migrated under economic duress. Several Sri Lankan women reported that the inability of their spouses to find employment either domestically or as an emigrant was their single most important reason to migrate. In Pakistan (where the research uncovered a two-stage migration model: rural to urban, followed by overseas emigration) and in Bangladesh, migrant workers identified landlessness and feudal control exerted by landlords as a primary incentive to migrate. What emerges as common to these stories of economic dispossession and marginalization is the recognition that most Box 1: Kafala or Sponsorship Program Under the kafala (literally, \u2018guaranteeing and taking care of\u2019 in Arabic) programme in the Arab States, an employer is required to sponsor a migrant worker\u2019s visa and assume full economic and legal responsibility for him/her during the contracted period. Legally, the sponsored migrant worker can work only for his/her sponsor. In the case of a domestic worker, the programme makes it mandatory for her to remain in her employer/sponsors\u2019 home. While the kafala system was created to provide the government with a way to regulate foreign labour flows, critics charge that the system can lead to the exploitation of migrant workers in general, and women domestic workers in particular. women migrants (and men, in the case of Pakistan) at lower skill and education levels migrate in order to escape undesirable domestic economic circumstances. 1.3 Dispossession and Debt Before Migration The studies of the countries of origin in this research highlight the different types of dispossession a migrant woman and her family experiences in financing her migration. As one participant from Bangladesh said: \u201c(After) borrowing some money from relatives and taking a loan on interest, I went abroad\u2026. For this purpose I sold the tiny piece of land that I got from my father to finance my going abroad. Brokers have betrayed me two times.\u201d (Bangladesh Country Report) The Pakistan report likewise noted that migrants sell valuable assets, such as land, or take out loans to pay for entry into the recruitment process. Many Sri Lankan women participants reported that they did not have the money to pay recruitment fees, and that in such cases they would often take loans from family members or friends to cover initial costs. For some of the women who lacked the necessary collateral (such as land) or did not have the necessary social network to facilitate borrowing (e.g., sympathetic relatives), the option of having their employer or sponsor deduct the necessary funds from their salary seemed attractive. However, this put these employees at an even greater dependence upon their employers. ReGIONAL ANALYSIS 26 The Arab States primarily rely on the sponsor (kafala) system22 for the recruitment of foreign workers, using the services of recruitment agencies (see Box 1). Unfortunately, this arrangement can endanger women migrant workers by generating an excessive dependency upon their sponsors. However, migrant workers from Bangladesh, Pakistan, and the Philippines explained that the decision to migrate to the Arab States (in the case of Bangladesh and the Philippines, for domestic work23) was to a large extent due to the advantages of the sponsorship system, which included the non-insistence on upfront payment, the ease of recruitment and placement, and the ease of processing documents. However, the sponsorship system is not the only indication that migrant workers often have few or no resource with which to build a better economic future. This is also apparent in the arrangements that potential migrant workers make with recruitment agencies. As the Philippines research shows, the majority of women migrants do not have enough money to pay their recruitment agents; consequently, they resort to installment salary deductions. Recruitment agencies in the Philippines are allowed by the Philippine Government to receive payments directly from the sponsors in Bahrain on the condition that the worker will not receive her salary for her first three months of employment. Given the many economic challenges that potential women migrants face, and how further impoverished they may become in their quest to emigrate, the need for easy and affordable access to formal credit mechanisms can not be over emphasised. 1.4 Inadequate Safeguards Remoteness of Villages from Capital Cities Three out of the four origin country reports (Pakistan, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka) indicated that the remoteness of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc5bfbbe-dd96-42ba-a1a9-a9d2a42cf685": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc5bfbbe-dd96-42ba-a1a9-a9d2a42cf685", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV Vulnerabilities of Migrant Women: from Asia to the Arab States", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f2539930ea31161ddb742f0786891924dc9d64ca6c36c75d4cb80152749c02ce"}, "3": {"node_id": "078e7073-4074-457b-a6fe-d93066be4d19", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "546941a13fc6273694b5668e2de8fb2a6fc9a6ebc785df834af32bcae84cedda"}}, "hash": "eb0e23a6ecaffd43074df18608e4b2e4f1ae50591398d347eebac53815833171", "text": "the migrants\u2019 homes was a factor that impeded their access to timely, accurate, and adequate information prior to migration. In addition, their distance from the capital city, where most of the official processing needed to be done, created security risks for these women, who often traveled alone and required overnight accommodations. Several Sri Lankan research participants reported having been subjected to sexual harassment and blackmail during their trip to, and stay in, the capital. In the case of the Philippines, however, women migrant workers who did not have relatives in the capital with whom they could stay were allowed to stay in the house or office of their agents. Growth of Informal Networks for Emigration In Bangladesh, Pakistan, and the Philippines there also seemed to be a tendency to utilize informal networks of friends, relatives, and unlicensed intermediaries in order to secure overseas employment, as opposed to formal migration channels. In Bangladesh, the research found that among the 190 women migrant workers interviewed both in the countries of origin and host countries, 116 migrated on their own, that is, through individual contracts facilitated by their relatives and unofficial middlemen. In these cases, the hiring agents were usually retained only for processing of the official government clearance, ticketing, and other such arrangements. The Pakistan report confirmed a trend of social networks involving friends, relatives, fellow tribesmen, etc. The majority said they initially traveled on a visitor visa and then simply remained undocumented in the host country until they were found and deported; these findings are corroborated by the Philippines report as well. Weak Regulation of Recruiting Agents With inadequate state-regulated channels and mechanisms for providing recruitment, placement, and education information regarding work and living overseas, women migrant workers tend to fall prey to unscrupulous recruiting agents and unlicensed intermediaries. The Bangladesh report noted that no information about the nature of the work, the number of work hours, the Box 2: Numbers of Licensed Recruiting Agents \u2022 Bangladesh - 762 \u2022 Sri Lanka - 580 \u2022 Philippines - 2481 land based recruitment agents whose licenses are still valid (not revoked, suspended, etc) 22 Gwenann S. Manseau, \u201cContractual Solutions for Migrant Labourers: The Case of Domestic Workers in the Middle east,\u201d pp. 29-30, at www.nottingham.ac.uk/shared/ shared_hrlcpub/HRLC_Commentary_2006/manseau.pdf. 23 Not applicable for Pakistan, which focused on male migrant workers. ReGIONAL ANALYSIS 27 salary, or the benefits (such as leave entitlements) were provided to the migrant workers prior to their departure. In most cases, women migrants reported that they signed their contract with their agency just prior to departure without knowing what the terms of the contract were. The lax monitoring and regulation of recruitment agencies was also evident from the high recruitment and placement fees paid by women migrant workers. The Philippines report states that women paid anywhere between 2,500 pesos ($62.50) to 15,000 pesos ($375) to go to Bahrain. For those who went to Dubai, the fees ranged from 2,000 pesos ($50) to 20,000 pesos ($500). Some of the participants reported having later learned that their employers had already paid for the cost of their travel and employment. Further, the report indicated that the women\u2019s expenses even included payments to the airport official who accompanied them through immigration. The Sri Lankan report found a similar situation where women were unaware of legal caps on the fees of hiring agents. This resulted in them paying fees as high as $345 rather than the official registration fee stipulated by the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign employment (SLBFe) not to exceed $50. The gaps in regulating recruiting agents further resulted in irregularities with contracts. The Philippines report indicated that while all domestic workers interviewed had agents, not all agents were legal. Some domestic workers reported that their agents simply phoned them when it was time for them to fly, met them ReGIONAL ANALYSIS 28 at the airport, and gave them their passports and plane tickets. For some, it was also at the airport where they were shown their employment contract for the first time. Others did not see or sign any contract before leaving the Philippines. The Bangladesh report noted that there was no mechanism to identify and regulate the middlemen who recruit domestic workers in Bangladesh. The Philippines report mentioned that while systems have been established to regulate migration in that country, there are still gaps in the monitoring of recruitment practices of local recruitment agencies and their foreign counterparts.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "078e7073-4074-457b-a6fe-d93066be4d19": {"__data__": {"id_": "078e7073-4074-457b-a6fe-d93066be4d19", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV Vulnerabilities of Migrant Women: from Asia to the Arab States", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f2539930ea31161ddb742f0786891924dc9d64ca6c36c75d4cb80152749c02ce"}, "2": {"node_id": "fc5bfbbe-dd96-42ba-a1a9-a9d2a42cf685", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eb0e23a6ecaffd43074df18608e4b2e4f1ae50591398d347eebac53815833171"}}, "hash": "546941a13fc6273694b5668e2de8fb2a6fc9a6ebc785df834af32bcae84cedda", "text": "The country reports clearly indicate that the movement of less educated migrant women from the hinterlands of countries of origin to the homes, hotels, bars, and restaurants in interior, urban, and metropolitan areas of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "36f4178a-9f44-4505-959e-c7dc7b1a7ef3": {"__data__": {"id_": "36f4178a-9f44-4505-959e-c7dc7b1a7ef3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV Vulnerabilities of Migrant Women: from Asia to the Arab States", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4d518c859ca6c5043808aa598ce5cf328ab68bb25b0925610ae98c76b1ba2a13"}}, "hash": "4d518c859ca6c5043808aa598ce5cf328ab68bb25b0925610ae98c76b1ba2a13", "text": "host countries is facilitated by a strong and active network of recruiting agents (both licensed and unlicensed) in origin and host countries. While there are a few examples of recruiting agents intervening to assist women migrant workers in seeking redress for their problems, by and large, most country reports seem to implicate recruiting agents in misinforming or failing to inform potential migrant workers about salary, work conditions, and visa related issues, in charging exorbitant recruitment fees, in substituting contracts, and in threatening and abusing migrant workers when they lodge complaints against their employers. In general, all the country reports identified the gaps in monitoring and regulation of recruiting agents as a major source of problems and/or abuse faced by the migrant workers in the study. Interestingly, the general position of recruiting agents in both Dubai and Bahrain, contrary to the testimonies of migrant workers, embassies, and NGOs, was that \u201cthe situation of migrants is not as bad as it has been reported.\u201d There was also a denial of irregularities in the recruitment process. Faced with this ambivalence regarding the role that recruitment agencies play in facilitating migration, a uniform code of conduct to regulate agency practices needs to be designed and enforced. 1.5 Pre-Departure Orientation Seventy-one percent of Sri Lankan respondents and 70 percent of Filipino respondents attended the official pre-departure orientation trainings. The Bangladesh report indicated that the remoteness of the only training centre of the Bureau of Manpower, employment, and Training (BMeT) training centre was in part the reason why only 9 percent of respondents attended the official pre-departure briefing in that country. Recruiting agents contributed to this phenomenon by helping to process all formalities for migrant workers, including BMeT clearance, so that they did not need to attend the pre-departure training. The Pakistan report showed that all the migrant workers interviewed who had lived in either Bahrain or Dubai were given no information by any government department regarding the host country\u2019s culture, rules, and laws before they travelled for the first time. With regard to the HIV component of the pre-departure orientation programs, research participants in Pakistan stated that they were not provided with any information related to HIV and AIDS. In the Philippines, 54 percent of the 70 percent who attended the Pre-Departures Orientation Seminars (PDOS) remembered that it included an HIV orientation. However, all the Filipino migrant workers interviewed in Lebanon stated that they had PDOS, including HIV information, before they migrated. In contrast, 96 percent of Bangladeshi domestic workers interviewed onsite stated that they had not received any HIV orientation before they left the country. Half of them had heard of HIV from the media or from co-workers, but none had in-depth knowledge on HIV prevention and safer sex practices. The Sri Lankan report found that although nearly 80 percent of the women attended the trainings, the HIV awareness sessions were ineffectual as women failed to retain the information that was presented. Pre-departure orientation sessions are important bridges between potential migrant workers and their host countries; and the effective sharing of relevant and adequate information is crucial for preparing the worker to better cope in their new environment. ReGIONAL ANALYSIS 29 1.6 Medical and HIV Testing Research revealed that the mandatory health examination of foreign workers required by host countries always includes HIV testing, and during HIV testing procedures one or all of the \u201c3Cs\u201d - Consent, Confidentiality, and Counseling - are violated. The Bangladesh report found that women were not given any prior information regarding the tests they would be taking, and only knew that the medical personnel took their blood and urine and checked their chest. The Philippines report found that only 62 percent of the women interviewed underwent a medical examination before departure. Those that did not were required to undergo a medical examination when applying for a work permit in the host country. The report concluded that HIV testing may have been conducted without pre-test and post- test counseling, given that 82 percent of those interviewed were unsure whether they had been tested for HIV or not. Research with Sri Lankan migrant workers revealed that test results were given directly to the agent, a clear violation of confidentiality, and that none of the women interviewed were given pre-test or post-test counseling. Few had a clear idea why the tests were conducted. Further, many reported that the medical centers in Sri Lanka also provided them with birth control pills or injectable medroxyprogesterone, commonly distributed under the brand name Depo-Provera, to prevent pregnancy.

As shown by the overseas travel bans imposed on women in Bangladesh (from mid-1998 to 2005) and Nepal (prior to 2007), despite the restrictions thousands of Bangladeshi24 and Nepali women continued to leave for work abroad in the informal sector, especially for domestic work. In 2003, for example, The Bangladesh National Women Lawyers\u2019 Association estimated that between 10,000 and 15,000 Bangladeshi women were seeking employment abroad every year since the mid-1998 ban was imposed. Nepal\u2019s position on the movement of women migrant workers has been ambivalent. It imposed a ban on May 16, 1997, prohibiting women migrant workers from going overseas as a response to the suicide of Kani Sherpa, a Nepali domestic worker in Kuwait who had been repeatedly beaten and raped. However, this failed to deter the continued out-migration of women, who, instead, used circuitous routes via Bangladesh and India to avoid detection at the Kathmandu airport25. Labour activists complained that the ban denied women legal opportunities to work abroad. In addition, informal migration made them susceptible to human trafficking and denied them access to pre-departure orientation programmes and to systems of redress in the host countries. It also stigmatized outgoing women migrants who consequently chose to be silent about their overseas employment before leaving and upon return26. This ban was partially lifted on January 17, 2007, and was completely lifted after the passing of the Foreign employment Act on September 5, 2007. On 25 August 2008 the ban was, once again, imposed on women Nepali migrant domestic workers going to Korea, Kuwait, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, and Taiwan27.

Rather than protecting women migrants from abuse, it increases their susceptibility by excluding them from formal legal frameworks. . 1.8 HIV and AIDS - Pre-Migration Training All the country studies pointed to a greater need for attention to developing and strengthening HIV policy and programs for (women) migrant workers, including the development of national strategic frameworks and national action plans, stronger integration of HIV in pre-departure orientation programs, and more effective monitoring of counselling, confidentiality, and consent during pre-emigration HIV testing. 1.9 Conclusion - Pre-Departure The above discussion identifies various aspects of the pre- departure process that jeopardizes the health of women migrant workers. Acknowledging that loopholes exist during pre- departure, the study makes the following general observations and recommendations: l Measures must be undertaken to encourage safe and informed migration. Stricter regulation of the recruitment process is required to prevent irregular and undocumented forms of migration. Potential migrants\u2019 access to accurate, timely, and adequate information is crucial to their making an informed decision regarding migration. Community- based interventions have traditionally been cited as the best method to address such a need. l To avoid dispossession of women in the process of migration, the costs of migration should be contained, including a cap on fees for recruiting agents, medical examinations, and training. To be truly effective, measures should be in place to ensure that such caps are enforced. l Pre-departure information needs to include comprehensive information on migration procedures; health and HIV issues; and the laws, policies, and culture of host countries. l Consistent and coherent regulation of the recruitment and placement process is likely to prevent the abuse and exploitation of migrating women. l Policies that ban the migration of women must be critically reviewed as these bar women\u2019s economic advancement, push migration underground, and place women at an even greater risk of exploitation and vulnerability to HIV. 2. Post Arrival This section discusses the implications of imbalanced economic development in the countries of origin and of regional economic disparities in terms of \u201cpush and pull\u201d factors for migration. Further, it looks at the institutional and legal frameworks in host countries that inhibit the exploitation of migrant women who work as domestic workers. 2.1 Gender Selectivity in Migration Feminization of migration is now an accepted global phenomenon. In some countries women constitute as much as 70 to 80 percent of the migrant population28. Women migrant workers also tend to be concentrated in occupations associated with traditional gender roles29. In the present study, it was common that most participating migrant women that they did not have options for a secure and sustainable livelihood in their country of origin. Structural inequalities in the distribution of income and wealth, imbalanced rural-urban development, and a gender-segregated labour market (whereby only the lowest paying occupations were available to unskilled women) were all cited within the literature reviews as limiting economic opportunities for women. However, their opportunities for employment overseas seemed to be limited by an equally gender-segregated labour market in the host countries, as the skill profile of the migrating women left them excluded from most vocations other than that of domestic help.

ReGIONAL ANALYSIS 32 exclusion of domestic work from the purview of national labour laws. Marginalization of domestic workers is further evident in the exclusion of domestic work from the national labour codes of all the countries participating in this study except for the Philippines. The Philippines employs a vague definition of \u201cdomestic or household service\u201d as \u201cservice in the employer\u2019s home which is usually necessary or desirable for th e maintenance and enjoyment thereof and includes ministering to the personal comfort and convenience30 of the members of the employer\u2019s household.31\u201d Such an attitude, even in a country of origin, contributes to the difficulty of securing labour protections for domestic workers. Contracts between employers and migrant domestic workers are an important legal tool for the latter, allowing the worker a means to seek redress in case of violation of or non-compliance with the contract. The report indicated that those who migrated through irregular channels (either because they were misled by their recruiting agents or of their own volition) did not have regular contracts. Among those who did migrate through conventional channels, some did not see their contract until they were just about to leave the country, and some did not sign a contract before leaving. Twenty-two percent of OFWs said that their contracts were written in Arabic, which they could not understand, and a similar percentage was reported for Sri Lankans. An additional problem is that of contract substitution. This happens when women migrant workers are compelled to sign a different contract upon arrival in the host country stipulating less favorable terms and conditions of employment. For example, 27 percent of the OFWs interviewed for this report said that they signed contracts before leaving home, but nearly two-thirds of these workers were made to sign a different contract upon arrival in the host country. Non-compliance on the part of employers with the terms of the contract (salary, days off etc.) was found to be one of the more common complaints. Some workers recalled that the content of their contracts did not accurately reflect the nature of the work they were given, such as the actual scope of their responsibilities or the number of households they were supposed to serve. Several pointed out that the contract did not specify the arrangements for their meals and accommodation. In the case of so-called \u201cindividual contracts\u201d used by those who do not go through licensed recruiting agents, as in Bangladesh, the domestic workers have a contract with hiring agents in order to process their necessary papers. Understandably, this makes the enforcement of the contract with the employer problematic. Often, recruiting agents were cited as the reason for employers subjecting migrant domestic workers to exploitative and abusive work and living conditions. Two quotes from the Philippines Country Report validate this claim: \u201cOne Bahraini employer who intended to pay 120 BD ($318) in salary to her domestic worker was told by the agency to give only 60 BD ($159) when she went to file her request for a domestic worker. Her domestic worker was made to sign the contract in front of her. She was also told not to allow her domestic worker to have days off. She came to know of the abuses that her fellow Bahrainis inflicted on their domestic workers.\u201d Box 4: Salaries of Domestic workers Domestic workers\u2019 salaries in the Arab States, in most instances, need to be increased to better reflect cost of living and the demands and responsibilities of the work. l For Filipino domestic workers the monthly income is approximately $125-150 in Bahrain, $187-375 in Dubai, and $200-400 in Lebanon. l For Bangladeshi domestic workers the monthly income is approximately $100 in Bahrain and the UAe, and $125 in Lebanon. l For Sri Lankan domestic workers the monthly income is approximately $125-140 in Bahrain and the UAe, and $120-150 in Lebanon. 30 emphasis added.

ReGIONAL ANALYSIS 33 Box 5: LEBANON - LAw GOVERNING MONITORING OF RECRUITING AGENTS Decree law 1/70, issued by the Ministry of Labour in 2003, regulates the responsibilities of recruiting agents in Lebanon, and stipulates that: \u2022 A recruiting agent must have a license to perform such service. This license is issued and approved by the Minister of Labour, provided all conditions for such request are in order and respected. \u2022 A license can be retrieved at any time by the Ministry, if the recruiting agency does not abide by the laws. In fact, in 2004-2005, more than 11 agencies were closed for not conforming to the law. Certain procedures and conditions to receive a license are: \u2022 The agent must provide a deposit of 50,000,000 LBP ($33,000) as a warranty at the Housing National Bank (affiliated with the Lebanese Government). \u2022 The agent must present a notarized statement that he will abide by all laws and regulations of the Ministry. \u2022 The owner and any partner of the agency must have a clean judicial record. \u2022 A recruiting agent is entitled to a single license, which cannot be bequeathed to another person or sold or lent. \u2022 Recruiting agents are forbidden from presenting any request under fictitious sponsorship to bring a migrant worker into the country for the purpose of making them work on a daily or monthly basis or in companies. \u2022 Recruiting agents must draw up a schedule to call upon the sponsor and migrant worker periodically in order to assess the worker\u2019s performance and to ensure that she is well treated and is receiving all that she is entitled to (e.g., proper monthly wages, sufficient rest, an acceptable place to sleep, and the provision of medicine, food, and clothing). Should the sponsor fail to respect these provisions, the sponsor will be subject to judicial pursuit. In such instances, the recruiting agent must inform the Complaint Desk in the Ministry of Labour. \u2022 The recruiting agent must not abuse the migrant worker and, in cases of disagreement or conflict between any of the three parties (agency/sponsor/worker), any party may file a complaint before the Ministry of Labour\u2019s Complaint Desk. \u2022 The recruiting agent must keep an accurate and updated record of all sponsor/worker names and addresses, work permit numbers, and dates of entry into Lebanon. This record is reviewed and stamped by the Ministry of Labour. \u2022 In a case where the migrant worker did not receive a work permit within two months of her entry, the recruiting agent must inform the sponsor of this mandatory obligation. In a case of non-compliance by the sponsor within three months, the recruiting agent must inform the Ministry of Labour. \u2022 The monitoring of recruiting agents is among the Ministry of Labour responsibilities (work inspection sector). The latter must present a comprehensive report on the status of agents once every six months. Any non-compliance by a recruiting agent to the above will lead to legal pursuit and the forfeit of license. There are other possible penalties as well. \u2022 The General Directorate of the General Security (the government institution providing entry visas and residency permits to migrants) maintains a \u201cblack list\u201d of non-compliant recruiting agencies. The General Directorate also has certain authority over the recruiting agents, and can use that authority to refuse visas for migrants recruited by a black listed recruiting agent. ReGIONAL ANALYSIS 34 \u201cRecruiting agents tend to deter women migrants from seeking support. They search and confiscate belongings, including contact numbers of the embassy. even when women are in abusive situations they agree to give these details only after the women have paid off their placement fees or after completion of their contracts.\u201d Host country initiatives that seek to address the HIV vulnerability of migrant domestic workers must factor in strategies that address the lack of labour laws to protect domestic work. In this regard, recent initiatives taken in Bahrain, Lebanon, and the UAe to reform the migrant labour sector are extremely welcome, and can pave the way for a more comprehensive review of migration and health-related laws and policies in order to reduce the vulnerability of women migrant workers to HIV infection. Some of these initiatives are detailed below.

Box 7: Health Problems of Domestic Migrant workers Many of the research participants onsite reported experiencing various health conditions, including common respiratory illnesses, poor nutrition, urinary tract infections, and skin rashes and blisters due to weather conditions. They also reported cases of unwanted pregnancy, unsafe abortions, and STIs among their peers. Accessing medical services was not easy for most domestic workers, because it depended on whether their employers allowed it. 32 Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, First Session, April 9, 2008. 33 Bahrain UPR Report 2008; UAe Country Report; UAe Annual Report on Combating Human Trafficking 2008. ReGIONAL ANALYSIS 36 2.3 Access to Health Care Services in Host Countries Access to health care is an important determinant of resilience against any disease, including HIV. Such access must be timely, appropriate, affordable, confidential, and non-discriminatory. As reported in other studies,34 women migrant workers in this research experienced many barriers that impede their access to health care services. In the absence of health benefits, the majority of the women testified to being dependent on their employers for treatment when they were sick. In addition, in Bahrain and the UAe women domestic workers are included in their employer\u2019s family health plan and, thus, do not have access to independent and confidential health care services. Illnesses and health needs varied from common colds, headaches, and menstrual cramps to pregnancies, abortions, and more serious conditions requiring hospitalization. The dependency upon employers for health needs has several negative implications: l Women are physically dependent on their employers to take them to a doctor when they fall ill. l employers tended to give migrant women medication without consulting a doctor. In addition, women migrant workers complained that they were not allowed adequate time by their employers to rest and recuperate following an accident, injury, or surgery. Many women also reported that they feared that if they were to get sick there would be negative repercussions, such as non-renewal of contract or termination of employment. In some cases, they self- medicated; in other cases, women did not seek any treatment when they fell ill. Affordability was another major issue. If the cost of treatment was not covered by the family health plan, an employer often advanced the cost and later settled this debt through deductions in the worker\u2019s salary. Nonetheless, positive steps are being taken in host countries to ensure health insurance, including easy access and affordable care: In Lebanon, all migrant workers, including domestic workers, have health insurance. The research indicated that this policy provided for satisfactory access to health care services. In Bahrain, health care is subsidized by the government for both Bahrainis and non-Bahrainis, whereby the non-Bahraini population pays a health check-up fee to the public hospital of just 3 BD (less than $1). In the UAe a new unified contract to regulate the rights and duties of domestic workers includes a medical aid provision. Health centres in Dubai offer sexual and reproductive care services for citizens and non-citizens alike, whereby women migrant workers can access these services independently. However, migrant women\u2019s knowledge and frequency of use of these services are not known. Although there are examples (as in Bahrain and Lebanon) where the existing national health policies and systems facilitate the affordability of women migrant workers to health care services, there are non-cost barriers that hold back women from making full use of them. These barriers include the documentation status of the migrant worker, linguistic barriers, and insufficient knowledge as to when, where, and how to access health care (as in the UAe). In the case of Pakistani men migrant workers, health benefits varied depending upon what their company offered, with some employers picking up all healthcare costs, and others providing a fixed amount of money in the event of illness. 2.4 Sexual Relationships Although risk factors differ within populations, countries, and continents, HIV is largely transmitted through unprotected sex regardless of location35. Further, the proportion of women living with HIV has been increasing steadily. Today, women account for 34 CARAM Asia - State of Health \u2013 2006 \u2013 Access to Health 35", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e7106420-e7da-41d1-8fa8-dc29592188bd": {"__data__": {"id_": "e7106420-e7da-41d1-8fa8-dc29592188bd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV Vulnerabilities of Migrant Women: from Asia to the Arab States", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2e50b7ad73cc48afa1f42e81db6b47c0464a25ad64d29775e94d3401b08eda08"}}, "hash": "2e50b7ad73cc48afa1f42e81db6b47c0464a25ad64d29775e94d3401b08eda08", "text": "www.kff.org/hivaids/upload/3030_12.pdf ReGIONAL ANALYSIS 37 half of all people living with HIV worldwide, which demonstrates the urgent need for increasing women\u2019s empowerment in order to reduce their vulnerability to HIV. The studies in the four countries of origin delved into the topic of sexual relationships of migrant women. The findings point to women migrant workers engaging in sexual relationships for a variety of reasons and under various circumstances. Many women engaged in intimate relationships to overcome feelings of loneliness; being away from home and the comfort and security of their traditional social networks of family, community, and friends created a need for warmth and belonging. Other women reported that they became sexually involved for economic reasons as well - either to share living expenses with a boyfriend or to earn wages through transactional sex. However, not all relationships were consensual. Relationships ranged from consensual to forced, and varied depending on living arrangements (if they lived with their employer or lived independently), the number of days off and amount of free time, and the power dynamics between partners. Relationships also varied in duration (from longer-term monogamous relationships to short-term and occasional casual sexual encounters) and in motivation (affection or in exchange for favors). Often, women migrant workers desired to have more leisure. employees were not accustomed to having their freedom of movement restricted, whereas employers were reluctant to allow women employees to leave their homes unaccompanied. In several instances, workers were expected - and even forced - to work seven days a week, 52 weeks a year. Such conditions, which deprive the worker of the ability to have and enjoy a social and cultural life, can be considered a violation of their basic human rights. Domestic migrant workers need to be provided with time off work, and measures should be taken to ensure that they have the freedom to leave their places of employment during those leisure periods, while respecting the local culture. For the women who choose to become involved in intimate relationships during their periods of leisure, a concerted effort must be made to ensure that their health and safety is not compromised. This is critical in light of the reports from this study, which found that women involved in consensual sexual relationships are largely engaging in unsafe sex, with little or no condom use. Although women migrant workers reported consensual relationships, there were also reports of coercion, sexual abuse, and rape. Some feared losing their jobs and/or persecution if they did not acquiesce to sexual encounters. Others cited instances of abuse and violence inflicted by partners and boyfriends. Incidents of sexual harassment and rape, either by nationals (including employers and strangers) or men migrant workers, were reported in the Bangladesh, Philippines, and Sri Lanka studies. 2.5 Condom Use The related risks of HIV infection arise from low knowledge among women migrant workers about HIV transmission and safer sex practices. Research identified a low level of condom use, which is often related to the willingness and consent of male partners. The Sri Lanka Country Report stated that none of the 145 women who participated in this study regularly used condoms either in Sri Lanka or while working abroad. It was reported that condom usage was seen as a sign that there was not significant love and trust between partners, that it affected sexual sensation, that it created a barrier between themselves and their partners, and that it was better understood as a means of contraception than for preventing HIV transmission. The Philippines report indicated that 20 percent of the participants interviewed onsite engaged in sexual activities, but that only one participant reported occasional condom usage with her boyfriend. Women who were sexually active reported that they did not use condoms because their male partners did not want to do so, the couple did not like the feel of the condom, and/or they used other forms of birth control. Bangladeshi participants reported similar reasons for low or no condom use, but also cited the inability to leave their places of employment to purchase condoms.

Source: european AIDS Treatment Group, www.eatg.org/pages/article. php?id=1080 Though the Pakistan report focused on men migrants, it reported that, in general, women in Pakistan lack the power and skills to negotiate condom use with their male partners. For Pakistani men migrants, the research indicates that condom use is low, and that these individuals lack knowledge about the relationship between STI prevention and condom use, and/or they argue that sex without condoms is more enjoyable. 2.6 Knowledge of HIV and AIDS All the country studies identified poor knowledge regarding HIV transmission as a barrier to reducing vulnerability to HIV. According to the Philippines Country Report, 84 percent of the women interviewed onsite were aware that HIV is sexually transmitted and that using condoms can prevent it. However, 14 percent of the participants also had misconceptions, for example, that HIV can be transmitted through kissing or mosquito bites. The Sri Lanka Country Report stated that women are aware that there are diseases called AIDS and STIs. However, they are not aware of how HIV is spread and have little knowledge of preventive measures. Likewise, knowledge of other STIs is scant. Over 50 percent of the women who participated in the study believed HIV could be transmitted by mosquitoes, over 25 percent did not know that condoms could provide protection from HIV, and a majority believed that someone with HIV or AIDS could not look healthy. The Pakistan Country Report affirmed that 16 of the 24 respondents participating in the Bahrain FGDs had no knowledge about HIV and AIDS when they left Pakistan. Most of the low and semi-skilled Pakistani migrant workers responded that they did not use condoms while engaging in sexual activity with women sex workers in host countries. 2.7 Mandatory HIV Testing In host countries mandatory testing is generally used in tandem with deportation to stop the spread of HIV infection to the host population and to prevent the continued residence of migrant workers who are seen as a potential burden on the country\u2019s health care system. However, UNAIDS states that existing epidemiological data on HIV transmission demonstrates that allowing HIV-positive foreigners into a country does not create an additional risk to the population of the host country36. Rather, such prevention tends to create a false sense of security in host populations. Furthermore, the policy of mandatory HIV testing and deportation of migrant workers as it is currently practiced has been found to breach international guidelines on HIV testing and to violate the human rights of migrant workers 37. The seven-country research indicated similar patterns in both origin and host countries in the mandatory HIV testing of migrant workers as a pre-employment fitness requirement and, in host countries, periodic screening needed for the renewal of work permits. In both origin and host countries there was a general breach of the internationally recognized 3Cs of HIV testing38, namely, that testing should be Confidential, accompanied by Counseling, and only be conducted with informed Consent. There was also evidence to indicate that personnel involved in 36 UNAIDS-IOM (2004) 37 CARAM Asia (2007) 38 UNAIDS-WHO (2004). ReGIONAL ANALYSIS 39 HIV testing in both origin and host countries lacked the required knowledge regarding HIV testing polices and guidelines A 2007 CARAM Asia study39 on mandatory HIV testing noted that in Bahrain, \u201clanguage diversity among health centre staff is low\u201d and could be a reason for the inability to provide proper counseling together with HIV testing. It added that GAMCA (GCC Approved Medical Centres Association) guidelines do not require staff to be able to speak migrants\u2019 languages. Furthermore, GAMCA guidelines require that migrant workers should indicate their consent by signing an english/Arabic form on their medical report. However, this form cannot be understood or filled out by migrant workers who do not know either language. Moreover, many workers stated that no consent or signature was asked of them at the time of testing, and several interviewees indicated that it was their sponsor who had signed the consent form for their test. In Dubai, the study noted that the general feeling among migrant workers during testing is that of fear of being declared unfit and losing the right to work in the emirates. Among the migrants covered in this study, none could recollect having been asked for their consent prior to testing, nor did anyone explain to them about the tests and the possible consequences of an adverse result.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cccecdf5-a187-4a63-a2f5-86a891f0ecd4": {"__data__": {"id_": "cccecdf5-a187-4a63-a2f5-86a891f0ecd4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV Vulnerabilities of Migrant Women: from Asia to the Arab States", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "399f1df2a063a14d8510e7ac3cfc333710c9bef520355473a1239533a9f752e0"}}, "hash": "399f1df2a063a14d8510e7ac3cfc333710c9bef520355473a1239533a9f752e0", "text": "Further, none could recollect undergoing any pre-test or post-test counseling. This observation was also confirmed by the staff of a testing centre. As one respondent noted: \u201cNo counseling is done here. We do not inform the testee also. It is confidential, no?\u201d Other critical issues related to mandatory HIV testing and deportation evidenced in host countries include: l Compromised confidentiality of HIV status, with the migrant worker being the last to know the reason for deportation. The report found cases of those who did not know that they had been deported because of HIV, but only belatedly discovered this fact when they decided to migrate again and had to pass the medical examination. This lack of awareness has serious consequences for the health and HIV vulnerability of the spouses/partners of HIV-positive migrants and for the migrants themselves. In this research, migrant workers who were aware of their HIV status reported that they took precautions to prevent transmission of the disease. However, for those who were unaware, there is a substantial risk of further transmission. l Fear of a potentially unfit medical status has been known to lead migrant workers to opt for irregular status, which can lead to further abuse, extortion, exploitation, and blackmail. l The rapidity with which a migrant worker found to be HIV-positive is deported precludes the scope of possible supportive interventions, such as post-test counseling and positive prevention education. It also does not allow space for providing referrals for support to the migrant worker upon return to her country of origin. Most often, embassies are not informed of the deportation either. The impact of mandatory HIV testing and deportation on HIV- positive migrant workers and his/her family is enormous. Not only do they have to deal with loss of livelihood opportunities, but they must confront new challenges of stigma, discrimination, loss of social status, restricted employment options, and the pressure of securing treatment and dealing with the disease in general. All of these create new risks and vulnerabilities for their health and welfare, as well that for their spouses/partners and families. Fortunately however, access to treatment, which is becoming increasingly affordable, has the capacity to mitigate some of these risks and vulnerabilities. 2.8 Physical and Sexual Abuse The isolated and individualized nature of household work within a private home, combined with the fact that local labour laws do not cover domestic work, can put women migrants at greater risk to verbal, physical, and sexual abuse. These abuses have the potential to affect general, mental, and sexual and reproductive health, as well as the risk to HIV. The Bangladesh report, for example, noted that the majority of those interviewed said that they had been abused physically and verbally by their employers. Most said it was a common ReGIONAL ANALYSIS 39 CARAM Asia - State of Health of Migrants 2007. 40 phenomenon in their daily life. In most cases, children were said to punch, kick, or bite the domestic workers without provocation, and were seldom reprimanded by their parents. Some women also reported that young men in the household sexually harassed them and/or offered money in exchange for sex. In some instances physical violence was involved. The research indicates that even if women flee from private homes to escape abusive situations, they are often faced with circumstances that are equally abusive. Frequently, they are raped and/or forced into sex work by people who offered to help them escape. This was particularly evidenced in the Sri Lanka report. Interviews with Sri Lankan women indicate that women migrant workers experience sexual harassment and rape in all stages of migration: pre-migration planning, start of migration within Sri Lanka, transiting to the host country, working abroad, while leaving/escaping, and upon return (reintegration). eight women shared experiences of sexual abuse by their male employers, ranging from harassment to rape. They also reported physical abuse, including being slapped and hit by their employers and recruiting agents. Women who worked as waitresses in hotels also experienced sexual harassment by boyfriends, employers, and/or strangers. The Sri Lankan research also found that security was a major issue prior to departure and upon return. Several women who had to travel long distances from their villages to pre-departure trainings or from the airport back to their homes reported being taken advantage of by hiring agents, employers, and taxi drivers.

While origin and host countries have been taking steps towards building the necessary infrastructure and programmes, gaps remain. Bahrain: In 1986 the Government of Bahrain established the National Committee for Prevention of AIDS (NCPA), which is responsible for the policy formulation, resource mobilization, and advocacy for HIV/AIDS activities in the country. The NCPA has bilateral partners aboard and addresses a variety of activities and constituencies, including health and education personnel, religious affairs, people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV), the uniformed forces, and youth in sports. Furthermore, four subcommittees on HIV/AIDS were established by ministerial decree. These subcommittees coordinate and implement services for HIV/AIDS awareness and counseling, treatment, research, information, and public health. Information, education, and Communication (IeC) has been the NCPA\u2019s major strategy in response to HIV/AIDS. Diverse forms of IeC messages and materials have been developed and disseminated by the NCPA and other stakeholders, including the Ministry of Religious Affairs, the Family Planning Association, and the Red Crescent. Dubai, United Arab Emirates: The National AIDS Prevention Programme in the Ministry of Health is tasked with generating HIV/AIDS awareness among the general population. Given that new HIV infections are reported primarily among youth, the awareness programmes focus on this age group. The awareness programmes include the development and distribution of leaflets and pamphlets both in english and Arabic and of television advertisements. Religious groups are also involved in generating awareness. However, to date there has not been any focused prevention programme designed for migrants. The national programme provides free care, support, and treatment services to UAe nationals. Currently, there is no national HIV strategic framework, but the government is in the initial stages of developing such a framework, and it is expected to be in place some time in 2009. That framework will include: l A review of national HIV and AIDS policy that requires mandatory HIV testing and deportation of migrant workers. l\ufffd Inclusion of migrant workers within the national HIV framework. l\ufffd Migrants\u2019 access to voluntary and confidential HIV testing, as well as to treatment, care, and support. l establishment of Voluntary Counseling Centres, available to migrant workers and addressing linguistic needs of the migrant population. l extension of HIV prevention programs to migrant workers. l encouragement of the private sector to join the fight against HIV and AIDS. Lebanon: As a national response to the HIV epidemic, the Lebanese Government declared in 1988 that HIV/AIDS was a threat to public health. Consequently, the National AIDS Control Programme (NAP) was created in 1989 - a joint programme of the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) and the World Health Organization (WHO). Its objectives are to: 1. encourage preventive measures and safer sexual behavior to limit the spread of HIV. 2. Reduce the impact of HIV on health and society. 3. Identify and mobilize the local and external resources that could be used in the fight against AIDS. Primarily, the NAP has performed activities based on short-term action plans, notably the local epidemiological situation, needs assessment, and KABP (Knowledge, Attitude, Behaviors, and Practices) studies. Medium-term planning that was undertaken for the period 1995 to 2000 identified a number of at-risk groups: youth (in and out of school), travelers and migrants, women (particularly women sex workers), men who have sex with men (MSM), intravenous drug users (IDU), prisoners, and members of the armed forces. In addition, several acts or mandates related to HIV control were put into laws or decrees, such as those related to the safety of donated blood, mandatory declaration, confidentiality, non-discrimination, and compulsory HIV testing of foreigners seeking a work permit. Since 1997, the Ministry of Public Health has vowed to increase the supply of Anti-Retro Viral treatment (ARV) to AIDS patients; also, if migrants are found HIV- positive, they are given ARV in the event that they need them ReGIONAL ANALYSIS 42 before being repatriated. The government\u2019s commitment to fight HIV and AIDS is also seen in its collaboration with the private sector and international agencies.

It is imperative that migrant workers are included within national HIV and AIDS action plans of the host countries, as it has been demonstrated that protecting migrant populations against HIV enhances the resilience of the host populations against the spread of infection. 2.10 Support Systems Support systems are critical in facilitating migrants\u2019 adaptation to new environments and contexts. For migrant workers, support systems generally include formal and informal networks of family and friends in the origin and host countries, consular support, and the support mechanisms of the host country, NGOs, and faith-based organizations. The seven-country research explored the available support systems for women migrant workers in the three host locations, specifically, Manammah (Bahrain), Beirut (Lebanon), and Dubai (UAe). Migrant social networks seemed to be a major source of support for meeting material needs, especially when in abusive situations. These networks consisted mainly of fellow migrant workers, both men and women. It was not uncommon to see support being sought from and given to fellow migrant workers of a different nationality. Often in such situations, support for women migrant workers did not come without a price; and some had no choice but to be in a relationship with a man in order to meet material needs. With regard to formal support systems, the studies indicate the following services: EMBASSIES Bangladesh: The review of literature in the Bangladesh Country Report and the primary data gathered indicate that the Bangladeshi embassies/ consulates lack the capacity to meet the consular needs of migrant workers. Non-cooperation and lack of assistance by Bangladeshi embassy or consulate staff were common complaints. This was a regret expressed also by NGOs in Lebanon and Bahrain. In all three countries \u2013 Bahrain, Lebanon, and the UAe \u2013 many research participants were unaware of the availability of consular services. The small number of domestic workers who accessed these services complained that they had to go several times for a single purpose, which involved considerable loss of time and money. In Dubai, the Bangladeshi consulate office is only able to provide services related to passports, such as passport delivery and renewal. In Bahrain, the embassy provides humanitarian and legal support services, if requested by the migrants. An avenue to access this support was the Open House Service, organized by the embassy once a month. In addition, two medical doctors run a monthly health clinic within the embassy itself. In Lebanon, the consulate is for visa purposes and for limited legal assistance only. The nearest embassy otherwise is in Jordan. ReGIONAL ANALYSIS 43 Pakistan: Information from migrant workers indicates that there is little interaction between embassy officials and Pakistani nationals working in the Arab States. As the country report notes, \u201cThe embassy does not handle any cases related to sexual abuse, rights violations, and health issues such as HIV and AIDS because it has no organized policy to provide help to migrant workers.\u201d even in cases of deportation due to HIV, Pakistani embassy officials are not informed by the agencies in the host country because there is no existing policy to exchange such information.\u201d (Pakistan Country Report). Philippines: The Government of the Philippines has a formal support system for migrant workers through its Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) and its embassies. Shelters run by the embassies and the Philippine Overseas Labour Office (POLO) offer food and accommodation to abused OFWs. At the time of the research, there were 80 women in the shelter in Bahrain and 54 in Dubai, UAe. These shelters are also supported by NGOs, civic organizations, and religious groups, which provide donations of clothing, food, toiletries, and even plane tickets back to the Philippines. In Bahrain, Dubai, and Lebanon it is not possible for either the embassy or the POLO to fetch a domestic worker from her employer\u2019s home following a complaint of abuse. However, in Lebanon, complaints received by the embassy from domestic workers regarding employers are referred to the Lebanese General Services Office, which takes appropriate action.

Sri Lanka does not have an embassy or consulate in Bahrain. A volunteer consul, who is also a member of the white-collared Sri Lankan Club in Manama, tries to serve the needs of the approximately 12,000 large Sri Lankan community in Bahrain by assisting with visas, emergency return migration, repatriation of bodies, hospital and jail visits. The Migrant Workers Protection Agency (MWPA) and the Manama Sri Lanka Club affirmed a major need for effective and adequate consular representation and services for visas, legal assistance, medical care, and other emergency assistance. NGOS AND FAITH-BASED GROUPS In many instances where embassies and states are not able to protect migrant workers, NGOs and faith-based groups step in to try and assist those in need. In Bahrain, besides the services offered by the Manama Club (as discussed above), the Migrant Workers Protection Society assists migrants needing emergency assistance40.

The Afro-Asian Migrant Center has a community center where approximately 100 migrant women go to share a meal and meet other migrants. The center also offers counseling, english language classes, legal support, Catholic spiritual training, health screening, and transport to health facilities, if needed. The Caritas Lebanon Migrant Center (CLMC, which is part of Caritas Internationalis) is the primary reference agency when it comes to migration issues. It offers a broad array of services that are provided nation-wide to migrants inside and outside 40 This is an important model for the Arab States to highlight as a prototype of organizing for migrant workers where they are not legally allowed to form their own organizations.

These anti - trafficking measures would offer more scope for strengthening the protection of women migrant workers, especially domestic workers, if they could be expanded to extend services beyond trafficked persons who formally identify themselves to the system. There is also need for the capacity building of enforcement officials in dealing with women who have been trafficked. Bahrain: Like the UAe, Bahrain has taken several anti-trafficking measures and has pursued legislative reform to address the problems of migrant workers, especially domestic workers. In its Universal Period Review report (2008), Bahrain stated that it had developed special measures for the protection of women migrant workers, including the establishment of a shelter for women victims of violence and a hotline to report violence against domestic workers. Bahrain also has a law for the protection of victims of violence within homes, as well as a special home for the protection of those who might be exposed to violence, including domestic workers. In addition, Bahrain has a law regarding unemployment benefits, which are available to migrant workers if they lose their job. Bahrain has also taken several specific anti-trafficking measures, which include: l Distribution of multilingual brochures to migrant workers on their rights and resources in the country. 41 Combating Human Trafficking, United Arab emirates Annual Report 2007. ReGIONAL ANALYSIS 45 l A 60-bed shelter offering medical, psychological, and legal care open to non-Bahrainis. l A 24-hour hotline for women victims of violence, including advice on dispute resolution. These are all welcome efforts to enhance the protection of women migrant workers. Although they are geared to reducing the vulnerability of women migrants to human trafficking, they have the additional potential to reduce their vulnerability to health and HIV risks. Lebanon: Lebanese law entitles foreign workers who are in possession of a work residency permit to enjoy full social rights. The Lebanese General Security is partnering with the Caritas Migrant Centre in the implementation of a regional pilot project aimed at protecting and assisting victims of trafficking. The project involves admission to a safe house, provision of humanitarian, medical, social, and legal assistance, as well as trauma counseling. Two 24-hours hotlines enable the staff to receive complaints. Project activities include raising awareness among General Security investigators and prison guards regarding the rights of migrants and trafficking issues, as well as improving interview/ investigation techniques with victims of trafficking. Furthermore, the government has formed a National Steering Committee to Combat trafficking, of which the Caritas Migrant Center is part. The center is the sole NGO in Lebanon allowed ReGIONAL ANALYSIS 46 by the General Security to operate within the retention center, whereby a multidisciplinary team ensures social, medical, and legal aid at all times. The General Security refers to CLMC all pregnant or sick migrant women for shelter, as well as those women who are accompanied by their children. 2.11 Strengthening Inter-Regional Aspects of Support Systems Government efforts to secure the protection and promotion of the human rights of women migrant workers and to reduce their HIV vulnerability need to develop stronger cooperation in the functioning of government bodies inter-regionally. These include: l Coordination between the State departments and agencies in the countries of origin and their embassies in the host countries. l Coordination between embassies within a host country. l Greater coordination among State departments, agencies, and embassies within host countries. Government officials in both Dubai and Bahrain showed openness to dialogue with embassies on the problems faced by migrant workers, and suggested that embassies be more proactive in bringing forward problems. The need for embassies to be proactive in addressing the needs of migrant workers has been an issue that has been consistently raised by migrant workers and migrant support groups in past studies as well as in this research. For example, the monitoring of recruitment agencies in Bahrain through cooperation between the Bahrain Labour Market Regulatory Authority and the various embassies is said to be more effectively utilized by the Philippines embassy than it is by other embassies. 2.12 Conclusion - Post Arrival As this report shows, women migrant domestic workers in the Arab States find that their new environment and context brings new material, social, physical, and psychological needs.

Supporting factors include an enabling environment, recruitment of social support, and the building of cognitive and behavioral coping skills.42 Governments of origin and host countries have taken several measures that reflect their intent to find solutions to these difficult problems. However, more needs to be done to address the core problems regarding the vulnerability of women migrant workers in informal, unrecognized, and unprotected sectors, such as domestic work. Much stronger political will is needed to initiate legislative and policy reform and programmatic interventions to create an enabling environment that respects and protects the human rights and health of women migrant workers. Post Arrival Recommendations: enabling environments that build resilience and reduce HIV vulnerability in the onsite stage require, among other things: l\ufffd A coherent, effective, and responsive legal and extra-legal framework with equally effective enforcement. Given that most host countries have ratified the Convention on the elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CeDAW), it is critical that its integration in national law be based on the principle of substantive equality of women migrant workers in all spheres of life, as provided for by CeDAW. l The recognition of domestic work as professional work together with its legal and social protection are of paramount importance, because it is the absence of such recognition that is currently exacerbating the human rights violations and HIV vulnerability of women migrant workers in the domestic sector. Legal protection of domestic work under the law ought to include: l Standard contracts between employers and domestic workers, attested by the origin country embassy in the host country and having clear provisions for hours of work, days off, overtime pay, annual leave, accommodation, 42 Fine 1994; Blum, McNeely, and Nonnemaker 2001. ReGIONAL ANALYSIS 47 medical check-ups, social security, and comprehensive health and accident insurance. l Adequate access to legal support. l\ufffd effective enforcement of standardized contracts. l An assessment of the kafala sponsorship programme and the required policy reforms. l Public awareness and education efforts that promote non-discriminatory social norms and values that will facilitate supportive interpersonal relationships and interactions, and will positively influence normative frameworks of laws and policies. The recognition and legal protection of domestic work in itself will serve to reframe the discriminatory norms related to women and work done by women. l Universal access to health care services. l Inclusion of (women) migrant workers in national AIDS strategies and programme responses. l Review of policies related to mandatory HIV testing and deportation based on HIV status, and to the provision of/ access to treatment. l Availability and accessibility of adequate social support systems and programs that enhance the capacity of women migrant workers to adapt to their new situation. l On-site information programs providing women migrants with integrated, timely, accurate, and adequate information. l Strengthening of existing social services to make them safer and more accessible, especially when women migrant workers are in crisis. l Humane deportation processes for those who entered unauthorized. l Support for networks and organizations initiated by women migrant workers. ReGIONAL ANALYSIS 48 3. Reintegration The preceding two sections have indicated that inadequate preparation for migration during the pre-departure stage contributes to HIV vulnerability, and this condition is further aggravated in host countries by inadequate or unhelpful policies and laws, conflicts of societal norms and values, and inadequate availability/access to supportive programs and services. The process of reintegration also contributes to the risk of HIV infection and/or creates further vulnerabilities for women migrants. 3.1 Stigma and Discrimination towards women Migrant workers Stigma and discrimination confront women migrant workers in all stages of migration in a far broader context than HIV alone, though HIV does exacerbate the situation. In some cases women migrate as a means to overcome discrimination related to the stigma of being widowed, of being single and beyond the socially acceptable age of marriage, and/or of being poor and dispossessed of property and material assets. However, in migrating from home they also transgress a social norm that assumes the immobility of women, and thus in some countries they face the stigma of being viewed as an \u201cimpure\u201d woman who lives away from the watchful eye of family and community. Life abroad brings its own forms of stigmatization.

In the Sri Lanka Country Report, the Migrant Services Center, an NGO based in Colombo, notes that \u201cone of the biggest concerns for migrant returnees who are HIV positive is discrimination. They go into hiding, remain unemployed, and do not receive adequate health care.\u201d Just as stigma and discrimination are being factored into HIV and AIDS policy-making and programming, the specific context of stigma and discrimination with regard to migrant workers needs to be integrated into efforts that link migration and HIV so as to make migration safer and to reduce the HIV vulnerability of migrant workers. Given the differences in the experience of HIV by women and men, the needs of HIV-positive women migrant workers need to be analyzed and addressed from a gender perspective. 3.2 Positive Prevention \u201cSome male migrants do not even inform their spouses about their HIV status.\u201d Bangladesh Country Report Positive prevention refers to HIV prevention that focuses on people living with HIV. Promotion of preventive behaviors among PLHIV and their partners improves their health while reducing HIV transmission46. It is thus crucial that positive prevention programs should be made available for migrant workers who test positive with HIV. As noted above, the sexual partners of HIV-positive migrant workers are at risk of contracting HIV, particularly when the status of the HIV-positive partner is not known and precautions are not taken to prevent transmission. There is also the threat of social discrimination and reprisal, which leads to fear in getting access to information and services, including health care. Furthermore, the gender power imbalance in many sexual relationships limits the opportunities for women to negotiate for safer sex. In the Sri Lanka report, all of the HIV-positive migrants who participated in this study were unaware of HIV prior to contracting it. Five of the fifteen HIV-positive participants interviewed had heard of AIDS, but had never heard of HIV until a doctor explained that they were positive. Furthermore, nearly half of the fifteen were still uncertain as to how they could spread the disease. Two individuals feared telling their spouses, and, without explanation, merely refused to engage in sexual relations with them. Another woman was afraid to cook for her family as she feared transmitting HIV through utensils and crockery. Positive prevention in tandem with access to treatment and other structural efforts, e.g. the development of positive laws and policies that build a facilitative or enabling environment, would significantly facilitate the control of HIV.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d848e939-60c7-41cc-9f65-2a07e60c4c93": {"__data__": {"id_": "d848e939-60c7-41cc-9f65-2a07e60c4c93", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV Vulnerabilities of Migrant Women: from Asia to the Arab States", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "240e4296286eed4b4063a0e5a2ef46cb7205485cc1bc0dd198dc64842dff0e5a"}, "2": {"node_id": "3a453d54-0718-476b-89d5-4567ced81b1b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cb6cd7ff2e48e2899bf55f1cb57131ffcd865af86eba67f82c091c7df9840726"}}, "hash": "a449b0e7e1412fbdb6510a8f329f0960d729cb4b4eb308f10f4e911978d111f1", "text": "In the context of migration and HIV, this would require national and inter-regional cooperation among agencies involved in HIV testing, including government bodies, embassies, PLHA groups, and organizations working with migrant workers, international agencies, and national AIDS committees. 3.3 Conclusion - Reintegration The reintegration stage of migration is as fraught with vulnerability as its preceding two stages.

Women migrant workers who are HIV-positive endure amplified discrimination because of misguided norms that associate the movement of women beyond their homes and/or HIV infection with promiscuity.

ReGIONAL ANALYSIS 50 HIV status and/or without knowledge of how to maintain good health and prevent transmission. On the other hand, in terms of the reintegration process, it is common for returning migrants to find an unchanged domestic economic and political context that offers restricted opportunities for gainful employment and little value for any newly acquired skills (particularly female domestic migrant workers) - a situation often compounded by small savings and high debt. Rather, the successful adaptation of women migrant workers in the reintegration phase and reduction of their HIV vulnerability requires the following: l\ufffd Adequate attention to the needs of reintegration in the pre- departure and post-arrival programmes in terms of information, savings programs, and skills building. l Reintegration programmes addressing economic, social, and psychological needs of domestic workers must be established and sustained, particularly for those returning due to problems encountered abroad, e.g. exploitation, violence, illnesses, and mental health. l Increase in access to treatment and positive prevention programs for returning women migrant workers who are HIV-positive. l Mainstreaming of migrant perspectives and issues into discourses and programmes that deal with HIV-related stigma and discrimination. l Creation of alternative livelihood opportunities to broaden the choices available to returning women migrant workers and thereby ease the pressures under which they might decide to re-emigrate. l Lastly, there are still many gaps in the understanding of the HIV vulnerability of women migrant workers during the reintegration stage, and more research needs to be conducted in order to strengthen programmatic interventions on their behalf. Regional Recommendations: The protection of migrant workers is a transnational issue involving a variety of actors. The discourse on migration in migrant worker and civil society forums has largely focused on the protection needs of migrant workers. Human rights violations in all stages of migration and the need for stronger protections have been emphasized. It has also been highlighted that limited opportunities for regular migration coupled with inadequate systems of protection give rise to human rights violations and create situations of irregular migration when workers, in a bid to escape abusive situations, end up outside systems of due process, and may even find themselves as victims of human trafficking and/or smuggling. Women migrant workers are more vulnerable within such a schema - especially because of their presence in occupations that are largely informal, unrecognized, and unprotected. Superimposing the HIV dimension upon the complexity of migration magnifies the need for systematic, coherent, and integrated approaches to dealing with migration and HIV. 4. Requisites For Regional Approaches The success of regional approaches is incumbent upon integrated responses, given the multi-sectoral nature of the problem. This requires greater coordination of various ministries, including and not limited to ministries of labour, immigration, health, women\u2019s affairs, and social welfare. Also needed is a comprehensive legal, policy, and programmatic response that takes an integrated approach to the health needs of migrant workers, including HIV. The effectiveness of such an integrated approach can only be sustained through harmonized regional policies on mobility, health, and HIV that are contextualized within the broader regional socio-economic context of the inequalities that drive migration and the HIV epidemic. Harmonized regional policies on migration and HIV need to be based on the principle of reciprocity, common goals, and a common vision to reduce inequalities and address the interests of origin and host countries in a fair and equitable manner. They also need to include monitoring and data collection strategies that go beyond mere monitoring of migration flows to monitoring the human rights extended to migrant workers. The discussion thus far has illustrated the centrality of the State\u2019s role in the realization of protections for women migrant workers and reducing their HIV vulnerability through the development of enabling environments, including coherent and systematic legal and policy frameworks. This also includes coherent mechanisms ReGIONAL ANALYSIS 51 of governance.

This is partly because of their proximity to women migrant workers, and because of an existing mutual trust and rapport that is a pre-requisite for interventions that seek to develop cognitive and behavioral coping skills that build resilience, especially in hard to reach populations like women migrant workers. This research emphasizes the need for combined and multiple approaches to address HIV vulnerability in women migrant workers, and especially the uniqueness of community-based interventions. The value of prevention and early intervention in policy and programmatic responses to address the HIV vulnerability of migrant workers was also emphasized in all the studies of the research. Comprehensive pre-departure programs and post- arrival education programs, compliance with the internationally recognized 3Cs of HIV testing to optimize opportunities for HIV education for migrant workers, and access to health-care services were among some of the identified measures. On-site especially, the principle of prevention needs greater attention within existing support systems for women migrant workers.

While the need for such systems cannot be underestimated, there is also a need for support systems that proactively build resilience in women migrant workers, help them to adapt positively to changed contexts and environments, and in that sense help minimize the need for crisis interventions. ReGIONAL ANALYSIS 52 Given the interface between human rights and the resilience of migrant workers to HIV, the integration of the former into regional policies and programmes to reduce HIV vulnerability is critical. Ratification of the core international human rights instruments, especially the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and ILO conventions 97 and 143, by both origin and host countries, would provide a common framework for perspectives related to the protection of women migrant workers and the governance of migration. 4.1 Migration and HIV: Forms of Regional Cooperation There are some good examples of various forms of regional cooperation, including attempts to foster common understanding and to explore common strategies, that are being undertaken by states, civil society, and international agencies to make migration safer. Some of these focus specifically on migrant domestic workers and HIV, and can operate as vehicles to further communicate the importance of taking action to ensure safe mobility for migrant women. A few of these are highlighted below. 4.2 Regional Consultative Processes Regional Consultative Processes (RCPs) are cooperative mechanisms for managing international migration that include, inter alia, discussions on the benefits of common approaches and even, in some cases, harmonizing policies47. The majority of RCPs address a wide range of issues, such as migration and development, migration trends, social integration of migrants, protection of migrants\u2019 rights, smuggling and human trafficking, migration and health, migration and trade48. Regional Consultative Processes related to labour migration include: Ministerial Consultations on Overseas Employment and Contractual Labour (The Colombo Process)49 : The International Organization for Migration (IOM) acts as the secretariat for the Colombo Process, whose focus areas include: protecting vulnerable migrants and providing support services, optimizing benefits of organized labour migration, capacity building, data collection, and inter- state cooperation. The priorities of the Colombo Process are: 1. The adaptation of the common training curriculum for labour administrators and labour attach\u00e9s for national-level training. 2. Taking further steps for the establishment of a common migrants\u2019 resource centre. 3. establishment of regular information sharing mechanisms. 4. Active exploration of opportunities for dialogue and cooperation with host countries. The Colombo Process, which was established in 2003, was originally a grouping of eleven Asian labour-sending countries meant to share experiences in organizing overseas work. After three ministerial meetings in Colombo, Manila, and Bali, it was expanded to include labour-receiving countries in the eU, the Gulf, and Asia50. The Abu Dhabi Dialogue followed these three consultations in January 2008. The Abu Dhabi Declaration was adopted by Afghanistan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Kuwait, Malaysia, Nepal, Oman, Pakistan, the Philippines, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, United Arab emirates, Vietnam, and Yemen on 22 January 2008. Collectively, this group is known as the Ministerial Consultation on Overseas employment and Contractual Labour for Countries of Origin and Destination in Asia, referred to as the Abu Dhabi Dialogue. The Abu Dhabi Declaration established four partnerships that were designed to: m enhance knowledge and share information about labour migration; m assist countries to build capacity by providing training and assisting in the development of a framework of laws to address the many issues that affect contractual labour; m prevent illegal practices and improve the quality of life of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6832059c-cddc-47f1-9c7a-466aced74669": {"__data__": {"id_": "6832059c-cddc-47f1-9c7a-466aced74669", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV Vulnerabilities of Migrant Women: from Asia to the Arab States", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4ef112eb6594b33037f2e6c6c1af5876ec69e0fa3e5614a14ee80f0189e862bb"}, "3": {"node_id": "f2bee17a-1e8a-4f55-b4cb-3bb15e7312fe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "85436f3cba4e99f38dd5fc27546d8a96e3bae2811acade983a4bfd3549a9c8f0"}}, "hash": "baa10fad4587d6d12803f93f65b5ace6ffac2587526fb3f1be2fe478edb470aa", "text": "migrant workers; m provide a smooth transition for workers as they begin their employment and, again, to reintegrate them into their home countries. 47 IOM 2002. 48 Regional Consultative Processes, at www.iom.int/jahia/Jahia/cache/offonce/pid/386 49 Matrix of RCP, at www.iom.int/jahia/webdav/site/myjahiasite/shared/shared/mainsite/microsites/rcps/May%2019%20Matrix%20of%20Major%20RCPs.pdf 50 6th ASeM Meeting for Directors General on Management of Migratory Flows between Asia and europe, at www.belgium.iom.int/document/Dec_KP_Article%20DG%20 Keynote%20at%20ASeM.pdf. ReGIONAL ANALYSIS 53 Though RCPs do not aim to have a normative impact, there are exceptions. For example, the Manila Process - led by the IOM - initiated the 1999 Bangkok Declaration on Irregular Migration that feeds into some of the ongoing RCPs. RCPs have also been known to enhance regional coordination on migration, build trust and a better common understanding of migration issues, and provide an alternative to global migration management forums 51. Other State-led regional cooperation efforts related to migration and HIV (though not always jointly) include: l The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Convention on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution, which promotes regional cooperation for the prevention, interdiction, and suppression of trafficking by international prostitution networks, and the repatriation and rehabilitation of victims. l The Coordinated Mekong Ministerial Initiative against Trafficking, which identifies a framework for a systematic response to human trafficking and a three-year sub-regional Plan of Action for collaborative efforts to protect victims of human trafficking, promote cooperation in investigating and prosecuting traffickers, and undertake protective efforts to address vulnerability to trafficking. l SAARC-UNDP-ILO Workshop on Leadership and Development Challenges in Addressing HIV/AIDS and Mobility, Kathmandu, Nepal, 23-25 June 2008, which made several national and regional-level recommendations for SAARC countries to combat HIV in the context of migration. Regional-level recommendations include: \ufffd m establishing an Inter-ministerial Group of SAARC Member States representing health, labour, and other relevant ministries to discuss issues of HIV and mobility, to recommend actions for improved collaboration between labour-sending and receiving countries, and to strengthen labour policies/ laws based on ILO conventions and other relevant UN instruments, such as CeDAW, the ILO multilateral framework for migration, and the ILO Code of Practice on HIV/AIDS. l ASeAN Declaration on the Protection and Promotion of the Rights of Migrant Workers, signed on 13 January 2007 by all ten Heads of State at the ASeAN Summit in Cebu, Philippines52. As a follow-up to the above declaration, the ASeAN ministers also established the Committee on the Implementation of the ASeAN Declaration on the Protection and Promotion of the Rights of Migrant Workers53 during the 40th ASeAN Ministerial Meeting, held in Manila, 29 July to 2 August 2007. As an update to this, ASeAN convened a Forum on Migrant Labour on 24-25 April 2008 in Manila, and among the recommendations of the forum was to operationalize the ASeAN Declaration on Migration specifically to: l Convene the first meeting of the ASeAN Committee on the Implementation of the Declaration on the Protection and Promotion of the Rights of Migrant Workers before the 14th ASeAN Summit, held in Bangkok, December 2008. l Operationalize the structure and function of the committee in accordance with the provisions of the statement on the establishment of the ASeAN Committee, which was adopted during the 40th ASeAN Ministerial Meeting on 30 July 2007. l Institutionalize and convene on a regular basis the ASeAN Forum on Migrant Labour as a platform for broad-based discussions on migrant labour issues under the auspices of the committee, which reports to SLOM. l Task the committee to determine its work plan, including the timeline towards the development of the instrument on the Protection and Promotion of the Rights of Migrant Workers as provided in the ASeAN Declaration on the Protection and Promotion of the Rights of Migrant Workers. 51 UN economic and Social Council 2005. 52 At www.aseansec.org/20768.htm.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f2bee17a-1e8a-4f55-b4cb-3bb15e7312fe": {"__data__": {"id_": "f2bee17a-1e8a-4f55-b4cb-3bb15e7312fe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV Vulnerabilities of Migrant Women: from Asia to the Arab States", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4ef112eb6594b33037f2e6c6c1af5876ec69e0fa3e5614a14ee80f0189e862bb"}, "2": {"node_id": "6832059c-cddc-47f1-9c7a-466aced74669", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "baa10fad4587d6d12803f93f65b5ace6ffac2587526fb3f1be2fe478edb470aa"}}, "hash": "85436f3cba4e99f38dd5fc27546d8a96e3bae2811acade983a4bfd3549a9c8f0", "text": "52 At www.aseansec.org/20768.htm. 53 Ibid.

The representatives at the forum welcomed Jordan\u2019s recent move to amend its labour laws to include the protection of all domestic workers, but emphasized the need for implementation to begin as soon as possible. The signing of the amendment, which ReGIONAL ANALYSIS 55 was gazetted on 17 August 2008 by His Royal Highness King Abdullah II, coincided with growing public awareness of cases in which foreign domestic workers have been subjected to serious violations, including physical abuse, non-payment of wages, and denial of rest days 54. Jakarta Process The Jakarta Process is a coalition of national and regional organizations and national human rights institutions that seeks to promote the role and mandate of national human rights institutions in increasing the human rights protection of migrant domestic workers and irregular migrant workers.

ReGIONAL ANALYSIS 57 5. Recommendations The foregoing analysis of the seven country reports points to key areas that need to be addressed to reduce the HIV vulnerability of migrant workers. These key areas cover a wide range of issues and require comprehensive strategies for the effectiveness and sustainability of interventions. This, in turn, necessitates a broad- based approach capable of harnessing collaboration among governments of origin and host countries, international agencies (including those of the UN, (i.e. ILO, IOM, and others), as well as NGOs and migrant associations. A proactive approach is vital for moving the recommendations forward. As can be seen in Table 4, positive steps have been taken by origin and host countries to address the needs of migrant workers and, in particular, the needs of migrant workers in regards to HIV protection and services. While emerging good practices include bilateral agreements, mechanisms that allow migrant workers to file employment complaints, support to NGOs that address the concerns of migrants, and legislation to protect the rights of migrant workers, there remains a gap between laws and enabling practices. To ensure the safety of migrant workers and that they are provided with quality working and living conditions, there is an urgent need to improve the design of pre-departure trainings, to regulate the functioning of recruitment agencies, and institute migrant friendly HIV testing. With regard to domestic workers, domestic work needs to be brought under the ambit of labour laws in the host countries. The Philippines stands out as a country that provides a variety of protections and services for its migrant workers, varying from pre-departure and embassy staff HIV training to reintegration training and support for migrants who are HIV positive. On the back of such support systems, Filipino workers are often less vulnerable, receive higher wages, and are able to demand more equitable treatment in host countries. Conversely, when enforceable mechanisms and laws are not in place, this lacuna is reflected in poorer living and working conditions for migrant workers in host countries. Governments play a unique role in developing and sustaining facilitative environments that would ensure the protection of the human rights of women migrant workers and reduce their HIV vulnerability. An integrated multi-sectoral and inter-regional approach is required. 1. Inter-regional dialogue and coordination for the promotion and protection of the rights, health, and well-being of women migrant workers must be initiated jointly by the ministries of health, labour, foreign affairs, and social welfare in origin and host countries. 2. Governments of origin and host countries need to demonstrate their commitment to reducing the HIV vulnerability of women migrant workers by institutionalizing the protections required in bilateral and multilateral memoranda of understanding and agreements. 3. Migrants who have a medical condition that does not impair their ability to work, such as living with HIV, should not be denied the right to work. 4. Health insurance schemes for migrant workers should cover all aspects of health, including HIV. In addition, insurance schemes should ensure affordable health care. 5. A migration ranking system should be developed, similar to the US trafficking tier 1-3 ranking system. Such a system would 1) assist authorities in the country to know what measures need to be taken to improve the situation, and 2) inform workers of migrant safe practices within a given country. 6. Hiring agent and employer blacklists need to be created, monitored, and shared with all migrants, hiring agents, embassies, and both origin and host country governments. Recommendations for both countries of origin and host countries: l Advocate bilateral agreements with host countries that standardize contracts and conditions of work for migrant domestic workers. explicitly outline their rights and obligations in order to minimize abuse. l Grant the same legal status to domestic work as is granted to professional work. l Ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and other relevant migrant conventions, as well as labour conventions such as ILO Convention 181 on the monitoring and regulation of private employment agencies. ReGIONAL ANALYSIS 58 l Initiate strategic regional, national, and international action across sectors - notably health, labour, and foreign affairs - to ensure safe access to HIV programmes and services for migrant and mobile populations. l establish and build capacity of government officials and CSOs to address the social and psychological needs of domestic workers, particularly those facing conditions of exploitation, violence, and poor health. l Train and utilize media to assist in creating informative messages on safe mobility and HIV.

For women who choose to become involved in intimate relationships during their periods of leisure, a concerted effort must be made to ensure that their health and safety is not compromised. l Include migrant workers in the National AIDS Programme response. 5.1 Recommendations for International Agencies The leverage that international agencies have in facilitating multi- sectoral forums and dialogues needs to be accessed to promote the human rights and health of women migrants and to secure their protection. l Initiate an Arab-Asian multi-sectoral forum similar to the JUNIMA for South-east Asia to meet periodically to exchange information and develop collaboration to address the HIV vulnerability of migrant workers, with a specific focus on women. l Strengthen initiatives in the SAARC region, involving the SAARC secretariat, to deal with HIV vulnerability of women migrant workers. l Support civil society groups, especially in host countries, to be effective partners in the fight against HIV and AIDS, specifically in relation to migrant workers. l Given the openness shown by several countries of origin in Asia and some Arab governments in working with the UN human rights system 56, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights is urged to integrate the human rights of migrant workers and their HIV vulnerability into its ongoing arrangements of technical cooperation on human rights with these governments. l Utilize the Universal Periodic Review, which assesses each UN Member State\u2019s fulfilment to its human rights obligations and commitments 56 See Appendix 2 for status of ratification of international treaties, including the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. ReGIONAL ANALYSIS 59 through a mechanism of the Human Rights Council, to assess progress and areas for improvement. l Share the findings of this research with the Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions. 5.2 Recommendations for National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) The unique position, role, and mandate of NHRIs within the human rights landscape and infrastructure of a country enables them to mediate between the state and society, and to provide transnational advocacy networks in conjunction with allies inside state bureaucracies. Thus, they are key to advancing the human rights of women migrant workers 57. l NHRIs in the Asian region are encouraged to proactively link with efforts in the Arab region to initiate NHRIs that would promote migrant workers\u2019 rights and their related vulnerabilities to HIV. 5.3 Recommendations for Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) NGOs, too, have a distinctive role to play in reducing the HIV vulnerability of women migrant workers, given their proximity to migrant workers and their mutual trust and rapport. l expand the reach of community-based interventions that address capacity-building on issues of migration, labour, and health as they relate to HIV. 57 Cardenas in Verghis and Conda 2008: 98).

Country Reports Countries of Origin & Host Countries 68 C. Country Reports Overview each country report presented in this section examines the situation of female migrants and their vulnerability to HIV infection in both origin and host countries. It also analyzes the laws, policies, programmes, and practices that are in place to protect female migrants from abuse and discrimination. Special focus has been placed on identifying deficiencies and gaps (both in origin and host countries) in existing mechanisms to ensure the safety of migrant workers and to minimize their risk of contracting HIV. In addition, host country reports highlight and examine the various perceptions of key stakeholders on the issues particular to women migrants and the efforts undertaken by home and host governments, embassies, and NGOs to protect female migrants against any form of human rights violation. It is envisaged that the generation of data on the HIV vulnerabilities of migrant workers, with specific focus on women and on existing responses in the host country, will highlight the need for the development of new and/or the scaling-up of existing HIV responses. COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN 1. Bangladesh 1.1 Introduction: Migration and HIV Data from the Bureau of Manpower, employment, and Training (BMeT) shows that from 1976 to January 2007 the total number of Bangladeshis working abroad as short-term migrants stood at 5,613,752. In 2007 alone, 832,609 migrants left Bangladesh and sent back $6.5 billion in remittances. Between 2006 and 2007, an estimated 18,000 women migrated from Bangladesh, compared to approximately 14,000 in 2005-2006. From 1991 to 2007, the majority of Bangladeshi women migrated to Saudi Arabia and the UAe. Between 1991 and May 2007, BMeT listed a total of only 69,967 women who migrated to Asian countries and the Arab States. Of these, 22,826 went to Saudi Arabia, while 20,482 went to the UAe. The next major destinations of Bangladeshi women migrants are Kuwait, Jordan, Malaysia, and Bahrain. From 1981 to 1998, the Bangladeshi Government repeatedly banned or restricted the emigration of women considered \u201cunskilled,\u201d which resulted in women migrants accounting for just 1 percent of the total flow of migration up to 2003. With the lifting of the ban and restrictions in 2003, the official flow of female migration rose to 6 percent in 2006. This official figure might be lower than the actual number as it is estimated that only 40 percent of women migrant workers migrate through recruitment agencies, while 60 percent leave in cooperation with relatives and friends who reside in the host countries. According to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), there were 1,207 registered HIV cases in December 2007. This was a sharp increase from only 363 registered cases in 2003. Overall, the prevalence of HIV in the general population is low, at under 0.1 percent 59. In Bangladesh, migrant workers account for a significant number of HIV cases, primarily because they are subjected to mandatory HIV testing. It has been estimated that 51 percent of the 219 confirmed cumulative HIV cases in 2002 were among returning migrant workers60. According to the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research (ICDDR), 47 of the 259 cases of people living with HIV during the period 2002-2004 were infected during the migration process. Of these, 29 were returning males from abroad, seven were wives of migrant workers, and four were children of HIV-positive migrant workers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c51d2364-3489-4489-960a-6653a383fc5c": {"__data__": {"id_": "c51d2364-3489-4489-960a-6653a383fc5c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV Vulnerabilities of Migrant Women: from Asia to the Arab States", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eebe0b41bf027b4b6ebecb6812af6d84a686033b6bc6547c8cd14a88e92a400a"}, "2": {"node_id": "5e502254-eda5-45b6-9693-46c6e161bc5c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e7a99099836af4da7d6f88bf980505ffa76690d9bba870ce559cb02ba109fe83"}}, "hash": "c5146018c47f92148a2fba2035dde4ebb8c6c2f9866c8c3fcae9a95de199cd9b", "text": "In 2004, data from the National AIDS/STD (Sexually Transmitted Disease) Programme of the MoHFW showed that 57 of the 102 newly reported HIV cases were among returning migrants.

COUNTRY RePORTS Countries of Origin 69 COUNTRY RePORTS Countries of Origin 1.2 Research Methodology The qualitative research in Bangladesh included interviews with 125 women returnee migrant workers. In the host countries, 53 domestic workers were involved in the study: 18 in Bahrain, 15 in Dubai, and 20 in Lebanon. An additional 17 women migrants, including workers in the garment industry, hotel-based sex workers, and bar and nightclub workers, were interviewed, as were some 45 male migrants who were either boyfriends or clients of sex workers. The snowball sampling61 method was followed to identify participants for the focus group discussions (FGD). Migrant women peer educators, trained by the Ovibashi Karmi Unnayan Program, were engaged to identify the returnee women migrants based on a set criteria - for example, country of employment, period of employment, employment category, income, and geographic origin. In Bangladesh, the research team conducted key informant interviews with stakeholders from government agencies, such as the Ministry of expatriate Welfare and Overseas employment (MoeWOe), BMeT, and Immigration. Other key informants included recruiting agents; international organizations, such as UNIFeM and IOM; local NGOs, such as HIV/AIDS and STD Alliance Bangladesh (HASAB); and people living with HIV (PLHIV) self- help groups, especially Mukto Akash Bangladesh and Ashar Alo Society. Onsite, the team conducted interviews with the consular officers in the Bangladesh missions and with migrant support organizations in all three host countries where the research took place. 61 \u201cSnowball sampling\u201d is a non-probability method of survey sample selection that is commonly used to locate hidden populations. This method relies on referrals from initially sampled respondents to other persons believed to have the characteristic(s) of interest. BANGLADESH BANGLADESH 70 1.3 Policies and Laws external migration in Bangladesh is regulated by the emigration Ordinance of 1982, which allows only persons with valid travel documents to emigrate. It also empowers the government to disallow emigration of persons of a particular occupation, profession, vocation, or qualification in the public interest. In 2002, this ordinance was revised and became emigration Rules, which, among other things, states the need \u201cto provide briefing to the outgoing overseas employees before issuance of emigration clearance.\u201d Moreover, the Code of Conduct of Recruiting Agencies and License Rules, also enacted in 2002, requires recruiting agents to ensure that migrant workers attend pre-departure briefings, and that recruitment agents must arrange for medical examinations From 1981 onwards, the Bangladesh Government repeatedly banned or restricted the out-migration of so-called \u201cunskilled\u201d women. In early 1981, a Presidential Order stated that professional and skilled women could migrate as \u201cprincipal workers\u201d (that is, primary bread winners). Semi-skilled and \u201cunskilled\u201d women could also migrate as principal workers, but they could not go overseas without a male guardian. In 1988, the government withdrew the ban but imposed a restriction on the migration of \u201cunskilled\u201d and semi-skilled women62. In 2003, an announcement was made that the employment of Bangladeshi women as domestic workers in Saudi Arabia would be permitted, provided they are above 35 years old, preferably married and accompanied by their husband. In September 2007, the Government of Bangladesh issued a gazette notification applicable only to female domestic workers bound for Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Arab States. This notification provided for particular rules regarding the issuance of a work permit (for example, minimum age of 25 for migration), visa processing, and mandatory training and briefing at the pre-departure stage. It also stated that a database of migrants be maintained and controlled by recruiting agencies, embassies, and the Bangladesh missions. With regards to HIV and AIDS, the National Policy developed in 1998 provides that HIV testing should be confidential or anonymous and that counseling services will be made available in all places where individuals are to be notified of test results. The policy further states that screening for HIV infection or other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) will not be mandatory for travelers or migrants into or out of the country. However, such is not the case for Bangladeshi migrant workers going to many countries in Asia and the Arab States, as it is required by their employers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bbc2222e-4813-4c8a-bfdb-2fbc83c988dc": {"__data__": {"id_": "bbc2222e-4813-4c8a-bfdb-2fbc83c988dc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV Vulnerabilities of Migrant Women: from Asia to the Arab States", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5388744d27b72bcc1d88cd8fe4424febdf910a9ee364c1d5bf088cd191bf73a5"}, "2": {"node_id": "40db54e1-5610-4175-aa37-5630acaf31be", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7adb9f1e8d8bed4b3a64702a1586ca39800a71eeea73ef9793580fcb836457ab"}}, "hash": "d488e9c0d3d15c3b77b666f29e07986bde82b40755b7691ca23e7d9cd375030a", "text": "In 2006, the government developed the National HIV/AIDS Communication Strategy 2005-2010, involving all relevant ministries, NGOs, the United Nations, and other development agencies.

In these cases, hiring agents are usually involved only for paper processing, including BMeT clearance, ticketing, and so forth. There is no mechanism to identify and regulate the middlemen who are recruiting domestic workers. At the time of this study there were 762 known recruiting agencies in Bangladesh, but an unknown number of agents, sub-agents, and middlemen were also engaged in recruiting prospective domestic workers throughout the country. There is no specific record of agencies that recruit for a particular host country. Thus, there is no mechanism to efficiently monitor agents, sub-agents, and middlemen. 62 Siddiqui, T., \u201cTranscending Boundaries: Labour Migration of Women from Bangladesh\u201d (Dhaka: The University Press Limited, 2001) COUNTRY RePORTS Countries of Origin 71 There is no minimum standard wage for Bangladeshi domestic workers either in Bahrain or in Dubai. Domestic workers in Bahrain are paid less than $100 a month, and earn approximately $100 in Dubai. In Lebanon the domestic workers are usually paid $125, as stipulated in their work contract. Only 9 percent of those interviewed in Bangladesh attended the official pre-departure briefing. The BMeT runs only one pre- departure briefing center for the country; however, recruiting agencies also manage a few accredited private pre-departure briefing centers. The weak monitoring mechanism, the inability to reprimand defaulting recruiting agents, and loopholes in existing laws all contribute to continued violations of the compulsory pre-departure briefing policy. The Pre-departure Briefing Module includes the rules and regulations that migrant workers are supposed to abide by in their host countries. Domestic workers are taught how to perform their household tasks. Relevant health information is not adequately provided, and women receive only limited orientation on STIs and HIV. 96 percent of Bangladeshi domestic workers interviewed onsite did not receive training on HIV before they left the country. Half had heard of HIV from the media or from co- workers, but none had in-depth knowledge on HIV prevention and safer sex practices. Abroad, women face numerous hardships, including irregular payment of salaries, long working hours, and physical and sexual abuse. even for some of the more common illnesses, they seldom have the time, knowledge, or resources to visit a physician, and thus tend to treat themselves for such maladies as back pains, colds, headache, fever, gastric pain, and menstrual cramps. Pregnancy is a major concern as it is considered a crime for unmarried women in the UAe and Bahrain. Since abortion is officially prohibited in many countries in the Arab States, unmarried domestic workers are sent to a detention camp, or even jail, if they are discovered to be pregnant. In order to avoid such a situation, some take the risk of undergoing unsafe, clandestine abortions. Bangladeshi research participants reported that some migrant women become involved in sexual relationships while abroad. While many relationships are consensual, there are instances where partners, both nationals and other migrant workers, take advantage of the women. Reports indicated that some domestic workers become victims of sexual exploitation by abusive partners and/or by employers and their relatives. Incidents of rape and group rape, either by local nationals or male migrant workers from other nationalities, were reported in the host countries. Usually, the domestic workers do not disclose incidents of sexual exploitation for fear of losing their jobs and to avoid stigma and discrimination. Currently, there is no mechanism in place to address sexual abuse and exploitation of domestic workers. Since domestic work is not covered by labour laws in the host countries, domestic workers have scant protection when their rights are violated. In the face of abusive situations, domestic workers sometimes resort to running away, which increases their vulnerability to other forms of exploitation, including forced sex work. In addition, many live-in domestic workers are kept under strict control. Usually, they are not allowed any days off, and they are forbidden contact with other men. Despite this restriction, some women still find the opportunity to get involved with a male migrant worker with whom they might come in contact, such as a driver, electrician, plumber, etc. Occasionally, they may have sexual relationships with their broker, or even enter into a fake marriage in order to maintain a relationship. Home-based and hotel-based sex workers, as well as women working in bars and nightclubs, who become involved in sexual relations reported low condom use and a general lack of knowledge regarding HIV and safer sex practices. However, the research also found that hotel-based sex workers", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7599bcc7-532b-4757-b496-4d4b0f2b3131": {"__data__": {"id_": "7599bcc7-532b-4757-b496-4d4b0f2b3131", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV Vulnerabilities of Migrant Women: from Asia to the Arab States", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "79f716548fdbadd9a70ab65a9ced1e5ab44a73b40fc630a341fedfa8ad6ecd44"}, "3": {"node_id": "684b93b4-fda4-48ca-9775-03ae815749d7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2d49cdc811865a12ac384c1a72065efc98f3c6e39cec1757c889382162185b0a"}}, "hash": "36dcb6d2b31f1887944a8aa4cd32885da6895819c1d98828a09bf051d85073db", "text": "in Dubai consistently use condoms with their clients.

All the research participants in the three host countries said that they had no knowledge about support services provided either by the Bangladesh embassy or other agencies. Very few domestic workers approach the embassy for support, even if they need it. 1.5 Recommendations Women migrant workers must be provided access to accurate and relevant information on migration and HIV prevention during pre-departure and post-arrival stages. Treatment and care services must be made available for deported migrant workers living with HIV. In addition, legal support and social and economic reintegration programmes should be established. Collaboration among NGOs, self-help groups, and PLHIV networks within the country is necessary and should be established. Support linkages and referral systems between origin and host countries also need to be established. Policy advocacy at the national and international level needs to be strengthened to mainstream HIV issues among migrant workers. Comprehensive policies that protect women migrants need to be developed, including providing safeguards and protection during the recruitment process. Bilateral agreements and/or MOUs for the protection of migrant domestic workers have to be developed with all host countries. COUNTRY RePORTS Countries of Origin 73 PAKISTAN PAKISTAN 2. Pakistan 2.1 Introduction: Migration and HIV Since the oil boom of the 1970s, millions of Pakistani men have migrated to the Gulf States in search of better employment opportunities. Similar to most labour-sending countries, the migration patterns are characterized by a two-step process: first, rural-to-urban (internal), and, second, urban-to-overseas (external). Data from the Bureau of emigration and Overseas employment (BeOe) shows that the majority of Pakistani migrants working in the Gulf countries are between the ages of 20 and 30 years. Most of them are unskilled and uninformed about health issues, including HIV. What is not similar to most labour-sending countries, however, is the ratio of men and women workers traveling abroad. While there is little data on the migration flows of Pakistani women to the Arab States, according to the BeOe, of the more than 700,000 Pakistanis who migrated overseas during the last five years, only 1,200 were women. The global stock of migrant Pakistani workers was estimated to be around four million in 2001. During the period 2005-2007, the Government of Pakistan, through the Overseas employment Promoters (OeP), has sent some 615,403 persons abroad. These included doctors, engineers, nurses, teachers, accountants, managers, agriculturists, and skilled technical workers such as welders, masons, and the like. In 2007, 280,279 Pakistani migrant workers were registered by the BeOe, with almost half going to the UAe. Today, some migrant workers do not go abroad through such conventional channels as government offices, overseas employment agencies, or other agents. Rather, the current trend is to use the social networks that the migrants themselves have facilitated during their travel overseas, thus relying on the assistance of friends, relatives, fellow tribesmen, etc. The majority travel on visitor visas and end up staying irregularly in the host countries until they are discovered and deported. Pakistan benefits from the foreign exchange earnings brought by its overseas workers. At its peak in the mid-1980s, remittances from overseas workers constituted half of the country\u2019s foreign exchange earnings. In fiscal year 2006-2007, foreign remittances reached around $8 billion. According to Pakistan\u2019s National AIDS Control Programme (NACP), there are approximately 4,000 registered HIV/AIDS cases in Pakistan. UNAIDS and WHO estimate the figure at around 70,000-80,000, with cases among women at 15,000. Data analysis indicates that most infections occur among Pakistanis between the ages of 20 and 44 years, with men outnumbering females by a ratio of 5:1.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "684b93b4-fda4-48ca-9775-03ae815749d7": {"__data__": {"id_": "684b93b4-fda4-48ca-9775-03ae815749d7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV Vulnerabilities of Migrant Women: from Asia to the Arab States", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "79f716548fdbadd9a70ab65a9ced1e5ab44a73b40fc630a341fedfa8ad6ecd44"}, "2": {"node_id": "7599bcc7-532b-4757-b496-4d4b0f2b3131", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "36dcb6d2b31f1887944a8aa4cd32885da6895819c1d98828a09bf051d85073db"}}, "hash": "2d49cdc811865a12ac384c1a72065efc98f3c6e39cec1757c889382162185b0a", "text": "UNAIDS estimates that 0.1 percent of the population is infected with HIV, although the number of cases reported by the NACP suggests less.

During that same period, the wives of five returning workers also tested positive for HIV. 2.2 Research Methodology The research team undertook a desk review of existing data and information on migration and HIV/AIDS in Pakistan, which proved to be challenging as the data on these issues was scanty and difficult to obtain. The team also faced other challenges in the preparatory phase of the research, such as the difficulty in getting the support and interest of concerned government ministries and departments. In addition, the research commenced at a time when the political situation in Pakistan was particularly unstable, thus hampering the collection process. Returned migrant workers formerly working in Bahrain and Dubai are spread throughout Pakistan. Through various sources, the research team identified clusters of these populations where the majority of the household heads (men) had been previously employed by construction companies in Bahrain and Dubai. COUNTRY RePORTS Countries of Origin 74 Through these contacts, it was possible for the research team to identify the target community and to collect data, especially with PLHIV. In order to accomplish the latter, AMAL (literally \u201caction\u201d in Urdu, and one of the country\u2019s most visible advocates for HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and awareness) held several meetings with NGOs working on HIV/AIDS issues, and with families, friends, and relatives of PLHIV. The team initially had a difficult time in getting the migrants to share their experiences about working and being abroad. even people who were not HIV-positive and had been working in Arab countries refused to meet the research team because of the stigma surrounding the issue of HIV/AIDS. Despite these difficulties, the research team was able to conduct five focus group discussions (FGDs) in the country, including one with PLHIV, for a total of 46 participants. Participants included both professionals, such as bank workers, factory managers, etc., and labourers or those considered \u201cunskilled,\u201d such as construction workers, factory workers, etc. Two FGDs in Bahrain involving 16 participants and two in Dubai with 17 participants were also carried out. In addition, the research team conducted in-depth interviews with eight participants each in Bahrain and Dubai. Two case studies of returned migrant workers living with HIV were also completed. Finally, AMAL conducted key informant interviews with 12 respondents from various government ministries and departments, UN agencies, recruitment agencies, testing centers, NGOs, and PLHIV. 2.3 Policies and Laws In Pakistan, the legal framework that safeguards the rights of overseas workers and regulates the activities of overseas COUNTRY RePORTS Countries of Origin 75 employment promoters and recruiting agents is contained in the emigration Ordinance (1997) and the emigration Rules (1997). Overseas employment is regulated under Section 8 of the emigration Ordinance, which grants vast powers to the Director General of the BeOe, the Protector of emigrants, and the Community Welfare Attach\u00e9/Labour Attach\u00e9, who, among them, deal with all matters pertaining to overseas employment of Pakistani workers. The emigration Ordinance regulates the activities of overseas employment promoters and agencies by establishing procedures for licensing and recruitment, and provides for the protection of workers against malpractices and for the redress of workers\u2019 grievances. The BeOe is the central organization for regulating labour emigration from Pakistan and administratively comes under the Ministry of Labour, Manpower, and Overseas Pakistanis. Its mandate has two main goals: to reduce unemployment within the country, and to earn foreign exchange through salary remittances from workers abroad. The BeOe, with seven regional offices, functions through the Protector of emigrants. The Protector of emigrants directly supervises the activities of overseas employment promoters; processes their requests for workers; inspects their offices; and receives such reports as may be required by the Director General. The Community Welfare Attach\u00e9 (CWA), the equivalent of the Labour Attach\u00e9 in other countries, is responsible for the promotion of overseas employment of Pakistani workers and for their welfare while abroad. At present, Pakistan has CWAs stationed in Bahrain, Kuwait, Libya, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAe, and the United Kingdom.

Pakistan currently has no law regarding HIV/AIDS, but in the National HIV/AIDS Strategic Framework migrant workers were considered a vulnerable group with regard to HIV transmission within the country. This attention was brought about by the cases of mostly male Pakistani migrant workers deported from the Gulf States after being found HIV-positive. Without proper counseling, these returning migrants could pose a significant risk to their spouses and partners. 2.4 Research Findings The research found that the pre-departure orientation provided to migrant workers is inadequate, especially on topics related to policies, laws, rights, working conditions, health hazards, and other vulnerabilities in the host countries. In Bahrain, almost all respondents interviewed stated that they received no orientation session before their departure. In Dubai, all the migrant workers interviewed said that they were unaware of the country\u2019s laws, rules, and culture. With most Pakistani migrants lacking formal education and coming from remote areas, they face a significant risk of exploitation by the recruitment agencies or independent agents both while in Pakistan and in their host country. 83 percent of respondents did not go through pre-departure orientation from any concerned government department, and 16 percent received no information from the official government department on policies, rights, working conditions, issues related to health, and other vulnerabilities. However, prior to departure most migrants received informal information from their friends, relatives, and/or colleagues. In terms of HIV/AIDS, 88 percent of respondents did not receive any information prior to traveling to host countries, but all the professional migrants interviewed had some previous knowledge about HIV/AIDS. 63 percent of respondents said that they traveled to host countries through hiring agents. The rest traveled either through a relative-sponsored or friend-sponsored visa. Those who traveled through agents were charged a large sum of money. In Pakistan, PAKISTAN PAKISTAN COUNTRY RePORTS Countries of Origin 76 a company-sponsored visa to Saudi Arabia could cost as much as $2,900, whereas an open visa (or Azad visa) would cost around $1,450. Pre-departure registration of migrant workers at the private and government levels remains weak. There is a lack of coordination between various departments and stakeholders to facilitate regular migration and to address irregular migration from Pakistan. Policy-makers and programme implementers have yet to systematically address the issues and concerns that migrant workers face, particularly at the pre-departure and post-arrival phases. All registered migrant workers, especially those going to the Arab States, undergo mandatory HIV testing. However, pre- and post- counseling are not often provided by the HIV testing centers in Pakistan. In the host countries, Pakistani migrants - especially low-skilled and \u201cunskilled\u201d labourers and those irregularly documented - often experienced sub-substandard or hazardous living and working conditions. 60 percent were subjected to long working hours, had no fixed salary, and were often deprived of rest, days off, and recreation. In addition, they had limited access to health facilities, orientations, and check-ups, which further aggravated their health risks and vulnerabilities. eight of the respondents were diagnosed with HIV by the medical officials in host countries. They were arrested by the police, ill-treated, and forcefully deported to Pakistan, being neither informed about their HIV-positive status nor able to collect the wages their employers owed them. 70 percent of respondents were living in their employers\u2019 camp sites during the entire duration of their stay in the host countries. 30 percent were living outside the camp, which meant sharing accommodations with at least eight to ten persons in a room. The savings realized from sharing the rent enabled them to communicate with their families about once a week, as well as to spend money on visiting sex workers. A majority of Pakistani migrant workers reported that they engaged in sexual relations with female sex workers during their stay in the host countries. 86 percent of the respondents who fell in the \u201cunskilled\u201d category had little or no knowledge about safer sex practices, including condom use, whereas the majority of professional migrants responded that they did. Most of the Pakistani migrant workers who were interviewed onsite in Bahrain, Dubai, or upon their return to Pakistan, were not in contact with the Pakistani embassy while in their host countries. The embassies do not handle any cases related to sexual abuse, rights violations, and health issues such as HIV/AIDS because the government has no organized policy to provide help to migrant workers. even in HIV-related deportation cases, the embassy is not informed by any local official because there is no policy to exchange information regarding the situations and conditions of migrant workers, particularly in relation", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d926832c-17a9-41ab-8b9a-6745f4f3af61": {"__data__": {"id_": "d926832c-17a9-41ab-8b9a-6745f4f3af61", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV Vulnerabilities of Migrant Women: from Asia to the Arab States", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9dea8443e42cd1e2348ccc03b565015c4ac5204133a3d3a81a1d88287e8b2027"}, "3": {"node_id": "9f95399f-af9e-4bb2-94f2-66f53d4961ef", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "83671349454712d28c6150ecf49d87ac8abdd04d5f85785bd71e7850434ca3eb"}}, "hash": "287a1061301c663515ed23b50ca80ffb454efdbf4dc5cba1041c34b6e8b7607d", "text": "to their HIV status. 2.5 Recommendations Advocacy efforts from civil society, such as AIDS service providers and women\u2019s rights groups, are needed to ensure gender-based migration policies that are sensitive to HIV/AIDS issues. Pre- departure briefings by emigration sub-offices need to provide basic information to migrant workers on migrants\u2019 rights and HIV vulnerabilities. Bilateral agreements between Pakistan and host countries should be signed to deter exploitation and abuse of Pakistani migrant workers during their stay in host countries. The Pakistan Bureau of emigration should improve its capacity for the registration of migrant workers. Coordination among major stakeholders, including agents, promoters, and government bodies, needs to be strengthened for purposes of accountability and transparency in the pre-departure and post-arrival phases of migration. The Pakistani embassies in Bahrain and the UAe need to establish and maintain assistance units for Pakistani migrants. They should be centrally located, easily accessible, and open after migrant work hours. In collaboration with host country governments, they also need to support and facilitate the creation of workers\u2019 unions to protect migrants\u2019 rights. COUNTRY RePORTS Countries of Origin 77 Cooperation mechanisms need to be put in place among government ministries/departments, UN agencies, NGOs, community-based organizations, and the National Commission on the Status of Women to promote workers\u2019 and women\u2019s rights, and to address the vulnerability of migrants to HIV. In-depth qualitative data on the nexus of gender, migration, and HIV/STIs should be gathered and studied; and awareness programs to reduce the vulnerabilities faced by the spouses of returning migrant workers should be developed. Referral and support systems as well as reintegration programmes should be put in place for HIV-positive migrants. PAKISTAN PAKISTAN COUNTRY RePORTS Countries of Origin 78 3. The Philippines 3.1 Introduction: Migration and HIV The Commission on Filipinos Overseas (CFO), a government agency mandated to uphold and promote the interests and well-being of overseas Filipinos, estimates that the number of Filipinos outside the country reached 8,233,172 in December 2006. Of this figure, 3,556,035 (43 percent) were immigrants or legal permanent residents abroad; 3,802,345 (46 percent) were contract workers (who are also referred to as Overseas Filipino Workers, or OFWs); and 874,792 (11 percent) were irregularly documented migrants 63. Since 2000, women have comprised 90 percent of the yearly deployment of new hires for service workers from the Philippines, of which 30 percent are household workers. In 2006, 184,454 women migrated in search of work, and about half of these found employment in the domestic sector. Such figures do not represent the total stock of female OFWs, as these exclude rehires, those with ongoing work contracts, and those who are undocumented. That same year, the top ten host countries for domestic workers were: 1) Hong Kong, 2) Kuwait, 3) Saudi Arabia, 4) United Arab emirates, 5) Lebanon, 6) Qatar, 7) Jordan, 8) Singapore, 9) Oman, and 10) Cyprus. In 2007 the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (Central Bank of the Philippines) reported that OFWs remitted a total $14.4 billion. These contributions make up about 13 percent of the country\u2019s total gross domestic product (GDP). Remittances from land-based workers comprised 85 percent, or $12.2 billion 64. Classified as an HIV \u201clow-prevalence\u201d country, as of July 2008 the Philippines had a cumulative total of 3,358 cases of HIV infections dating back to 1984. A total of 796 (24 percent) are AIDS cases, and of these 310 (39 percent) have died. Since the start of the decade, the National HIV Registry of the Department of Health has been recording and reporting the continued incidence of HIV cases among OFWs. Of the total number of cases, OFWs make up 34 percent (1,142). Such figures have to be looked at as a function of mandatory HIV testing for overseas employment, which is required by most host countries. As of December 2007, women domestic workers comprised 17 percent of HIV cases among OFWs. 3.2 Research Methodology The ACHIeVe research team undertook preliminary data gathering through a desk review of existing literature covering the topics related to migration, gender, and HIV and AIDS.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f95399f-af9e-4bb2-94f2-66f53d4961ef": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f95399f-af9e-4bb2-94f2-66f53d4961ef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV Vulnerabilities of Migrant Women: from Asia to the Arab States", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9dea8443e42cd1e2348ccc03b565015c4ac5204133a3d3a81a1d88287e8b2027"}, "2": {"node_id": "d926832c-17a9-41ab-8b9a-6745f4f3af61", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "287a1061301c663515ed23b50ca80ffb454efdbf4dc5cba1041c34b6e8b7607d"}}, "hash": "83671349454712d28c6150ecf49d87ac8abdd04d5f85785bd71e7850434ca3eb", "text": "Meetings were held with the executive Director of the Office of the Undersecretary for Migrant Workers Affairs (OUMWA) of the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), and with the specific focal persons/officers handling the three countries identified as the research sites, to discuss the research design.

COUNTRY RePORTS Countries of Origin 79 3.3 Policies and Laws There are two main laws that are relevant to migrant workers and HIV and AIDS issues. The first is Republic Act (RA) 8042, or the Migrant Worker and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995, a law envisaged to protect and promote the rights and welfare of OFWs. The law makes explicit its aim to \u201cuphold the dignity of Filipino migrant workers\u201d and \u201cafford full protection to labour, local and overseas, organized and unorganized, and promote full employment and equality of employment opportunities for all and provide adequate and timely social, economic, and legal services to Filipino migrant workers.\u201d It aims to provide safeguards against illegal recruitment, respond to labour rights violation of OFWs onsite, and provide for reintegration services. Lastly, it also makes the pre-departure orientation seminar (PDOS) mandatory. The second piece of relevant legislation is Republic Act 8504, or the Philippine HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Act of 1998, a law that provides the policy backdrop for the country\u2019s national HIV and AIDS response, as well as protection for people living with and affected by HIV. A provision that applies specifically to OFWs is Article 1, Section 7, which reads: \u201cAll Overseas Filipino Workers, diplomatic, military, trade, and labour officials and personnel to be assigned overseas shall undergo or attend a seminar on the cause, prevention, and consequences of HIV/ AIDS before certification for overseas assignment.\u201d Because of this, all departing OFWs, as well as Foreign Service personnel, are required to undergo HIV orientation during the mandatory PDOS. Another important provision of this legislation is the prohibition of compulsory testing for HIV. PHILIPPINES PHILIPPINES COUNTRY RePORTS Countries of Origin 80 In 2007, the Philippine Overseas employment Agency (POeA) Governing Board took steps to try to reduce the abuses and maltreatment experienced by female domestic workers abroad through the issuance of a reform package for domestic workers. This package consists of: a minimum age requirement of 25; an entry-level minimum wage of $400 per month; prohibition on the collection of placement fees; pre-qualification of recruitment agencies under the POLO; the securing of a pre-qualification certificate from employers; and mandatory verification by POLO of individual contracts and subsequent job offers. It remains to be seen, however, if such steps are adequate to alleviate the vulnerability of domestic workers, rather than fuel the proliferation of illegal recruitment agencies that have become increasingly resourceful in subverting government restrictions and regulations on labour migration. In August 2007, the Philippine Government entered into a Memorandum of Agreement with the Government of the UAe, setting standards for the recruitment and placement of Filipino manpower in that country.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6cafcc5d-39c5-42fe-9710-f03ada6c1f52": {"__data__": {"id_": "6cafcc5d-39c5-42fe-9710-f03ada6c1f52", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV Vulnerabilities of Migrant Women: from Asia to the Arab States", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8e3a7ac65737ed727c1f0b453d6d06477b3a3e151375bb63282939f638635feb"}, "2": {"node_id": "1590d979-289f-4ec8-96c1-d098a602e05f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0aa633c1a7c06bccc2fd595d7534c7c6d5475913269fe2a45c0feab874d6c233"}}, "hash": "b57941c18bb95eaad297602a68bec3cf6b9225d99ccf5e911b0c623af6b14e90", "text": "According to this agreement, the worker \u201cshall perform work for the employer and shall be recruited through selection according to the needs of the UAe, and shall be given protection pursuant to the labour laws and regulations in force in both countries.\u201d The Philippines has signed on to key international instruments and agreements, such as the 1990 International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASeAN) Declaration for the Protection of the Rights of Migrant Workers, and the ASeAN Declaration of Commitment on HIV/ AIDS. 3.4 Research Findings Like many Filipinos who decide to work overseas, the participants in this research opted to work abroad mainly to alleviate their families\u2019 financial condition.

Upon arrival at the host country, 60 percent of them were made to sign a different contract. 22 percent said that their new contracts were written in Arabic, which they could not understand. While all OFWs are required to undertake the PDOS, only 71 percent of the participants in this research attended. Of these, 54 percent remembered that it included an HIV orientation. Under the law, the PDOS should include information on a variety of migration realities, as well as on HIV and AIDS. However, the module on HIV and AIDS is not uniformly or even regularly implemented. Because the PDOS is viewed as just another requirement, many of the participants seem to have ignored much of it and, thus, their lack of clear recollection on the topics discussed. Various stakeholders have deemed the PDOS as inadequate in preparing domestic workers for the actual situations they encounter abroad. Further, those who are irregularly documented or who migrate through sponsorship visas, as in the case of those in Dubai, do not go through the PDOS at all. Of the participants who were interviewed onsite, only 62 percent underwent a medical examination before departure. However, those who traveled on a sponsorship visa, such as the waitresses interviewed in Dubai, needed to undergo the required medical examination when applying for a work permit onsite. The fact that 82 percent of those screened were unsure as to whether or not they were tested for HIV demonstrates that HIV testing is being conducted without pre-test and post-test counseling. Most medical testing facilities in the host countries are not cognizant of the pre- and post-test requirement of HIV testing or they view this as an added \u201cburden\u201d in the medical testing process. This issue of the PDOS and HIV screening reflects a larger flaw in the system, that is, the inability of the government to regularly monitor the implementation of the relevant provisions of RA 8042 and RA 8504. At the individual level, the level of knowledge on HIV and AIDS - its modes of transmission and how it can be prevented - can lead to unsafe sexual practices that put migrant workers in danger COUNTRY RePORTS Countries of Origin 81 of infection. 84 percent of the women interviewed onsite were aware that HIV is sexually transmitted and that using condoms can prevent it. However, 14 percent of the participants also had misconceptions - for example, that HIV can be transmitted through kissing or mosquito bites. 20 percent of the participants interviewed onsite admitted engaging in sexual activities but only one said she sometimes used condoms with her boyfriend. According to the comments of the research participants, the relatively high cost of migration and the need to provide for the needs of their families at home have pushed women migrant workers to engage in economically-beneficial relationships while working abroad, within which their right to safer sex may have been difficult to assert. For example, six domestic workers interviewed in Lebanon stated that they did not use condoms in their sexual relationships, citing that one of the reasons was that their male partners did not want to use them. Other reasons included not liking the feel of the condom and that they used other forms of birth control. even if they were aware of the consequences of unprotected sex, they were hard-pressed to assert protection with their partners in the context of such relationships. In many cases, the participants did not take proactive steps to protect themselves; but the worst consequence of their economic vulnerability is the fact that some actually opted to endure sexual exploitation in exchange for money. This situation is aggravated by the fact that salaries for domestic workers in most Arab State countries are not high (as compared to Hong Kong, for example) and are often subject to delays. The monthly income of a domestic worker is approximately $125-150 in Bahrain, $187-375 in Dubai, and $200-400 in Lebanon. These salaries are not in compliance with the POeA reform package, and one reason for this is the practice of contract substitution, i.e. migrant workers are made to sign a different contract that stipulates lower wages once they reach the host country. 32 of the research participants interviewed onsite reported experiencing various health conditions, including common respiratory illnesses, poor nutrition, urinary tract infections, and skin rashes and blisters.

Accessing medical services was not easy for most domestic workers because it depended on whether their employers allowed it. A common thread running through the stories of domestic workers who were interviewed in the POLO shelters is the experience of verbal, physical, and sexual abuse and maltreatment. Almost all of them were overworked, going through the day without rest and adequate food. Many of them did not get their salaries on time or did not get their salaries at all. In some cases, the agencies onsite also inflicted violence on the domestic workers. eight women shared experiences of sexual abuse from their male employers, ranging from sexual harassment to rape. The women who worked as waitresses in hotels also experienced sexual harassment perpetrated by their boyfriends and/or strangers. The harshness of their working and living conditions force some domestic workers to flee from their employers and, in the process, they may become even more vulnerable to sexual abuse. The Philippine embassy/Consulate and the POLO in all three research sites have been overwhelmed with various cases of women OFWs who have escaped from their employers and have filed complaints or cases of maltreatment. At the time of the research, there were 80 women in the shelter in Bahrain and 54 in Dubai. Understandably, the embassies and consulates are unable to attend to and provide adequate support to all cases, given their limited personnel and resources. In addition, they are unaware of HIV cases among OFWs, including those who are detained and deported, because the host countries do not inform them of such cases. Filipino research participants reported that migrant women do engage in consensual relationships with men while abroad. Respondents reported that a common perk of these relationships is that male partners provide phone credits so that women can call families at home. While 58 percent of domestic workers in this study reported that not having any days off made it difficult for them to engage in relationships, they also shared that it was still possible to engage in sexual relations, notably with PHILIPPINES PHILIPPINES COUNTRY RePORTS Countries of Origin 82 men who do odd jobs for their employers, such as electricians, drivers, and gardeners. Of those women who do engage in sexual relationships onsite, few engage in safe sex practices. Although there is very limited data that points to the actual prevalence of HIV infection among Filipino domestic workers from Bahrain, Lebanon, and the UAe, the findings of this study show that the vulnerability of these workers to HIV infection is real. It must also be noted that compared to other countries in the Arab States, there are more known cases of OFWs deported from Dubai due to HIV. While the majority of these cases have been men, there have also been women who have been forced to return after being diagnosed HIV positive. 3.5 Recommendations The government, particularly the POeA, needs to exert more vigilance in regulating private recruitment agencies to ensure that domestic workers are properly recruited, documented, and protected once deployed. As a corollary to this, there should be stiffer penalties for recruitment agencies that fail to diligently follow procedures set forth in the recruitment guidelines of the POeA. The Department of Health needs to develop and enforce implementing guidelines for the proper conduct of HIV screening among OFWs, one that includes signed consent as well as pre- test and post-test counseling. The government, through the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Labour and employment, should step up efforts in initiating and engaging in bilateral agreements with host countries in the Arab States for the protection of migrant workers, particularly women domestic workers. efforts should also be undertaken by various stakeholders to engage international organizations, such as the International Labour Organization, for a global campaign that would result in the recognition of domestic work as professional work. This should be accompanied by the development of appropriate labour standards. Regional and international bodies, such as ASeAN and the UN, as well as government in origin and host countries, should begin discussions on HIV testing among migrant workers with the goal of removing mandatory testing and making it voluntary in the future. Another proactive measure to monitor the human rights of migrant workers is the maintenance of an updated database of recruitment agencies, brokers, agents, and employers by the POeA and OWWA, especially those that engage in acts that violate the human rights of migrant workers. HIV-prevention education should be intensified.

Community-based education also needs to be undertaken, especially for women migrants coming from rural areas. The Philippines posts abroad should reinforce HIV awareness by sponsoring regular outreach HIV-prevention activities for OFWs. These can be integrated into ongoing outreach activities undertaken by the embassy or consulate or by Filipino organizations abroad. The Philippines should also pursue negotiations with the Immigration Department or the Ministry of Health of host countries to ensure that the current practice of HIV-related deportation is coursed through the embassy or consulate. In this way, the posts can assist OFWs in the repatriation process and can refer them to appropriate agencies and NGOs in the Philippines for counseling and support. COUNTRY RePORTS Countries of Origin 83 4. Sri Lanka 4.1 Introduction: Migration and HIV Sri Lanka has an active policy of promoting the emigration of its female citizens for work to several destinations around the world, including the Arab States and affluent Southeast Asian nations, such as Singapore and Malaysia. Over the past three decades the number of Sri Lankan migrant workers has increased steadily, as has the proportion of women in the emigrant group. Today, an estimated more than one million female Sri Lanka citizens earn their livelihood abroad in the Arab States. In 2007, the number of Sri Lankan who emigrated stood at 21,500, the majority of whom were female (58 percent). Furthermore, 70 percent of the female emigrants in that year left to work as domestic workers. Within the last ten years, women leaving to work as housemaids comprised half to two-thirds of all work- related migration out of Sri Lanka. The rise in emigration - especially of females - is the result of several factors. In addition to the economic incentive of a higher wage in the receiving country (which can range from two to more than ten-times the local salaries) and the corresponding anticipation of an increase in standard of living, the social and political uncertainties precipitated by the nation\u2019s ongoing civil war provide a strong push for migration. An increasing number of migrant workers in the Arab States are being detected with HIV infections. The costs of detection are substantial: deportation leads to a loss in income, and the return to Sri Lanka is fraught with anxiety regarding social ostracism and discrimination. Migrant workers, especially female, are vulnerable to systematic abuse throughout the migration process. Such abuse can be economic (including extortion and non-payment of wages), sexual (including harassment and rape), or mental (including harsh working conditions and the trauma of dislocation). All these factors point to the need to strengthen the evidence linking high- risk behavior among migrant workers to structural deficiencies in the migration process. It is envisaged that generating data on the HIV vulnerability of migrant workers, with specific focus on women and on responses in both origin and host countries, will provide insights for the development of new, and/or the scaling- up of existing, HIV programmatic responses. Sri Lanka has historically been categorized as a low HIV/AIDS prevalence nation. Since the first AIDS case was reported over 20 years ago, a plethora of factors - including high literacy rates, high socio-economic status of women, widespread access to health care services, and comprehensive HIV education programmes - have contributed to keeping HIV incidence at manageably low levels. Cumulative HIV cases at the end of 2006 were reported to be at 838, increasing, by the end of 2007, to 957. However, after taking into account the fear and stigma associated with HIV and the consequent non-testing and non-detection, UNAIDS estimates that approximately 3,500 people are living with the virus in Sri Lanka. It is worth noting that more than 96 percent of HIV infections in Sri Lanka are acquired through unprotected sex, and those who work abroad are considered to fall into a high-risk group. 4.2 Research Methodology Research for this report was commissioned by the UNDP Regional Center, Colombo, Sri Lanka, between June 2007 and March 2008. During this period, 145 Sri Lankan migrant women were interviewed, both on a one-to-one basis and within focus group discussions. Of these women, 100 had returned to Sri Lanka from the Arab States within the past three years, having worked in Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAe. All of the women - 15 of whom were HIV-positive - came from five districts with high rates of female migrant workers: Colombo,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "75f3f7f7-b37f-4874-931d-02fdad3b3572": {"__data__": {"id_": "75f3f7f7-b37f-4874-931d-02fdad3b3572", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV Vulnerabilities of Migrant Women: from Asia to the Arab States", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8910239601b5288b5c948c2978aab4296fa5ae0c7f50353f0aa3986931a6852f"}}, "hash": "8910239601b5288b5c948c2978aab4296fa5ae0c7f50353f0aa3986931a6852f", "text": "Kurunegala, Kandy, Polonnaruwa, and Batticaloa. In terms of the host countries, 15 workers were interviewed in each of Bahrain, Dubai, and Lebanon. The majority of the women were economically marginalized, were married with two or three children, and were educated at the fifth to sixth-grade level. In Sri Lanka, interviews were conducted with NGO representatives, trade union leaders, hiring agents and sub-agents, and government officials, including those from the Sri Lankan Bureau of Foreign employment (SLBFe) and the Ministry of Labour. In the Arab States, Sri Lankan embassy and consular officials, NGO representatives, social club representatives, and hiring agents participated in the study. The interview team was comprised of SRI LANKA SRI LANKA COUNTRY RePORTS Countries of Origin 84 three women and one man representing diverse backgrounds, including civil society, government, healthcare, and academia. In accordance with the preference expressed by the interviewers, the interviews were either taped or documented via note taking. 4.3 Policies and Laws Government policies play a substantial role in encouraging migration, primarily of women. The government\u2019s enthusiasm for sending female workers abroad stems from the economic benefits of such migration: currently migrant remittances amount to over $3 billion per year, making it one of the largest sources of foreign exchange. These remittances help support five million Sri Lankans - roughly a quarter of the total population. Migration also makes possible fiscal savings on the part of the government, since low-income families become ineligible to receive governmental welfare transfers once a member of the family migrates. Sri Lanka has publicly committed to stemming the proliferation of HIV infections and reversing the trend by 2015. In 1992, the National AIDS Council in conjunction with the National AIDS Committee started the national STD and AIDS Control Programme to collect and consolidate HIV-related data nationwide; and to design and implement, in partnership with provincial directors COUNTRY RePORTS Countries of Origin 85 of health services, STD clinics, and the National Blood Transfusion Service, effective strategic responses for prevention and control. In addition, several NGOs are making concerted attempts at improving public awareness of HIV-related issues in order to eliminate the social stigma attached to persons living with HIV and to curb discrimination against such persons. It is acknowledged in regulatory circles that a successful strategic response to HIV must take into consideration the high rates of HIV prevalence in migrant women (various reports assert that of all women living with HIV in Sri Lanka, 20 to 48 percent are returning migrants). To this end, in 2005 the SLBFe began offering HIV education as part of the pre-departure training that domestic migrant workers are required to attend. SLBFe operates 34 training centers around the country; in 2006 it established eight migrant desks to disseminate information to potential migrants, and to aid returning migrants to reintegrate into society both economically and psychologically. 4.4 Research Findings SLBFe currently conducts training programmes of 12-13 days to prepare female migrant workers departing for the Arab States. Such programmes typically consist of instruction on usage of household cleaning and cooking equipment, child and elderly care, banking and financial matters, multicultural communication, basic Arabic, and health and HIV issues. However, only approximately 70 percent of the 145 people sampled for this study attended the full duration of the programme. The remaining 30 percent attended a shorter version or did not attend at all. Approximately 90 percent of the women informed family members and their husbands of their decision prior to migrating, making arrangements for their children to be cared for by fathers, grandparents, or other relatives. The 10 percent who left without informing their kin migrated under duress, typically caused by domestic violence or crippling domestic responsibilities. Approximately 80 percent of the women made arrangements, through banks or private channels, for remittance of their foreign income to Sri Lanka. However, 40 percent complained about mismanagement of these monies by their beneficiaries in Sri Lanka. A large majority of the women were unaware of the legal cap on fees charged by hiring agents, fixed at $50-100. Some women reported paying as much as $345 for the \u201copportunity\u201d to work abroad. Such extortionary practices on the part of unscrupulous hiring agents were found to be pervasive. In most cases, the women needed to make long trips from remote villages to urban training centers and/or to the airport, often involving an overnight stay. During this phase, the women were routinely exposed to sexual harassment, rape, or blackmail. Several women complained of being robbed on return to Sri Lanka. In the Arab States, some women attempted to escape their employers\u2019 homes - a practice known as \u201cjumping\u201d - either", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f572fbcd-1eda-4db2-8d5a-dcfcc533ef56": {"__data__": {"id_": "f572fbcd-1eda-4db2-8d5a-dcfcc533ef56", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV Vulnerabilities of Migrant Women: from Asia to the Arab States", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1827ab5b33684ddceb4f9e274a21351b1bbc8ad5c1635bca81f1f540a2b2afa0"}}, "hash": "1827ab5b33684ddceb4f9e274a21351b1bbc8ad5c1635bca81f1f540a2b2afa0", "text": "after having become aware of a better employment prospect or to avoid being abused or exploited by their employer.

Ten of the interviewed women who were outside the stipulated 18-45 age group reported having used the passport of a friend or relative to migrate to Lebanon, known for its lax immigration policy. Furthermore, 19 women working in the Arab States had irregularities in their immigration status: nine of these women had expired visas, and ten lived outside their sponsor\u2019s home (a practice illegal in most Arab States).

SRI LANKA SRI LANKA COUNTRY RePORTS Countries of Origin 86 Blood and urine tests (for HIV and pregnancy, respectively) are mandatory for legally migrating women prior to their departure. The test results are provided directly to the agents, and many of the interviewed women admitted to being in the dark about the nature of these tests. Clinics performing the tests, administered at the request of the hiring agents, also were reported to administer contraceptives (either orally administered birth control pills or the injectable medroxyprogesterone) to potential migrants, who were not always aware what they were taking. Interviewed women reported abortions as being common amongst Sri Lankan migrant workers in Bahrain, Dubai, and Lebanon despite their being illegal in all three countries. The interviewed women displayed a low level of awareness concerning the transmission and prevention of HIV. Over 50 percent believed that HIV could be spread through mosquitoes; over 25 percent did not know that condoms could protect against HIV infection; and over 50 percent believed that an HIV-positive person could not look healthy. None of the 15 HIV- positive participants in the study had heard of the virus prior to contracting it, and nearly half were uncertain about how they could spread it. None of the women reported using condoms in their current practice, and most were unsure about the availability or legality of condoms in the host countries. The majority of the women disclosed that opportunities for leisure and access to recreational amenities and social support groups were minimal. Any migrant worker in Lebanon can seek assistance from the Afro-Asian Migrant Center or Caritas, both located in Beirut. In the Budaya Club in Bahrain, 30 percent of whose 300 members are domestic migrant workers, serves as a focal point for social and cultural interaction. In addition, the Migrant Workers Protection Society operates a safe-house and deals regularly with women, primarily Sri Lankan, who have \u201cjumped.\u201d A similar function is provided in Dubai by the Dubai Foundation. The interviewed women with work experience in Dubai and Lebanon revealed their lack of confidence in Sri Lankan embassy or consular support, citing overcharging of fees by officials and complacency towards the migrant workers\u2019 plight. In Bahrain - where Sri Lanka doesn\u2019t have a formal embassy or consulate - the 12,000 Sri Lankan migrant workers have to depend on a part- time Consul, who volunteers his services. Interviewees reported that some women migrants engage in sexual relationships with Arab nationals and other migrants for a variety of reasons, including a desire for companionship, for protection, or to share living expenses; invariably, there are also those who are coerced into such relationships. Consensual relationships come in a multitude of forms, ranging from short and long-term monogamous relationships to sex work. Non- consensual relationships were reported to include sexual harassment (10 percent), forced to work as sex surrogates for young Arab males in the employer\u2019s home (one percent), and rape (five percent). Informants and NGOs in host countries reveal that some Sri Lankan migrant women engage in transactional sex for survival. Whether coerced or voluntary, sex work further marginalizes these women and puts them at greater risk of HIV infection. 4.5 Recommendations The Ministry of Labour needs to negotiate reasonable salaries for its migrant workers with the Arab countries.

SLBFe should have clear guidelines concerning the medical tests that prospective migrants must undergo. It must make confidential pre- and post-test counseling mandatory and ensure that the women, and not the agencies, receive their test results. Administration of contraceptive medication must be made conditional upon consent. Pre-departure training programmes for domestic migrant workers need to be lengthened beyond the current period of 12- 13 days and made more comprehensive. Apart from increasing the scope of language training, HIV awareness, and condom usage campaigns, the trainings should inform prospective migrant workers about recruitment fees, airport procedures, and medical test procedures. It must also identify proper channels for workers to register their grievance against harassment and for seeking redress. Training programmes should be conducted 1-3 months prior to departure in order to increase their effectiveness, and should include accurate information \u2013 preferably provided first-hand \u2013 about the various vulnerabilities that women are likely to face during their time abroad. This will allow women to make a more informed decision to migrate. Grassroots (village)-level education on HIV/AIDS should take place, preferably through a cultural medium, so as to reduce the social stigma and superstitions associated with migrant workers living in those communities who have tested HIV-positive. SRI LANKA SRI LANKA COUNTRY RePORTS Countries of Origin 90 HOST COUNTRIES 5. Bahrain 5.1 Introduction: Migration and HIV Following the oil boom of the 1970s, Bahrain experienced rapid economic growth. As a consequence, the government embarked on massive redevelopment projects encompassing the construction, public health, and public education sectors. Of the large number of jobs that were created, those towards the relatively lower end of the skill spectrum were sought by immigrants from several Asian countries. Today, migrant workers fill Bahrain\u2019s labour gaps, primarily in the manufacturing, construction, entertainment, and domestic work sectors. As a whole, migrant workers comprise 38 percent of Bahrain\u2019s total population. Women migrant workers in Bahrain are characterized as either \u201cregular\u201d or \u201cunskilled\u201d: regular workers include professionals (engineers, bankers, nurses, etc.), and the bulk of unskilled workers consist of domestic help. Women migrants in Bahrain are primarily of Indian, Sri Lanka, Filipino, Bangladeshi, ethiopian, or Thai origin. The oil boom significantly increased family incomes and the number of working Bahraini women, thereby fueling the demand for domestic help. even though domestic workers do not come under the ambit of local labour laws in Bahrain, employers of domestic help need to obtain work permits for helpers - granted for a two-year period but renewable - to facilitate their entry into the country. Despite the Bahrain Government\u2019s efforts to equip locals with the skills to work in areas currently monopolized by migrant labourers, the trend towards an increase in the number of foreign domestic help is likely to continue owing to the reluctance of Bahrainis to hire other Bahrainis. Commonly cited reasons for this antipathy include anxiety about possible romantic relationships between a Bahraini worker and a family member, privacy concerns, and the threat of retaliation in the event of maltreatment of the Bahraini worker. According to the Bahrain Labour Market Regulatory Authority, between the fourth quarter of 2005 and the third quarter of 2007, 66,054 new work permits were granted, up from the 36,678 recorded in the corresponding period between 1999 and 2001. At the end of the third quarter of 2007, Bahrain was employing 49,503 legally documented migrant workers \u2013 of which 34,766 were women. In addition, between 2004 and 2006 approximately 48,000 migrant workers had irregular status, that is, were either holding expired work permits, had left their original employer without consent, or were working in places or occupations other than those listed in their work permits.

Prevalence was highest among injecting drug users (up 69 percent), and there was a marked increase in transmission through heterosexual activity (23 percent). Transmission through blood transfusions, homosexual contact, and mother-to-child were at four, three, and one percent, respectively. Demographically, the 15-35 age group is most susceptible to HIV infection as a consequence of high-risk behavior, which includes the use of injectable drugs and low condom usage (it is reported that only a quarter of the 90 percent of sexually active injecting drug users [IDUs] had used condoms). Amongst the migrant population, HIV cases have increased from 52 to 68 between 2002 and 2007. Testing positive for HIV leads to the deportation of a migrant worker - without any counseling - within three to seven days. 5.2 Research Methodology This study was undertaken in Bahrain with the assistance of the UNDP Country Office and the head of the Bahrain National AIDS Committee. Qualitative data was collected through meetings, interviews, and discussions with key stakeholders, including representatives of ministries, embassies, health centers, and relevant NGOs. In addition, a comprehensive literature review was undertaken to assess and analyze the vulnerabilities encountered by female migrants in Bahrain. In the case of interviews and discussions, a set of guiding open-ended questions was employed to initiate the dialogue. even though discussions were initially recorded, this practice was later abandoned in an attempt to put the discussants at ease. For the literature review, over 40 documents of various kinds and from various sources were analyzed. COUNTRY RePORTS Host Countries 91 5.3 Policies and Laws To regularize and monitor the labour market, the government established the Labour Market Regulatory Authority (LMRA) on 31 May 2006. Since July 2008, all work permits except for domestic workers have been issued by the LMRA; and beginning in January 2009, LMRA will issue work permits to domestic workers as well. The Ministry of Labour and Ministry of Interior will no longer be responsible for providing work permits. The new work permits are valid for a two-year period and renewable for subsequent periods. LMRA is maintaining a database of all expatriates in the Kingdom, and also monitoring the recruitment agencies, employment offices, and business practices of self-sponsored expatriates. The National AIDS Committee, established in 1986, is the highest government body in Bahrain addressing the issue of HIV/ AIDS. Four subcommittees assist it to design, coordinate, and implement policies with regard to awareness and counseling, research, treatment, and public health. However, even though HIV-related topics form an integral part of high school curriculums and a significant effort is expended on peer education activities, a section of the migrant community, including domestic and construction workers \u2013 vulnerable groups in terms of HIV transmission \u2013 continue to remain uninformed. Amongst another high-risk group, IDUs, there are no comprehensive behavioral change or condom promotion campaigns. There is optimism, however, that this might change under the National Strategic COUNTRY RePORTS Host Countries BAHRAIN BAHRAIN 92 Framework on HIV/AIDS \u2013 a blueprint intended to guide the national response to HIV between 2008 and 2010. To protect women migrants from abuse, the government distributes multilingual brochures to incoming migrants containing information on workers\u2019 rights and in-country resources. It also provides a 60-bed shelter offering medical, psychological, and legal care for female victims of abuse. Training programmes in abuse-sensitization are run for the police, whose referral is necessary for a migrant to obtain a place in the government shelter. On the NGO front, the Migrant Workers\u2019 Protection Society, established in 2002, handles cases of abuse and runs a shelter for up to 20 people. More generally, migrant issues \u2013 including the granting of permits for all categories of workers, regulation of recruitment agencies, and the monitoring of expatriate business practices \u2013 come under the purview of the recently established Labour Market Regulatory Authority. 5.4 Research Findings Officials in the embassies of the Philippines, Bangladesh, and India concurred that despite the efforts of the Bahrain Government, female migrant domestic workers suffer from multiple forms of abuse, including non/under-payment of wages, harsh working conditions, and physical and sexual abuse. embassies provide dispute resolution support between employees and employers, arrange documents for those in need, and facilitate the repatriation of those migrant workers who wish to return.

Additionally, contracts are in Arabic, which leave workers unaware of the terms that they are accepting. The embassy of the Philippines also reported employers holding on to the keys to the rooms of the domestic help, thus engendering conditions rife for abuse. The problem of unscrupulous taxi drivers exploiting runaway migrant workers by forcing them into sex work was also mentioned. The same source suggested that bringing domestic help within the ambit of local labour law might minimize the potential for such abuse and provide victims with access to mechanisms of redress. Senior Bahrain health officials, including the head of the National AIDS Committee and the head of the hospital responsible for the pre-employment medical examination of migrant workers, defended mandatory testing for HIV by citing that greater migrant knowledge of their HIV status will better enable migrants to seek appropriate treatment and care. Nevertheless, both agreed that without access to community-based support networks and post-detection counseling, mandatory testing might be counterproductive as it might provide incentives to evade testing and lead to discrimination against, and ostracism of, those who test positive. Within government circles it was believed that HIV-positive migrants should be deported, given the inadequate care and treatment infrastructure for the local population. However, even though treatment services will continue to be denied to migrants, the Head of the National AIDS Committee elaborated that migrant workers will benefit from a targeted information campaign \u2013 including training for correct and consistent condom use \u2013 under the new National HIV/AIDS Strategic Framework. However, he warned that bottlenecks would likely delay implementation of the activities planned under the new framework. Interviews with ministry officials confirmed that abuse of domestic migrant workers exists, and that some recruitment agencies contributed to the problem. These officials felt it would be difficult to cover domestic workers by the provisions of local labour laws as this would constitute interference by the government in the family life of Bahrainis. Officials were also adamant that systems are in place for potential and actual victims of abuse, saying that abused migrant workers should seek \u2013 and embassies should proactively encourage their members to do so \u2013 local police and public prosecutor support, and not merely check themselves into shelters. The spokesperson for the Migrant Workers Protection Society (MWPS) asserted that one of the biggest areas of concern in terms of the abuse of migrant domestic workers is the role of recruitment agencies. Women from remote areas in the sending country are lured with promises of lucrative jobs but are not COUNTRY RePORTS Host Countries 93 provided any details about the nature of employment. In some cases, women migrate without even knowing which country they are migrating to; and many of these women \u2013 some unable to speak the language of their employers \u2013 fail to communicate effectively and struggle to perform their jobs, creating conditions rife for abuse. It was stressed that recruitment agency practices should be scrutinized in order to create a more stringent regulatory framework in which they operate. It also came to light that in most cases when abused domestic help complained to female members in the employers\u2019 households, the complaints were disregarded. The spokesperson for the MWPS, in noting the lack of a Sri Lankan embassy in the country, mirrored the government\u2019s views on the need for the relevant embassies to be more proactive in protecting the rights of their migrant workers and ensuring redress for those who have been abused. The MWPS spokesperson mentioned not having encountered any migrants living with HIV but admitted that as HIV/AIDS is not a focus area for MWPS, its members and volunteers have not undergone any training in this area. Recruitment agencies insisted that the reports of actual abuse of female migrant workers and the threat of potential abuse were exaggerated. It was suggested that the agencies are instrumental in ensuring that women have access to substantially higher wages and a better standard of living as compared to that in their home countries. Officials representing the various agencies claimed to help the migrant workers by negotiating on their behalf in terms of wages, and by settling disputes that might arise between workers and employers. 5.5 Recommendations The scope of national labour laws need broadening to ensure that even domestic migrant workers have rights within their places of work.

A coordination team comprising officials from the sending and receiving governments, relevant embassies, and concerned NGOs should work to address the problems and issues that migrant workers face. embassies should organize orientation sessions for all new workers, taking care to include existing workers in the process. During such sessions, information about local culture, law, hotline numbers, and emergency services should be disseminated. Local women\u2019s organizations should work in tandem with concerned embassies to sensitize employers towards the needs of domestic migrant workers. In the same way, international agencies such as UNDP and IOM should organize similar programmes for policy-makers on a regular basis. The government should institute formal victim identification procedures, allow victims to refer themselves to the government shelter (the current practice is for police referral only), and allow victims of sex trafficking access to the facilities at the shelter. Migrant workers who test positive should be provided post- detection counseling and information on organizations and services available in their home countries. The help of concerned embassies should be recruited to link victims with their respective national AIDS control bodies. BAHRAIN BAHRAIN COUNTRY RePORTS Host Countries 94 6. Dubai, United Arab Emirates 6.1 Introduction: Migration and HIV The emirate of Dubai, given its high per capita income, open and growing economy, and small national population, has been a destination of choice for migrant workers from throughout South and east Asia. Of Dubai\u2019s total population of 1.4 million, a large majority, 1.12 million, are expatriates. A striking anomaly in demographic statistics in Dubai is the predominance of males. Nearly 75 percent (989,305) of Dubai\u2019s population is male, with trends projecting even more skewed gender representation by 2010 (1.5 million males to 420,430 females). In addition, there are substantial gender-based discrepancies in job profiles and working conditions: male migrants are more likely to occupy the relatively higher paying jobs, with greater skill requirements, while female migrants often work in traditionally female sectors, such as domestic service. The majority of professional workers (engineers, bankers, doctors, nurses, etc.), regular workers (those working in hotels and bars), and unskilled workers (those working as domestic help) come from a variety of countries, including Bangladesh, ethiopia, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. Official statistics on the number of migrant workers in Dubai are likely to be underestimated in light of the fact that the emirate has a large number of undocumented workers - those whose work permits have expired, those who have run away from their sponsor/employer\u2019s residence, and those who have vocations COUNTRY RePORTS Host Countries 95 other than what is listed on their work permit. One indicator of the magnitude of the problem is the 350,000 people who chose to leave the UAe - of which Dubai is part - during the recently granted amnesty to all undocumented workers in the country. Domestic workers currently constitute five percent of the UAe population. Such is the demand for domestic workers that between 1975 and 2005 the number of work permits issued for domestic workers grew from 1,340 to 218,000. In Dubai alone, 83,600 new visas for domestic workers were granted in 2007, bringing the total spending on domestic help to close to $3 billion. The majority of domestic workers in the UAe are from Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Some 80 percent of all Sri Lankan female migrants choose the UAe for overseas work, while the corresponding figure for the Philippines stands at 40 percent. Furthermore, despite a ban on female migration to the emirates both in Bangladesh and Pakistan, Bangladeshi and Pakistani female domestic workers continue to travel to the emirates to work. UNAIDS characterizes the UAe as a low-prevalence country for HIV. By the end of 2006, the country had a total of 466 recorded cases of persons testing positive for HIV, all of whom were UAe nationals. The corresponding figure at the end of 2007 was 540. However, even though the number of people with HIV increased, new infections in the same period dropped from 42 to 35. A large majority of new infections in both years were detected in men - 33 and 29, respectively. HIV transmission has commonly occurred through heterosexual activity and injecting drug use. The problem with sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is more acute. In the 16 months prior to the research, 650 cases of STIs were reported, mostly among young women who were infected by their husbands. (It is notable that the government has recently instituted mandatory premarital HIV testing.) The bulk of the recorded cases are UAe nationals; corresponding figures for migrant workers are not available publicly. 6.2 Research", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a7c25444-1b18-45d0-bad4-1ffb043751a4": {"__data__": {"id_": "a7c25444-1b18-45d0-bad4-1ffb043751a4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV Vulnerabilities of Migrant Women: from Asia to the Arab States", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b2af48cd781df24e79c3c87f9fee24d2972549318678e58b56722e329c0b2fe2"}}, "hash": "b2af48cd781df24e79c3c87f9fee24d2972549318678e58b56722e329c0b2fe2", "text": "Methodology The research for this study was conducted in Dubai by a team consisting of a lead researcher and a research assistance, with support from the UNDP Country Office. The study was qualitative in nature: data was collected via in-depth interviews, meetings, and discussions with key stakeholder, such as embassy officials from sending countries, officials in the relevant Dubai ministries and government departments, doctors from hospitals entrusted with the pre-employment medical examination of migrant workers, relevant NGOs, and officials representing the recruitment agencies. Prior to the discussion itself, a guiding questionnaire - which addressed migrant laws, policies, and practices, as well as future plans to address migrant issues - was designed to initiate discussions with the participants. A conscious decision was made to take notes (as opposed to recording) during interviews and discussions in light of the experience in Bahrain, where interviewees appeared uncomfortable in expressing their opinions while being recorded. In addition to this primary research, over 30 migration and HIV-specific documents from various ministries and national and international organizations were studied for an updated view of migrant and HIV statistics and the problems faced by migrant women. 6.3 Policies and Laws Domestic workers are outside the purview of local labour laws, falling under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Immigration rather than the Ministry of Labour. Nonetheless, in April 2007 the UAe passed a separate domestic worker law, which governs working conditions, leave allowances, medical care, and salary issues. This is in addition to the bilateral agreements signed in December 2007 with prominent labour supplying countries such as Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka to regulate migration flows and streamline labour contracts. The agreements envision a future where contracts would be processed by the labour ministries of the supplying countries, thus bypassing recruitment agencies. earlier in the same year, in a reform to the sponsorship programme, domestic workers were permitted to change jobs conditional on their being able to produce a no-objection certificate from their original sponsor. Finally, in a recent attempt to bolster legal cover for migrant domestic workers, sponsors who facilitate domestic workers in working illegally are, since January 2008, liable to be charged with human trafficking and face a minimum jail term of ten years. Other recent efforts in ensuring the well being of such workers have been the establishment of a dispute resolution unit to iron out employee-employer discord and the setting up of an UNITED ARAB EMIRATES UNITED ARAB EMIRATES COUNTRY RePORTS Host Countries 96 electronic system for wage payments to foreign workers. In addition, to prevent abuse the Dubai police maintain a 24-hour hotline and website for the lodging of complaints. The police also employ human rights and social support offices to provide assistance to women who are victims of abuse. Migrant workers are required to be tested for HIV upon each renewal of their work permit and to be deported if they are found HIV-positive. Tests are also conducted for Hepatitis and TB, and a positive test in either case is likewise followed by deportation. For TB, however, if it can be shown that a migrant worker contracted the disease during a stay in Dubai, he/she receives access to treatment and is not liable to be deported. The National AIDS Prevention Programme, under the Ministry of Health, carries out awareness campaigns - including the distribution of literature published in english and Arabic - focusing on youth. It also provides free care, support, and treatment services to all UAe nationals. There is no preventive campaign targeting migrant workers in particular, who are also excluded from the curative infrastructure. The nation\u2019s first Voluntary Counseling and Testing Center facility, intended exclusively for use by nationals, is also in the pipeline. 6.4 Research Findings Two hospitals, both under the Ministry of Health, are responsible for conducting pre-employment checks for migrant workers. The checks are conducted for each migrant worker before the first approval of his/her work permit and for every subsequent renewal. The cost of administering each test, which is borne by the migrant worker, is approximately $136, and each year approximately 1.1 million migrant workers are tested. In the event of a positive test result, confidentiality is not maintained. Rather, the results are sent to the ministries of Labour, Immigration, and Health, as well as to the employer, and the deportation process starts immediately. Both hospitals, however, do not make the worker\u2019s HIV status explicit, opting instead to categorize the worker simply as either \u201cfit\u201d or \u201cunfit\u201d on the test report. The hospitals also provide treatment for opportunistic infections to the needy prior to starting the deportation process.

Interviews with officials from the embassies of Pakistan, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka revealed a wide range of abuse and deprivation faced by female migrant workers. The embassy of the Philippines reported that many Filipino domestic workers complained of maltreatment by employers in terms of physical and verbal abuse, long working hours, and restriction on freedom. Many of the women are not allowed to keep mobile phones, and some are locked in their room when their employer leaves home. Officials from all three embassies were unanimous in their view that many women enter or stay in Dubai illegally, hindering attempts to reach or be of assistance to them. They also insisted that measures were in place for regular monitoring of recruitment agencies and to take appropriate action in the event of any detection of malpractice. The Filipino and Sri Lankan embassies revealed that it was common practice for employers to withhold the passports of their domestic help, despite the fact that this is in clear violation of Dubai law. Officials in the Ministry of Labour highlighted that domestic migrant workers often sign employment contracts - written either in Arabic or english - without taking due care to understand the provisions outlined therein. This increases the potential for exploitation and limits the migrants\u2019 access to protection services. even though these officials insisted that the government has established mechanisms to safeguard the rights of migrant workers, they envisioned even greater participation in future from both the embassies and the recruitment agencies. Within the Ministry of Health there was consensus that migrant workers who tested positive for HIV should be deported. The lone dissenting voice belonged to a doctor from a local hospital, who suggested that the fear of deportation is a disincentive for migrants to seek testing, which in turn delays diagnosis and could culminate in further transmission of the virus. A top official from one of Dubai\u2019s hospitals suggested encouraging prospective migrants to test themselves in their home country prior to COUNTRY RePORTS Host Countries 97 migration in order to avoid wasteful expenditures. Another health ministry official disclosed that migrant HIV statistics are not made public in order to prevent public antagonism towards migrant workers. The Dubai Foundation for Women and Children - established in October 2007 - supports women and children who are victims of abuse regardless of whether they are nationals or migrants. An official of the foundation revealed that to date more expatriates than nationals have sought the foundation\u2019s assistance. There was consensus amongst the foundation\u2019s officials that government measures against the exploitation of female migrant workers were adequate; nonetheless, it was agreed that their interests would be better served by more proactive embassies and recruitment agencies. Officials also conceded that, owing to the foundation being relatively new, staff members have yet to acquire HIV-related training. Officials from recruitment agencies were adamant that the situation of domestic female migrant workers is not as precarious as it is made out to be. The interviewees stressed that workers represented by the agencies are safe, and that agencies try their utmost to match migrant domestic workers with households where they would be comfortable. In addition, agencies provide these workers with support in terms of salary negotiations and the resolution of disputes that might arise between employers and employees. Agency officials also asserted that unsafe sexual behavior on the part of the migrants was a phenomenon for which migrants themselves were responsible. 6.5 Recommendations Labour laws should be amended to cover domestic work to ensure that female domestic migrant workers are accorded the same level of legal protection against exploitation as migrant workers in other vocations. Best practice guidelines and benchmarks need to be developed for recruitment agencies, and effective monitoring mechanisms should be developed jointly by governments and embassies to enforce the guidelines. A coordination team composed of representatives of the sending and receiving governments, the relevant embassies, recruitment agencies, and related NGO groups should be formed to engage with workers\u2019 problems and issues. The AIDS Prevention Committees of origin and host countries should be linked in order that migrant workers who test positive for HIV can receive counseling, as well as information regarding care and support facilities in their home country, prior to deportation. embassies should organize orientation sessions for all new workers, taking care to include existing workers in the process.

This has the potential for preventing inadvertent abuse of the migrant workers, such as the withholding of their passports. The National AIDS Programme in Dubai, with help from the corporate sector and NGOs, should reach out to migrant workers with target specific literature on HIV prevention in an effort to discourage high-risk behavior of this vulnerable group. Recruitment agencies should ensure that employment contracts signed by domestic migrant workers are, in addition to being in english and Arabic, in a language that the worker can understand - preferably the worker\u2019s native language. This will ensure that workers understand the provisions that they are obligated to undertake and, thus, will enable them to ask for amendment or deletion of any clause they might find unfair or exploitative. UNITED ARAB EMIRATES UNITED ARAB EMIRATES COUNTRY RePORTS Host Countries 98 7. Lebanon 7.1 Introduction: Migration and HIV Despite continuing political uncertainty, Lebanon is a prime destination for migrant workers from all over Asia. Statistics from the Ministry of Labour confirm that the influx of migrant workers is steadily trending upward: between 2006 and 2007, the total number of work permits issued increased from 107,568 to 121,375. During the same time period, the number of new migrants increased from 31,468 to 42,218. A large proportion of these new migrants in both years (20,713 in 2006 and 37,104 in 2007) came to Lebanon to work as housemaids. Since the official statistics do not enumerate the number of migrant workers who arrive/live in Lebanon irregularly, and given the large number of migrants working in the informal sector, the numbers provided by the Ministry of Labour are likely to be underestimated. Female migrant workers employed as domestic workers in Lebanon can be classified in one of three categories: live-in workers, freelancers, or runaways. Women in the first group reside within their employer\u2019s household, and the latter is responsible for the costs of paperwork, health insurance, food and clothing, and a return airfare at the end of the employment period. In addition, it is the employer\u2019s responsibility to renew work and residency permits and health insurance. Freelancers, on the other hand, have their own accommodations and usually work for multiple employers on an hourly basis. Both these groups require a Lebanese sponsor. Runaways comprise workers who, for a variety of reasons \u2013 including non-payment of wages and abuse \u2013 flee an employer\u2019s household to seek refuge in embassies, with friends or NGOs, or live independently to pursue freelance work. Should a domestic helper become a runaway, employers are required to notify the authorities immediately. Lebanon is characterized as a low HIV/AIDS prevalence country, with a total number of 1,056 reported cases at the end of November 2007. Of these, 42 percent are asymptomatic carriers of the virus, and approximately 41 percent are living with AIDS. Ministry of Health statistics reveal that sexual activity is the highest mode of transmission (68 percent), while transfusion and injecting drug use contribute seven and six percent, respectively. Prenatal transmission accounts for roughly three percent. According to a 1996 study by the National AIDS Control Programme (NAP), unsafe sexual practices such as multiple partners and low condom use contribute to making sexual activity a high-risk behavior. In terms of gender, an overwhelming majority of those living with HIV are males (82 percent), with most infections recorded in the 31-50 age group. Migrant workers along with sex workers and injecting drug users are identified by most studies as high-risk groups in terms of exposure to and contraction of the disease. Socio-economic marginalization, low-levels of education, lack of legal access, the trauma of cultural dislocation, and the potential for harassment and abuse are amongst the many factors that dispose migrant workers to engage in high-risk behavior that makes them particularly vulnerable to HIV infection. Many runaway female migrant workers either are coerced into sex work or choose it voluntarily. In either instance, they are ill-equipped to enforce condom use. In addition, the economic and social costs (and consequent deportation) of being detected HIV-positive constitutes a significant disincentive for migrant workers to opt for testing, with the result that they are deprived of care, support, and treatment. Limitations of language and culture further inhibit the dissemination of preventive information. 7.2 Research Methodology The primary information used in this study was generated via in-depth interviews with all major stakeholders of migrant welfare and the HIV situation in Lebanon. This includes officials from embassies of the sending countries, various government departments and ministries, NGOs, recruitment agencies, testing centers, and the ILO.

This means that domestic workers can be denied the right to minimum wage, time off, maximum working hours, vacation time, accident or end-of-work compensation, or the freedom to organize through labour unions. However, the COUNTRY RePORTS Host Countries 99 Lebanese Government in recent years has taken some positive steps to protect domestic workers and other migrants. In 2000, the government established a formal complaint procedure for migrant workers, allowing them to register their complaint directly with the Ministry of Labour. Most notably, as a consequence of this procedure some hiring agencies have had their licenses suspended for improper conduct. In terms of the private sector, some Lebanese NGOs, and particularly the Caritas Migrant Center, have had some success relying on criminal law to prosecute employers and hiring agents who have exploited workers. In addition, as early as 1998 the government computerized the names and addresses of all sponsors and foreign workers. This has made it easier to trace sponsors through the ministry if a domestic worker, particularly in the case of a runaway, is filing a complaint. The Lebanese Government has also at various times granted amnesty to migrant workers. Most recently, in July 2006 migrant workers who were in an illegal/irregular status were permitted to leave without financial penalties. Generally, the aim of the amnesties is to lower the number of illegal foreign workers and lower the governmental expenses involved when a worker is apprehended. Finally, Lebanon requires that all migrant workers, including domestic workers, have health insurance. In 1989, Lebanon created the National Aids Control Programme (NAP), which is jointly instituted by the Ministry of Public Health and the World Health Organization. NAP\u2019s plans and actions are based on the local epidemiological situation, needs assessments, KABP (Knowledge, Attitude, Behaviors, and Practices) studies, and WHO directives. The government\u2019s commitment towards stemming the spread of the disease and providing specialized care to nationals living with HIV has been crystalized in efforts to formulate multi-sector strategies to combat the disease. This has involved capacity-building in several ministries and increased partnerships with NGOs and the private sector in order to increase awareness amongst high-risk target groups, ensuring adequate social support and care for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV), as well as increasing the availability of Anti-Retro Viral Treatment (ARV). LEBANON LEBANON COUNTRY RePORTS Host Countries 100 The National AIDS Policy does not make it mandatory for Lebanese citizens to undergo testing for HIV, but testing is compulsory for blood donors. In 2007, all units of donated blood were tested via quality assured processes. even though the renewal of work permits for migrant workers does not require screening for HIV, in accordance with Lebanese labour laws, all new migrants are required to submit negative HIV and STD lab test results along with their application for a work permit. Migrant workers testing positive are deported and, in accordance with the law, repatriation costs are borne by the recruitment agency. As of 2007, however, in such cases foreigners are given access to ARV treatment prior to deportation. 7.4 Research Findings According to officials in the Bangladeshi, Filipino, and Sri Lankan embassies, common abuses faced by their respective migrant workers include non/under-payment of wages, long working hours, inadequate nutrition, lack of private accommodation, sexual abuse/rape, and prohibitions on returning home. There was a general consensus that while male migrant workers mainly encountered problems related to illegal entry, overstaying, or expiration of entry visas, women migrants were more often susceptible to physical and sexual abuse. While the Sri Lankan and Filipino embassies provided social, medical, and legal services to their expatriates, actions of the Bangladesh Consulate focused primarily on wage related disputes between migrant workers and their employers in collaboration with recruitment agencies. While officials of the Filipino and Bangladeshi diplomatic missions reported having undergone training to handle HIV/AIDS-related cases, the Sri Lankan officials admitted to being unequipped to do so. Officials at the former two missions considered the sexual behavior of migrants as the primary risk factor in terms of contracting HIV, and were unanimous in asserting the need for comprehensive awareness programmes for both Lebanese and migrant populations. In addition, the Philippines Consul suggested that HIV-positive workers be deported only with the worker\u2019s consent, while the Bangladesh Consul suggested making an HIV test mandatory for renewal of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ed09a029-dc1f-4d19-b277-19d604749c14": {"__data__": {"id_": "ed09a029-dc1f-4d19-b277-19d604749c14", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV Vulnerabilities of Migrant Women: from Asia to the Arab States", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "33004dc5b722992bfa9de23b88d439470fefe5de73960323adf528279269956b"}, "3": {"node_id": "aa68ee61-d316-4b70-84d3-8a7fd1d5464b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f48165fd6036889e7baba2f3e84585a3d09c6768ba51e74dc3a7da31c0406703"}}, "hash": "77645d3cc993944fd1ce21298cf3b1115d386f4ea28f34cc34db4e25cabd04a9", "text": "work permits (current practice is to insist on the test only for new work permits). The interviewed official from the Ministry of Social Affairs revealed that the bulk of the ministry\u2019s efforts were targeted at increasing awareness amongst women and the youth population on best practices concerning reproductive health. In so far as migrant workers were concerned, the official was in favor of more comprehensive screening prior to the granting of work permits. The NAP representative mentioned that no records of migrants testing HIV-positive are kept. In order to foster better awareness and adherence to preventative practices, NAP, in conjunction with local NGOs, runs nationwide campaigns, as well as campaigns at the company level, targeting migrant workers directly and indirectly. The representative from the Ministry of Labour corroborated the embassies\u2019 perception that female migrant workers are more susceptible to abuse than their male counterparts, though most workers, regardless of gender, are exposed to some form of infringement of their human rights. Labour Ministry officials receive training on HIV/AIDS-related issues; and the ministry is in favor of lobbying the government to let migrant workers continue to work in Lebanon regardless of their HIV status. Nonetheless, the relevant department in the Interior Ministry reported that most detained migrant workers, regardless of their nationality, lacked requisite papers, were runaways, or had had their contracts terminated. This ministry supported the deportation of workers who had tested positive, citing the benefits to the migrants of comprehensive social and family support back home and the prohibitive costs of ARV treatment. Testing centers that were responsible for the HIV screening of prospective migrant workers acknowledged that there was a lack of confidentiality involving the test results. In 99 percent of cases, results were provided directly to either the employer or the recruitment agency; additionally, no pre- or post-test counseling was provided to the tested worker. Both NGOs selected for this study worked with PLHIV and offered a comprehensive array of services that included VCT (as per NAP guidelines), pre- and post-test counseling, psycho-social support for family member of persons living with HIV, skills-building for a variety of income-generating activities, and more. Migrant workers who turned to these NGOs were not discriminated against in terms of further access to their facilitates; confidentiality issues in terms of test results were respected; and active lobbying for recognition of the rights of the PLHIVA were conducted. NGO COUNTRY RePORTS Host Countries 101 LEBANON LEBANON representatives expressed the opinion that migrant workers who test positive could continue working in Lebanon. They also suggested that the pre-departure test for HIV be conducted in the countries of origin (rather that post-arrival screenings in the host country) to spare the expense that perspective migrant workers incur in terms of travel to and from Lebanon, as well as the test cost upon arrival. In 2003, peer counsellors from the Caritas Lebanon Migrant Center attended an HIV/AIDS awareness training of trainers. Curricula was developed in Amharic (for ethiopians) and Sinhalese (for Sri Lankans), and subsequent sessions were carried-out with approximately 300 migrant women. 7.5 Recommendations HIV/AIDS awareness amongst migrant populations (especially women) should be raised to reduce high-risk behaviors. In this light, migrant workers should be directly targeted. Preventative literature - e.g., brochures, posters, talks, etc. - must be made \u201cmigrant specific\u201d in order to be effective. Policy-makers need to acknowledge that any sustainable strategy for combating HIV/AIDS must be based around prevention rather than cure. The ability to provide treatment to persons living with HIV is dependent on keeping the rates of new infection low. In the countries of origin, there need to be broad efforts both at the level of policy formulation and programme design COUNTRY RePORTS Host Countries 102 and implementation to empower women. Multi-dimensional empowerment encompassing women\u2019s social, political, and economic clout will make them stake-holders in an HIV-free society. To this end, legislation is required to ensure the protection of women\u2019s rights and to reduce gender-skewed access to resources. Pre-departure orientation sessions for migrant workers in the countries of origin are often too general. Other host countries should follow the lead of the Caritas Lebanon Migrant Center (CLMC) in drafting (in conjunction with partners in the countries of origin) a comprehensive, destination-specific set of guidelines that outline the rights of migrant workers to access testing, counseling support, and care facilities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aa68ee61-d316-4b70-84d3-8a7fd1d5464b": {"__data__": {"id_": "aa68ee61-d316-4b70-84d3-8a7fd1d5464b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV Vulnerabilities of Migrant Women: from Asia to the Arab States", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "33004dc5b722992bfa9de23b88d439470fefe5de73960323adf528279269956b"}, "2": {"node_id": "ed09a029-dc1f-4d19-b277-19d604749c14", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-vulnerabilities-migrant-women-asia-arab-states", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "77645d3cc993944fd1ce21298cf3b1115d386f4ea28f34cc34db4e25cabd04a9"}}, "hash": "f48165fd6036889e7baba2f3e84585a3d09c6768ba51e74dc3a7da31c0406703", "text": "Such country-specific information in the pre-departure orientation session will enhance the preparedness of migrant workers and reduce the potential for their abuse.

In order to accomplish this, the network sought input from its members to identify what must be strategized and prioritized to reach the 10 targets of the 2011 Political Declaration, especially targets 1, 3, and 7 (detailed below) that speak most directly to the HIV needs of women and girls. More specifically, the e-discussion sought input to clarify: who members consider to be the key affected women and girls; and what are the priority actions that need to be taken by governments and civil society to achieve the targets regarding women and girls set forth in the Political Declaration, by 2015. The e-discussion coincided with and was advertised at the UNESCAP Asia-Pacific High-level Intergovernmental Meeting on the Assessment of Progress against Commitments in the Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS and the Millennium Development Goals1. By taking place in tandem with this influential meeting the HIV-APCoP was able to obtain contributions from the delegations and civil society participants attending the meeting and feed these into engagements at the meeting itself. More than 25 contributions were received from nine countries (Philippines, Australia, Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Sri Lanka, India, Cambodia, New Zealand and Thailand) over the e-discussion\u2019s three week duration. Contributors included UN agencies (UNDP and UNAIDS), government (Viet Nam, Sri Lanka) and civil society organizations (WAPN+, PATH India, ANPUD, IDLO, Asia Pacific Alliance for Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (APA), FHI, 7Sisters, ICRW, IPPF, and CCW). This e-discussion was conducted by the HIV-APCoP in partnership with UNZIP the Lips! (http://unzipthelips.org), a coalition of Asia-Pacific regional networks on HIV/AIDS together with supporting partners and activists across the region to articulate the needs of key affected women and girls. A special thanks to Asia Pacific Alliance for Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights for the support provided in developing the content for the e-discussion. 1 Held in Bangkok from 6 to 8 February 2012, organized by ESCAP in partnership with UNAIDS, UNDP, UNODC, UN Women, UNFPA, UNICEF, and WHO.

However, often programmes and policies do not specifically address women and girls; and fail to acknowledge that gender equality is a cross-cutting issue and critical to reach all the goals and targets in the 2011 Declaration and the Universal Access agenda. Many countries in Asia and the Pacific are experiencing concentrated epidemics with key affected populations (KAPs) identified as most-at-risk. It is especially important to recognize the needs of women and girls who work as sex workers, use drugs and/or are transgender. In a number of settings, women and girls, as well as adolescents and other young people, experience substantial, and in some cases disproportionate, impacts of the epidemic and must be addressed in the context of KAPs. Prioritizing KAPs is also dependent on the context and dynamics of the epidemic in a particular country. Evidence-based research is needed to guide targeted interventions for the most-at-risk and affected women and girls to ensure that their specific needs are accurately addressed. Governments commit to comprehensively target populations at higher risk in national prevention strategies and to ensure that services are accessible to them. This recognition is a step forward; however, the specific needs of key affected women and girls are often neglected and punitive laws, policies, practices and stigma and discrimination continue to exist. I am pleased to launch this e-discussion on behalf of Unzip the Lips!3, to stimulate the participation of members to contribute to the dialogue and to ensure more policy attention is paid in the region to key affected women and girls. Your contributions will help shape our engagement at the upcoming Asia-Pacific High-level Intergovernmental Meeting on the Assessment of Progress against Commitments in the Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS and the MDGs that will take place from 6-8 February 2012. 3 For more information visit http://unzipthelips.org www.hivapcop.org 4 Contributors The HIV-APCoP received responses, with thanks, from: Alka Narang, Assistant Country Director, HIV and Development Unit, and Ernest Noronha, Programme Officer, HIV and Development Unit, UNDP India Bolalava Vaia, FHI 360, Papua New Guinea Brianna Harrison, Human Rights Programme Officer, UNAIDS Asia Pacific Regional Support Team Dean Lewis, Regional Coordinator, Asian Network of People who Use Drugs (ANPUD) Ferdinand J.

What are the priority actions that governments and civil society should undertake to achieve the three targets regarding women and girls in the Political Declaration by 2015? Depending on the circumstance and country, the following groups of women were identified as key HIV affected women and girls by contributors: women living with HIV; female sex workers and female intimate partners of male clients; women who use drugs and female partners of men who use drugs; transgender women; female partners of men who have sex with men; young key affected women; and women and girls from households impacted by HIV. The following issues were highlighted by contributors as those that need to be addressed in order to address HIV needs of key affected women and girls migration; and violence against women. Part 1: Who are Key affected women and girls Women living with HIV (WLHIV) It has long been recognized that women and girls living with HIV constitute a key affected population. Contributors noted that governments have committed to ensuring that national HIV policies and programmes are sensitive to the needs and rights of women and girls living with HIV and that these commitments are fulfilled and implemented in practice. It was noted that programme and policies www.hivapcop.org 6 were more likely to succeed (including government initiated initiatives) by fostering stronger partnerships with civil society, in particular positive women\u2019s networks and women\u2019s rights organizations, and by meaningfully involving them in programme design and implementation. Respondents also called for positive women to be more closely involved in the service delivery of programmes that impact them. Community level examples that were cited include the valuable role that positive women play as peer educators, counselors, and out-reach workers. Contributors further called on governments in the region to ensure that these type of initiatives are funded from national budgets and that the meaningful involvement of women and girls living with HIV in national AIDS responses should not be reliant or conditional upon external donor funding. Female sex workers and female intimate partners of male clients Sex work remains a key driver of the HIV epidemic in Asia and the Pacific. This e-discussion highlighted female sex workers as one of the groups of key affected women and girls in the region. Respondents from the Philippines reported significant progress made in their country with regard to addressing the HIV- related needs of this key affected population. Recent research showed significant increases in coverage of HIV prevention services for female sex workers, from 14 per cent in 2006 to 55 per cent in 20104. This corresponds with an overall decrease in the proportion of new infections among women in the Philippines from 33 per cent in the period 1984-2006 to 7 per cent in 20115. In contrast to this picture of progress, respondents from the Philippines and India noted that the vulnerability of non-brothel based female sex workers to HIV has increased in recent years. Reasons cited include difficulties among this group in accessing HIV prevention services that is further exacerbated by criminalization of sex work in those countries. Citing recent studies done in India, a respondent reported that in their country both aging and younger women in sex work were at higher risk of HIV compared to other groups in the population. Evidence also shows that significant numbers of sex workers continue to be susceptible to abuse by law enforcement officers and laws remain in place in many Asia-Pacific countries that criminalize sex work, hindering access to HIV services6.

The need for better linkages between sexual reproductive health services (SRH) and drug and alcohol services was highlighted, especially given that alcohol and drug use can negatively impact on a women\u2019s ability to negotiate safe sex. Transgender women Transgender women are vulnerable to HIV and should be considered as one of the groups of key affected women and girls in the region. In their statement to the UNESCAP High-level Intergovernmental Meeting which was subsequently posted to the HIV-APCoP e-discussion, the Asia Pacific Transgender Network (APTN) noted, \u201cResolution 66/108 is the first UN Declaration to mention transgender people. We applaud the leadership of our region in recognizing us.\u201d APTN also shared the significant challenges they face as citizens in their countries, including holding identity cards/passports which do not match their appearance, being denied employment and repeatedly facing stigma and discrimination, including in health care settings. APCASO and APA, in their recently released report Women and Girls: The 2011 Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS, Civil Society Perspectives on the 2011 HIV/ AIDS High Level Meeting9, noted that while the 2011 Declaration commits governments to comprehensively target populations at higher risk, which in this region includes transgender people, what is needed is national prevention strategies that ensure gender sensitive services are available by removing punitive laws, policies, practices and stigma and discrimination blocking access. 7 Commission on AIDS in Asia (2008).

Female partners of men who have sex with men Contributors, while noting that there is limited data available on the HIV vulnerabilities of this particular group, highlighted that female sexual partners of men who have sex with men (MSM) should be considered as key affected women. The available evidence suggests that a significant minority of MSM in the region have long- term female partners/spouses. With MSM recognized as a key affected population with high HIV prevalence rates reported in several countries in the region, intimate partner transmission of HIV in this context requires greater attention than has hitherto been the case10. Young key affected women A number of contributors highlighted the need for focusing attention on key affected young women and girls. A contribution from the Cambodian Community of Women Living with HIV (CCW) noted, \u201cgirls living with or affected with HIV share the challenges of being more likely to drop out of school than boys; of getting married at a younger age; of poorer, unequal economic prospects; and of enhanced vulnerability to HIV infection and (if infected) of difficulties ensuring they do not pass on the infection to others due, in large part, to gender norms and ideals in Cambodia.\u201d The contribution also pointed to the fact that the country\u2019s young population has been given special attention by the government, and addressing the HIV needs of young people included in the National Policy on Cambodian Youth Development. A statement made by the government of Sri Lanka at the UNESCAP High-level Intergovernmental Meeting\u2019s side event on \u2018Engaging with young people: removing legal and access barriers\u2019, which was shared with the HIV-APCoP, also highlighted their commitment in working with young people.

This group is often forgotten, including in the 2011 Declaration and their needs and rights should be more comprehensively addressed.\u201d HIV and Violence against Women: A key point highlighted by the UNAIDS Strategy on Getting to Zero is zero tolerance on gender-based violence. Similarly, the UNAIDS Agenda for Women and Girls calls for appropriate systems to be established to investigate and document violence, as well as the link between HIV and different forms of violence against all women and girls, including key affected populations such as sex workers, women living with HIV, women who use drugs, young women and transgender persons.\u201d Many contributions noted vulnerability of women to violence, their fear in voicing their concerns, and the stigma and discrimination that they face. Part II - Priority actions that need to be taken by government and civil society to achieve the targets regarding women and girls set forth in the Political Declaration by 2015 Involving men and boys Many contributors stressed the importance of involving men and boys in addressing the HIV needs of women, especially given that the majority of women acquire HIV from their long term intimate male partners. Contributions from UNAIDS noted the work done in Indonesia targeting mobile men with money, as highlighted by the Indonesian delegation at the High Level meeting, as a good example and pointed to the inclusion of the following text in the Outcome document of the UNESCAP High-level Intergovernmental Meeting as a clear recognition of the need to involve men and boy. \u201cThe Meeting recognized that addressing gender norms and relations were crucial for reducing HIV vulnerability. For women, a major source of transmission of HIV was unprotected sex with their male partners, especially if those were the clients of sex workers, and the impact of the epidemic across the region on monogamous women infected by their intimate partner was highlighted by one delegation. The need to increase male involvement in reproductive health was noted.\u201d Making HIV prevention technologies, including female condoms more readily available for women and girls The importance of making it easier for women to access HIV prevention www.hivapcop.org 10 \u201c good sexual and reproductive health, in some kind of sustainable way, would not result unless and until men get their foot off women\u2019s and girls\u2019 necks, unless and until the land and its resources are redistributed, and unless and until both \u201cculture\u201d- related and clearly religion-inspired sexism and homophobia are revealed for what they are and opposed and rooted out. everything else, in my opinion, is simply a temporary solution. technologies such as female condoms was made clear in the discussion. Citing a report conducted by the Guttmacher Institute (2011), a member stated that 72 percent and 32 percent of women younger than 20 have an unmet need for modern contraceptives in South Central Asia and South-East Asia, respectively11. A number of barriers hinder women\u2019s access to HIV prevention technologies, including women\u2019s inability to negotiate condom use with their partners, cultural and religious norms that inhibit, and laws and policies that prohibit women from accessing contraceptives. Contributors called on decision makers to endorse policies and funding that raise awareness of and increase access to more protection options for women. Address the needs of females who use drugs and female spouses of male drug users In order to address the HIV needs of women and girls within the context of injecting drug use, ANPUD called for implementation of all nine interventions listed in the WHO/UNODC/UNAIDS Technical Guide for Countries to set targets for universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care for injecting drug users12, with sufficient coverage (at least 80 percent of the target population). The nine interventions are: 1. Needle and Syringe Programmes (NSPs) 2. Opioid Substituition Therapy (OST) and other drug dependence treatment 3. HIV Testing and Counselling (T&C) 4. Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) 5. Prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STI) 6. Condom programs for IDUs and sexual partners 7.

Strengthen sexual reproductive health programmes The importance of strengthening sexual and reproductive health services in the region was emphasized by a number of participants, especially (as one participant pointed out) within the context of broader health systems strengthening. The importance of capacity building of health workers to ensure that the rights of key affected populations are not violated in health care settings was repeated. In particular, it was noted that key affected women face severe stigma and discrimination in health care settings, are not given proper information on treatment that can prevent transmitting the disease to their children and that can at times save lives, and HIV positive women who are pregnant continue to be forced or coerced into abortions or sterilization. Remove punitive laws and enhance access to justice for women A number of laws that prevent key affected women from accessing HIV services and the existence of barriers to accessing justice were noted by participants of the e-discussion. Some laws that impact key affected women in the region reported include: laws that criminalize sex work, sex between men and drug use; property and inheritance rights that discriminate against women ( or have special implications for HIV affected women); laws and policies that prevent key affected women, including young key affected women, from accessing reproductive health services and information. IDLO shared with the HIV-APCoP information on a recent workshop conducted on \u2018Access to justice and legal services for positive women and women vulnerable to HIV\u2019, and highlighted the importance of legal literacy for women living with HIV as many are unaware of their rights. It was recognized that a lot of work remains to be done in order to build sufficient capacity of lawyers and the judiciary in the region. Address wider issues of gender equality in the region and empower women to claim their rights Contributors repeatedly underscored that gender dimensions of the epidemic cannot be addressed without also addressing wider issues of gender equality in the region. Susana Fried from UNDP observed, \u201cIn the context of the AIDS epidemic, understanding and responding to gender inequality is essential www.hivapcop.org 12 to delivering results. The wide variation in patterns, resources and responses, in concentrated as well as generalized epidemics, points to the importance of understanding the role of gender inequality in driving epidemics, as well as the interaction between gender inequality and other social and structural factors\u2014such as economic status, ethnicity and religion\u2014that influence disease dynamics.\u201d Brianna Harrison from UNAIDS noted, \u201cAddressing the rights and needs of key affected women and girls will not only enable progress towards the three targets specifically relating to women and girls in the Political Declaration 2011, it will also ensure progress on advancing human rights to eliminate stigma, discrimination and violence related to HIV (another of the 10 targets - which in fact impacts on countries\u2019 ability to achieve all targets). It will also enable our efforts to address HIV to contribute to progress on broader development and human rights issues.\u201d Greater awareness of HIV Contributors emphasized the importance of raising awareness among women and girls and men and boys, particularly the importance of including sexual reproductive health in the school curriculum. A number of countries in the region have made significant progress in this regard and lessons should be shared between countries. Innovative approaches to raising awareness among the wider public were also shared.

They include the need to: comprehensively target populations at higher risks - including women and girls who work as sex workers, drug users and or are transgender women - in national prevention strategies and ensure that gender sensitive services are available to them; undertake measures to address legal barriers that impede effective HIV responses, in particular with regard to key affected populations; ensure access to comprehensive sexuality education for girls and boys both in and out of school; strengthen national health and social systems and ensure proper linkages with sexual and reproductive health and maternal and child health services; ensure that services provided to prevent vertical HIV transmission are part of a holistic, rights-based HIV prevention, treatment, care and support package for women; ensure women of child-bearing age have access to HIV prevention services; ensure laws and policies on preventing vertical HIV transmission should adhere to principles of informed consent, confidentiality, pre- and post-test counselling and proper referral to treatment, care and support services; ensure that the needs of migrants, especially female migrants are more comprehensively addressed; ensure national responses meet the specific needs of women and girls through strengthening legal, policy, administrative and other measures for the promotion and protection of women\u2019s full enjoyment of all human rights; 13 Available at http://www.womenandaids.net/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=ed645877-b1b8-4553- 856c-d5f183862996&disposition=inline www.hivapcop.org 14 recognize that the role and engagement of men and boys in the achievement of gender equality is crucial; and invest in women\u2019s leadership, community capacity building, and eliminate gender based violence, as they are critical enablers that are essential to the success of HIV programmes.

The e-discussion was conducted to engage with the HIV-APCoP\u2019s diverse membership of UN agencies, networks of people living with HIV, national and local governments, civil society organizations and academic and research institutions, to inform a Discussion Paper on HIV and violence-against-women2 that has been commissioned by the Asia-Pacific United Nations Interagency Task Team on Women, Girls, Gender Equality and HIV (IATT). A survey was conducted in early July 2012 prior to the e-discussion to collect inputs on available research, policies and programmes on VAW and HIV and sought to identify the major gaps in evidence, policies and programmes. The e-discussion sought inputs from the diverse membership of the HIV-APCoP to identify: Members views on the linkages between violence-against-women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific region; and Practical ways of addressing the intersection of violence-against-women and HIV Over 30 members participated in the survey and online discussion. The contributions were insightful and of strong quality. Activity on the website indicated widespread reach of content of the discussion. Over the duration of the e-discussion the HIV-APCoP website received visits from 143 different users from 36 countries, including from 19 countries in the Asia Pacific region. In addition, every contribution to the e-discussion was disseminated via email to the HIV-APCoP\u2019s 500+ members. The HIV-APCoP would like to extend a special thanks to guest moderator Ms. Neelanjana Mukhia, founding member of the international \u2018Women Won\u2019t Wait Campaign\u2019 on the intersection of violence-against-women and HIV. 1 For more information visit http://saynotoviolence.org/join-say-no/2012-16-days-activism-against- gender-violence-campaign 2 The Discussion Paper is expected to be published in mid 2013. www.hivapcop.org 2 Message from Neelanjana Mukhia, Guest Moderator Neelanjana Mukhia is a founding member of the international campaign on the intersection of violence against women and HIV \u2018Women Won\u2019t Wait Campaign\u2019, and managed the international secretariat of the campaign since its inception up to late 2010. She has been working on women\u2019s rights and gender equality issues for 15 years in South Asia and internationally, including in Africa, and has published widely on issues relating to women\u2019s empowerment and gender equality. I am delighted to launch this e-discussion on violence-against-women and HIV on the first day of the 16 Days of Activism on Violence against Women.

NeelaNjaNa MukHIa, Guest MoDerator 3 The research has identified the following evidence in the Asia Pacific region: Violence as a risk factor for HIV5 In Asia Pacific most studies exploring the relationship between violence- against-women and HIV have been limited to India. A study with husband-wife dyads in India found that abusive husbands were more likely to acquire HIV than non-abusive husbands and the HIV risk for women in violent relationships was seven times greater than that of women not in violent relationships6. HIV as a risk factor for violence Few studies show prevalence of intimate partner violence among women living with HIV. One study in rural and urban India found that women living with HIV were more likely to report forced sex and domestic violence than women who were not HIV positive. Another study, also from India, found that 42 percent of women visiting voluntary counseling and testing for HIV centers who tested positive reported intimate partner violence. Of these, 18 percent believed the cause of violence was their status.7,8 Violence against sex workers9 Studies show female, male and transgender sex workers face endemic violence from various perpetrators and at a range of different sites. In India, up to 35 percent of female sex workers face intimate partner violence; in Pakistan, up to 66 percent face physical violence and 34 percent faced sexual violence; in China, 55 percent faced emotional 5 Program on International Health and Human Rights, Harvard School of Public Health, 2011.

Violence against women, girls and drug use Evidence on the risk of women who use drugs to HIV or violence is sorely lacking. Women who use drugs face conditions of marginalization, criminalization and police surveillance, which can increase their risk of violence. In many countries, possession of drugs or injecting equipment can lead to criminal sanctions, including imprisonment and involuntary detention in treatment centers, sites where women are at particular risk for violence15. During drug searches women are at particular risk for rape, sexual exploitation and sexual harassment and because possession of drugs is criminalized women are unable to report abuses for fear of retribution16. Even when perpetrators are not the police, women who use drugs are reluctant to report violence17. Violence against adolescent girls, young women and HIV Age disaggregated data collection has been very limited despite some evidence to show young women\u2019s vulnerability to violence and HIV. Globally, the majority of sexually active girls aged 15\u201319 in developing countries are married, and these married adolescent girls tend to have higher rates of HIV infection than their sexually active, unmarried peers18. 14 For more see Beattie, Tara SH & others, 2010. \u201cViolence against female sex workers in Karnataka state, south India: impact on health, and reductions in violence following an intervention program.\u201d BMC Public Health Vol. 10: 476-577; Swain, Suvakanta N & others, 2011. \u201cExperience of violence and adverse reproductive health outcomes, HIV risks among mobile female sex workers in India.\u201d BMC Public Health Vol. 11: 357-367; Decker, Michele & others, 2010. \u201cViolence victimisation, sexual risk and sexually transmitted infection symptoms among female sex workers in Thailand.\u201d Sexually Transmitted Infections Vol.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fd26cb48-86cf-41b2-8f07-dd39caaf26be": {"__data__": {"id_": "fd26cb48-86cf-41b2-8f07-dd39caaf26be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-apcop-summary-e-discussion-linkages-between-violence-against-women-and-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV-APCoP Summary of E-discussion on Linkages between Violence-Against-Women and HIV in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-apcop-summary-e-discussion-linkages-between-violence-against-women-and-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "61a82518734542ef439fd67dfbc0e82e3aa63096876cbc14f5fd24f40b8c5134"}, "2": {"node_id": "4d86a4e5-7e30-4413-b785-e3ca98ea4b33", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-apcop-summary-e-discussion-linkages-between-violence-against-women-and-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cac0cb56cbad319aa4f8a0160883d88e459392f7aa45104b65c31965fbcd9aee"}}, "hash": "080650ca066fe6cdf04de191e131e7eaae6656fbe5dac697ac308aa984b2620f", "text": "86: 236-240. 15 HAARP, 2011.

Stemming from a manifestation of unequal power relations between men and women, participants noted that traditional and cultural roles often perpetuate gender inequality and violence-against-women. It was also noted that much of the violence faced by women goes unreported. This may be a result of women being unaware of available services. While much has been done to put laws in place, one of the biggest challenges that remains is their implementation in providing equal access to justice, services and personal safety and well-being for those experiencing violence. For example, there are few legal, health and support services (in the context of HIV) available for survivors of violence in the region. Lack of evidence Many contributors expressed concern over the lack of evidence available on HIV and violence-against-women in the region. Without empirical evidence policy makers face challenges in developing and implementing policies and programmes that adequately address these linkages. Even when laws and policies do exist, there can sometimes be little effort made to actually implement them. For example, contribution from Papua New Guinea noted that there has been poor implementation of the HIV/AIDS Management and Prevention (HAMP) Act and the Family Law. Contributors noted that while there have been some attempts to collect data on VAW, including in instances of domestic rape, child sexual abuse etc., these surveys do not collect data on HIV linkages.

For example, \u201cPartners for Prevention is coordinating a regional multi-country study on men\u2019s perpetration of gender- based violence. The study, called \u201cThe Change Project\u201d[20], interviews men \u2013 and, in some sites, women as well \u2013 to explore men\u2019s use of violence and links to notions around masculinities. The study also looks at men\u2019s sexual health practices and sexual behavior patterns.\u201d Findings of the study, conducted across six countries in Asia-Pacific, \u201c\u2026 point to a picture of women\u2019s limited ability to negotiate condom use, and vulnerability (of both women and men) to STIs and HIV. Both factors point toward partner relationships in which inequalities and power imbalances limit healthy sexual choices and equitable relationship dynamics. Work to address the intersections between HIV and experiences of violence is crucial in order to prevent gender-based violence and lower HIV prevalence across the region.\u201d A member from UNAIDS PNG highlighted findings from a study in that country21 that demonstrated that women who report child sexual abuse were twice as likely to be HIV positive and seven times more likely to engage in transactional sex. This evidence has since led to development of national policies and strategic plans to respond to HIV and gender-based violence in PNG and other countries in Asia and the Pacific. 19 A regional publication capturing the results of the study is to be released in 2013. 20 The results of the Change Project regional study will be launched in July 2013.

For example, studies called on the importance of the need to address the gap in services in providing post-exposure-prophylaxis for survivors of sexual violence. Studies in each country also found that HIV and VAW programmes were run in parallel with poor communication and referral mechanisms. Contributors echoed these sentiments, \u201cHIV and Gender are seen as two separate and different problems. HIV is seen as a \u2018health\u2019 problem, while gender is seen as a \u2018social and cultural\u2019 problem. This kind of point of view influence the approach and methodology taken by the government into AIDS response.\u201d Key HIV affected populations face disproportionate violence Many contributors noted key HIV affected populations faced disproportionate violence, including female sex workers, transgender people and men who have sex with men. On violence faced by sex workers, a contribution from UN Women in Cambodia pointed out, \u201cRates of violence are particularly high among female sex workers and transgender women in Cambodia. Jenkins\u2019 2006 study[22] on 500 freelance sex workers, of whom 14% were sray sros (transgender women), found that altogether 86.8% of female freelance sex workers had been raped in the past year, and this rate was higher at 90.8% among the sray sros. Altogether 54.8% of female sex workers and 37.5% of sray sros included in the study were gang raped by clients in the past year.\u201d Sam Winters from the University of Hong Kong highlighted the extent of violence confronting transgender men and women.

Research agenda Sex and age disaggregated data collection, across targets and indicators covering all key populations, should be encouraged, resourced and fast tracked so as to ensure gender analysis is integral to all HIV plans. Data collection of indicators on the prevalence of intimate partner violence should be encouraged, resourced and fast tracked and should cover all women at particular risk of HIV, including but not limited to sex workers, transgender population, women living with HIV and women who use drugs. Collect data on availability and accessibility of female condoms to all women, including but not limited to, female sex workers, and women living with HIV, married women, women who use drugs and other at risk women. Research the diverse and complex linkages between violence against women and HIV in the context of systemic gender inequality, poverty, and multiple discriminations, including but not limited to, women\u2019s risk to violence and HIV in conflict, post-conflict and humanitarian settings; young women\u2019s risk to violence and HIV, including in the context of early marriage; specific risks and vulnerabilities of lesbian, bisexual and transgender women, migrant and undocumented migrant women, female prisoners, women with disabilities and women in serodiscordant relationships. 11 Map all perpetrators of violence against sex workers and understand the full range of violence they face, as well as protection factors that interrupt their risk for violence and HIV. Conduct research on the role of criminalization, police surveillance, harassment and violence in increasing HIV risks of sex workers and women who use drugs, including in health systems, detention centers, rehabilitation centers, and their impact on access to justice, HIV and harm reduction services. Conduct research on the gender specific risks and vulnerabilities of women who use drugs, including their fear of disclosure and risk for violence, gate- keeping by others, and their sexual and reproductive needs and rights. Expand the evidence base on what works by evaluating and showcasing interventions that address gender equality, violence against women and HIV, including evaluating the appropriateness of successful interventions for replication and scale-up. For example, there are a number of sex worker led initiatives in the region that should be costed and modeled for replication or scale up. Advocacy agenda Laws, policies and practices that discriminate against women and people living with HIV, should be reformed in line with internationally agreed human rights standards. In particular, countries should legislate against all forms of violence against women, including but not limited to, intimate partner violence, marital rape and sexual harassment Laws, policies and practices that undermine and erode national AIDS responses, such as criminalization of same sex practices, sex work and drug use; possession of condoms and clean needles as evidence for criminal sanction should be reformed. State institutions such as health systems and law enforcement machineries should follow a zero tolerance policy to stigma, discrimination and rights violations, sexual harassment and violence, especially directed at women living with HIV, sex workers, women who use drugs, transgender people and men who have sex with men, and ensure equal access to justice to all.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d2e89538-2921-4c77-8e75-132de9ca10b5": {"__data__": {"id_": "d2e89538-2921-4c77-8e75-132de9ca10b5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-apcop-summary-e-discussion-linkages-between-violence-against-women-and-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV-APCoP Summary of E-discussion on Linkages between Violence-Against-Women and HIV in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-apcop-summary-e-discussion-linkages-between-violence-against-women-and-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "26480df915e8827746813420a7d32b1dc1f47875797eec56f3cc16976ec5a735"}, "2": {"node_id": "4560349a-f7dc-4965-a3f0-8156b7d74538", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-apcop-summary-e-discussion-linkages-between-violence-against-women-and-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d131c086438413765ab846468bb2f801390101882ac4785a922d41b2cc10a6f3"}}, "hash": "94bf4b0360b2ca758a6a425441b3cccffafa8ec7e3d8ae633136455049d81355", "text": "Laws and policies that guarantee women\u2019s sexual and reproductive rights and prevent and redress violence against women should be resourced and strengthened to respond to all women\u2019s dual risk of violence and HIV.

Also, these and other gender equality plans and services should be monitored to ensure accessibility for all women, including sex workers, women living with HIV, women who use drugs, and others who are marginalized and hard to reach. HIV prevention programmes for young people should integrate gender equality components and challenge violence against women. Programmes for sex workers should acknowledge and address the full range of violence faced by them; facilitate and resource collective action; and ensure state institutions are accountable for preventing and redressing violence against sex workers regardless of who the perpetrator is. Programmes for people who use drugs should respond to needs and risks of women who use drugs, including their access to integrated HIV, harm reduction, sexual and reproductive health and violence response services. Different models of enhanced voluntary counseling and testing services and the provision of comprehensive post-rape care services, and other integrated services should be evaluated and costed for scale up and replication. Services should be periodically monitored to ensure accessibility for all women, including sex workers, women living with HIV, women who use drugs, and others who are marginalized and hard to reach. All HIV interventions and services should monitor the gender specific barriers and human rights impacts of their activities and remedy any adverse human rights outcomes, including heightened risk for violence.

The Socio-economic Impact of HIV on Women and Girls 1 Message from the Guest Moderator Aradhana Johri Additional Secretary National AIDS Control Office, Government of India HIV has an adverse, and often debilitating, socio-economic impact on individuals living with HIV and their households. In several countries, especially in Asia and the Pacific, traditional and entrenched gender inequities exacerbate the disproportionate impact of this socio-economic burden on women and girls living with HIV or from HIV affected households, by restricting their access to social and economic resources, coping mechanisms, and care and support services. Over the past several years, governments in Asia and the Pacific have planned and implemented a broad range of policy responses aimed at mitigating the socio- economic impact of HIV. However, these measures have either been inadequate or not completely effective to directly address the impact on women and girls. In the absence of adequate data, efforts towards evidence-based policy advocacy for impact-mitigation have not always been effective. To address this gap, UNDP has undertaken a regional analysis of the socio- economic impact of HIV on women and girls in Asia1, based on national studies conducted in Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam, during the last few years. Despite its limitations in terms of the data (India report for example was released in 2006), this analysis clearly indicated that in all the countries where the studies were conducted, women living with HIV or in HIV-affected households shouldered additional economic burden (women were more likely to head HIV- affected households, compared to non-affected households) and additional social and care-giving burdens in spite of the constraints on their opportunities for education and income generation (women living with HIV had lower levels of education, compared to men living with HIV). In addition, the analysis identified the following key areas of concern: Unlike men, women and girls with HIV or in HIV-affected households, in general, have higher labour force participation rates and employment levels, compared to women in non-affected households, indicating the need for women to continue to work in spite of their poor health; 1 The Socio-economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Asia: A Regional Analysis of the Im- pact on Women and Girls, UNDP, due for release in November 2011 www.hivapcop.org 2 Female headed HIV-affected households are more likely to have limited access to coping mechanisms \u2013 including lower levels of asset ownership and higher levels of indebtedness \u2013 compared to male headed HIV-affected households; In general, there are lower rates of school attendance and higher rates of dropout and absenteeism among girls, than among boys in HIV-affected households, signifying higher incidence of economic/care-giving burden on girls; Women living with HIV experience both a higher level of internal stigma and external discrimination, compared to men living with HIV; Women\u2019s vulnerability to HIV is enhanced by gender-based variations in key drivers of intimate partner transmission (women are less aware of condoms as a harm reduction technology, and less equipped to negotiate its use); As compared to women, men are less likely to be diagnosed through the voluntary counseling and testing facilities and are also less likely to disclose their status to their partners after diagnosis); and Widows, especially those living with HIV, are more likely to be denied their inheritance rights and, are often, even excluded from the communal use of household property. In the context of these findings, it is imperative that comprehensive policy options are identified and advocated to mitigate the socio-economic impact of HIV on women and girls. In this regard, it is my pleasure to launch this e-discussion, which will run for two weeks, and focus on key areas of impact based on the above findings. These include: 1. Policies to mitigate impact on women\u2019s economic opportunities. 2. Policies to mitigate impact on girls\u2019 education. 3. Policies to mitigate social impact (including stigma and discrimination). 4. Policies to reduce women\u2019s increased vulnerability to HIV through intimate partner transmission. 5.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b54b4cc-6452-4223-8d7d-7f7a483c3d85": {"__data__": {"id_": "0b54b4cc-6452-4223-8d7d-7f7a483c3d85", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-apcop-summary-e-discussion-socio-economic-impact-hiv-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV-APCoP Summary of E-discussion on the Socio-economic Impact of HIV on Women and Girls", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-apcop-summary-e-discussion-socio-economic-impact-hiv-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8eaacbe62009b2b24b610fdfc1a4c75d1f6452118e7bf5f406794021469985bd"}, "2": {"node_id": "17eb0a24-cdea-4e15-86cb-5aff4fdf77d0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-apcop-summary-e-discussion-socio-economic-impact-hiv-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f72430ab991de59d6516ed108d5cb2d38e9e44911c61bbaa67cb7e2f69ce6e04"}}, "hash": "fbf60b4f433783157e1a59f15343680b96d97248fc8999548656e071ef1487a0", "text": "5.

Members, who were informed of the findings of the regional analysis on the socio-economic impact of HIV on women and girls in Asia, were asked to identify the most critical impacts of HIV on women and girls in the region across a range of issues. Respondents rated the issues (see list below) on a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being the least important and 5 the most important) and also provided specific examples of initiatives implemented by government, civil society and the private sector. Economic: Income; Assets (e.g. ownership of property); Credit, Debt, Employment, Other Food and Nutrition: Accessibility; Affordability; Quality; Other Education: School attendance; Affordability; Other Health: Health-seeking behavior; Accessibility; Discrimination; Affordability; Other Stigma discrimination: Law and policy; Enforcement/judiciary; Service delivery; Discrimination in healthcare, community and occupational settings; Other Household burden: Care for the sick; Heading the household (additional economic burden); Disproportionate household-labour; Other The findings from the online survey and the e-discussion are summarized below1. Economic Most participants identified loss of (or inability to find) employment (80%) and the loss of (or inability to generate) income (76%) as the most critical economic impacts of HIV on women and girls in Asia and the Pacific. A relatively smaller proportion of participants also identified drops in ownership and control over economic assets (property, livestock, etc.); increased indebtedness; and diminished access to sources of credit as critical economic impacts (44%, 42% and 34%, respectively). 1 The online survey ran from 15 to 31 July, 2011. A total of 41 responses were collected from respond- ents situated in 18 different countries. The breakdown of respondents by gender was as follows: 63.4% female; 34.1% male; and 2.4% other (specified as transgender).

Legislative frameworks that continue to constrain women\u2019s rights to own economic assets (for example, the inability to open bank accounts without husbands\u2019 authorization in Indonesia) contribute to increasing vulnerability of women to the economic impacts of HIV. Food & Nutrition A large majority of participants identified the reduced affordability of food as the most critical food and nutrition-related impact of HIV on women and girls in Asia and the Pacific (76%). Sixty six percent and fifty six percent of participants also identified inadequate nutritional value (quality) of food and the diminished accessibility to food sources, respectively, as the most critical impacts. Participants pointed out how (food) accessibility and (food) quality-related impacts on women and girls are amplified by gender stereotypes within Asia and the Pacific, which skew the effort-reward balance in terms of food provision and allocation.

Education Majority of participants (73%) identified the drop in school attendance (and relatedly, the increase in absenteeism) as the most critical education-related impact of HIV on women and girls in Asia and the Pacific. 71% of participants also considered the reduced ability to afford education as the most critical impact, while 56% suggested a lack of access to formal education is the most critical impact. Participants also noted that in the case of countries that provide free or heavily subsidized education, the quality of education is a key concern. In addition, it was also highlighted that, in many instances, where education is both accessible and affordable, increased household and care burden on girls in HIV-affected households compromises their ability to reinforce what is learned in school through homework. www.hivapcop.org 6 Health A large majority of respondents identified drops in levels of healthcare seeking and the (in)affordability of healthcare as the most critical health related impacts of HIV on women and girls in Asia and the Pacific (71% and 76%, respectively). A slightly smaller majority identified increased discrimination in healthcare settings (66%) and reduced accessibility to treatment and care facilities (63%) as the most critical health-related impacts. Participants noted the interconnectedness of these critical impacts and highlighted how they can operate to reinforce each other and, consequently, encroach on women and girls\u2019 rights to lead healthy, functional lives. For example, discrimination in healthcare settings (and the threat of physical/non-physical violence in social settings) contributes to disincentivising treatment-seeking behaviour. Equally, inaccessibility of treatment and care facilities increases costs of seeking healthcare and, consequently, contributes towards making treatment and care unaffordable. Stigma & Discrimination A large majority of respondents identified increased discrimination in healthcare, community and occupational settings as the most critical stigma and discrimination-related impact of HIV on women and girls in Asia and the Pacific (78%). A relatively smaller majority identified increased discrimination in service delivery (68%); increased discrimination by law enforcement and judicial agencies (68%); and increased discrimination within legislative and policy- making frameworks (61%) as the critical impacts. Participants stressed the need to acknowledge that families are often key sites where women and girls experience discrimination, while calling for greater redress (through legislative reform and more proactive enforcement) for women in instances of sexual assault, domestic violence and other forms of gender- based violence. Household Burden A large majority of participants identified increased care-giving burden (83%); increased economic burden (especially as heads of households) (83%); and an increase in household labour (81%) as the most critical household burden related impacts of HIV on women and girls in Asia and the Pacific. Participants suggested that social protection schemes and strategies might be the most effective way of mitigating the disproportionate increase in household burden experienced by women and girls living with/affected by HIV. \u201c the economic impacts vary considerably between different countries, and depend on national expectations and legislation surrounding women\u2019s ability/right to economic performance. there are some very practical changes that need to take place which overtly discriminate against women\u2019s entry into the business and financial arenas whether at local or larger scale levels. In Indonesia, for example, married women need their husband\u2019s authorisation to open a bank account. Such practices are reinforced by national processes, e.g. the national census assumes that a male is the \u2018head\u2019 of a household and the main income earner. anonyMouS (SuRVey ContRIbutIon) The Socio-economic Impact of HIV on Women and Girls 7 General Observations from the E-discussion Mitigating the Socio-Economic Impacts of HIV on Women and Girls - HIV-Sensitive Social Protection While participants identified several distinct but mutually reinforcing pillars of effective social protection strategies, there was a consensus that social protection is a framework for putting in place comprehensive policies and programmes to protect poor and marginalized individuals and groups from socio-economic shocks.

Impact Mitigation Several participants highlight that conditional/unconditional cash transfer programmes, in addition to providing subsidized access to essential goods and services, can be instrumental in alleviating the economic impact of HIV on households in general, and women and girls, in particular. It was argued that, \u201cThe most obvious benefit of cash transfers for HIV outcomes is in the area of providing care and support; that is helping vulnerable households and individuals to withstand the economic impacts of AIDS. Since care and support for people living with HIV and HIV-affected households is disproportionately the responsibility of women and girls (often elderly women and/or young girls), this alone has a positive impact for women and girls. It is also very important because it can protect the already poor households from slipping further into destitution that can result from HIV related health expenditure as well as from stigma and discrimination. HIV related stigma and discrimination affects people living with HIV and poor HIV-affected households by loss of jobs, lack of access to prevention and treatment services and lack of access to poverty reduction and other impact mitigation programmes\u201d. Participants also provided successful instances of countries where such programmes are already in place, either in to or have been adapted to bring women and girls living with/affected by HIV under their ambit. A government widow pension scheme in Rajasthan, India, which was reformed to cover women \u2013 regardless of their age \u2013 whose husbands died of HIV, was identified as having benefited more than 20,000 women. Similarly, in the Philippines (where the large scale of female migration for employment overseas, accentuates the loss of employment/income generation opportunity following a positive diagnosis) conditional cash transfer programmes (to support, nutrition, healthcare and children\u2019s education) are the cornerstones of the country\u2019s social protection architecture. In Sri Lanka, however, while there is a monthly stipend available to households with disabled members in the family, the provision does not cover households headed by positive women. \u201c ownership of business or farms is another place where women have very little control. Many women in households give all they have to the family business/farm and make a substantial contribution towards it yet they do not have any legal authority and this can be crippling. anonyMouS (SuRVey ContRIbutIon) The Socio-economic Impact of HIV on Women and Girls 9 Food & Nutrition Key Impacts There was consensus among participants that guaranteeing nutrition and food security is fundamental to reducing HIV\u2019s impact on households and especially on women. It was pointed out that women living with/affected by HIV can be affected by food and nutritional issues in two separate ways. Firstly, diminution in household income combined with an increase in care-giving responsibilities for women with family members with HIV contribute to reducing the time spent in food preparation, as well as the nutritional value in the food consumed by HIV- affected households. Secondly, participants also noted, that in several countries in the Asia and Pacific, gender inequalities in the preparation and allocation of food within the household continued to be rigidly followed. Males and boys are served their meals before women and girls eat; this, more often than not, results in an unequal allocation of, if not food, then nutrition. Impact Mitigation Participants also shared their knowledge of food support initiatives in some countries. In the Philippines, the 4Ps (Pantawid Pamilyang Philipino Program) conditional cash transfer programme allocates a certain amount of cash (Php 6,000 annually) to poor households to supplement their nutrition intake. In India, recent legislative reforms in various states have made provisions for PLHIV to have subsidized access to food, nutritional supplements and other essential commodities.

It was pointed out, for example, that providing food support to households does not imply ensuring a gender equitable access to the support by all members of the household. A pioneering WFP initiative in Zambia, where electronic food vouchers are provided to affected households to be expended at the local shop of their choice was also shared. This mechanism, albeit dependent on the presence of functioning markets, has the twin advantages of allowing households to collect food rations at their convenience and attenuating the stigma attached to food collection. Participants, reflecting sentiments from their ground level interactions with positive networks, seemed to suggest that while governments have made the free provision of ARVs and HIV-related treatment services to PLHIV a key priority, providing nutritional guarantees, specifically, to HIV-affected households has become a marginalized area of concern; as such, nutrition is left to the affected www.hivapcop.org 10 households \u2013 already crippled by HIV-related employment and income loss \u2013 to manage for themselves. It is clear that inadequate attention to nutrition not only compromises the effectiveness and efficacy of unemployment/income loss insurance, but also locals PLHIV and affected women/girls in a vicious cycle while low nutrition feeds back to low productivity and low income and back to low nutrition. Thus, in absence of supplementary nutritional support, the sustainability of employment and income support programmes is compromised. Health Key Impacts Participants agreed that while conspicuous advances had been made in extending free ARV/ART to affected populations, the impact of HIV on household health and, especially, on the health of women and girls living with/affected by HIV remained disproportionately large. Inequalities in existing health support structures were attributed to a combination of coverage, extensiveness, accessibility, affordability and quality-related issues in publicly provided (sexual and reproductive) health services). Several participants, across countries, reported a rural-urban divide in women\u2019s access to health (sexual, reproductive and HIV-related) services. A lack of decentralization in medical care provision artificially inflates cost of treatment, as does the lack of financial support for PLHIV to deal with opportunistic infections. These costs can comprise a disproportionately large component of household expenditures for affected households, especially those struggling with employment/income loss. Further, it also compromises women\u2019s access to healthcare, as their lack of control over household finances makes them dependent on male heads of household, who often \u2013 following tradition, especially in rural communities \u2013 deprioritise sexual and reproductive health concerns. Participants also identified stigma (both general social stigma and institutionalized discrimination within the health sector) as a key impediment to women\u2019s (especially those living with/affected by HIV) access to health services. While the potential for being stigmatized in society can disincentivise access to health services due to a fear of disclosure of positive status, institutional discrimination in health care settings can impose significant physical and psycho-social burdens on women in need of care. Impact Mitigation Philippines was singled out as a country having made significant strides in reducing the burden of HIV-related healthcare costs, as well as mitigating \u201c We know that social protection programmes only are not sufficient but need to be coupled with sound macroeconomic policy, good governance and access to basic education and health care for all so that it helps to sustain the already achieved economic gains and further contribute to human development in Papua new guinea.

Accordingly, this section consolidates the discussions about the positive impact of social protection in reducing the psycho-social impact \u2013 manifested as internal stigma \u2013 of HIV/AIDS on people living with or affected by it. Impact Mitigation As noted earlier, participants suggested that the lack of employment or income not only has a negative impact on the economic circumstances of WLHIV, but also contributes to an erosion in their sense of self worth arising out of a palpable sense of loss of agency. Further, in middle and low income societies, capacity constraints imply that psycho-social support for WLHIV to enable them to cope with this discrimination in self-worth is scarce. In addition, it was highlighted that the problem is exacerbated by the erosion of family networks in erstwhile traditional societies (i.e., by the gradual supplanting of \u2018families\u2019 by \u2018households\u2019). As such, social support systems, especially in the economic domain, have the dual purpose of enhancing economic well-being and enabling WLHIV to maintain their rights to functionally fulfilling and dignified lives. www.hivapcop.org 12 Other Concerns and Issues Raised by Contributors Ensuring sustainability, reachability, ability to target and ability to circumvent capacity constraints in middle and low income countries, was repeatedly highlighted. One participant pointed out \u2013 based on local experiences with social support schemes in Cambodia \u2013 that rapid interventionist models of social protection are not effective as they are not sustainable, extensive in their coverage or adequately cognizant of the local environment. Another general aspect of the discussion on social protection centered around monitoring mechanisms in place to access, review and revisit existing social protection strategies and schemes. There was a clear consensus for the need to develop harmonized indicators that lend themselves to comparative analysis, while measuring and monitoring the effectiveness of current social support interventions against uniform and consistent benchmarks. However, participants noted that such indicators might fail to capture broader, long term goals of particular social protection programmes, as well as the complexity of socio-economic realities lived out at the grassroots level. As such, there is a need to supplement the development of indicators with the practice of sharing best practices from work on the ground. The e-discussion also highlighted the need to incorporate existing community and family structures, as well as networks, to improve the design and diversity of targeted social support. Participants pointed out that this will enable social protection schemes to harness the local knowledge (that is inherent in communities and networks), and empower communities and families to be resilient to socio-economic shocks. An example of this form of partnership is found in Fiji. Here, UNDP, through its Fiji National AIDS Spending Assessment Project, added a component whereby financial assistance was provided to a civil society organization (FJN+), whose members included people living with HIV/AIDS, to develop an advocacy communication and implementation strategy. However, while this approach is promising in general, its applicability to HIV-related social protection is relatively more limited. Unless attitudinal change that challenges socially entrenched gender inequalities and stigma against HIV is first fostered, depending on community/family networks to deliver support, this might exacerbate gender- based inequalities in access to social support. As such, with respect to HIV-based social support, there is still a need to maintain independently and professionally manned referral systems to guarantee unstigmatised access to social protection for women and girls. \u201c one of the most pernicious forms of discrimination is the perpetuation of beliefs and attitudes which reinforce gender stereotypes and gender inequalities of both women and men, particularly in healthcare settings related to sexual and reproductive health. anonyMouS (SuRVey ContRIbutIon) The Socio-economic Impact of HIV on Women and Girls 13 That said, participants were concerned that attitudinal change within family and community (\u201cstrengthening the family core\u201d, for instance) was critical to the sustainability of social protection initiatives.

Ensure \u2013 in the context where social protection schemes are universal \u2013 that HIV-affected populations, especially women and girls, have full and complete access to their entitlements. Design and deliver mitigation programmes that distribute social protection resources equitably to women and girls in HIV-affected households; equally, strategies to build capacity for socio-economic resilience must be cognizant of the gender specific socio-economic impact of HIV on women and girls. Incorporate cash transfer (conditional or otherwise) components within existing and new social protection schemes to mitigate the impact of socio- economic shocks and ensure women and girls affected and impacted by HIV have access to them. Institute legislative reform to ensure gender equality in the ownership of economic assets (e.g. property, inheritance rights) and autonomy over economic decisions (e.g. freedom to open bank accounts without the authorization of husbands). Empower and involve representatives of affected women in the design, delivery and monitoring of relevant interventions to ensure that their real concerns are appropriately reflected and practical solutions developed. Apply a rights-based approach to all interventions, clearly articulating the role of duty bearers and rights holders and facilitating dialogue and collaboration between the two. Design, implement and enforce anti-discrimination (both gender and HIV- status based) laws in institutional settings (workplaces, schools, healthcare settings, etc.) to combat stigma; minimize the threat of HIV-related income/ employment loss; and improve women\u2019s access to social protection, healthcare and psychosocial services. Expand scope of mitigation policies and programmes, from a piecemeal structure, to address the various dimensions of socio-economic impact of HIV (on employment/income, nutrition, healthcare, education and household burden). The Socio-economic Impact of HIV on Women and Girls 15 Incorporate ground level resources (existing community structures, positive networks) to leverage on local knowledge in order to design and deliver better targeted, more accessible socio-economic interventions with high coverage quotients. Build multi-sectoral partnerships to circumvent financial and capacity constraints in the delivery of social protection services. Develop harmonized indicators to monitor, review and audit mitigation schemes on a constant, consistent basis.

To this end, the Commission focuses on some of the most challenging legal and human rights issues in the context of HIV. These may include: (1) laws and practices that effectively criminalise people living with and vulnerable to HIV; (2) laws and practices that mitigate or sustain violence and discrimination as lived by women; and (3) laws and practices that facilitate or impede treatment access. Building on the UNAIDS Outcome Framework 2009-2011, the work of the Commission is constructed along three mutually reinforcing axes \u2013 findings and recommendations, a Technical Advisory Group to help generate and build consensus around the evidence base, and Regional Dialogues to ensure participation and inclusion of affected communities and law and policy makers. In order to learn from individuals, communities, policy and law makers and law enforcement agencies in the region, the Commission hosted a regional dialogue in Asia and the Pacific on 16 and 17 February 2011. It gave a chance to those profoundly and directly impacted by and vulnerable to HIV, including those whose voices are silenced by restrictive legal environment, to be heard. Over 22 countries from the region including 6 from the Pacific attended the Commission. This e-discussion conducted on the Asia Pacific Community of Practice on HIV, Gender, and Human Rights (HIV-APCoP) built on the regional dialogue of the Commission on HIV and the Law1. The discussion titled, HIV and the Law gave an opportunity for network members to participate and inform the Global Commission on HIV and the Law. The discussion ran from 17 February to 11 March 2011. We received over 30 contributions from regional and national civil society organizations, public health departments, parliamentarians, academic institutions and UN staff in the Asia Pacific region. We also received from Solution Exchange AIDS Community \u2013 India, a summary report of a national e-discussion linked to the Global Commission on HIV and the Law, which took place in December 2010. The content of this report includes key points raised by the e-discussion in India. 1 The HIV-APCoP is an interactive knowledge network jointly established by UNDP, UNAIDS, UN Women, UNOHCHR and Asia Pacific Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS (APN+) 2 www.hivapcop.org Message from the Guest Moderator Dame Carol Kidu Minister for Community Development, Papua New Guinea The Global Commission on HIV and the Law was launched in June 2010 to develop actionable, evidence-informed and human rights-based recommendations for effective HIV responses that promote and protect the human rights of people living with and most vulnerable to HIV. The work of the Commission is constructed along three mutually reinforcing axes including findings and recommendations, a Technical Advisory Group to help generate and build consensus around the evidence base, and Regional Dialogues to ensure participation and inclusion of affected communities and law and policy makers. Needless to say, laws and policies can have a profound impact on our lives, especially those living with HIV. It can enhance access to life saving treatment, support the prevention of mother to child transmission, and protect people living with HIV from discriminatory practices. It can also play a pivotal role in bringing marginalized groups to the mainstream so that they can freely access prevention, treatment and care services. However, despite significant work done in the Asia and Pacific region to provide a conducive legal environment to mitigate the causes and consequences of HIV, reports from the Commission on AIDS in Asia and the Commission on AIDS in the Pacific note that punitive laws and criminalization related to most at risk groups are a major challenge to effective HIV responses in the region. Submissions made to the Global Commission on HIV and the Law, in the context of the Asia Pacific Regional Dialogue, highlight the plight of women and girls living with HIV, due to laws that criminalize people and practices, inadequate enforcement of existing laws, proactive discrimination against them by law enforcement officials, and inadequate legal protection for their social, economic and human rights.

The discussion will run for 3 weeks and will focus on the key areas outlined by the Commission, as they relate to women and girls. They will include: i) Laws and practices that effectively criminalize people living with and vulnerable to HIV; ii) Laws and practices that mitigate or sustain violence and discrimination as lived by women; and iii) Laws and practices that facilitate or impede treatment access.

The findings from the e-discussion are summarised below. Summary of Responses to Questions Part 1: Laws and Practices that effectively criminalise people living with and vulnerable to HIV (a) How can multi-stakeholder partnerships (involving governments, civil society groups and those living with or vulnerable to HIV) be formed and sustained to enact rights- based legislation and repeal discriminatory laws? (b) What steps can be taken to prevent women living with or vulnerable to HIV from falling victims to a discretionary application of such laws? There was a clear consensus among participants that a reform of the legal framework, to enshrine a rights based approach to law, in several countries was urgently needed. It was also emphasised that the success of legal reform depended critically on the ability of the executive and judicial wings of the government to enforce these laws. Acknowledging that identifying discriminatory policies and practices constituted a key first step on the road to legal reform, participants identified several instances of discrimination against women living with or vulnerable to HIV in their respective countries. These are summarised below. \u2022\ufffd In many countries in the region, there is no dedicated legislation to protect the rights of people living with HIV. Where such legislation exists (for example, the HAMP act in PNG), awareness of it is limited, even among law enforcement officers.

We will be very grateful for the support of members of this community and would welcome any advice you may have on how we should address the issue. - Dean Lewis, ANPUD interests of female sex workers. On account of these laws, female sex workers fail to put their children through formal education systems; are forced to move the practise of their profession under ground; and, are vulnerable to systematic and routine abuse by law enforcement officers. In Sri Lanka, for example, while involvement in sex work is a criminal offence for female sex workers, brokers, traffickers and clients alike, it is the female sex workers who bear the brunt of law enforcement. \u2022\ufffd In some countries in the region, including Malaysia and PNG, there is inadequate legal recognition of the rights of transgender persons and ineffective legal protection against abuse and harassment. Often, the harassment is perpetrated by law enforcement officials themselves; to make matters worse, traditional religious beliefs can contribute to maintaining a social environment that is overtly hostile towards and alienates transgender identities. \u2022\ufffd In many countries of the region, law enforcement officers routinely and systematically enforce a version of the law that derives from social conventions and personal moral codes, and which bears little resemblance to the actual civil and criminal code of the land. Such extra-legal practices that consequence in the harassment and abuse of marginalised sections of society \u2013 including FSWs and transgender persons \u2013 are sustained by, both, social mores against certain groups of people and practices, as well as by a blatant lack of awareness among ordinary people and law enforcement officers alike about constitutionally guaranteed rights and remedies. More importantly, this highlights how legal reform can be irrelevant unless it is complemented by increased awareness and attitude change at the social grassroot level. Based on the problems discussed above, participants made the following recommendations while identifying key corrective initiatives that have been/are being undertaken. \u2022\ufffd Intensification of efforts by civil society organisations, in partnerships with lawyers\u2019 organisations, community leaders and victims to enhance the information available at grassroots level about the legal and constitutional guarantees available to marginalised and stigmatised groups and foster mindset change. \u2022\ufffd Sensitisation programmes for legislators and law enforcement officials modelled along the lines of UNDP\u2019s newly instituted cross-practice programming; such initiatives include induction programmes for parliamentarians, which integrate MDG- related information and emphasise the role that can be played by ministries and government departments in enhancing awareness of HIV-related legislation within the private sector. A key feature of cross-practice programming is the emphasis laid on multi-stakeholder participation, including CSOs, NGOs and community leaders. Experiences shared by the Indian police, with organisations like \u2018Disha\u2019 and the Society for Community Interventions and Research (SCIR), show how strong leadership, will and partnership can build an environment where law enforcers can act as \u201cchange agents\u201d in favourably influencing social attitudes towards drug users and sex workers. \u2022\ufffd Systematic and comprehensive national level audits of legal statutes and procedures needs to be undertaken throughout the region to identify gaps in the legal environment. A UNAIDS initiative, entitled \u2018Making the Law Work for the HIV Response\u2019, 6 www.hivapcop.org\u201d We from the Tonga Leitis\u2019 Association are proud to say that we fully support the cause and may God be praise with all our work. - Joey Joleen Siosaia W.C.A Mataele, Pacific Sexual Diversity Network/ Tonga Leitis\u2019 Association www.hivapcop.org 7 is a crucial step in the right direction as it provides a quick and comprehensive guide to laws in various countries that support/hinder universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support, as well as serving as a baseline against which progress towards an enabling legal environment can be measured. \u2022\ufffd Close cooperation between donor agencies and recipient countries is essential to draw up testing targets and institutional mandatory protocols governing testing/ counselling procedures in order to reduce the harassment of FSWs, among other MARPs, and the incidence of forced testing. In addition, a monitoring mechanism must be established to ensure compliance by various national HIV organisations across the region.

There was a consensus among participants that while formal legal reform is a necessary component of any intervention against Gender Based Violence (GBV), the efficacy of such reform is contingent on the degree to which it is supplemented by informal but extensive social/cultural reform. Participants, especially from societies where Violence against Women (VAW) is endemic, suggested that it is sustained, primarily, by social and cultural norms that perpetuate gender inequities in access to social and economic resources and pressure the male monopoly over socio-economic decision-making at the level of the family and the community. The role played by social institutions in maintaining this inequitable social order was also highlighted (for instance, it was pointed out that several churches in PNG still deny women the privilege of leading church services). In this context, participants reiterated the pressing need for social reform to precede legal reform in order that laws against VAW or GBV are fully internalized at the level of the community. In addition, this internalization is crucial to effective enforcement of laws. Specifically, the following obstacles to statutory reform and effective law enforcement were identified. \u2022\ufffd In many societies in Asia and the Pacific, there is no conception, at the grassroots level, that individuals \u2013 regardless of their gender or their standing on other indicators of socio-economic status \u2013 have basic, inalienable human rights. In such societies, the move towards rights based advocacy against VAW might be, at best, ineffective, and, at worst, counterproductive. For example, a Bangladesh-based participant mentioned that the general population is substantially more sympathetic towards the plight of female sex workers when they are portrayed as \u201cpoor and vulnerable and victims of violence\u201d than when they were \u201cput on a platform to speak\u201d. \u2022\ufffd Relatedly, the notions of GBV and VAW are conceptually intractable for many living in societies that are organised along traditional beliefs. As noted by a PNG participant, this leads to an inability among ordinary citizens, lawmakers and law enforcement officials alike, to internalise the idea that GBV and VAW violate the basic rights of women. Rampant illiteracy, especially at the village level exacerbates the problem by making it harder for CSOs, NGOs and FBOs to communicate effectively with ordinary people about GBV and VAW. This, in turn, neutralises the effect of anti-GBV legislation and reduces the intensity of efforts directed at combating GBV. If there is continued failure to implant values that denormalise GBV, legislation, by itself, will only have nominal impact since \u201cif laws do not mean anything to us, we will not observe them\u201d. \u2022\ufffd Participants identified the multiplicity of agendas as a third impediment to effective legal reform and law enforcement. Especially in the context of Bangladesh, but generalisable to other developing countries in the region, it was pointed out that a medley of social and economic problems compete for limited resources. This has the result of relegating legal reform down the order of socio-economic priorities. Similarly, the presence of multiple disadvantaged groups pressing for group-specific privileges contributes towards diluting the need for women\u2019s rights to be recognized and protected. Based on the problems discussed above, participants made the following recommendations. \u2022\ufffd There must be a clear acknowledgment that social reform to address inequitable gender structures in society is key to ensuring the success of legal reform and the effectiveness of law enforcement. In the context of VAW, intervention to denormalise GBV are critical and urgent. These interventions must be designed to make them conceptually accessible to ordinary people at the village level. Further, in order to give them the requisite legitimacy, community leaders must be actively engaged. Examples of such primary prevention strategies include the involvement of \u2018Village Facilitators\u2019 in UNDP\u2019s Cambodia Programme to conduct community level conversations on GBV with the primary intention of challenging the normalisation of domestic violence as a private family matter. Attitude change can also be fostered by installing women as community leaders and insisting on model behaviour from holders of public office. For example, a participant from PNG suggested legal reform to bar bigamous/ polygamous men from law holding positions as legislators, ministers, judges or law enforcement officers. \u2022\ufffd There is a need for scaling up lobbying activity to ensure that legal and social reform to safeguard the rights of women (especially against violence) remains high on the list of government priorities. Civil society groups can play an important role in this regard. However, sustainable progress to eliminate GBV depends ultimately on the ability of a", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "46fbf9b2-5d7a-446b-b3f2-a3652d680aa1": {"__data__": {"id_": "46fbf9b2-5d7a-446b-b3f2-a3652d680aa1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-apcop-summary-ediscussion-hiv-and-law", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV-APCoP Summary of Ediscussion on HIV and the Law", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-apcop-summary-ediscussion-hiv-and-law", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9029923910f5800fb4d67d93d2b5c8b77198479c4695630445273772dacd8526"}, "3": {"node_id": "0e3b3a40-cecc-4775-8d38-8c5fb1c78c7a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-apcop-summary-ediscussion-hiv-and-law", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6eaabeabe12a66e32550df58b6f9710268489b01981acc13293d51e9529b26d2"}}, "hash": "04dfe5e751979649ead4822e4161ed26b91ab3240a9d035091ca148b8c385fd3", "text": "society to make advances on other development objectives, as enshrined in the MDGs. \u2022\ufffd Easy and clear provision of legal aid to women who are victims of violence can play a key role in establishing a credible deterrent to GBV.

Similarly, a UNDP 8 www.hivapcop.org www.hivapcop.org 9 initiative in Nepal targeted at improving awareness among women of remedies available against GBV and the procedural aspects of seeking them. \u2022\ufffd Sensitisation of front line personnel (police officers, for example) is of critical importance in improving law enforcement related practices in the context of GBV. An example of a first step towards developing effective sensitisation techniques is a UNDP supported Baseline Study of the Royal PNG Constabulary that aims to develop an effective training curriculum based on the institution\u2019s current responses to GBV, as well as the attitudes of its individual members.

Participants were unanimous in the view that the greatest obstacles to testing/treatment access are constituted by extra legal behaviour by law enforcement agencies, who impose \u201ctheir own conceptions of morality\u201d on women living with or vulnerable to HIV; by a general social stigma, especially, against HIV and sex work; and laws that push risky behaviour underground by criminalising them, either explicitly or implicitly. In addition, participants agreed that women\u2019s resilience against actual and potential legal and extra-legal exploitation depends to a great extent on their empowerment. This, in turn, depends on guaranteeing their equitable economic rights (especially, with regard to employment, inheritance and property); enhancing their awareness of existing legal provisions; and enabling their access to legal redress. However, in several countries, inheritance and property rights retain a distinctive gender bias. Further, women in many instances are neither aware of their legal rights (as PLHIV or sex workers or victims of VAW), nor have the means to seek recourse to the law. In this context, participants identified the key impediments to equitable treatment of women living with/vulnerable to HIV to include: \u2022\ufffd Existing\ufffdprovisions\ufffdin\ufffdthe\ufffdlaw\ufffdthat\ufffdcompromise\ufffdthe\ufffdability\ufffdof\ufffdFSWs\ufffdto\ufffdbe\ufffdempowered:\ufffd A participant highlighted the Indian Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act (ITPA), whose provisions severely compromise FSWs\u2019 ability to negotiate safe, dignified and productive lives and place them at a disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis the law. The provisions of the act include the criminalisation of brothels (which might prevent FSWs from forming a collective organisation); of the \u2018earnings\u2019 of sex workers; of prostitution \u201d ... your inputs will greatly help the work of the Commission on HIV and Law.

Based on the problems discussed above, participants made the following recommendations: \u2022\ufffd There is an urgent need to review testing/counselling and treatment practices in all countries around the region in order to identify laws, policies and practices that violate the rights of women living with/vulnerable to HIV. Participants suggested audits along the lines of the UNAIDS \u2018Snapshot\u2019 programme to identify where and how HIV programming leads to routine and systematic rights violations. It might be desirable to have a HIV programming framework where donor agencies might require receiving countries to comply with universally accepted testing protocols by providing statutory guarantees to protect the same. \u2022\ufffd Collective efforts by CSOs, lawyers and legislators are urgently needed to lobby for the amendment/repeal of existing legal provisions that discriminate against or criminalise female \u2018most at risk\u2019 populations (like FSWs). While legal reform might not be sufficient to ensuring that these populations are not stigmatised, discriminated against or exploited, it is a critical and desirable first step. In this context, the filing of a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in India against the provisions of the Indian ITP Act on the behalf of FSWs by an NGO, with the backing of the \u2018Lawyers Collective\u2019, can be considered as an achievement and as a step in the right direction. www.hivapcop.org 11 \u2022\ufffd Greater involvement of the government and the public section in HIV (and GBV) related advocacy is required. Participants suggested that there needs to be a mindset change within the public sector that HIV related advocacy is the sole responsibility of the non- state sector. In support of this view, participants provided examples of how strong political leadership can function as a catalyst for changing, both, discriminatory social attitudes and legal frameworks. It was also suggested that formal mechanisms and platforms should be established to facilitate periodic exchange of information about gaps and best practices in law-based HIV intervention strategies between the public and the NGO/FBO sector. Final Note Throughout the discussion, it clearly emerged that law-related responses to HIV is not limited to the domain of legislation and law enforcement. While legal reform and improvements in law enforcement might be necessary conditions for ensuring that the rights of women and girls living with/vulnerable to HIV are recognised and protected, they will remain incomplete without complementary change in social attitudes towards marginalised groups of people and their practices. Thus, the sustainability of a move towards rights based legal climates is contingent on the degree to which the notion of \u2018human rights\u2019 is internalised by populations living in societies that are organised on the basis of traditional codes. Accordingly, participants recommended legal and procedural audits to identify laws that criminalise marginalised populations and their practices (FSWs, female drug users, transgender persons and women living with HIV/AIDS); multi-stakeholder cooperative mechanisms to share best practice information and catalyse mindset changes; training and sensitisation programmes for lawmakers and enforcers to eliminate or reduce the potential for extra-legal abuse of women; establishment of standard operating HIV testing and counselling procedures for FSWs/female drug users backed by statutory guarantees and compliance monitoring mechanisms; and, dissemination of information on HIV related legislation and legal resource available to victims of discrimination, abuse and GBV at the grassroots level. Finally, the e-discussion provided an invaluable platform for bringing participants up to date with recent initiatives and developments on law and HIV and sharing information on general and country specific information on gaps in the legal infrastructure and best practices in legal reform. As such, it unlocks potential for future collaboration between individuals and institutions for related research, expertise sharing and cooperation in moving towards more just, equitable and inclusive legal systems based on a recognition of human rights. 12 www.hivapcop.org References UNAIDS (2008) Addressing HIV Related Law at the National Level http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/documents/priorities/2008_ GuidanceNoteLaw_en.pdf UNAIDS (2006) Courting Rights: Case Studies in Litigating the Human Rights of People Living with HIV.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9fb82714-c444-4d8b-a4b2-83e99ff3d38c": {"__data__": {"id_": "9fb82714-c444-4d8b-a4b2-83e99ff3d38c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-apcop-summary-ediscussion-hiv-and-law", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV-APCoP Summary of Ediscussion on HIV and the Law", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-apcop-summary-ediscussion-hiv-and-law", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "54210b3a273e769cb4a90060a85729d2e36677606498a0e9205fa71607d1fd4e"}, "2": {"node_id": "321a319b-e21b-45a6-898a-a3043531d90f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-apcop-summary-ediscussion-hiv-and-law", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0ac1b7a439f37e0c5fbee7d560dbdd33e47cf62a0998bfdd7ae0828ae446201f"}}, "hash": "5d05c62f263f5179717daefa044394ee67de2faa4d6fcc569dc5666e63abf1b8", "text": "Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/dataimport/publications/irc-pub07/ jc1189-courtingrights_en.pdf www.hivapcop.org 13 How can the HIV-APCoP help you? \u2022\ufffd Provide access to important publications, presentations, tools, and other materials. \u2022\ufffd Provide access to emerging and good practices across the region. \u2022\ufffd Provide information on upcoming events related to HIV, gender, and human rights in the region. \u2022\ufffd Provide peer-review for your studies and guidance to resources under development. \u2022\ufffd Link you to professionals working on issues related to HIV, gender, and human rights. \u2022\ufffd Provide technical advice on specific queries.

Photos by Reuters Summary of E-discussion; Progress on MDG 3 and 6 Women and girls living with HIV in Asia and the Pacific Introduction In 2010 the UNAIDS Action Framework for Women and Girls Living with HIV tasked the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to create and support a process by which national-level networks and organizations of women living with HIV could assess their region\u2019s progress on achieving Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 3 (Promote Gender Equality and Empower Women) and MDG 6 (Combat HIV, Malaria, and other diseases). In response to this request, UNDP conducted consultations with women affected by HIV in India, Papua New Guinea (PNG), and the Philippines. A total of 135 HIV-positive women (70 in India, 35 in PNG, and 30 in the Philippines) were consulted over a period of 30 days. The consultations were followed by an e-discussion with members of the Asia Pacific Community of Practice on HIV, Gender, and Human Rights (HIV-APCoP) \u2013 an interactive and dynamic knowledge network jointly established by UNDP, UNAIDS, UN Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNOHCHR), and APN+ (a network of people living with HIV in the Asia-Pacific region) in response to the challenges faced by the Asia-Pacific countries regarding HIV, gender, and human rights. The discussion \u2013 titled \u201cProgress to MDG 3 and MDG 6: Women and Girls Living with HIV in Asia and Pacific\u201d \u2013 was designed to share the findings of the consultations with HIV-APCoP members. Based on the feedback received from the 135 HIV-positive women, the discussion was divided into three parts: 1. issues of advocacy, stigma, and discrimination; 2. access to health, antiretroviral drugs (ARVs), and harm reduction technologies; and 3. providing a conducive legal environment, particularly vis-\u00e0-vis violence against women. The discussion ran from 11 August 2010 to 3 September 2011. In total, 27 responses were received from 10 countries: Australia, Cambodia, Fiji, India, Nepal, PNG, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and the USA. Contributions were received from civil servants, civil society organizations, UN agencies, and academia. This booklet is a summary of that discussion. 2 www.hivapcop.org www.hivapcop.org 3 Message from the Guest Moderator Dr. Noeleen Heyzer Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations and Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) The numbers of new HIV infections annually in the Asia-Pacific have stabilized, yet HIV infections among women are on the increase. Of all HIV-positive people in the region, the proportion of women living with HIV rose from 19 percent in 2000 to 35 percent in 2008. Similarly, prenatal transmission continues to rise, accounting for 5.1 percent of new infections in the Pacific in 2005. The impact of HIV on women and girls is experienced more severely compared to male counterparts. Structural gender inequalities work to the detriment of women and girls, increasing their vulnerability to both the causes and consequences of HIV. A number of reinforcing factors place women in \u201cdouble jeopardy\u201d regarding their higher infection rates and greater impact of living with HIV. These include: \u2022\ufffd Harmful norms and practices affecting women and girls, including stigma and discrimination \u2022\ufffd Violence against women \u2022\ufffd Barriers in achieving economic security \u2022\ufffd Barriers in receiving education \u2022\ufffd Barriers in access to services and information \u2022\ufffd The great burden of social care carried by women The key to tackling these issues effectively is the translation of global commitments to MDG 3 on Gender Equality and Women\u2019s Empowerment and MDG 6 on HIV, Malaria, and other Diseases into real change for women and girls in Asia and the Pacific.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "88c770a2-b43c-455b-8d5a-7f8b3209c641": {"__data__": {"id_": "88c770a2-b43c-455b-8d5a-7f8b3209c641", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-apcop-summary-ediscussion-progress-mdg-3-and-6-women-and-girls-living-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV-APCoP Summary of Ediscussion on Progress on MDG 3 and 6 Women and girls living with HIV in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-apcop-summary-ediscussion-progress-mdg-3-and-6-women-and-girls-living-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ece79363d42220ea4dacd7303a9418f3bab22626ff10e0f2db39a632a00434bf"}, "2": {"node_id": "3943908f-08b3-445a-8a63-c7501d389a0a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-apcop-summary-ediscussion-progress-mdg-3-and-6-women-and-girls-living-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b1c897605a6b83a5d6cc465b9e13153a341ee4ba29e007a6672016f4979db5e"}}, "hash": "625c0989b4413014b1ddd7192405a7eeded5975c529171f72870b8e0c3e31524", "text": "The UN system is united in its commitment to this goal, and is working with stakeholders across the region to end the gender inequalities that collectively are the primary driver of the HIV epidemic and the associated heavy cost to women.

Together we can make a real difference in the prospects of women and girls living with the threat and effects of HIV across our region. Background In examining the situation in India, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines, a lack of institutionalized mechanisms for the dissemination of comprehensive HIV related knowledge to school-going adolescents and youth was evident in all three countries. Participants in the UNDP consultations testified that though there was an increase in media attention to HIV-related issues, often the portrayal of those issues \u2013 for example, through the choice of images and words \u2013 represented HIV and people living with HIV (PLHIV) in a negative manner. It was also noted that the primary source of information on HIV education for women and adolescents is through peer groups and the media, and therefore often incomplete and incorrect. In terms of testing, participants from India and the Philippines pointed out that test results were often not kept confidential; on the other hand, discussants from PNG suggested that confidentiality was detrimental to their well-being, citing cases where their HIV- positive husbands had infected them by not disclosing their test results. Counselling was reported to be inadequate in all three countries, and was attributed to uninformed health care personnel and sparsely equipped health care facilities. Especially in India, but also to a large extent in rural Philippines and PNG, participants reported widespread misinformation on prevention of parent-to-child transmission (PPTCT) and prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) among health care personnel. In addition, all three countries were found to be lagging in improving women\u2019s access to prevention and harm reduction technologies. Participants reported that female contraceptives were expensive and not widely available, making them dependent on their partner\u2019s usage of condoms. Accordingly, condom usage continues to remain low as a result of social mores, the reluctance of men to use condoms; and, as the Indian participants highlighted, women\u2019s dependence on men to use condoms. More positively, ARV coverage among the participants was comprehensive. However, most women identified logistical bottlenecks in ARV delivery (including remoteness from ART centers, costs of transportation, etc). In a majority of instances, despite ARV being more readily available free of charge, costs remained high as a result of expenses incurred on account of CD4 diagnostic tests, medication for opportunistic infections, and a lack of subsidized access to nutritional supplements. 4 www.hivapcop.org www.hivapcop.org 5 On the issue of discrimination, participants from India reported that there is widespread discrimination across all aspects of social life, including health care, employment, and participation in family and community life. Echoes of similar stigmatization, though to a lesser extent, in the Philippines and PNG point to scenarios where women are denied access to basic medical and surgical care, jobs, and family and social support, and where they are discriminated against by law enforcement agencies based on their HIV status. Further, participants from both India and PNG remarked that female sex workers were systematically ill treated and abused by the police. Violence against women is another common theme that emerges from the discussions in the three countries. A large majority of the women reported having encountered, or knowing others who had encountered, forms of violence (including physical and psychological harassment and abuse) frequently and systematically. Participants revealed that violence was likely to come from within the family and, often, with a male as the perpetrator. Victims of violence rarely report such episodes and attribute their silence to the fact that law enforcement agencies are slow to take action and are most often ineffective. Violations of women\u2019s sexual and reproductive rights, which occur routinely, similarly go undocumented.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "924807ed-93ee-4402-9bfd-972cb61f0011": {"__data__": {"id_": "924807ed-93ee-4402-9bfd-972cb61f0011", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-apcop-summary-ediscussion-progress-mdg-3-and-6-women-and-girls-living-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV-APCoP Summary of Ediscussion on Progress on MDG 3 and 6 Women and girls living with HIV in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-apcop-summary-ediscussion-progress-mdg-3-and-6-women-and-girls-living-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "982d80b1041c5a8f22b443f1dadc9ac1d2e1a58bf00dff07f3ff5a542fb555b3"}, "2": {"node_id": "d3591b8b-73ab-4555-a250-cddf1632749b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-apcop-summary-ediscussion-progress-mdg-3-and-6-women-and-girls-living-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d4c902d91789a7c6b5d40952775ccce10ff3af8363d33ca68f8f397fe6d0095b"}}, "hash": "b8640a89b70c8880aefb47567a878c3f607213e108c4dcd2449bac13aa815111", "text": "Contributors The HIV-APCOP received responses from: Alka Narang, Shashi Sudhir, Ernest Noronha, and Caitlin Wiesen, UNDP India Annie McPherson, Igat Hope, PNG Aparna Basnyat, Human Rights Capacity Development Specialist Christine Stewart, Australian National University David Bridger, UNAIDS Sri Lanka and the Maldives Emma Fulu, Partners for Prevention Ferdinand Strobel, Regional HIV Practice Team for Asia Pacific, Pacific Centre Jacob Kupu, Department of National Planning & Monitoring, PNG Karabi Baruah, UNIFEM Lisa Williams-Lahari Malu Marin, ACHIEVE, Philippines Maura Elaripe, PNG-Australia HIV & AIDS Program Monica Smith, consultant Peterson Magoola, UNDP PNG Priya Nanda, International Center for Research on Women Shiba Phurailatpam, APN+ Susana", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b6f49d3c-4302-42b6-a19c-592cf4d07819": {"__data__": {"id_": "b6f49d3c-4302-42b6-a19c-592cf4d07819", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-apcop-summary-ediscussion-progress-mdg-3-and-6-women-and-girls-living-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV-APCoP Summary of Ediscussion on Progress on MDG 3 and 6 Women and girls living with HIV in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-apcop-summary-ediscussion-progress-mdg-3-and-6-women-and-girls-living-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c33e0544112f92bf36081526d1c650f1f41345a1c3d2a3abf70e5c13c94ef4b3"}, "3": {"node_id": "c519591f-115a-4723-9d4f-ace0d4545d4e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-apcop-summary-ediscussion-progress-mdg-3-and-6-women-and-girls-living-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2a895caf20d131be2a631b830871c362648e3dbbce6a3314089a59a78d3e416f"}}, "hash": "2c32eb0bf4c085179251da21a3b3be968c653a28122a33b2272eaf7480b5e071", "text": "Fried, Mandeep Dhaliwal, Deena Patel, Julia Kim, Brianna Harrison, and Brian Lutz, HIV/AIDS Practice, UNDP Jane Wilson, UNAIDS, Regional Support Team, Bangkok 6 www.hivapcop.org www.hivapcop.org 7 Part 1: Advocacy, Stigma and Discrimination a) What can we do to encourage changes in attitudes and practices that will lead to the treatment of HIV-positive women as equal participants in social life? b) How can we formulate and deliver correct, yet culturally appropriate, information to women and girls? Participants in the discussion reiterated that a life free from stigma and discrimination is the cornerstone of human dignity. It was pointed out that while stigma can manifest itself visibly \u2013 through verbal, physical, or other forms of abuse, or through the denial of employment opportunities \u2013 it can also be internalized, contributing to lower self- esteem and impeding the capacity of affected women to lead normal lives. Contributors also concurred that HIV-positive women experience stigma (and corresponding discrimination) in a wide range of social interactions \u2013 within the family and community, in the workplace, and even in health care settings. It was further agreed that sustainable measures against discrimination toward women living with/affected by HIV need to be underpinned by a rights-based approach, as well as be characterized by an increased participation of HIV-positive women in their implementation. In this context, key initiatives were identified, spanning multiple domains. \u2022\ufffd Collecting\ufffdstigma\ufffdrelated\ufffdinformation: It was suggested that informational gaps in our understanding of stigma (of how it is caused, what it is constituted by, what its consequences are, how extensive it is in particular societies, etc.) be urgently addressed. The Stigma Index Report in Sri Lanka and the UNDP-India study on levels of stigma are examples of such measures that need to be reproduced more widely and frequently. Evidence on the correlation between discrimination and the levels of new infection must be generated. Not only will this allow better policy design but it will also justify the scaling-up of advocacy in favour of people living with HIV. \u2022\ufffd Building\ufffdeconomic\ufffdcapacity\ufffdfor\ufffdwomen\ufffdliving\ufffdwith/affected\ufffdby\ufffdHIV: Participants agreed that economic empowerment of women living with/affected \u201c \u201d The purpose of participation reaches beyond an ethical commitment: women living with and affected by HIV are uniquely placed to assess and analyze their region\u2019s response to gender inequality and AIDS and, indeed, progress towards achieving all of the MDGs. In many cases these are women who have first-hand experience of the impact of gender inequality on HIV vulnerability, and vice versa. While statistical assessments can provide a broad overview of a country\u2019s progress, they cannot fully reveal what that progress (or lack of) means in terms of the lives of women and men in communities. Susana Fried, UNDP by HIV improves their resilience to stigma and discrimination. Expanding the coverage of micro-credit facilities as well as ensuring that women have rights to land and property can play a major role in enabling HIV- positive women to live meaningful and productive lives with dignity. Increased and equal access to economic resources can compensate for reduced opportunities for employment in the formal sector, combat the low self-esteem that results from economic discrimination, and increase the level of respect that HIV-positive women command in the community. UNDP\u2019s initiatives in India, in partnership with local banks, to increase women\u2019s access to micro-finance, as well as its efforts, in partnerships with UNAIDS, UNIFEM and IAJW, to enhance the inheritance and property rights of women living with HIV in Nepal, have been acknowledged as model initiatives. \u2022\ufffd Building\ufffdsocial\ufffdcapacity\ufffdfor\ufffdwomen\ufffdliving\ufffdwith/affect\ufffdby\ufffdHIV:\ufffd Participants identified an urgent need for equipping HIV-positive women with requisite social skills and support networks to boost their resilience against stigma and discrimination. It was argued that building the leadership potential of these women would empower them to advocate directly on matters that concern their well-being.

It is envisaged that such interventions would combat HIV-related stigma at the individual level (by building the capacity of women living with/affected by HIV to function as HIV activists and educators), the social level (by providing correct and relevant information to communities, and thereby normalizing HIV-positive status), and the policy level (by establishing platforms for cross-constituency dialogue and cooperation). Some participants noted the need to engage men and boys in particular in improving community awareness on HIV and PLHIV. Among the resources highlighted during the e-discussion were the 2009 paper by the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW), which has a comprehensive list of recommendations to combat HIV-related stigma in health care settings; ACHIEVE\u2019s initiatives in sensitizing media personnel about responsible HIV-related reporting; and a UNDP-supported initiative to sensitize police officers in Tamil Nadu, India. 8 www.hivapcop.org \u201c \u201c \u201d \u201d If the Stigma Index points to anything, it points to the need for positive living \u2013 how to live positive, productive, and full lives with HIV \u2013 in Sri Lanka.

Discussions in this section elaborated on the key bottlenecks in expanding the coverage of treatment, prevention, and harm reduction technologies as a way of identifying key areas for intervention. Contributors pointed out that effectiveness of treatment is severely hampered by the lack of comprehensive pre- and post-test counselling. Treatment services are further marred by a lack of appropriately trained personnel; concerns about breaches of confidentiality by health care workers; the potential for discrimination in health care settings; and logistical difficulties in accessing treatment centres. A lack of awareness about the role of ARVs and nutritional supplements in managing HIV was also cited as playing a part in preventing HIV-positive women from using treatment facilities. In Vietnam, for instance, some health care workers are reported to consider treatment as a waste of money on the premise that persons with HIV have no chance of survival. Inadequate financial resources were also identified in the discussions as a key impediment to sustained access to treatment technology. In terms of access to other treatment related services, participants noted that, while CD-4 testing is relatively easily available and affordable, facilities providing viral load testing and drug resistance testing are virtually inaccessible. PPTCT/PMTCT services are under utilized in many countries (Vietnam and Indonesia, for example) because women are unaware of ARV regimes that prevent vertical transmission. Participants in the e-discussion agreed that research on the impediments to universalize access of HIV-positive women to treatment related services is urgently required in several countries in order to generate baseline data (especially in the Pacific) and to gain a holistic understanding of factors that restrict access to prevention, testing, and treatment services for women in various risk categories. Consideration of the initiatives suggested here indicates the substantial degree of crossover between efforts to reduce stigma/discrimination and strategies to increase access to treatment services. \u201c \u201d Provider Initiated Counselling Testing is at times misinterpreted at the ground level by UN staff as mandatory, and people are not given the choice to opt out.

Participants suggested that a useful and insightful way of understanding the roots of gender-based violence (GBV) was by contextualizing it as an instrument that perpetuates the hegemony of the male in a patriarchal social order. It was suggested that this theoretical understanding enables an appreciation of the basis of violence and, accordingly, must inform any intervention targeted to eliminate or minimizes the incidence of the same. In response to the call for suggestions to bolster the enforcement of existing laws against GBV, it was pointed out that lawmakers and enforcers, overwhelmingly male, have little incentive to enforce laws that threaten their own privileged position within families and communities. In addition, with particular reference to PNG, the normalization of the notion of GBV \u2013 and domestic violence, in general - pushes acts of violence into the private domain. This not only silences victims of violence but also prevents concerted efforts by law enforcement agencies to act against any abuse that is reported. Another key social characteristic that sustains GBV is the economic and social dependence of women on men. As one participant put it, the woman \u201cmust not provoke the man\u201d for fear of the threat to her \u201csecurity, shelter, family\u2019s comfort, love, food, and even her life\u201d. The discussion recommended remedial steps, the major aspects of which are listed below. Nonetheless, they share an emphasis on involving men in the attempts to foster change, on the empowerment of women to sever their dependence on men, on strengthening the legal infrastructure to redress women\u2019s grievances, and on improving the enforcement of laws by sensitizing law enforcement officers through a bottom-up approach that involves communities leaders as well. Specifically, key recommendations include the following: \u2022\ufffd Provision of legal aid to women who are victims of violence plays an important role in establishing a credible deterrent to GBV. UNDP\u2019s initiatives in Cambodia to ensure women\u2019s access to grievance redressing mechanisms and the UNDP-supported establishment of Legal Aid clinics in India were highlighted as pioneering efforts.

Jacob Kupu, Department of National Planning & Monitoring, PNG 12 www.hivapcop.org \u2022\ufffd Involving communities, and especially men and boys, was identified as indispensable in catalyzing attitudinal change. These efforts, targeting the root causes of GBV, constitute what are termed \u201cprimary prevention strategies.\u201d Such strategies are seen as necessary complements to other strategic interventions, including, for example, the involvement of Village Facilitators in UNDP\u2019s Cambodia Program to conduct community-level conversations on GBV with the primary intention of challenging the normalization of domestic violence as a private family matter. Conversations about GBV provide the critical space, at the level of the community where acts of private violence can be publicly scrutinized and, hopefully, condemned. Participants in the e-discussion asserted that the success of de-normalizing GBV depends crucially on the engagement of men and boys, premising it on the thesis that males are best placed to challenge the ideologies of domination that underlie episodes of violence against women. A joint UNDP, UN Population Fund, UNIFEM, and UN Volunteers initiative, Partners for Prevention (P4P), launched in 2008, was presented as a model for a coordinated, streamlined intervention addressing the roots of GBV. P4P supports research that explores linkages between masculinity and GBV, and is used to design evidence-based responses to violence through the active involvement of men and boys in the local community. \u2022\ufffd Empowerment of women was seen as critical in the effort to lessen and even eliminate the dependencies of women on men. As highlighted in the earlier sections, empowerment is multidimensional; while economic empowerment can be ensured by developing the capacity of women to earn sustainable livelihoods and by enhancing their control over economic resources, social empowerment is constituted by providing women with platforms from which advocacy against GBV can be carried out. A third dimension focuses on ensuring that women have recourse to such support services as refuge centres, crisis hotlines, and counselling. \u2022\ufffd Sensitization of front-line personnel (police officers and medical professionals, for example) was considered to be of major importance in improving enforcement of existing laws related to GBV. One contributor highlighted UNDP\u2019s support for a Baseline Study of the Royal PNG Constabulary, which aims to develop an effective training curriculum based on the institution\u2019s current responses to GBV, as well as the attitudes of its individual members. It was noted that the baseline data would also contribute to monitoring changes in individual attitudes and institutional approaches over subsequent years. \u201c \u201c \u201d \u201d Although researchers in India have investigated and identified many of the sociocultural factors that make women vulnerable to HIV, what is still not adequately understood is a comprehensive understanding of barriers (perceived and actual) to HIV prevention, testing, and treatment services for women and girls in different settings of risk and vulnerability. Priya Nanda, International Center for Research on Women Male-dominated institutions and ideologies of male domination fuel gender-based violence, and it is essential that more men get involved in allying with women to challenge these expressions of male power. A powerful motivation for men to get so involved is that men, too, are targeted by other men\u2019s violence, as one look at the homicide statistics makes clear. Emma Fulu, Partners for Prevention www.hivapcop.org 13 Conclusion As a result of the e-discussion, a clear consensus emerged regarding the linkages between achieving progress on MDG 3 and on MDG 6. Participants acknowledged that gender inequalities and HIV transmission are locked in a vicious cycle, each feeding off the other, and in so doing exacerbating the vulnerabilities of women to HIV and compromising the ability of HIV-positive women to lead fully functional and fulfilling lives. As an indication of how closely the different dimensions of unequal power relations between men and women and HIV-positive living are intertwined, measures suggested by participants to combat HIV-related stigma included not only improved access to prevention, treatment, and harm reduction technologies but the need to eliminate incidences of GBV as well.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da34edd5-7384-47a9-a40c-b979ae95afdb": {"__data__": {"id_": "da34edd5-7384-47a9-a40c-b979ae95afdb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-apcop-summary-ediscussion-progress-mdg-3-and-6-women-and-girls-living-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV-APCoP Summary of Ediscussion on Progress on MDG 3 and 6 Women and girls living with HIV in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-apcop-summary-ediscussion-progress-mdg-3-and-6-women-and-girls-living-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e2738a5c33b149b1e2006587940f142c54e52f45f2ed7307a282be7b4c0f50f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "e456d5a4-4380-49e3-9d3b-4ded1b82e599", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-apcop-summary-ediscussion-progress-mdg-3-and-6-women-and-girls-living-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2f70383d1083b741f6ec5efeb965a6137a9de122142d9f28add0e6b3bcb703a9"}}, "hash": "8788af685704bcc00514e9f15d349fd8351a6d424b3ebca234dd160da5a01cce", "text": "Contributors proposed boosting research to generate better and more comprehensive data that could be used to foster a better understanding of the root causes of such gender inequalities and, in addition, serve as benchmarks by which the efficacy of interventions would be evaluated.

The need for a participatory methodology was also clearly revealed, as members agreed that the ability to bring about large-scale transformations in social attitudes depends crucially on the degree to which local communities (and in the case of GBV, men and boys) are involved as agents of change. Finally, the e-discussion was invaluable in bringing participants up to date with relevant literature by identifying and outlining recent studies on the subject. As such, the exercise has created the potential for future collaboration between institutions and individuals for related research, expertise sharing, and cooperation in intervention design and delivery.

The community of practice was designed based on the feedback provided from an online survey and more than 50 development practitioners who participated in the joint UNDP, UNAIDS, UNIFEM, OHCHR Regional Consultation on HIV, Human Rights and Gender held in May 2009 in Bangkok, Thailand. This interactive and dynamic moderated knowledge network is open to all UN family partners working on these issues, as well as national and local governments, key civil society organizations, academic and research institutions and networks of people living with HIV. The launch of the Community of Practice was followed by an electronic discussion on a priority issue highlighted via the needs assessment survey and the feedback given by participants at the consultation held recently. The inaugural discussion topic is titled \u201cWomen, HIV, and Intimate Partner Transmission\u201d and was moder- ated via the workspace by Dr. Nafis Sadik, the UN Special Envoy on HIV and AIDS in Asia and the Pacific. This booklet presents the consolidated response from this electronic discussion and will also feed into some of the key sessions organized at ICAAP\u201909 (the International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific). We encourage you to contribute your knowledge, insights and experience with the community and welcome your feedback and advice to make it a success. The Community of Practice on HIV, Human Rights and Gender (HIV-APCOP) serves two basic functions to achieve the goal of knowledge networking and capacity building: to connect and collect. It connects those working for and with UNDP, UNIFEM, UNAIDS and UNOHCHR with development practitioners, civil society and government partners in the region to advocate and address the issues of HIV, Human Rights, and Gender. The HIV-APCOP also collects and serves as a regional clearinghouse for resources, experiences, training tools and methods around the themes of HIV, Gender and Human Rights in Asia and the Pacific. We look forward to your active involvement and participation in this important joint Community of Practice on HIV, Human Rights and Gender.

The guest moderator of the inaugural discussion is Dr. Nafis Sadik, UN Special Envoy on HIV and AIDS in Asia and the Pacific. The 2008 Report of the Commission on AIDS in Asia illustrates the inextricable link- ages between HIV, human rights and gender. Human rights violations and gender inequality are fuelling the epidemic and creating major obstacles in reaching our Universal Access goals and the MDG targets for HIV and AIDS. Gender-related HIV challenges are deeply embedded in the fabric of society. Gender norms prevent girls from seeking information and services on sexual health and HIV, and deny women their say in sexual decisions. At the same time, gender norms encourage boys and men to engage in multiple sexual encounters and risky behaviour. Intimate partner violence is silencing women\u2019s voice, and preventing them from seeking help and taking measures to protect themselves from HIV infection. This is compounded by the shame and persistent stigma associated with HIV which creates powerful barriers to accessing basic HIV prevention and treatment services. It is estimated that 50 million women in Asia are at risk of HIV infection from their intimate partners and urgent attention is needed for developing effective prevention strategies to reach them. In the light of this, I am delighted to launch the inaugural virtual discussion on intimate partner transmission of HIV and its linkages with violence on the newly established HIVAPCOP. HIV and Intimate Partner Transmission raises questions related to intimate partner violence, giving agency to vulnerable women, engaging men in the response, and improving women\u2019s rights to inheritance and property as a way of addressing violence and providing coping mechanisms. Please find a few key questions below to help kick start the discussion. The results of this e-discussion will feed into the multi partner (UNDP, UNAIDS, UNIFEM, UNFPA, WAPN+ and ICW) joint symposia on HIV and Intimate Partner Transmission at the 9th ICAAP in Bali, Indonesia. The challenges and complex interplay between HIV, laws that discriminate and criminalize rather than protect people living with and are vulnerable to HIV and deep seated norms and attitudes that embed gender inequalities requires us to engage across a broad spec- trum of society to shift mindsets, behaviours and actions. The HIV- APCoP provides a unique platform to exchange ideas and latest practices, and build a community of commitment across partners in the Asia Pacific for creative responses to HIV that are rights based and grounded in gender equalities. Caitlin Wiesen-Antin, Regional HIV/AIDS Practice Leader & Programme Coordinator Asia & Pacific UNDP Regional Centre Today we are living in a world of specialization and excellence. I am delighted that in response to this emerging reality this community of practice has been set up to discuss and explore issues that are specific to gender, HIV and human rights. I have been working to move the HIV/AIDS agenda with as powerful a gender lens as possible since 1993 but have been frustrated when gender and rights issues have often got subsumed in the HIV discussions because, for some, there were more urgent and pressing concerns. This space I am sure will move our vision with accelerated speed now in the Asian region. I feel privileged to be part of this community. Madhu Bala Nath, Technical Advisor on HIV, GBV and Anti Trafficking, UNIFEM www.hivapcop.org HIV, Intimate Partner Transmission and Domestic Violence \u2022\ufffd In some parts of Asia, it can be said that marriage is a robust indicator of HIV vulnerability for women. To what extent does this hold to be true in your experiences? \u2022\ufffd Violence within marriage appears to be the norm rather than the exception in many of our communities. There is also substantial evidence that violence increases women and men\u2019s vulnerability to contracting HIV. What violence prevention efforts have been effective in empowering women and affecting HIV transmission rates? \u2022\ufffd Spousal violence involves at least two people, usually a male perpetrator and a female victim.

These findings also confirm that discrimination and violence against women/girls and the norms and standards of sexual engagement that condone or socially sanc- tion violence in intimate partner relationships, render women vulnerable to HIV/ AIDS. Cultural taboos, including the notion of sex being a \u201cmale right,\u201d especially within marriage, often gives women little space to openly discuss and negotiate sexual relations within marriage, increasing their vulnerability to HIV infection. Positive women face disproportionate stigma and discrimination, which affects emotional well being, diminishes access to treatment and care, employment and a spectrum of other services. Finally, when a positive woman has to assume the additional responsibility of caring for family members suffering from HIV/AIDS, it increases emotional/physical stress, enhances time poverty, and may reduce her earning potential or push her to earn more. [1] In 2008, the UNIFEM East and Southeast Asia, Regional Office Bangkok, conducted a study, entitled \u201cResponding to the Feminization of HIV/AIDS: A Rapid Assessment of Spousal and Partner Transmission of HIV and Sero Discordant Couples\u201d in four countries in Southeast Asia in partnership with UNAIDS, Asia Regional Office, Bangkok. www.hivapcop.org Summary of Responses to Questions In some parts of Asia, it can be said that marriage is a robust indicator of HIV vulnerability for women. To what extent does this hold to be true in your experiences? Members felt that marriage is not yet a \u2018robust indicator\u2019 of HIV in Asia but is increasingly emerging as a possible risk to contracting the virus. Framing the issue this way runs the risk of a range of conservative responses from non-acceptance and branding this position as anti-marriage to introduction of mandatory pre marriage testing. What might be more useful is to use data and analysis to es- tablish the power dynamic - power exercised by and large by men over women in society as a whole, including in marriage - as a key cause. Interventions need to strike at this power dynamic in order to make any real difference in terms of halting or reversing the spread of HIV. It is important to note that not all women in marriage are at risk for HIV; there are specific groups of married women who are at higher risk than other women. Research to date has characterized such groups of women by the behaviors of men and cultural practices in marital system within the South Asian context. For instance, married women who face Intimate Partner Violence (IPV), have husbands with hypermasculine attitudes or are heavy users of substance. These men are also more likely to engage in unprotected extra marital sexual relations and hence are at increased risk of HIV transmission. Female partners of migrant men or female migrants themselves as married partners are at risk of HIV due to lack of knowledge and skills to protect themselves and inaccessibility and lack of knowledge about quality services. This multi-factorial risk of HIV transmission in intimate partner relationships points to specific groups of married couples at higher risk rather than \u201cmarriage\u201d itself being an indicator for risk of infection. It is critical to invest heavily in helping women to assess their risk of HIV infection through self-administered questionnaires. These have been developed in the region but since they have to go through peer counselors and field workers, the assessment of self risk has to be done keeping the woman\u2019s and man\u2019s right to privacy in perspective. www.hivapcop.org Violence within marriage appears to be the norm rather than the exception in many of our communities. There is also substantial evidence that violence increases women and men\u2019s vulnerability to contracting HIV.

While the signs of progress in addressing violence against women are many, large scale efforts at violence prevention have not been very effective, until now.[2] They have either tried to create spaces for women in their own homes through acts like the Domestic Violence Act in India or they have moved into the economic empowerment model of creating incomes for the survivors of violence so that they can, at best, survive. However, members noted: neither of these initiatives directly help in HIV prevention. Good macro data on (a) different forms of violence against women; (b) sex disag- gregated data and gender statistics on the feminization of HIV/AIDS and spousal transmission is presently \u2018work in progress\u201d. One among many problem issues in data collection is poor reporting due to stigma and discrimination. This adds to the problem of establishing links between the efficacies of violence prevention efforts, women and preventing HIV transmission. [2] There are, however, community based examples of how work on preventing discrimination and violence against women and HIV prevalence have been combined with good effect. \u201cDouble Jeopardy\u201d Recent studies in India reveal that female partners of abusive men are (a) with a partner who is more likely to get infected based on his behaviour outside the relationship, and (b) more likely to become infected by that partner based on his behaviour inside the relationship. This places many women in double jeopardy regarding their risk for HIV. *Other country examples are available on the HIV-APCOP www.hivapcop.org It is now becoming clear that to prevent HIV for women in violent relationships we need; \u2022\ufffd Psychosocial interventions like trauma counseling and help in building self esteem along with access to women controlled technology for AIDS prevention, such as the female condom. \u2022\ufffd Substantial work on lobbying with governments to make this affordable and accessible. \u2022\ufffd Violence against women practitioners need to come together with HIV/AIDS practitioners, including related ministries and government departments, ministries of women\u2019s empowerment, and health ministries to facilitate the development of policies and programs that are focused and coordinated. Spousal violence involves at least two people, usually a male perpetrator and a female victim. What approaches have been used to work with men and boys to prevent violence within marriage and reduce HIV transmission? Members agreed that work with men and boys is absolutely critical to support men to redefine masculinity and deconstruct the concept of hegemonic (hyper) masculinity themselves. The UNDP project, Partners for Development, is beginning to gather speed on issues relating to masculinity and some networks on this issue are beginning to find their space in South Asia. They are however as yet nascent and are trying to gather evidence and research on men and GBV. There is considerable data on intimate partner violence however, not much of it is from the perspective of men. ICRW has just completed a study on why men are violent and how they feel after they are violent. The study points to the need for self esteem develop- ment of adolescents as well as the importance of trauma and guilt counseling to help adolescents living in violent homes to value non violence. www.hivapcop.org For survivors of spousal violence who are also infected or affected by HIV/AIDS what kinds of support structures/mechanisms have been seen to be effective in helping them survive? To what extent do women\u2019s empowerment schemes provide enough support? Members suggested a variety of empowerment mechanisms to support survivors of spousal violence who are also infected or affected by HIV/AIDS. \u2022\ufffd Economic empowerment programs that are gender responsive and consistent with market demand. \u2022\ufffd Gender responsive workplace, education policies that ensure that HIV positive people, including women do not lose their jobs and children/ youth are retained in school/college. \u2022\ufffd Effective trauma counseling that is not moralistic and that combines indigenous with western methods or is solely indigenous.

This is a huge emotional burden that women in particular tend to carry. Boundaries of Safety and Risk In Papua New Guniea the relevance of standard definitions of risky and safe are being called into question because of the prevalence of spousal HIV transmission. For instance, divorced, separated or widowed women who exchange sex for money are considered \u2018safe\u2019 sexual partners, and mar- ried women are considered to be \u2018safe\u2019 from infection in their marriages. The focus on \u2018at risk groups\u2019 may contribute to the failure of prevention messages and miss the point that transmission could be more frequent where most people do not expect it, or in social spaces considered \u201csafe\u201d. *Other country examples are available on the HIV-APCOP www.hivapcop.org Final Note Finally, one member felt that in the current HIV scenario in the region, the em- phasis of focusing on certain population groups and communities and having a targeted approach, may lead to women being addressed essentially as spouses and partners of MARPS. This member suggested that the focus be broadened to address the issues of vulnerability to HIV and impact of violence for those women and young girls who are not wives or in any marital relationship. This ideological framework would bring in the political, social and economic agency of women and girls as human beings in their own right and not merely as wives, partners and spouses. To reach out to women in marriage who are at risk or are vulnerable, there is no getting away from addressing the underlying causes of gender inequality. This work needs to be embedded in the larger efforts taking place across the world by diverse groups of men and women to address VAW and other forms of gender based violence. A life cycle approach, which highlights her denial, deprivation and discrimination as a continuum of human rights violation, is needed to tackle the risks of HIV and violence for women in marriage.

INTRODUCTION \u201cIn the course of socially constructing an illness, symptoms are identified, and the disease is named\u2026 Responsibility and blame often are assigned. Those who contract the disease come to be regarded as victims or patients, guilty or innocent, dangerous or benign, heroic or pitiable.\u201d (Herek, 2003) Although there have been many notable successes in both the prevention and treatment of HIV, stigma and discrimination have been intractable problems associated with the AIDS epidemic throughout the world. Stigma certainly has well-established individual consequences: it has been shown to delay HIV testing, restrict utilization of preventative programs, and hinder the adoption of preventative behaviours like condom use and HIV status disclosure (Brooks et al., 2005). Stigma may also have consequences for individual economic well-being as well as broader socioeconomic development (beyond the impact of HIV disease alone). In Asia, where the epidemic arrived relatively late, HIV is spreading with rapid speed. In 2005, the number of AIDS cases in Asia topped 8 million; this is compared to approximately 3 million people just 10 years prior (UNAIDS, 2006). Determinants and consequences of stigma and discrimination on socioeconomic development in Asia have yet to be empirically assessed. In this context, this review is aimed at generating informed discussion among key stakeholders including academia, policy makers, governments, donors and people living with HIV on the phenomenon of stigma and discrimination, with a particular focus on its human development context and impact. The paper also seeks to set a research agenda to foster compelling and disaggregated enquiries into stigma and discrimination. This review takes an ecological perspective to examine the human development consequences of HIV-related stigma and discrimination in Asia. A report from the US Institute of Medicine (2002) has called for an ecological approach to research and health promotion (Institute of Medicine, 2002). Ecological Systems Theory (Bronfenbrenner, 1989) emphasizes the dynamic relationship between an individual and the social environment.

The core of the paper addresses the intersection between stigma/discrimination and human development from this broad ecological perspective addressing the manner in which individual people living with HIV (PLHIV) and their families are affected by stigma and discrimination from the individual to structural/societal levels. We provide illustrative examples of these bi-directional effects as part of an \u201cinfluence matrix\u201d (Table 1). Finally, because empirical research in this area has been limited, we consider implications for future research. 2. OVERVIEW OF HIV-RELATED STIGMA AND DISCRIMINATION Erving Goffman (1963) describes stigma as \u201can attribute that is deeply discrediting,\u201d transforming the affected individual into a \u201cdiscredited\u201d person. The definition of stigma has been continually developed and re-conceptualized since the publication of his foundational work. Stigma can be broken down into that which is felt or anticipated and that which is enacted (Jacoby, 1994; Malcolm et al., 1998). It has also been dichotomized into expressive and instrumental forms, where an individual may perceive another negatively but may only act according to this prejudice under certain circumstances (Herek & Capitanio, 1998). The process by which stigma occurs has also been well delineated as has its function of maintaining power, economic and social hierarchies (Link & Phelan, 2001). Extending from this, stigma has been conceived as occurring at the community, institution and policy levels, rather than being limited to the action of individuals (Parker & Aggleton, 2002). The HIV/AIDS epidemic has created new opportunities for the manifestation of stigma. The disease\u2019s characteristics are similar to those of other ailments that commonly evoke stigma: the cause is perceived to be the bearer\u2019s responsibility even though it often may not be the case; it is incurable; it is infectious and can cause others harm; and in some cases it can be identifiable (e.g., severe wasting) (Herek, 1999).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3e1660cc-4b3e-432e-96d6-66189efd98d9": {"__data__": {"id_": "3e1660cc-4b3e-432e-96d6-66189efd98d9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-related-stigma-and-discrimination-asia-review-human-development-consequences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV-Related Stigma and Discrimination in Asia: A Review of Human Development Consequences", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-related-stigma-and-discrimination-asia-review-human-development-consequences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0e3ca4ec4db1d414359795a454115b1c13e82d4d12f5103f4e716673fb3a342d"}, "2": {"node_id": "8ef54f53-17b1-4189-9de4-dcc430bfd150", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-related-stigma-and-discrimination-asia-review-human-development-consequences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "71d8533ad5433f6a5a062eaa629d75f76ea1012a5837b830fc3ebde640eb97a3"}}, "hash": "eaaa7dfb2fdbd97f98867e61bc2049fbda28ed37b1bc7775c4031d7b34495ecf", "text": "HIV/AIDS provokes further stigma in larger society as the epidemic commonly begins in subgroups already marginalized such as men who have sex with men (MSM), drug users and sex workers.

For example, women, racial/tribal minorities, and the poor also suffer discrimination in society, which is heightened when combined with the stigma associated with HIV (Parker & Aggleton, 2002). Stigma can manifest on multiple levels. In the following sections, we review the stigma literature at the level of the individual, family, institution, and structural/policy. 4 2.1 Individual Stigma Stigma is most often discussed at the individual level. Here, PLHIV are differentially treated by friends, family members and other individuals in one on one encounters. For example, friends may no longer be willing to associate with PLHIV for fear of infection or accusations of also being HIV positive. Family members may no longer feel comfortable sharing dishes or towels for fear of contagion. This behaviour occurs despite knowledge of modes of transmission. In a study of HIV stigma in Vietnam, family and community members were aware that HIV could not be transmitted through causal contact but remained hesitant to share drinking glasses or sit near someone who was HIV positive for fear of being infected \u201caccidentally\u201d (International Center for Research on Women [ICRW], 2004). Individuals in various countries in Asia have reported coercion to move from their homes by landlords and refusal of service at food and other business establishments (Human Rights Watch, 2003; Paxton et al., 2005). PLHIV also reported being referred to by derogatory terminology by others in the community (Bharat, 2001; ICRW, 2004; Paxton et al., 2005; Songwathana & Manderson, 2001). Terms used frequently referred to individuals as drug users, sex workers, or carried connotations of imminent death. Regardless of whether stigma is experienced or perceived, it can have detrimental impacts on the individual. Individuals who believe they will experience discrimination may be less willing to disclose their HIV positive status to others, thereby limiting their resources for much-needed social support. Numerous studies have shown that PLHIV suffering from discrimination are more likely to experience depression (Heckman et al., 2004; Joseph & Bhatti, 2004; Manopaiboon et al., 1998). In turn, chronic depression among individuals with HIV hastens disease progression and mortality (Ickovics et al., 2001; Major & O\u2019Brien, 2005). In addition, the intense stigma surrounding HIV reduces the likelihood that individuals in Asia will seek voluntary testing and counselling, basic medical care, and even adversely affects adherence to anti-retroviral treatment (Ainsworth, Beyrer, & Soucat, 2003; FHI; Ford, Wirawan, Sumantera, Sawitri, & Stahre, 2004; Kurmarasamy et al., 2005). Fear of stigma has also led PLHIV in India, Vietnam, and Thailand to quit their jobs and move to new communities for fear of stigma should their HIV status become known (Bharat, 2001; ICRW, 2004; Songwathana & Manderson, 2001). 2.2 Family Families in Asia are affected by HIV/AIDS in multiple ways. Families may discriminate against their family members with HIV either because of fear of the infection or because they are ashamed by the behaviour (or presumed behaviour) that led to the infection. As previously mentioned, families decide to use separate dishes, towels, and even avoid washing clothes in the same water as that used by PLHIV following disclosure. Individuals who have disclosed their HIV status to their family have been excluded from family events, prevented from having contact with their own children, cut off from the family\u2019s financial support and even forced to leave family residences (Bharat, 2001; Human Rights Watch, 2003; ICRW, 2004; Joseph & Bhatti, 2004; Kumarasamy et al., 2005; Paxton et al., 2005). 5 Discrimination within the context of the family is particularly prominent against women. Numerous studies have reported that women in Asian countries experience greater stigma than men (Bharat, 1996; Bharat & Aggleton, 1999; ICRW, 2004; Paxton et al., 2005; Warwick et al., 1998).

In a case study from India, a widow living with her in- laws was finally asked to leave the home after months of mistreatment as the family believed that her presence in the home was adversely affecting the marriagability of one of their sons (Shreedhar, 2000).

Yet, despite these high levels of support, families continued to experience negative reactions from their communities, such as gossiping and being refused service for fear other members of the community would discontinue store patronage (Songwathana & Manderson, 2001; VanLandingham et al., 2002). In a study in Thailand, negative reactions from the community resulted in numerous families wanting to leave the area, despite overall high levels of reported support (VanLandingham et al., 2002). Families experience stigma from their communities because they are blamed for the behaviour (e.g., drug use or sex work) that led to infection (ICRW, 2004) or because members of the community fear that the rest of the family is also infected (Songwathana & Manderson, 2001; VanLandingham et al., 2002). The latter is often attributable to misconceptions about modes of transmission. Stigma and discrimination toward families can occur both during the period of illness as well as following the death of a family member to AIDS. Although one study in Thailand indicated that most stigma was short-lived (less than one month) and did not carry over following the death of the infected family member (VanLandingham et al., 2002), other studies in the country reported that stigma and discrimination did continue after death (Pitayanon, Kongsin, & Janjareon, 1996; Songwathana & Manderson, 2001). To avoid this stigma and discrimination from the community, individuals often avoid disclosing their HIV status to family members (Bharat, 2001; Human Rights Watch, 2003; Kumarasamy et al., 2005). When families are aware of the positive HIV status of one of its own members, they often lie about the illness to avoid community stigmatization (Songwathana & Manderson, 2001). A study in Thailand reported that families often take dramatic steps and exhaust financial resources to ensure a \u201cnormal\u201d burial for their loved one so as not to reveal that the cause of death was attributable to AIDS (Songwathana & Manderson, 2001). In other regions of the world with high HIV prevalence, such as sub-Saharan Africa, there has been some attention paid to the plight of HIV orphans and vulnerable children. Studies have demonstrated that immediate and extended family rejects these children when their HIV positive parent(s) becomes too ill to care for them or passes away (Ansell & Young, 2004). Less attention 6 has been given to this matter in Asia. Although there is some evidence that children whose parents have died from AIDS are not taken in by family (Human Rights Watch, 2003; ICRW, 2004), studies in Thailand have shown that these children face less discrimination by family than children in other parts of the world (Knodel, VanLandingham, Saengtiechai, & Im-em, 2001). Children whose parents are infected with HIV or who are themselves infected, however, have faced discrimination in the educational system. Although it is rarely written policy, children have been denied entry into schools because of their HIV status or that of their parents (Bharat, 2001; Human Rights Watch, 2003; Paxton et al., 2005; Safman, 2004; UNDP, 2003). In India, organizations providing care services for destitute children have carried out HIV testing for all children seeking services and have segregated or transferred those who test HIV positive (Bharat, 2001). 2.3 Institutional Stigma and discrimination toward PLHIV is very common at the institutional level. Several studies conducted in Asia found that stigma was most common in the health care sector (Bharat & Aggleton, 1999; Bharat, 2001; Paxton et al., 2005). In a study of four Asian countries (Thailand, Indonesia, India, and the Philippines), 54 percent of respondents with HIV reported that they had experienced some form of HIV-related stigma and discrimination in the health care sector (Paxton et al., 2005).

In India, a growing number of private health care facilities have agreed to treat patients with HIV, however, staff wear at least one extra pair of gloves, use \u201cAIDS kits,\u201d and fumigate operating and delivery rooms after they have been used (Bharat, 2001). Other forms of stigma and discrimination include noting patient charts or rooms with identifiable markers indicating the individual is HIV positive, requiring repeated HIV testing at the patients\u2019 expense and beginning medical interviews presuming risky behavior (Yang et al., 2005; Elamon, 2005; Khoat et al., 2005; Bharat, 2001; Songwathana and Manderson, 2001). Due to the common experience of HIV-related stigma and discrimination in the health care sector, PLHIV are 7 less willing to seek healthcare for themselves (Ainsworth, Beyrer, and Soucat, 2003; Shreedhar, 2000; Kumarasamy et al., 2005). As with HIV positive women in the general population, those interacting with the health care sector face specific discrimination. Women attending antenatal appointments are routinely tested for HIV without their consent (Paxton et al., 2005). When health providers learn the women have HIV, they have denied women antenatal care and coerced them into termination of the pregnancy or sterilization without being informed of risk of transmission and treatment options (Bharat, 2001; Paxton et al., 2005; Khoat et al., 2005). An Indian physician interviewed in one study reported that when poor young pregnant women test positive for HIV, he calls their mothers-in- law rather than informing the patient herself as these women are deemed too ignorant to understand (Bharat, 2001). This case clearly demonstrates the interaction of the multiple stigmas of poverty, gender and HIV-positive status. Stigma and discrimination also occur in the employment sector. In Paxton et al.\u2019s study (2005) in India, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines, they found that both men and women had experienced some form of discrimination in the workplace. Approximately 7 percent of individuals from these countries had lost their jobs because of their HIV status and nearly 10 percent had experienced changes in their job responsibilities after their HIV status became known. Employers in some countries also require HIV testing for job applicants, thereby discouraging PLHIV from applying (Manopaiboon et al., 1998). A survey of over 200 companies in Hong Kong in the late 1990\u2019s revealed that very few companies had specific policies regarding protection of employees with HIV and less than half were aware of legislation limiting employers\u2019 access to an applicant\u2019s HIV status (Lau and Wong, 2001). This study also showed that nearly one-third of employers were willing to dismiss or transfer an employee against his/her will upon learning of the employee\u2019s positive HIV status. There is limited information available on stigma and discrimination by religious institutions in Asia. Some studies have stated that religious leaders do not harbour judgmental attitudes toward people living with HIV and even permit places of worship such as wats (Buddhist temples) and mosques to be used for hospice care (Bechtel and Apakupakul, 1999; Songwathana and Manderson, 2001). However, it is suggested elsewhere in the literature that religious leaders preserve the status quo by claiming that individuals infected with HIV have sinned and deserve their punishment (Parker and Aggleton, 2002). A study in Thailand claimed that Buddhist philosophy perceives HIV/AIDS as both the result of immoral action as well as karma from misdeeds in past lives (Songwanthana and Manderson, 2001). Attitudes toward HIV also extend to religious leaders in Thailand who believe that individuals who are infected with HIV should not be allowed to become Buddhist monks. Finally, there is evidence that stigma and discrimination occur in private institutions and organizations. Individuals in India have been required to be tested for HIV when applying for life insurance; upon receiving a positive result, insurance has been denied (Bharat, 2001). Paxton and colleagues\u2019 study (2005) of four Asian countries reported that 8 percent of PLHIV were denied private health insurance after their HIV status was known; with rates as high as 15 percent in Thailand.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a80e5e33-1880-4322-92c2-ab3b81d7000a": {"__data__": {"id_": "a80e5e33-1880-4322-92c2-ab3b81d7000a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-related-stigma-and-discrimination-asia-review-human-development-consequences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV-Related Stigma and Discrimination in Asia: A Review of Human Development Consequences", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-related-stigma-and-discrimination-asia-review-human-development-consequences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "818521bdd615efd2b38e6128927cc30e59015a18b861b323e72f0346def2f366"}, "2": {"node_id": "9b6ee182-ff87-46e1-8ed0-d86e257e8ea4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-related-stigma-and-discrimination-asia-review-human-development-consequences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0e3e20b51206e3d74cb4be3136140f5cbb259c6b3c7f39066047dc8de6dfac03"}}, "hash": "61af9fa4785e44fda443f8af4bdb2487fdcc2318e53ca6443cab6ac7911a266e", "text": "Organizations providing services to disadvantaged groups such as women and youth have denied services to PLHIV and their families in Vietnam, arguing that they are less deserving than other groups (ICRW, 2004). 8 2.4 Structural/Policy There is abundant evidence of discriminatory policies toward PLHIV across Asia.

Policies in Thailand and India have required physicians to provide the names and addresses of persons testing positive for HIV and exempted them from regulations protecting patient confidentiality (Ainsworth, Beyrer, and Soucat, 2003; Shreedhar, 2000; Elamon, 2005). This legislation has been repealed in Thailand. Numerous countries also restrict border access to immigrant populations. These restrictions include forbidding individuals with HIV from entering the country, requiring testing for HIV to receive work permits, or demanding declaration of negative status before entry to the country is granted (Ainsworth, Beyrer, and Soucat, 2003; Ortega et al., 2005; Parker and Aggleton, 2002). In China, cases have been documented where immigrant workers were deported once their HIV positive status became known (Human Rights Watch, 2003). Serodiscordant families have been separated between the mainland and Hong Kong due to HIV-related legislation (Human Rights Watch, 2003). Both China and India had put in place legislation banning PLHIV from marriage (Shreedhar, 2000; Human Rights Watch, 2003). Individuals found in violation of the law in India were subjected to the country\u2019s penal code; however, this legislation was repealed in 2002 (Action AID, 2003). Individuals deemed to be high risk have also been subject to stigma and discrimination at the structural level. One of the hallmark examples comes from Vietnam and the \u201csocial evils\u201d media campaign (ICRW, 2004), designed to eliminate the \u201csocial evils\u201d of drug use and sex work. A separate administrative department within the national government was put in charge of this campaign. With the growth of the HIV epidemic in the country and its high prevalence within these two groups, HIV was included as part of the \u201csocial evils\u201d triangle. The common mind-set linking HIV, drug use, and sex work was further fuelled by the merger of the \u201cDepartment of Social Evils Prevention\u201d with a national task force to address HIV/AIDS in the country (subsequently called the National Committee for AIDS, Drugs, and Prostitution). High-risk groups have been further targeted by compulsory rehabilitation if arrested. Compulsory rehabilitation for drug users has also been implemented in China (Human Rights Watch, 2003). Additionally, there is a mandatory testing policy for drug users, sex workers, and residents who have lived outside China for more than one year (CHAP and LR, 2001; Yang et al., 2005). If found to be HIV positive, these individuals are put under quarantine; Chinese jails are segregated by HIV status (CHAP and LR, 2001; Human Rights Watch, 2003). It is important to note that although the passage and upholding of legislation discriminating against PLHIV has occurred in Asian countries, governments also have instituted protective legislation for individuals who are living with HIV. In 1997, the Indian Supreme Court ruled in several cases that PLHIV (and their widows) could not be barred access to employment should they be fully capable of performing the duties and responsibilities of the position 9 (Subramaniam, 2004). In one case, the judge stated that by continuing to work, the individual\u2019s physical and mental well-being is enhanced. Both Vietnam and China have made efforts to protect children orphaned and made vulnerable by HIV/AIDS. The Vietnamese government issued a policy that children with HIV should be permitted to attend school; no cases have been documented that would indicate the policy has not been upheld (ICRW, 2004). In its efforts to protect vulnerable children, China ratified the Convention on the Rights of Children, which would provide special assistance to children who are temporarily or permanently without a source of care (Human Rights Watch, 2003). Protective legislation, however, can be undermined by other policies. For example, Vietnam passed a decree to protect PLHIV from stigma and discrimination, requiring government agencies and families to provide support and prohibiting the mass media from providing personal information without consent. Yet the dominance of the social evils campaign counteracts the potential benefits to be gained from such a policy (ICRW, 2004). Furthermore, Reidpath and Chan (2005) have noted that the presence of protective policy and legislation may do little to reduce enacted stigma and discrimination as these laws are rarely enforced and have minimal cultural credibility. 3.

It is important to recognize that these relationships are complex and bidirectional. The discourse will focus primarily on the impact of stigma and discrimination on human development. However, as individual and institutional economies are adversely affected, stigma and discrimination consequently may increase. The examples in Table 1 are meant to be illustrative rather than exhaustive. Although human development is often measured at the national or macro-level, these measurements are primarily reflections of aggregate individual/family or micro-level economic activities and standards of living. Much of the research to date has focused on the effect of HIV on economic development in sub-Saharan Africa given the well-established presence of the epidemic in that region; less research has been carried out on this topic in Asia. Examples will, therefore, focus on Africa, and drawing on experiences from Asia when available. To elucidate the intersection between HIV-related stigma and human development, it is first necessary to create a working definition of human development. Amartya Sen (1999) argues that development can be seen as the level of freedom (or the capability) individuals have to 10 engage in the economic, political and social life of their communities. Sen defines five freedoms that are essential to development: (1) political freedoms, (2) economic facilities, (3) social opportunities, (4) transparency guarantees, and (5) protective securities. He argues that establishment of these freedoms enhances the capabilities of individuals on these five dimensions and their ultimate engagement in the civil structure of society. Sen\u2019s concept of capabilities provides insight regarding individual/family-level development. Sen notes that the standard of living as defined by capabilities is the set of attributes it is possible to attain. Individual- and family-level development must be operationalized as capability sets linked to economic and social freedoms, such as economic productivity, access to health care, and education. These areas are often the focus of research investigating the developmental impact of HIV. 3.1 Individual and Family Stigma Influences on Individual and Family Human Development Reduced economic productivity is the most common area of focus when looking at the impact of HIV on personal development. AIDS-related death of a family member has significant adverse effects on family income. HIV-related illness leads to absences from work, thereby reducing individual and family earnings. A recent study on the socioeconomic impact of HIV and AIDS in India reveals that households with an HIV positive member(s) (HIV households) lost 9.2 percent of the total income due to leave/absence not only of a person living with HIV but also of working family members to provide care (NCAER, NACO and UNDP, 2006). In a community-level survey in Viet Nam, 25 percent of caregivers reported giving up employment in order to care for their ill family member; one-third of caretakers reported cutting back on work hours in order to meet caretaking responsibilities (UNDP, 2005). HIV-related illness also increases medical expenditures, putting further financial burden on the household. The aforementioned Indian study shows that HIV households spent almost 4 times as much on medical expenses in comparison with non-HIV households. In addition, HIV prevalence is highest in the most economically productive age groups. HIV-related stigma and discrimination can exacerbate these already fragile economic circumstances of individuals and households affected by HIV. The loss of income due to illness and premature death is intensified when an individual with HIV/AIDS or their family members are denied employment or dismissed from their jobs because of HIV status. Individuals working in the informal sector can experience loss of income as community members deny them patronage by refusing to purchase their goods in local markets or rely on them for unskilled labour (Muyinda and Seeley, 1997). Economic impact of stigma at the individual and family level has been documented in Viet Nam and elsewhere in Asia (ICRW, 2004). HIV-related stigma can also have indirect effects on individual economic productivity and the financial well-being of the family. Perceived stigma and discrimination have been associated with increased prevalence and severity of depression among people living with HIV 11 (Heckman et al., 2004; Joseph and Bhatti, 2004; Manopaiboon et al., 1998). Depression, in turn, has been linked to subsequent declines in health status (Ickovics et al., 2001; Major and O\u2019Brien, 2005). Depression and physical health decline consequently can result in increased absenteeism in the workplace and reductions in income. Restricted access to resources - or denial of access to these resources - is another important way capabilities are affected by HIV and HIV-related stigma. Studies of agrarian households affected by HIV in Rwanda and Zimbabwe demonstrated marked reductions in economic activity\u2013 both labour inputs as well", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "933f80f0-a3c0-4844-80b1-7047548496ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "933f80f0-a3c0-4844-80b1-7047548496ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-related-stigma-and-discrimination-asia-review-human-development-consequences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV-Related Stigma and Discrimination in Asia: A Review of Human Development Consequences", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-related-stigma-and-discrimination-asia-review-human-development-consequences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "99fd4f745fb088d4c4f3b60c127db68970e6f86ba989e29984cf42a2e785ae7f"}, "3": {"node_id": "abf82cde-a5f6-46df-8d4f-fc8e1afd6c8e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-related-stigma-and-discrimination-asia-review-human-development-consequences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d9918ac67d481e1d043f0ce0398190fa517fea950cd069eafde3225b53de64ef"}}, "hash": "fbeb259942f453a5fd0fb7115a4e7a7000c420d38a199edeb9e11e556b7e9d4a", "text": "as overall crop production (Guiness and Alban, 2000; Kwaramba, 1997).

A study in rural Thailand documented declines in farm output and income ranging from 52 percent to 67 percent among households affected by HIV (ActionAid, 2003). Using survey data from Viet Nam to conduct statistical estimations on HIV\u2019s effect on levels of poverty, UNDP (2005) found that expenditure and income changes attributed to having a family member with HIV in the home forced some non-poor families to fall below the poverty line, while driving other families further into poverty - falling below the food poverty level. The compromised nutritional status of families and lack of previously available financial resources severely restricted individual and family capability sets. Individuals who are malnourished do more poorly in school and are less able to work at former capacity levels. Reductions in household earnings limit resources that can be used for education, savings, or small enterprise. In a study on land-use rights in Kenya, Drimie (2004) found that HIV-related stigma adversely affected women\u2019s and orphans\u2019 right to inherit and use land. In many cases, women were dispossessed of their rights to inherit land owned previously by their husbands - in part because the community blamed them for the death of their spouses. Orphans faced similar types of barriers to inheriting property and were left destitute after the death of their parents. Bharat (2001) noted that families in India have denied daughters-in-law\u2019s access to property, pension, or insurance benefits because they are blamed for infecting their husbands with HIV. Another Indian study of over 400 HIV-positive widows shows that almost 80 percent of the respondents had been denied the right to their husbands\u2019 property (NCAER, NACO and UNDP, 2006). The public rationale may be stated as responsibility/blame; an alternative explanation is the economic vulnerability of women and children and the family or community simply taking advantage of their lack of resources or public voice to defend their own rights - particularly during a time of care taking and mourning. HIV can have a detrimental impact on the family\u2019s long-term economic prosperity through limiting children\u2019s access to education. A major portion of the caretaking and housekeeping burden falls on children, who then find it difficult to attend school (Gaffeo 2003). Families also rely on fees saved from school enrolment and purchasing school supplies as means to cope with the financial burden of HIV. Short-term economic gains are exchanged for longer-term financial 12 benefits for families (UNDP, 2005). Studies in South Africa and Senegal found that when children are withdrawn from school, they are more likely to be female, thereby exacerbating the impediments to gender equality in both countries (Booysen, van Rensburg, Bachmann, Engelbrecht, and Steyn, 2002; Ibrahima Niang, and Quarles van Ufford, 2002). Reliance on children as caretakers for ill family members and its subsequent economic impact may not universally apply to the Asian context. Studies in Thailand, Viet Nam and India have rarely reported children to be caretakers of ill family members, but rather parents and spouses seem to take on this responsibility (Joseph and Bhatti, 2004; Kespichayawattana and VanLandingham, 2003; UNDP, 2005). Withdrawing children from school may not be a strategy currently employed by HIV-affected families in Asia, however, the potential impact this could have on families\u2019 future economic coping can be inferred from other studies in the region. A study carried out in Thailand demonstrated that families with lower educational attainment were more likely to make cuts in consumption (e.g. food and household goods) than those families with higher educational levels (Pitayanon, Kongsin and Janjaroen, 1996). Such measures have a negative impact on families\u2019 capabilities. In addition to the practical concerns of resource conservation, access to education, resources and social capital, are also significantly influenced by HIV stigma and discrimination.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "abf82cde-a5f6-46df-8d4f-fc8e1afd6c8e": {"__data__": {"id_": "abf82cde-a5f6-46df-8d4f-fc8e1afd6c8e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-related-stigma-and-discrimination-asia-review-human-development-consequences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV-Related Stigma and Discrimination in Asia: A Review of Human Development Consequences", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-related-stigma-and-discrimination-asia-review-human-development-consequences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "99fd4f745fb088d4c4f3b60c127db68970e6f86ba989e29984cf42a2e785ae7f"}, "2": {"node_id": "933f80f0-a3c0-4844-80b1-7047548496ec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-related-stigma-and-discrimination-asia-review-human-development-consequences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fbeb259942f453a5fd0fb7115a4e7a7000c420d38a199edeb9e11e556b7e9d4a"}}, "hash": "d9918ac67d481e1d043f0ce0398190fa517fea950cd069eafde3225b53de64ef", "text": "As stated previously, cases have been documented in Asia where children have been denied access to education due to their HIV status or that of their parents (Bharat, 2001; Human Rights Watch, 2003; Paxton et al., 2005; Safman, 2004, UNDP, 2003).
