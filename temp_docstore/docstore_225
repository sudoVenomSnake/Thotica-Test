 4(1). Where the provisions of any other written law are specifically inconsistent with the provision of this Decree, the Decree prevails to the extent necessary for the purposes of this Decree. The Decree establishes the HIV/AIDS Board (a ministerial advisory committee) and defines its membership, including a PLHIV representing civil society organizations concerned with the protection of the human rights of PLHIV. The most significant protective provisions of the Decree are the non-discrimination provisions (Sections 21 and 22): Section 21. Subject to section 23 and without prejudice to the safety and human rights of the public of Fiji and elsewhere, it is unlawful to discriminate, directly or indirectly, against a person having HIV/AIDS or affected by HIV/AIDS. Without limiting Section 21, Section 22 provides detailed prohibitions of discrimination in the following areas: a. employment, contract work and membership of the unformed services; b. business partnerships; c. industrial or professional organizations, clubs, sporting or other associations; d. childcare, education and training; 374 Ibid. 172 LegaL protections against HiV-reLated Human rigHts VioLations e. prisoners and persons in custody; f. accommodation, including rental accommodation, hotel and guesthouse accommodation; g. entry or presence in a community or place of residence; h. surveillance or research; i. the provision of or access to goods, services or public facilities. Exceptions are provided, which allow for lawful discrimination in relation to: \u2022\ufffd recruitment, promotion, posting or discharge of members of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces (Section 22(2)); and \u2022\ufffd insurance or superannuation, where actuarial or statistical data justifies the discrimination (see Section 23).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e9925163-2f33-4eca-9178-aa0b185cf5a9": {"__data__": {"id_": "e9925163-2f33-4eca-9178-aa0b185cf5a9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Legal protections against HIV-related human rights violations: Experiences and lessons learned from national HIV laws in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c2a3fcd1fdfceb1b68fa6cdb59dd701510817a8a43e899a4694aa738a50be833"}, "2": {"node_id": "52e6c999-d1cf-4252-b67c-e0d6c14404c1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "acd923aceb63c250169d56a6068cb35c092e5cabe5674d76de22497dff34f1ea"}}, "hash": "6d3416024318e4c48adf233a80c5b89273e61cc031d163dbfd670693c1829f51", "text": "Section 25 provides that it is unlawful to stigmatize a person on the ground that the person is living with HIV/AIDS or affected by HIV/AIDS. \u201cStigmatize\u201d includes vilifying or subjecting a person or group to harassment, or to incite hatred, ridicule or contempt against a person or group on the grounds that a person or member of a group is believed to be a person living with or affected by HIV, or tested for HIV.

An exception is provided for military personnel who may be subject to mandatory testing if required for operational reasons, including the requirement of overseas duties.375 \u201cVoluntary informed consent\u201d, in relation to the performance of a test for HIV, means a prior written consent specifically related to the performance of that test, freely given without force, fraud, coercion, duress, undue influence or threat ad given with knowledge and understanding of the medical, domestic and social consequences of a positive or negative result, the nature of that test, that knowledge and understanding having been gained through counselling. Section 29(2) provides that a person under 18 years can consent to an HIV test (without involvement of parent or guardian) if the person is, in the opinion of the person providing the pre-test information, capable of understanding the meaning and consequences of an HIV test. Section 26 provides that it is unlawful to knowingly deny a person access to a means of protection from HIV infection. \u201cMeans of protection\u201d is defined to include condoms, lubricant and other means of reducing the risk of HIV transmission. The Act requires pre and post-test counselling and confidential reporting of test results.

Section 35 provides for privacy of PLHIV in court proceedings. Section 36 provides the circumstances in which a person providing treatment care or counselling of a person living with HIV may inform a sexual partner of the person\u2019s HIV status without the person\u2019s consent. Notification must be with the consent of the person with HIV, or with endorsement of the Permanent Secretary of Health, which is required if counselling has failed to achieve behaviour change and the infected person has refused to notify the sexual partner or consent to notification of sexual partners. Section 41 provides that an unlawful act under the Decree is an offence punishable by a fine and/or imprisonment not exceeding 2 years. If the unlawful act is carried out by a health professional, it is a breach of professional standards and the professional may be subject to disciplinary proceedings. Section 41(2) of the Decree provides: \u201cNothing in this section affects the right of any person to seek civil remedy.\u201d Therefore, a PLHIV may pursue rights to compensation or other civil remedies available under other laws, in addition to a prosecution for an offence under the Decree. The Act also regulates supply of blood and blood products, and provides that guidelines may be issues for the conduct of HIV-related research, and that approval of research is required from the Fiji National Research Ethics Review Committee. 11.2 Implementation of the HIV/AIDS Decree 2011 The Decree has been promoted through a series of workshops targeting health care workers, civil servants, police and lawyers. As yet there are no reports of enforcement of the human rights protections contained in the Decree by criminal prosecutions or other legal proceedings, or use of the Decree in advocacy or negotiations to resolve specific disputes. Nazhat Shameem describes the challenges of implementation of the Decree as follows: Much depends on the HIV/AIDS Board, its membership, adequate resourcing of it, and the effectiveness of the policy guidelines issued by it. Its membership gives us good reason to expect effective implementation. The Decree also provides that any policies issued by the Board will have the force of law, and that any person who contravenes the policies commits an offence. This provision gives the Board \u201cteeth\u201d, but will require a strong partnership with the police force to ensure that police officers are aware of the provision, and of the Board\u2019s policies.

The Ministry\u2019s work with UNAIDS and civil society shows us that the best approach, both nationally and internationally, is one based on support, networking and partnership. The implementation of the Decree will showcase the effectiveness of that partnership.376 The provision of the Decree that provides a right of access to protection from HIV is intended to ensure the illegal status of sex work does not prevent sex workers having access to condoms and lubricant (Section 26). As yet there is no evidence as to whether this provision has had the intended effect. A medical practitioner from the Oceania Society for Sexual Health and HIV Medicine describes some of the challenges of implementation, and the need to ensure effective legal protection is available for all vulnerable populations: In my work I have found that health workers still need a great deal of education and behaviour change with regards to working with and for PLHIV and other sub- population groups such as MSM, transgender persons, sex workers and others. Perhaps health care workers need to be reminded of their ethical responsibilities and furthermore be very clear that they may be charged under the law for breaching their professional obligations. This should be the very last resort after other strategies are considered. As such the Ministry of Health should establish these mechanisms and resort to legal relief if these mechanisms fail. The HIV Decree protects PLHIV very well, but it is important that under-served and marginalised groups in the population are protected as well, and that it is mandated in law that their health needs are addressed. There is existing legislation in Fiji that make it difficult to follow specific areas of the HIV Decree. For example we have been advised that when working in a clinical setting and a \u2018young\u2019 person approaches a health worker for sexual health services, the Child Welfare Decree requires that we report the matter to the relevant Permanent Secretary. We have sought clarification on this matter but it remains unclear. The Ministry of Health also made serious efforts to educate workers and the public on the HIV Decree, which is an excellent example of creating a supportive and enabling environment. This was a positive step, which also resulted in unexpected outcomes. There needs to be greater efforts to ensure that structures are in place that support the implementation of the Decree. For example consequent to the extensive education of health workers, the Decree makes it very clear that HIV testing cannot be conducted unless VCCT (voluntary and confidential HIV counselling and testing) is provided by \u2018trained individuals\u2019. The issue now identified is that many health workers in the public and private sector have ceased testing for HIV because training was limited to lay counsellors and a few nurses. Very few, if any, Medical Officers and Nurses have received the types of training stipulated in the HIV Decree. This counter 376 Shameem (2011), Making the law work for HIV \u2013 the Fiji HIV/AIDS Decree 2011. Address by Nazhat Shameem at the 10th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific \u2013 26-30 August 2011. 175 Part III - Country Case studIes: natIonal HIV laws In tHe PaCIfIC FIJI to our public health goals of identifying PLHIV early to provide treatment both for individual quality of life and as prevention of onwards transmission. Secondly, while there is clear legal obligations placed on health workers there needs to be mechanisms put in place to educate and address the various behaviours that impede provision of services for PLHIV and other under-served populations. Workshops are frequently conducted to provide health care workers with technical skills, but very little is being done to address stigma and discrimination issues both from health workers and the general public. 11.3 Other legal redress mechanisms for human rights violations Constitutional protections of human rights are no longer available in Fiji because the 1997 Constitution of the Republic of Fiji Islands was abrogated in 2009. There are no reports prior to 2009 of PLHIV using the previous Constitution to seek legal protection from HIV-related human rights violations. Fiji is considering a new Constitution that proposes a new Bill of Rights in 2013. The Draft Constitution includes a prohibition on unfair direct or indirect discrimination on the grounds of disability, gender, sexual orientation and several other grounds.377 The ability to use the 1997 Constitution to address human rights violations prior to 2009 was demonstrated by a case challenging the legality of Penal Code provisions criminalizing homosexuality.

These rulings decriminalized homosexuality under the 1997 Constitution. The Crimes Decree 2009 was consistent with the outcome of this case, in that it did not incorporate provisions criminalizing consensual non-commercial sex between adults. In addition to the HIV/AIDS Decree 2011, provisions protecting the rights of PLHIV to non-discrimination are included in the Employment Relations Promulgation 2007 and the Public Service Act 1999.379 The Employment Relations Promulgation 2007 prohibits discrimination against workers or prospective workers on the ground of real or perceived HIV/AIDS status in respect of recruitment, training, promotion, terms and conditions of employment, termination of employment or other matters arising out of the employment relationship.380 The Employment Relations Promulgation 2007 applies to public and private sectors. Fiji also has a National Code of Practice for HIV/AIDS in the Workplace (2008), which promotes compliance with the non-discrimination provisions of the Employment Relations Promulgation 2007. There are no reports of PLHIV using these general laws to seek legal protection from HIV-related human rights violations. 377 Article 26(3), Draft Constitution of Fiji (2013). 378 Nadan and McCoskar v. State [2005] FJHC 500. 379 Sections 10B and 10C Public Service Act 1999, as amended by the Public Service (Amendment) Decree 2011. 380 Sections 6 and 75. 176 LegaL protections against HiV-reLated Human rigHts VioLations PLHIV have rights to privacy established by common law. The Court of Appeal of Fiji defined the boundaries of the right to privacy as the basis of civil action in the case of Alifereti Yaya v. Commissioner of Police (2009) FCA. The test is whether the plaintiff had a \u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d and, if there was a breach, whether it was prescribed by law and was a limitation that was reasonable and justifiable in a democratic society. No PLHIV has brought an action claiming breach of privacy in relation to HIV test results or information. Complaints of unlawful discrimination may be made to the Human Rights Commission of Fiji on various grounds as specified in the Human Rights Commission Decree 2009, including the grounds of gender, sexual orientation and disability. The Human Rights Commission Decree does not list HIV status as a prohibited ground of discrimination, although persons with a disability are protected. Nor is privacy a right specifically protected under the Decree. However the Proceedings Commissioner may bring civil proceedings for human rights violations in relation to any breach of rights contained in international human rights conventions to which Fiji is a party. For example, the Proceedings Commissioner could bring a civil case for breach of privacy rights, because Fiji is a party to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which guarantees the right to privacy. Under the Human Rights Commission Decree 2009, breaches of rights can lead to declarations, damages or any other appropriate relief. A complaint made to the Human Rights Commission in 2005 for the publication of test results of a positive person, was not taken to court by the then Proceedings Commissioner.381 Legal empowerment approaches have been implemented by the sex worker network Survival Advocacy Network (SAN). SAN has implemented a programme of legal rights training, access to legal services and working with police. Sex workers report that physical violence by the police has reduced. This is, in part, a direct outcome of sex workers having better knowledge of their legal rights and being able to negotiate with police, making them less vulnerable to unlawful arrest and detention and exploitation and extortion.382 11.4 Conclusion The explicit reference in the HIV/AIDS Decree to the International Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and human rights and relevant international human rights treaties is an important feature of the legislation that provides a model for other jurisdictions. As yet there have been no occasions in which the Decree has been enforced in court. A weakness of the Decree is that enforcement of the law requires a criminal prosecution of the offender or disciplinary proceedings to be taken against a health care provider.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee4b006a-b610-4b11-b879-8608d4200822": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee4b006a-b610-4b11-b879-8608d4200822", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Legal protections against HIV-related human rights violations: Experiences and lessons learned from national HIV laws in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "be9e2be0741e523a13b8a27ec79f1385c02692a0b318c89bbb11903f35e76a56"}, "2": {"node_id": "36e37728-6215-4a2b-82d3-89f29641a11b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0dc4baf8943ffe12f41a62f798445da4f193443ffee99bb1ae9012b8f0909e24"}}, "hash": "f1f8940df68e0cd66f94bc4983f20f6f11e10cbebf4d8d9416755e8e1f95c5cf", "text": "There is no provision in the Decree for individuals or organizations acting on behalf of individuals to seek a civil remedy for a breach of the Decree\u2019s provisions from the courts, 381 Email to UNDP from Nazhat Shameem, 2012. 382 UNFPA, UNAIDS, Asia Pacific Network of Sex Workers (2012), The HIV and Sex Work Collection: Innovative responses in Asia Pacific, Bangkok: UNFPA,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9d226485-8a71-42ef-b672-e16832f05264": {"__data__": {"id_": "9d226485-8a71-42ef-b672-e16832f05264", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Legal protections against HIV-related human rights violations: Experiences and lessons learned from national HIV laws in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1d9c29b52ff61a9812dedfe4093bb7854bb0f7c9ac424e8d45d9208dfac473c1"}, "3": {"node_id": "229a8ca7-a09d-4a03-8020-c7779e0ec95b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "16f3c6c9567200e562f3124b350336f982e58f970f538e92953ba32620cf4487"}}, "hash": "7bf2ef878c1b6f47ff4cc52edea3ed7e34a91fd681169d0b7f288074d9032418", "text": "UNAIDS, APNSW, pp.140-143. 177 Part III - Country Case studIes: natIonal HIV laws In tHe PaCIfIC FIJI such as an order for compensation or reinstatement.383 It may be possible to seek an injunction from a court to prevent unlawful discrimination, but it is unclear whether a court would have jurisdiction to award compensation or other relief through civil proceedings. The exemption of military personnel from the protections of the Decree relating to discrimination and consent to HIV testing depart from a human rights based approach. In other respects, the human rights provisions are similar to those of PNG\u2019s HIV/AIDS Management and Prevention Act 2003, which (like the provisions of Fiji\u2019s Decree) are yet to be tested in court. A lesson learnt from the development of the HIV/AIDS Decree is the importance of allocation of adequate time and resources to development of legislation, which requires consideration of realistic timeframes and financing including for community consultations. The development of the Decree took five years, involving multiple agencies within government, international technical assistance supported by UN partners, and extensive consultations.

The Pohnpei HIV Prevention and Care Act of 2007 provides for a Pohnpei HIV Council to oversee the HIV response. The Council\u2019s responsibilities include promotion and protection of the rights of people living with HIV and strict observance of medical confidentiality. The Act includes a declaration of policy at the outset as follows: 1. The State shall promote public awareness about the causes, modes of transmission, consequences and means of prevention of HIV through a comprehensive, state- wide education and information campaign organized and conducted by the state. Such campaign shall promote value formation and employ scientifically proven approaches, focus on family, as a basic social unit, support the development of appropriate skills, and be carried out in all schools, training centres, workplaces, and communities. The programme shall involve affected communities and groups including people living with HIV. 2. The state shall extend to every person believed to be or known to be infected with HIV full protection of his or her human rights and civil liberties. Towards this end: a. compulsory testing shall be considered unlawful unless otherwise provided by this Chapter; b. the right to privacy of individuals with HIV shall be guaranteed; c. discrimination, in all its forms and subtleties, against individuals with HIV, or persons perceived or believed as having HIV shall be considered inimical to individual and state interest; d. provision of appropriate health and social services for individuals with HIV shall be assured. 3. The State shall promote utmost safety and standard precautions in practices and procedures that carry the risk of HIV transmission. 4. The State shall recognize the potential role of affected individuals in propagating vital information and educational messages about HIV and shall utilize their 12.

No one shall be refused housing solely because he has a communicable disease, nor shall he be denied employment, admission to a school, or access to any other services or facilities available to the public unless Public Health finds that his disease or conduct is such that his employment at a particular job, his attendance at school, or his access to such other services or facilities presents a substantial danger to public health. 2. Notwithstanding Subsection (1), no one who has an STD shall be permitted to engage in an occupation which would regularly bring him into contact with the bodily fluids of a living person. Anyone who is found in violation of this provision shall be subject to a civil fine of not more than $1,000 in addition to any rights and remedies the afflicted person may have at law or equity. The Act also addresses confidentiality and imposes a \u2018civil fine\u2019 of $1,000 for breach of confidentiality. However, the Act provides widely drafted exceptions.

The main provisions of the Act are as follows: The purpose of the Act to be to give effect to the public interest in public safety, public welfare and public health, and to protect the rights and freedoms of others. (Section 1) Section 6 makes it unlawful to discriminate against a person on the grounds that the person is infected or affected by HIV/AIDS. (Section 6) Section 7 provides that, without limiting the generality of Section 6, an act of unlawful discrimination may take place in relation to \u2014 a. employment and contract work, b. partnerships, c. industrial and professional organizations, or other clubs and associations, d. education and training, e. detainees and persons in custody, f. provision of accommodation, including rental, hotel and guesthouse accommodation, g. surveillance or research, h. provision of or access to goods, services or public facilities. 385 This Chapter was informed by a country visit during which stakeholders were interviewed in Port Moresby in the period 24 September 2012 - 28 September 2012.

Section 23 states that intentionally transmitting or attempting to transmit HIV to another person amounts to an \u201cassault causing bodily harm\u201d under the Criminal Code, 1974, and that intentional transmission amounts to an \u201cunlawful killing\u201d under the Code. It is a 185 Part III - Country Case studIes: natIonal HIV laws In tHe PaCIfIC PAPUA NEW GUINEA defence to a charge of intentional transmission that the other person was aware of the risk of infection by HIV and voluntarily accepted that risk; or a condom or other effective means of HIV prevention was used; or the accused person was not aware of being infected with HIV. The transmission of HIV by a woman to her child before, during or after the birth of a child is excluded from these provisions. People can protect rights guaranteed under the HAMP Act by the following processes: i. lodging a complaint to the Ombudsman\u2019s Commission; or ii. lodging a claim in the District Court or National Court. Section 28 provides that a Court may make any order or declaration necessary or appropriate in the circumstances, including but not limited to, the following: a. a declaration that the act complained of is unlawful; b. an order that the act is not to be repeated or continued; c. a declaration that an act similar to the act complained of is not to be performed in future; d. an order for apology or retraction; e. an order for damages by way of compensation for any loss, damage or injury to feelings suffered by reason of the act complained of; f. an order for payment of punitive or exemplary damages; g. an order for provision or restoration of access, admission, readmission or reinstatement to the place, facility, situation, workplace or institution from which the person the object of the act complained of has been excluded, ejected or dismissed; h. an order for employment, re-employment, promotion or restoration of benefits; i. an order for provision of or restoration of access to a means of protection from infection by HIV; j. an order for the performance of any reasonable act or course of conduct to redress any loss or damage suffered by reason of the unlawful act; k. an order declaring void in whole or in part, either ab initio or from such date as may be specified in the order, any contract or agreement made in contravention of this Act; l. a declaration that the termination of a contract or agreement should be varied to redress any loss or damage suffered by reason of the termination; 186 LegaL protections against HiV-reLated Human rigHts VioLations m. a declaration that it would be inappropriate for any further action to be taken in the matter. Section 27 provides that a breach of the Act is an offence, to which the following penalties apply: i. in the case of a corporation a fine not exceeding K10,000.00; and ii. in the case of a natural person a fine not exceeding K5,000.00 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years, or both. Breach of the Act can also result in proceedings for professional misconduct under the Medical Registration Act or disciplinary offences under the Police Act, Correctional Services Act, Military Act or Public Services (Management )Act. 14.2 Implementation and enforcement of the HAMP Act 14.2.1 Cases under the HAMP Act Very few HAMP Act cases have been dealt with by the courts or the Ombudsman Commission in PNG. This is despite the fact that HIV-related stigma and discrimination remain issues of deep concern in the community, particularly in relation to women living with HIV. A study published in 2009 reported that almost half of the people living with HIV who were interviewed experienced some form of verbal abuse as a result of their status, and almost 15 percent reported physical abuse linked to being HIV-positive.386 The Stigma Index study conducted by Igat Hope confirms that", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b8de70c5-2376-4e53-ae85-f857bc37b073": {"__data__": {"id_": "b8de70c5-2376-4e53-ae85-f857bc37b073", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Legal protections against HIV-related human rights violations: Experiences and lessons learned from national HIV laws in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "23b12a42f8d8ae97b96ba5ca81572dbcfcea9cac2f3506194bfd851335cccd42"}, "3": {"node_id": "a8dd2042-e615-41e9-a5ba-209b0754ef3d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "80473746290caf0380304bdcbf789446e71c4b7ad7fb782c7ea8618dc82a2e00"}}, "hash": "e5e72c8f292743c0a961c7515280b63959f96742a3453efd0f30ec63a3467b83", "text": "stigma and discrimination are widespread in HIV-affected communities. Interviews with PLHIV in Chimbu and Mount Hagen found a high percentage of respondents who had been physically assaulted in the previous twelve months because of their HIV status. Over 50 percent said they had not attended social gatherings because of their HIV status. Being gossiped about was identified as a major problem and nearly half the respondents said they had feelings of being ashamed, guilty or blamed themselves because of their HIV status.387 Despite the extent of stigma and discrimination, very few court cases have been commenced alleging HIV-related human rights violations. The following two HAMP Act cases are reported in the law reports of the District Court: i. State v.

Benny v Yopa390 This was a defamation case that took into account the provisions of the HAMP Act in relation to stigmatization when ordering compensation. The complainant Ms Benny complained of defamatory statements made by her sister in-law Yaya Yopo. Ms Benny requested compensation for mental suffering, stress anguish, humiliation and embarrassment. The defendant made no appearance in court. It was claimed that the following defamatory statement was made at the Goroka market: \u201cmi sori long yu wantaim man bilong yu long wanem, yutupela igat sik Aids so yutupela mas igo long hausik na sekim blut.\u201d Following the statement, Ms Benny\u2019s husband divorced her or they separated. Rumours about her AIDS status circulated in the community, which caused people to shun her and her husband. The District Court found that the defamatory statement was not true, because she had attended for an HIV test, the result of which was negative. The Court found that the statement was not only defamatory but also that it \u201cstigmatized\u201d the complainant and her husband within the meaning of the HAMP Act. The judge stated: The published defamatory matters are definitely \u2018stigmatizing.\u2019 The complainant in my view has certainly been traumatized, ridiculed and has gone through a lot of hardship and suffering.

The project has been providing legal advice and representation since 2011. The PNGDLA Legal Service also conducts education and training activities for lawyers and PLHIV on the HAMP Act and other HIV-related legal issues. In 2012, lawyers from the service delivered a training session for students at the Legal Training Institute to raise awareness about the HAMP Act and other HIV-related issues. As at June 2012, PNGDLA had provided legal representation, advice and information on a total of 85 matters (14 \u2018one off\u2019 advice sessions, and 71 ongoing substantive matters). Clients included women and men living with HIV, transgender people, men who identify as gay, and women who sell sex. Approximately 20 of the 71 substantive matters related to stigma and/or discrimination. Some of these cases were settled without the need for court proceedings. As at September 2012, the PNGDLA Legal Service had represented PLHIV in relation to the following court matters: \u2022\ufffd 8 Interim Protection Order cases (under violence protection laws) \u2022\ufffd 9 HAMP Act cases (8 filed in the District Court and 1 in the National Court) \u2022\ufffd 1 bail application \u2022\ufffd 1 defence to a prosecution \u2022\ufffd 1 victim of crime.

Cases represented by other legal services An assessment of the need for HIV-related legal services conducted by IDLO in 2010 found that the Office of the Public Solicitor (OPS) had managed eight HIV-related legal cases since 2006, and the Legal Training Institute Legal Aid Program managed three HIV-related legal cases in 2010, and had managed a small number in previous years.392 IDLO reported that some of these cases were awaiting judgment and other cases were resolved out of court. OPS maintains records of cases related to HIV, however data is not specifically collected on HAMP Act matters.

The Ombudsman Commission can also accept and investigate complaints against private sector entities, but has weaker powers in relation to private organizations than public bodies.

The PNG National HIV and AIDS Strategy 2011-2015 states: The Legal Environment: The strategy recognises the challenges posed by weak enforcement of the HAMP Act and proposes that knowledge and understanding of the relevant legislation be promoted amongst partner organizations, leaders and communities. The Government\u2019s 2012 Country Progress Report to UNAIDS noted that some provincial policies are inconsistent with the HAMP Act. The report also notes that the National AIDS Council Secretariat worked in partnership with civil society organizations in hosting the first National Dialogue on HIV, Human Rights and the Law in 2011, which had a particular focus on the lack of enforcement of the HAMP Act and on other laws that criminalize those most vulnerable to HIV (sex workers and MSM).395 The Dialogue recommended that enforcement of the HAMP Act be strengthened by development of policy guidelines and an implementation framework for the Act. IDLO Needs Assessment The IDLO needs assessment on HIV-related legal services conducted in 2010 was based on interviews in Port Moresby. The needs assessment made the following findings in relation to general constraints on access to justice, (which are not specific to enforcement of rights under the HAMP Act): \u2026vulnerable populations face the following challenges in accessing justice: 394 Howse G.

Mediation has been the dispute resolution mechanism PLHIV and people affected by HIV have used for a long time. The mediation process has not always been effective for the fact that victims are not properly redressed and there are no punitive measures taken against parties who have wronged.397 In relation to the HAMP Act, the author of the environmental scan concluded as follows: Currently, I find the HAMP Act to be ineffective. This legislation was enacted for the sole purpose of protecting and managing the rights of PLHIV and the affected people. However, as it is now, we cannot say it serves its purpose.398 Criminalization of sex work and homosexuality Criminalization of \u2018prostitution\u2019 / sex work399 and homosexuality400 undermines implementation of the HAMP Act because sex workers and MSM lack trust in authorities and fear the police. Criminalization compounds the marginalization and vulnerability of these populations. There is a conflict between the HAMP Act provisions that seek to empower key HIV-affected populations to access condoms and other means of prevention, and provisions of the Penal Code and Summary Offences Act that drive the same key populations away from services. The National HIV and AIDS Strategy 2011-2015 notes that \u201claws that criminalise sex work and same-sex practices create barriers to people accessing services and reinforce vulnerability, stigma, and discrimination\u201d and recommends \u201clegislative reforms to improve the environment for effective HIV and AIDS prevention, treatment and care\u201d as a key strategic objective.401 In 2011, Cabinet requested that a review of laws governing sex work and \u2018unnatural sex\u2019 offences be undertaken by the Constitutional and Law Reform Commission.402 Access to legal aid Given that many PLHIV are unable to afford private lawyers, access to legal aid services is essential to support greater use of the HAMP Act to protect rights. Constraints to access to legal services include under-funded and under-staffed legal aid offices, excessive private lawyer fees, inaccessibility of courts and long and cumbersome court processes.403 397 Burke-Shyne N.

Independence from government means that the legal aid service can advise clients in relation to complaints against government services, including health care services and public sector employers.

Although every province now has at least a legal aid desk, OPS struggles to meet the level of demand for services and access to legal aid is often difficult for rural and remote populations.

The White Paper on Law and Justice in PNG (2007) states: The sector will ensure that all levels of the judiciary from village to national courts appreciate and observe the principles laid down in the HIV and AIDS Management and Prevention Act and, in partnership with other key players, will support citizens to invoke the law where appropriate. Internally, the sector is largely made up of men in leadership positions whose influence can be mobilized to promote an understanding between their peers of the role that men can play in fighting the epidemic both in terms of prevention and care.405 Review, 40(1), 1-24. 404 There are OPS branches in Port Moresby, Lae, Madang, Goroka, Mt Hagen, Wabag, kokopo, Kimbe and Buka.

These issues included: i. Inclusion of references to the international human rights treaties that PNG has ratified and the International Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights in a preface to the Act; ii.

She has missed a lot of days at work and sometimes she has to go home early to rest. Her boss has hired another receptionist to relieve her.

Joint project of UNDP Pacific Centre, Regional Rights Resource Team SPC and UNAIDS, March 2009. http://www. undppc.org.fj/_resources/article/files/PNG_HIV_Ethics_and_HR_review_of_legislation.pdf 411 Ibid. 412 NACS (2004), HIV/AIDS Management and Prevention Act: A User\u2019s Guide, Port Moresby: National AIDS Council Secretariat (2004), p.6. 196 LegaL protections against HiV-reLated Human rigHts VioLations be regarded by a PLHIV (or person with another medical condition) as detrimental treatment, because of resulting reduced job satisfaction, less opportunities for promotion etc. There is a risk that the exception might be applied to justify discrimination that violates human rights. For example, applying the exception could excuse an employer who enforces a policy of dismissing any people diagnosed with a potentially life-threatening condition (cancer, heart disease, HIV) even if the reason was just to save money on absences and sick leave, or because the employer wanted to ensure \u2018healthy looking\u2019 staff. An alternative to the exception of Section 6(3) would be to incorporate an obligation on employers, and other duty bearers such as service providers and schools, to make reasonable adjustments or reasonable accommodation to the person\u2019s disability. Such an obligation is required by human rights principles and the commitments of States under international law. The International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability (signed by PNG in 2011) requires disability laws to include obligations to accommodate a person\u2019s disability, and defines \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d to mean: necessary and appropriate modification and adjustments not imposing a disproportionate or undue burden, where needed in a particular case, to ensure to persons with disabilities the enjoyment or exercise on an equal basis with others of all human rights and fundamental freedoms.413 iii. Removal of the legal requirement to disclose HIV status to sexual partners Section 24 of the HAMP Act imposes a legal requirement on PLHIV to both disclose their HIV status to their sexual partners and to take all reasonable measures and precautions to prevent the transmission of HIV to others, including the use of a condom. This provision may at first appear to be helpful to protect vulnerable women from men who fail to disclose their HIV status and do not use condoms.

Enabling the Village Courts to address HAMP Act cases Village Courts have no jurisdiction to enforce the HAMP Act. In 2008, Howse argued that the HAMP Act should be amended to enable people to bring complaints under the Act in Village Courts, which are much more accessible to ordinary citizens than the District Courts and National Court.416 Stakeholder interviewed in 2012 expressed differing views about how to support the Village Courts to play a greater role in addressing HIV-related matters. Some stakeholders recommended amendment to the HAMP Act. Others were of the view that the Village Courts could be supported in exercising existing powers to address HIV-related cases, without a change to the law (see 14.3.2 and recommendations at 14.4). 415 See HIV/AIDS Bill 2007 India, Section 24. 416 Howse G.

Violence protection orders for key populations and women and children affected by HIV Violence protection laws such as sexual offence legislation and child protection laws offer important legal protections for women and children, which may also reduce HIV vulnerability. However, gender inequality is a cultural norm affecting the willingness of police to act to protect women, and this is a major obstacle to effective law enforcement. 199 Part III - Country Case studIes: natIonal HIV laws In tHe PaCIfIC PAPUA NEW GUINEA Women and girls are often reluctant to report sexual assault due to fears of ostracism or reprisals from family and clan members. Survivors of family and sexual violence may seek protection orders under Section 209 and 210 of the District Courts Act (Chapter 40). In 2009, rules were issued under Section 21A of the District Courts Act to enable Interim Protection Orders to be made rapidly and at no cost to the applicant.417 In practice, the District Courts consider applications for violence protection orders under these general rules much more frequently than applications under the HIV-specific provisions of the HAMP Act. For example, in the case Nap v. Nap,418 the District Court issued orders under the District Courts Act that the complainant\u2019s husband be of good behavior and refrain from having sexual intercourse with his wife until an HIV test result confirmation was returned (see also, violence protection order issued in Aitakoe v Akita419). Provisions in relation to protection of children are found in the Lukautim Pikinini (Child Protection) Act 2007. Kapul Champions (a CBO for men who have sex with men (MSM)) emphasized the need for MSM to have access to violence protection services and independent complaints mechanisms for addressing police abuses. It may be possible to sue a person for defamation if the person is spreading rumours about another person\u2019s HIV status that have no basis in truth. In the case Umben v. Suku,420 Christine Umben was awarded K2,000.00 to compensate for injury to her reputation as a result of the defendant\u2019s conduct in falsely stating to a third party that she had acquired a \u201cbad disease\u201d, understood to be AIDS. Some women living with or affected by HIV in PNG have been victims of sorcery-related killings, due to assumptions that they have been involved in sorcery leading to HIV- related deaths. Widows or women without family to protect them are disproportionately affected by sorcery-related violence in PNG. Amnesty International has called for repeal of the Sorcery Act and for strengthened legal responses to sorcery-related killings and HIV education of communities to address myths and misinformation.421 There is an ongoing debate as to whether sorcery-related threats and killings should be punished under specific legislation (i.e., Sorcery Act 1971) or general provisions of the Penal Code.422 14.3.2 Village Courts The role of Village Courts Village Courts are established under the Village Courts Act and are the lowest level of the formal court system.

Where custom and the Constitution conflict, the Constitution takes priority. For instance, although it may be consistent with local custom to order that a woman returns to her husband against her will, such an order is unconstitutional.425 The National AIDS Council Secretariat (NACS) and UNDP conducted an assessment of HIV and gender-based violence service providers in PNG in 2012. The study was conducted in the provinces of Western Highlands, Simbu, East Sepik, Madang and the Autonomous Region of Bougainville. The study made the following observations in relation to Village Courts: Village Courts are the most accessible and responsive form of legal intervention in most rural areas. However, women do not perceive village courts as fair and believe decisions are weighted against them. Different jurisdictions of village and district courts were not well understood by village court magistrates or the community. Village Court magistrates\u2019 access to ongoing training is limited. While some female magistrates have been appointed in all provinces studied, there is a long way to go before gender balance is achieved.426 423 National AIDS Council Secretariat (NACS) (2012), Global AIDS Report 2012 Country Progress Report: Papua New Guinea.

Several projects have been implemented that have included consideration of the role of Village Courts in addressing HIV and human rights at community level: \u2022\ufffd FHI conducted a project on application of the principles of the HAMP Act to Village Courts. \u2022\ufffd The Customs Project implemented by the Village Courts Secretariat in Manus has explored the ways in which custom can evolve so as to support understanding of issues such as human rights, HIV and the status of women. \u2022\ufffd UNICEF is conducting a human rights project in Simbu, Eastern Highlands, Milne Bay, East Sepik, Southern Highlands and Enga provinces, with a focus on building the capacity of Village Courts in protecting the rights of women and children. This project includes consideration of violence protection, HIV and related human rights issues.428 \u2022\ufffd The Poro Sapot Project of Save the Children Fund supports sex workers and MSM to seek protection at the village or urban settlement level if they experience threats, harassment or violence. The project raises awareness of the specific issues faced by these populations among community leaders and reported that ward counsellors or Village Courts regularly resolve cases through mediation. The Village Courts Secretariat (VCS) promotes capacity development of Village Court magistrates and officials, and has included consideration of HIV in training on violence protection and gender. VCS has been instrumental in increasing the number of female magistrates to over 3,000, representing 35 per cent of magistrates. The VCS recognises that customary law is dynamic and evolves in response to new developments, such as the community and family impacts of HIV. The VCS emphasises the role of Village Courts in working with other local institutions to provide leadership and to shape norms on issues of community concern such as HIV.

Complicated forms are not required and access is not prohibitively expensive. Small awards of compensation can be made.429 However, interviews with the VCS confirmed that the VCS does not want Village Courts to be given the same mandate as the District Courts to address discrimination in institutional settings such as employment, schools and hospitals, or to have a role in ordering HIV tests or addressing non-consensual HIV testing at clinics. Such issues are appropriately dealt with at the District Court level. The VCS is supportive however of other efforts to ensure that implementation of powers under the Village Courts Act aligns with the objectives of the HAMP Act in relation to reducing stigma. Currently HIV-related complaints are addressed by Village Courts under general provisions relating to insults and keeping the peace. Village Court Magistrates are able to issue orders under existing power to compensate people who have been subject to insults or harassment, and preventive orders to stop harassment or insults being repeated. There is some overlap between the HAMP Act provisions that empower District Courts to address stigmatization (which includes vilifying a person living with HIV in public), and the role of Village Courts in hearing cases involving use of insulting words and breach of the peace. UNAIDS stated that Village Courts are generally clear about their role in addressing HIV- related complaints by applying one of the specific offences that they are authorized to address \u2013 although there may be some issues in practical implementation that could be clarified. Igat Hope emphasised the need for clear referral pathways, so that Village Court officials refer PLHIV directly to legal aid or a District Court if they experience discrimination more appropriately dealt with in the District Court. It appears that the most important immediate priority is to integrate consideration of HIV-related issues within the general measures being undertaken to improve the capacity of Village Court Magistrates and officials in applying gender equality and other human rights principles in their work. 429 Ibid. 203 Part III - Country Case studIes: natIonal HIV laws In tHe PaCIfIC PAPUA NEW GUINEA Data on HIV cases addressed by Village Courts VCS collects data on the number of HIV cases through the Village Courts and Land Mediation Information Management System. Ninety-two complaints were recorded in the period 2007-2011. It is probable that this is an under-estimate, as many cases with an HIV aspect are likely to have been reported under another category (e.g., disturbing the peace, insult or family conflict). The following data was collected through research on HIV in the Village Court system in 2011:430 During 2010 and 2011 an audit of selected Village Courts in the National Capital District (NCD) was undertaken. The Village Courts visited were: Gerehu, Morata, Evedaha, Kaugere, Hohola, Tokarara and Nine Mile. Findings included: i. In the Village Court Secretariat Database there are nine cases listed for NCD. The courts where these are recorded are Morata, Nine Mile and Evedaha, however a total of 12 cases were identified during visits. Kaugere and Gerehu were both able to demonstrate cases related to HIV&AIDS which were not reflected in the information contained in the Village Court Secretariat database. The cases in Gerehu and Kaugere do not appear in the database as they were not marked as related to HIV&AIDS on the quarterly return. The clerk at Gerehu was able to remember the case and locate it in the register book where is was recorded as being related to HIV. The clerk at Kaugere also remembered their case.

It is likely that the cases recorded in the Village Court Secretariat database underrepresent the actual number of cases being dealt with by the Village Courts.

It is possible there are many more cases related to HIV being seen in the Village Court that are not being reported. iii. Although the Village Court database records six cases from Nine Mile Village Court, registers could not be located to verify any details related to these cases. There is a combined quarterly return from Nine Mile Village Court for Quarter 2 and 3 of 2010, which lists 65 cases related to HIV and AIDS.

There were no cases involving PLHIV identified relating to eviction from accommodation, being fired from employment, being rejected from their family, being refused permission to go to school, marriage dissolution, family and sexual violence, sorcery or intentional or reckless HIV transmission. 14.3.3 Constitutional rights and the Human Rights Track of the National Court There are no reports of court cases being brought to protect HIV-related human rights based on the human rights guarantees contained in the Constitution. The Constitution contains sixteen basic rights and freedoms, including rights to life, freedom from inhuman treatment, liberty of the person, freedom of expression, freedom of association, privacy, freedom of employment, freedom of information, freedom of movement and equality. There is no general right of access to health in PNG, although the HAMP Act includes a right of access to the means of HIV prevention (Section 11). However, the National Goals and Directive Principles declare as the first Goal that every person develop as a whole person through improvement in the level of nutrition and the standard of public health to enable people to attain self-fulfilment. According to Talao, \u201cthis in itself places an obligation on the Government to ensure the provision of health services as a minimum pre-condition to good health\u201d.431 However, the National Goals and Directive Principles are not enforceable in a court of law. The Human Rights Track of the National Court was established in 2011 to provide a fast track process for redressing human rights violations. The Human Rights Track allows people to submit complaints related to human rights violations directly to the National Court without having to go through the police or engage lawyers. Establishment of the Human Rights Track presents a new opportunity for advancing the rights of PLHIV. A priority should be given to raising awareness about the Human Rights Track among communities of PLHIV and key populations (sex workers and MSM), and among lawyers. Although the National Court\u2019s Human Rights Rules (2010) do not specifically refer to the HAMP Act, a claim of discrimination, stigmatization, breach of privacy or non-consensual testing could be made through the Human Rights Track on the ground that it constitutes a breach of a Basic Right guaranteed by the Constitution.432 431 Talao F. (2008), op cit., p.20. 432 Relevant Basic Rights include right to freedom (s 32); right to life (s 35); freedom from inhuman treatment (s 36); protection of the law (s 37); liberty of the person (s 42); freedom from arbitrary search and entry (s 44); freedom of expression (s 46); (xi) freedom of assembly and association (s 47);", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fde8f6ac-ff33-42a3-8a92-1bb9a5c8f599": {"__data__": {"id_": "fde8f6ac-ff33-42a3-8a92-1bb9a5c8f599", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Legal protections against HIV-related human rights violations: Experiences and lessons learned from national HIV laws in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f748e0212a400df376295289e6f1ab6cda75ba0821423c014a20df298136dd70"}, "3": {"node_id": "64d6e616-dcaf-4464-9f7b-f211cdc9cb99", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dec069636ec4f495ec32546d0abca3cbfcc9ea96ecdc36fe990da6591875ce73"}}, "hash": "f51181ec0c1b58b178fec287c14e6be0a049fb566c8a696121efcfafacafb6f8", "text": "(xii) freedom of 205 Part III - Country Case studIes: natIonal HIV laws In tHe PaCIfIC PAPUA NEW GUINEA 14.4 Conclusions and recommendations The HAMP Act enshrines the human rights principles underpinning the national HIV response in legislation, particularly the rights to non-discrimination, privacy, informed consent and to access means of protection such as condoms and lubricant. The existence of the HAMP Act has provided a framework for educational measures to be taken to combat stigma and discrimination and to reduce the likelihood of human rights violations occurring. For example, many employers have introduced workplace policies that reference the HAMP Act, and over 1,000 employers have received training from the Business Coalition Against HIV/AIDS (BAHA) on the HAMP Act. BAHA rely on the HAMP Act as the basis of much of their educational and advocacy activities with corporations, including intervening to help companies and employees resolve workplace issues without the need to resort to the legal system. However, at a practical level, very few PLHIV have been able to use the HAMP Act to obtain a remedy for specific incidents of human rights violations. Many of the obstacles to use of the HAMP Act are the same as those confronted by all citizens seeking to access the PNG justice system \u2013 the expense of lawyers, lack of legal aid services, the limited reach of the courts to rural areas, court delays and complexity of the formal legal system. Some obstacles are specific to HIV, particularly the fear that engaging a lawyer and taking a matter to court will only lead to further experiences of stigma and disclosure of HIV status in the community or media. Although there may be benefits from updating the HAMP Act at a future date, there is much else that can be done to strengthen implementation. Christine Stewart (who was involved in drafting the HAMP Act) points to the limitations of law reform by itself as a strategy to address human rights issues in the context of PNG: (A) legal regime is at best no more than an enabling device. It is only the first step in a three-stage process. The second is implementation. The third is the monitoring and, where necessary, enforcement of implementation. Even the best law reform cannot achieve, by several strokes of the pen, such wholesale social change as the empowerment of women. Nor can law reforms reach all levels of society. This is all the more so in a country such as Papua New Guinea, with over 800 different societies, most of them located both physically and conceptually far from the centre of government power; where the provision of government services is inexorably deteriorating and economic opportunities are limited; where the introduced common law system competes with or has achieved uneasy syncretism with custom and its more modern manifestation \u2018customary law\u2019; and where state law, if it has penetrated to any degree at all, is ill-understood and inadequately applied by law and justice institutions and enforcers.433 employment (s 48); (xiii) right to privacy (s 49); (xiv) right to vote and stand for public office (s 50); (xv) right to freedom of information (s 51); (xvi) right to freedom of movement (s 52); (xvii) protection from unjust deprivation of property (s 53); (xviii) equality (s 55). 433 Stewart C., (2010), op cit., p.277. 206 LegaL protections against HiV-reLated Human rigHts VioLations Recommendations Leadership and coordination i. Implementation of recommendations listed below requires leadership from government at all levels. NACS has a role in ensuring Provincial AIDS Councils are supported in addressing the legal and human rights aspects of the epidemic. Coordination across government requires the engagement of the Minister for Health and HIV/AIDS, the Minister for Community Development, Religion and Youth and the Minister for Justice and Attorney General. UNDP has a role in briefing senior officials and key Ministers. This should include briefing in relation to the conflict between the aspirations of the HAMP Act and the obstacles to HIV prevention created by laws and police practices relating to sex work and homosexuality. It is particularly important that there is ownership of HIV-related human rights issues in the law and justice sector. HIV-related human rights issues and the HAMP Act are sometimes misunderstood as issues only for the National AIDS Council, rather than responsibilities of all sectors of government.

Regulations should be promulgated that provide detailed guidance for specific sectors, such as schools, health care services and prisons, and to address specific issues of concern such as approaches to provision of pre-test information in the context of provider-initiated counselling and testing (PICT). This does not require going back to Parliament and would promote understanding and ownership of the Act\u2019s requirements. The implementation of the PICT approach to HIV testing in health facilities requires active monitoring to ensure that requirements for pre-test information and post-test support are met. This is particularly important as efforts are increasingly focused on promoting \u2018test and treat\u2019 as both a treatment and prevention approach. Concerns have been raised that implementation of the PICT approach could give rise to non- consensual testing, particularly in ante-natal settings. v. Should the HAMP Act be updated, it could be strengthened by: \u2022\ufffd Removal of the defence that allows discrimination no more detrimental than for other serious conditions. \u2022\ufffd Strengthening the anti-discrimination provisions of the Act by including a requirement of reasonable adjustment or accommodation to the needs of the PLHIV, as required by the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. \u2022\ufffd Removal of the legal requirement to disclose HIV status to sexual partners. \u2022\ufffd A specific provision clarifying responsibility for provision of legal aid for PLHIV seeking to enforce rights under the Act, education of PLHIV about their rights, and monitoring of implementation and enforcement of the Act. vi. The National Human Rights Commission Bill, which the government aims to table in parliament in 2013, will define the powers of the National Human Rights Commission to accept complaints and resolve disputes. This will provide an alternative to the more formal processes of the District Court and National Court. The National Human Rights Commission should be specifically empowered to address HAMP Act violations, so as to provide PLHIV with a more accessible alternative than the formal courts. The National Human Rights Commission Bill could include \u2018consequential amendments\u2019 to the HAMP Act to achieve this outcome. The National Human Rights Commission should also be given responsibility for promoting HAMP Act human rights protections to PLHIV communities, as well as the human rights protections of the Constitution. vii. It is not recommended that the HAMP Act be amended to enable Village Courts to exercise a specific mandate under the HAMP Act (e.g., to address unlawful discrimination and HIV testing issues). Rather than law reform, formal guidance should be issued and training provided to Village Court magistrates and officials regarding the application of a human rights-based approach in the exercise of existing Village Court powers (in relation to disturbing the peace, spreading false reports, insults etc.) to resolve HIV-related disputes. Guidance and training can focus on issues such as promotion of gender equality, and respect for privacy and the 208 LegaL protections against HiV-reLated Human rigHts VioLations specific needs of key HIV-affected populations such as MSM and sex workers. General efforts to strengthen the capacity of Village Courts to apply human rights-based approaches will help the Village Court system to offer improved", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f9278681-f534-42dd-b447-f7ead1da253c": {"__data__": {"id_": "f9278681-f534-42dd-b447-f7ead1da253c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Legal protections against HIV-related human rights violations: Experiences and lessons learned from national HIV laws in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5c7dc0b4c1c925ec6d7dad7e9c31a650960301e6c3a3af86f648e9e9c7e635f5"}, "3": {"node_id": "894f35d5-c888-4f7a-ac35-2047c642a681", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "808d1e97763e874334fc372d454ea51b67f473a479794c5000f1af5acf211432"}}, "hash": "0b68e14016ab0bf928a1d82d72acc01b9ec48c6c33a14dc5340ce29b722cbb12", "text": "justice to PLHIV and key populations. Strengthening the capacity of Village Court magistrates to protect women and girls from violence and to make decisions that are sensitive to the needs of PLHIV and key populations will help to promote a rights-based approach. HIV should be addressed within general measures undertaken to improve the capacity of Village Court magistrates and officials to apply human rights principles such as gender equality to their work. Legal aid viii. Government partners and donors should support a model in which PLHIV can choose to access legal aid either from government services (i.e., OPS) or from non- government legal services (e.g., PNGDLA legal service). PLHIV are likely to be more confident in attending a non-government legal aid service if they are seeking advice about a complaint against government. It is important for PLHIV to have access to legal aid from non-government services so that fully independent advice can be provided about taking legal action against government agencies that violate human rights. The OPS should ensure that all OPS staff are sensitized on HIV and are aware of rights and responsibilities under the HAMP Act. Rights education & HIV sensitization ix. Community legal education Programmes that educate PLHIV about their legal rights under the HAMP Act and how to enforce these rights through the legal system are essential to support greater use of the law to protect rights. The PNG-Australia Law and Justice Partnership has developed pamphlets on HIV-related rights. In addition to written materials, PLHIV communities would benefit from educational sessions e.g., presentations provided by paralegals or trained peer educators through community outreach. There is a need for a user friendly guide on the HAMP Act and other mechanisms for HIV-related human rights protection (e.g., Human Rights Track of the National Court) that explains how to lodge a complaint and achieve redress, and the practical application of the Act in different sectors \u2013 identifying the specific responsibilities of health professionals, people in the community, police, prison officials, educational institutions, landlords etc. The peer education approach of Save the Children Fund\u2019s Project and Igat Hope have been effective in promoting awareness of rights among people living with HIV, sex workers and MSM. In addition to targeted rights education for PLHIV and key populations, broader community education on HIV should include anti-stigma messages, avoid relying on fear as a motivation for behaviour change, and should depict positive and empowering images of people living with HIV. It is important to recruit local community leaders to provide education in the local vernacular to combat stigma and discrimination, (rather than using foreign sportsmen or imported campaigns). NACS emphasized the need for such campaigns to occur to provide a more 209 Part III - Country Case studIes: natIonal HIV laws In tHe PaCIfIC PAPUA NEW GUINEA supportive social climate for PLHIV to come forward and challenge discrimination in the courts. x. Legal profession Education of lawyers, prosecutors and the judiciary on HIV and the HAMP Act will support greater use of the law to protect rights. Education and training should include information on the community impacts of HIV, the specific impacts on the human rights of key populations (sex workers and MSM) and women and girls (e.g., exposure to violence), and use of the HAMP Act, enforcement of constitutional rights, and the Human Rights Track of the National Court to address violations of the rights of PLHIV. Guest speakers (such as staff of the PNGDLA Legal Service) have provided information on HIV on an ad hoc basis to law students at the Legal Training Institute. This should be provided in a more systematic way through inclusion of HIV-related issues in the Legal Training Institute curriculum. xi. A priority should be given to sensitizing Village Court magistrates on human rights- based approaches to resolution of cases involving HIV-related issues. Data on HIV- related cases addressed by Village Courts should be systematically analysed by the VCS to inform education and training. xii. The Judicial Education Committee or equivalent body should be encouraged to provide educational resources to the judiciary on jurisprudence relating to HIV, human rights and gender-based violence and opportunities for training on these issues. xiii. Parliamentarians and other duty bearers HIV issues should be mainstreamed within the work of parliamentary committees to ensure broader ownership of HIV-related human rights issues among legislators.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "894f35d5-c888-4f7a-ac35-2047c642a681": {"__data__": {"id_": "894f35d5-c888-4f7a-ac35-2047c642a681", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Legal protections against HIV-related human rights violations: Experiences and lessons learned from national HIV laws in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5c7dc0b4c1c925ec6d7dad7e9c31a650960301e6c3a3af86f648e9e9c7e635f5"}, "2": {"node_id": "f9278681-f534-42dd-b447-f7ead1da253c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b68e14016ab0bf928a1d82d72acc01b9ec48c6c33a14dc5340ce29b722cbb12"}}, "hash": "808d1e97763e874334fc372d454ea51b67f473a479794c5000f1af5acf211432", "text": "HIV is relevant to the work of several parliamentary committees, including those addressing health and welfare, education, justice, gender and employment.

Legal systems of Asia and the Pacific The legal systems of the region are highly diverse. Broadly, there are four major legal systems: civil law, common law, religious law and customary law. Each country is unique and may combine elements of these four categories. In civil law systems, the central sources of law are codes enacted by legislatures. Civil law applies in the former French colonies of the Mekong sub-region, Indonesia, New Caledonia and French Polynesia. Socialist law is an adaptation of civil law that applies in the communist countries of East Asia (Viet Nam, Lao PDR, People\u2019s Republic of China, and Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea). Chinese law is a mixture of civil law and socialist law. In common law systems, law is made through a combination of decisions of judges (\u201ccase law\u201d) and legislation enacted by parliament. Common law systems operate in the former British colonies including Australia, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Fiji, Hong Kong SAR (China), Singapore, Solomon Islands, Samoa, Tonga and Papua New Guinea. In addition to these countries, others have adapted the common law system into a mixed system e.g., Malaysia, Sri Lanka. India follows a mixture of common law and customary or religious law. In India, separate personal law codes apply to Muslims, Christians and Hindus. The Pacific island countries and territories adopted legal systems from British, French or American colonisers. Some also adopted legislation from Australia or New Zealand. In most Pacific island countries, customary law systems also operate that incorporate norms and values based on pre-colonial customs and traditions. Customary law is often more important than state law in resolving local and family disputes, particularly in rural and remote communities.

There appear to be no data at all on HIV rates among trans* men, an emerging identity group. The number of trans* people of either gender who have died of AIDS, or what proportion they represent of overall AIDS-related deaths, is unknown. The regional HIV epidemic among trans* people is strongly linked to stigma and prejudice. This review, focusing on the literature post-2000, seeks to examine literature on laws, regulations, policies and practices that prompt, reinforce, reflect or express stigma and prejudice towards trans* people. It seeks to identify vulnerabilities to HIV and barriers to access or uptake of HIV related healthcare services, and attempts to establish a research agenda aimed at providing the sort of data that will enable a reduction in future risk, as well as better access to treatment, care and support for trans* people living with HIV. Research on Asia-Pacific trans* people, scattered and often small-scale, has tended to focus on young and urban communities of trans* women, and has neglected the elderly and rural, as well as trans* men.3 That said, the research indicates that stigma and prejudice are major problems for trans* people, and are rooted in a range of beliefs (either traditional or modern, depending on the culture concerned) about sexuality and gender norms and nonconformity. The stigma and prejudice appear to put large numbers of trans* people onto a slope (a \u2018stigma-sickness slope\u2019), prompting patterns of discrimination, harassment and abuse (verbal, sexual and physical) in the family, at school, in the workplace, in the provision of services (including health) and in society more broadly (including in the law and law enforcement). Trans* people commonly report dropping out of or being excluded from education, and experiencing difficulty in finding, keeping and advancing in employment. Trans* people become marginalized, both socially and economically. Asia-Pacific legal environments serve to marginalize trans* people further, failing to offer trans* people sufficient protection against discrimination (or indeed against the more serious forms of sexual assault), and discriminating by withholding either practical or legal recognition of self-affirmed gender, criminalising trans* people\u2019s sexual or gendered behaviours, and subjecting trans* people to gender-inappropriate detention or incarceration practices, as well as contributing to police abuses. There is good reason to believe, in the absence of much Asia-Pacific research in this area, 1 Following the practice of organizations such as GATE (Global Action for Trans*-Equality) the term trans* people is used as an open-ended social umbrella term, rather than a descriptor of a specific identity or cultural classification, acknowledging the wide range of identities, and identity-based communities, within this population and across the Asia-Pacific region. 2 Based upon 2010 UN population data for the region, and an estimate that 0.3 percent region wide may fall within the definition for being transgender. See main body of report for more detail. 3 Trans* women here are birth-assigned males identifying and/or presenting as female, or (in those cultures in which it is accepted that there are more than two genders) as members of another broadly feminised gender.

Although many trans* women in the region appear quite badly informed about HIV risks, it is clear that many of those who are well-informed nevertheless engage in unsafe sexual practices. There is little research to indicate why. The lack of information on these matters mirrors more general (and global) ignorance on risks associated with neo-vaginal intercourse and lubricants (especially those that are not water-based and developed for lubrication during sex), and of how trans* women\u2019s use of cross-sex hormones, hormone blockers and silicon injections, or their cis-male partners\u2019 use of penile implants and drugs for erectile dysfunction might raise trans* people\u2019s HIV vulnerability.4 Across much of the Asia-Pacific region, many trans* women engage in sex work at some point in their lives. It is likely trans* men also do sex work, providing services as female sex workers (FSWs) or as male sex workers (MSWs). In each case (trans* women and trans* men) the numbers of trans* sex workers (TSWs) remain uncertain. It is highly likely that sex work raises their HIV risk, though little work has been done in this area, especially to examine the ways in which different reasons for and patterns of sex work might contribute to risk. Across the region, there are numerous reports documenting problems in healthcare for trans* women - whether for general, transition or sexual health. The challenges facing trans* men remain severely under-researched. Trans* people approaching health services commonly report that providers are uncooperative or hostile with staff addressing or responding to the trans* person in a gender inappropriate way, adopting a mocking or ridiculing attitude, withholding or refusing healthcare, or even offering \u2018reparative\u2019 treatments. Providers may lack competence in regard to trans* health care. Services are often difficult to access or costly. Costs, especially in regard to transition healthcare, serve to push trans* people towards sex work. Trans* people often seek out whatever health services there may be, relying on word-of-mouth recommendations. They pay for whatever transition they can afford; gender affirming surgeries, implants and/or high- quality silicone injections (for those trans* people that have the money), or (traditional or backyard) castration and/or industrial quality silicone from medically unqualified \u2018fillers\u2019 and \u2018pumpers\u2019 (for those on a budget). Some take care of their own healthcare needs as best they can (e.g. getting hormones wherever and whenever they can and taking them with little or no medical supervision). Those who seek gender affirming surgeries find that they are likely to be the most expensive procedures they ever undergo. Requirements for psychiatric evaluation before provision of hormones and/or surgery may add to the expense. Public subsidies for gender affirming surgeries are rare. In many countries transition-related surgeries (especially gonado-genital) are simply unavailable or else are prohibitively expensive. For some communities castration has proved to be 4 Cisgender people identify and present in a way that is congruent with their birth-assigned sex. Cis-male refers to birth-assigned male who identifies and presents as male. Executive Summary 3 a much cheaper, and more easily available, route to feminisation (or more precisely, emasculation). Trans* people often find that sexual healthcare services are not suited to their needs, focused instead on female and (more recently) on gay men and other MSM. The challenges facing trans* men again remain severely under-researched. Trans* women are likely to be denied women\u2019s services, and even turned away from MSM services. Confidentiality is not always assured, especially in regard to mandatory HIV testing for sex workers. HIV positivity often compounds the problems in accessing appropriate care. Trans* women (perhaps especially TSWs where sex work is stigmatized or illegal) are often reluctant to seek sexual healthcare services, unless and until they experience a symptomatic sexually transmitted infection (STI). Across the region, few trans* people step forward for HIV testing. The failure to address trans* people\u2019s sexual health needs is to some extent symptomatic of a more general failure extending across the broader sexual minority spectrum.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bde44586-b475-48c3-9a95-202e70c9fc46": {"__data__": {"id_": "bde44586-b475-48c3-9a95-202e70c9fc46", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Lost in Transition: Transgender People, Rights and HIV Vulnerability in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d593c7dc0b4f33b3272bf0c592ce293a8daa8a1009b724ec107801c71b977697"}, "2": {"node_id": "e8bd5fbe-cccb-4a09-b6d7-b87be78a2922", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e112d814cbc5f208fc5c32d7082b4ee4757055fa89db2a663cf38cfd22fe171c"}}, "hash": "522e286a0e635db5bf68409bec1365c8f78fae1ffd4ffad1491387267bd4b887", "text": "However, it is also clear that throughout much of the history of the global HIV response, trans* people have been invisibilised; in that they have seldom been properly recognised as a distinct population for purposes of confronting the HIV pandemic.

It often conflicts with the identities of their partners as heterosexual, or \u2018real men\u2019. Trans* men again have been completely left out of any kind of reporting; even trans* men who have sex with men (TMSM), a group which (ironically, and unlike trans* women) are best thought of as a sub-group of MSM. To some extent NGOs and CBOs have in recent years stepped in to provide sexual health services. However many in trans* communities region-wide remain out of the reach of these services, and their work of these organizations has sometimes been hindered through actions of police and officials who harass both the providers and recipients of these services, detaining outreach workers, confiscating materials, and raiding offices and events. There is an increasing tendency for trans* people to be seen as communities distinct from MSM. The increasing ability of Asia-Pacific trans* communities, especially trans* feminine communities, to organise themselves for advocacy can only help this process along. In this regard trans* men lag behind their female counterparts. A research agenda is proposed that can facilitate reduction in future HIV risk for trans* people, as well as promoting better access to treatment, care and support for transgender persons living with HIV in the Asia-Pacific region. Donors may want to bear this agenda in mind when making funds available for research, or assessing individual research proposals. Recommendations are that: 1. Researchers (particularly those involved in HIV-related health and rights research) should work to end the invisibility of trans* people, researching them in their own right and, when necessary, disaggregating them from other groups in a research study. This will enable the building of a data base on trans* people\u2019s HIV vulnerabilities Transgender persons, Human Rights and HIV vulnerability in Asia and the Pacific 4 and healthcare needs. Research should seek to recognise diversity within trans* communities, and the existence of hitherto under-researched communities of trans* people; in particular the elderly and rural, as well as trans* men, about whose life circumstances and needs little is known. 2. Researchers should avoid letting cisgenderism (a way of thinking that demeans trans* people and privileges those who are not transgender) enter their research work, and note it in other\u2019s research, bearing in mind that such practices can reinforce stigma and prejudice, and undermine trans* people\u2019s claims for gender rights. 3. Researchers should engage with trans* people as partners, involving them as key members of research teams, paid on an equal-pay-for-equal-work basis alongside their cisgender colleagues. This helps avoid cisgenderism, facilitates more informed and sensitive research, and helps build researcher capacity. Research capacity can also be enhanced by improved access to international research (translated and summarised where necessary). 4. Research is needed that attempts to ascertain or estimate how many trans* people there are across the region, including elderly and rural trans* people, trans* men, and trans* sex workers (male and female). With good population data for trans* people (including for TSWs), and good HIV prevalence data, it should be easier to plan targeted health services, including HIV prevention programmes. 5. Research (especially multidisciplinary) is needed which seeks to understand the HIV vulnerabilities of trans* people, especially key populations like trans* sex workers, the young, the elderly, and the rural. Trans* men, hitherto little studied, are another key population. Among potentially important research studies are those which throw more light on patterns of sexual behaviour, and some of the ways in which those patterns of behaviour may impact on HIV risk. Another important initiative would be a central data base documenting rights violations against trans* people, as well as research which aims to understand more fully the nature of life on the stigma- sickness slope. Multi-disciplinary, comprehensive, large-scale and longitudinal research may be particularly valuable, enabling a more thorough assessment of the effects of stigma, discrimination, harassment, abuse and marginalization upon trans* people\u2019s lives, and making possible an examination of the impact of changes in laws and law enforcement. 6. Research is needed that goes beyond risk factors for trans* people and looks instead at protective factors and personal qualities conferring upon trans* people resilience against the effects of stigma and prejudice, discrimination, harassment and abuse, and consequent marginalization.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2211a587-e472-4db0-9f62-6dffc853ba7a": {"__data__": {"id_": "2211a587-e472-4db0-9f62-6dffc853ba7a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Lost in Transition: Transgender People, Rights and HIV Vulnerability in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f1c8f9b7f5c0aaec2f225d46066da29f0ecf3d76c2315fda8a4595ad09c8f663"}, "2": {"node_id": "8d2286e4-14eb-41af-908a-2b46c20952ce", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9334ca6e1b9ddcd70845ef58d4d7fc8b82786f0b9048b019553048ba803237e6"}}, "hash": "bad6ed296c7d15098705f52c34dab97f96e01fad38252fc96c337f78193f2abf", "text": "Research of this sort may facilitate the development of programmes that help trans* people avoid slipping down the stigma-sickness slope, as well as countering a view of trans* people as passive victims. 7.

There is a need to document information about innovative and good practice in regard to efforts to help the public (and key social agents such as police, judiciary, health workers, teachers, and various media etc) become better informed regarding trans* people, and more sensitive to their needs. Such research, properly disseminated, may prove useful in helping CBOs to develop more effective (and scaled up) education campaigns. 9. It is important to document the ways in which key conventions, declarations, court judgements and juridical and jurisprudential reports can be used to advance the rights of trans* people across the Asia-Pacific, and to find ways in which transgender communities across the region (and their advocates) can use that information in ways that make sense in the societies in which they live. 10. It is important to document means (both well-established and innovatory) by which trans* communities can effectively get access to important health information. Also useful would be research aimed at identifying ways of getting health information to the hard to reach in trans* communities \u2013 particularly the elderly and the rural, who may neither be members of community groups nor linked to the internet, and may have limited literacy. 11. Research is needed which documents good practice in the provision of trans* positive, competent, comprehensive and accessible healthcare, that is out there.5 Especially useful is research which helps CBOs and other key stakeholders work with healthcare providers to scale up existing services, and to develop new initiatives, adapted to local context but drawing on what has been learned elsewhere (particularly in relation to behavioural interventions in the field of HIV). 5 Trans* positive here refers to practice that affirms trans* people\u2019s rights to their gender identities and expression, and support their ability to lead their lives with respect, equality and dignity. Transgender persons, Human Rights and HIV vulnerability in Asia and the Pacific 6 This review examines existing literature on trans* people\u2019s human rights and HIV vulnerability across the Asia-Pacific region. For present purposes Asia-Pacific includes all those nations and territories on the continent of Asia (from the Mediterranean to the Pacific) and in Australasia and Oceania. The focus in this report is therefore mainly (though not exclusively) on lower income and middle income countries of the region. This is not to suggest that trans* people in more affluent countries do not experience challenges. On the contrary, they often find themselves excluded from economic opportunities enjoyed by others and end up facing many of the same challenges of survival as do trans* people in less developed economies. The objectives of this review are: (a) to examine literature on existing laws, regulations, policies and practices that prompt, reinforce, reflect or express stigma and prejudice towards trans* people; (b) to identify vulnerabilities to HIV and barriers to access or uptake of HIV-related healthcare services; and (c) to establish a research agenda aimed at providing the sort of data that will enable a reduction in future risk, as well as better access to treatment, care and support for transgender persons living with HIV. This review concerns Asia-Pacific trans* people. The term trans* people (transgender people) is defined here as \u2018individuals whose gender identity and/or expression of their gender differs from social norms related to their gender of birth. The term ... describes a wide range of identities, roles and experiences which can vary considerably from one culture to another\u2019.6 This inclusive definition embraces a wide range of people who identify as male, as female, as genders beyond these two, or identify in ways that transcend gender. It embraces those who are comfortable with their bodies and therefore feel no need for hormones, surgeries or other body modifications, as well as those who seek to modify their bodies. Some may identify as transgender, others as transsexual. Others identify by way of indigenous community labels that have much greater cultural relevance for the people concerned (and the contemporary", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2580a846-89d1-4044-a7bf-4993518717be": {"__data__": {"id_": "2580a846-89d1-4044-a7bf-4993518717be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Lost in Transition: Transgender People, Rights and HIV Vulnerability in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ec80ee44f08d43c75ed2e9da9972d5891331f06e52437b7c417f5778ab458128"}, "3": {"node_id": "1a74ceaa-7b49-43b6-9cb7-3ba7e911b3e0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "633a158b12929462523df2906fec9ecef49aba3327e033161000c35893498943"}}, "hash": "397fb0c684d0d9fd063d29447ef889a3bd66e6d74ebd28003dd3e9770b24d5b1", "text": "societies in which they live) than these modern Western terms - and a much longer history too. The term trans* people is used in this report only as a convenient, if arguably Western-imposed, umbrella term or place- holder, reflecting the very wide range of identities and expressions these individuals and their communities represent across the Asia-Pacific. This review refers specifically to trans* women and trans* men. Trans* women are birth- assigned males who identify and/or present as female, or as members of another broadly feminised gender (in those cultures in which it is accepted there are more than two genders). Trans* men are birth-assigned females who identify and/or present as males, or as another broadly masculinised gender. Throughout much of the Asia-Pacific region trans* male identities (in contrast to those that identify masculine-identifying women) currently have an emerging status. Trans* men, as we will repeatedly point out in this 6 Definition adopted from USAID / UNDP (2010). A. Introduction: objectives, /definitions and method 7 A. Introduction: objectives, definitions and method review, remain severely under-researched. The review is of largely post-2000 material, focusing as far as possible on literature that addresses trans* people and their concerns exclusively, or treats them as a group distinct from other sexual and gender minorities. There is a particularly heavy focus on material post-2008. This emphasis on very recent material is because there are so many fast- moving developments in our knowledge of the HIV epidemic among trans* people, and of social and legal influences upon that epidemic. In some parts of the region the social and legal environments are themselves fast changing. The material reviewed includes basic research involving surveys and case material (in journal articles and reports, as well as in university theses and book chapters) as well as other material (e.g. reports from government agencies, NGOs and CBOs) in which research is reviewed and/or additional case material is provided. Other work consulted includes a large number of newspaper, magazine and blog reports, though they tend not to be cited in this review, which concentrates on more research-oriented materials (in which those newspaper reports are in any case often referenced). During the period May to August 2011 material was identified using Google Scholar search terms \u2018transgender+Asia\u2019, \u2018transgender+Pacific\u2019 and \u2018transgender+Oceania\u2019 (and similar search terms). Other material was located elsewhere, for example by way of the website of the TransgenderASIA Centre at the University of Hong Kong.7 Finally, a series of e mails were sent to 15 key CBO leaders throughout the Asia-Pacific region (in Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Nepal, India, Samoa, Fiji, Indonesia, Philippines, China, Mongolia, and Pakistan) seeking relevant material in either English or in local languages, noting that, in the case of the latter arrangements, might be made for translation. This e mail (sample in Appendix 1) elicited ten responses from eight countries. In October 2011 a draft report was circulated to members of the APTN, with a request for comments. A presentation based on the draft was made at the Governing Board Meeting, held 5-7 December 2011, at which time members were invited to give further comments. This draft represents an update, incorporating those comments, as well as further published work that has become available in the months up to the end of December 2011. Upon examining the literature on Asia-Pacific trans* people, it is immediately obvious that it predominantly focuses on urban, young trans* women. Rural and elderly trans* women, as well as trans* men (urban or rural, elderly or young), have been severely under-researched. One reason for the dearth of material on trans* men is that the trans* male identity (in contrast to various identities for masculine women) appears to be an emerging one across much of the Asia-Pacific region.8 7 http://web.hku.hk/~sjwinter/TransgenderASIA/bibliography.htm. 8 See e.g. Jun (2010).

There is very little information on how many trans* people there are in the Asia-Pacific 9 Examples of terms for trans* women, some conferring respect and dignity, others (at least nowadays) more derogatory and demeaning, are: kathoey (Thailand, Laos), pumia, pumae, phet tee sam; sao, phuying praphet song (Thailand); acault (Myanmar); bayot, bayog, asog, bantut, bakla, binabae (Philippines); maknyah (Malaysia); waria (throughout Indonesia); banci (old Batavia); calabai (Bugis); kedie (Java and Bali); kawekawe (Makassar and Bugis); wandu (Java); yen yiu (China); yirka-la-ul-va-irgin, ne-uchica (Northern Siberia); khanith and xanith (Oman); hijra (India, Pakistan and Bangladesh), kothi and aravani, (India); chakka and meti (Nepal); khusra and zanana (Pakistan); ponnaya (Sri Lanka); donme (Turkey); ah kua (Singapore); lai cai, bong cai, bong lai cai, dong co, be de (Viet Nam); mahu (Hawaii); fa\u2019afafine (Samoa), vakasalewalewa (Fiji). Some of these terms are imprecise thus often ill-suited to the goals of community activism. Consequently, some rights groups have started to construct their own vocabulary of gender identity variance. Filipino trans* activists have introduced the Tagalog-English term \u2018transpinay\u2019 (Filipina trans* woman) and \u2018transpinoy\u2019 (Filipino trans* man); see STRAP (Society for Transsexual Women of the Philippines) press release, 4 May 2008. In Thailand activists have recently introduced the terms khon (or phuying, phuchaai) khaam phet (a person who has crossed sex), khon (or phuying, phuchaai) plaeng phet (a person who has changed sex): Krisana Mamanee, Nada Chaiyavit and Prempreeda Pramoj Na Ayutthaya, e-mail communications with author, 5 May 2008, 16th May 2008, and 26th November 2008, respectively. Attempts to construct a vocabulary that conveys both dignity and precision may be an essential first step for trans* people to achieve recognition as a distinct community able to promote its members\u2019 interests and press for their rights. Across much of the region the trans* male identity (and indigenous equivalents) appears to be far less well developed. But this is changing. For example, Sampoorna, formed in 2004 in India, is a network which actively involves and works with trans* men. Moreover, CBOs originally formed by and for trans* women are increasingly finding that there are trans* men out there who want to become involved, and are consequently broadening their work.

The same is true worldwide. This is in stark contrast to the abundance of data relating to MSM prevalence (whether in terms of orientation, behaviour or identities). This absence of numbers is a matter for concern. Arguably, minorities do not count until they are counted. It can be speculated that the proportion of the population aged 15 and above who are transgender may be around 0.3 percent. This figure broadly matches community estimates for numbers of trans* women in countries such as India, Thailand and Malaysia, which gravitate around a prevalence rate of 1:30013, a figure that matches very closely one offered by Gates (2011)14 for persons in the US who identify as trans*. This 0.3 percent figure yields a region-wide population estimate of around 9 to 9.5 million. But this is just a rough estimate, and is based on UN population data from 2010.15 Better numbers are crucial to properly ascertaining the severity of the HIV epidemic among trans* people, as well as for proper", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9b849aa9-45f1-4b96-b39e-a320c595b9c1": {"__data__": {"id_": "9b849aa9-45f1-4b96-b39e-a320c595b9c1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Lost in Transition: Transgender People, Rights and HIV Vulnerability in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "96d806302ff2389b9d57a33faced10bece59ce1be92dcb9b480e522cc2d8fd70"}, "3": {"node_id": "77a06b3f-2f38-4d70-af96-51e17258591c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "857755fe281231406f38f65532ab33c5328aacade93d85a3fab1665098abb3fc"}}, "hash": "4c4a15581f4225cfedd031e5d8aa749987a1117546515714c7b2dcc2a566884d", "text": "social and healthcare planning. They help us \u2018know our epidemic\u2019 better. In the West, there have been clear calls for better data collection on trans* people.16 The censuses currently being conducted in India and Nepal (and recording the way people identify) indicate one way forward for Asia-Pacific on the matter of numbers. The HIV transgender pandemic; how big is it? The information on this is patchy, and is overwhelmingly focused on trans* women. Among trans* women there are indications that, internationally, infection prevalence has reached alarming levels. Worldwide, the available evidence suggests that, HIV prevalence rates reach as high as 68 percent in trans* communities, with new case incidence from 3.4 to 7.8 per 100 person-years.17 In the USA, rates for newly identified infections among trans* women exceed those of men and birth-assigned women by factors of around 3 and 9 (and exceed those of trans* men by much greater multiples).18 The Asia-Pacific situation is equally alarming, with prevalence rates in some areas reported to be up to 49 percent (albeit from scattered and often small-scale research).19 All these rates far exceed the general population. They commonly exceed the rate for MSM, sometimes substantially so.20 Young trans* women are thought to be at particular risk, although the comparative lack of data on elderly trans* people makes an assessment of comparative risk difficult. Possible factors contributing to youth HIV risk include their levels of sexual activity, use of alcohol and drugs, multiple partners, lack of information or misperceptions about risk, lack of information about safer sex, or simple impulsiveness and perceived invulnerability. Whatever the causes, alarming figures from one Asian city (Jakarta) have suggested that over a recent four year period 2003-2007 HIV prevalence among trans* people (evidently 13 See Winter and Conway (2011). 14 See Gates (2011). 15 This figure is based on the following population figures published by the United Nations Population Division (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs): Asia (2010) 4.16 billion, of which 74 percent are aged 15 and above. Oceania (2010) 36.6 million, of which 76 percent are aged 15 and above.

Epidemiological research for other STIs indicates high rates for syphilis, rectal gonorrhoea, rectal Chlamydia and other STIs among Asia-Pacific trans* women.22 These conditions are believed to put infected individuals at added HIV risk. The recently widely reported emergence of a drug-resistant strain of gonorrhoea aggravates concerns over co- infections. The Commission on AIDS in Asia has predicted that by 2020 trans* people and MSM will together constitute the majority of new HIV infections in Asia.23 Much of the alarm over the trans* HIV epidemic comes from the perception that trans* women are a vector for the transmission of HIV and other STIs into the wider population, often through male partners who themselves commonly engage in sex with cisgender (birth-assigned) women.24 That said, HIV positive trans* people are more than vectors. They are also victims.

In the National AIDS Control Programme study transgender prevalence rates for syphilis were at 60 percent, with rectal gonorrhoea at 29 percent and rectal chlamydia at 18 percent. The Chemnasiri et al. study reported a history of STIs among 71 percent of the sample (and 10 percent were HIV positive). STI infection may also be high in more developed societies; in a small sample of 43 TSWs Higashi et al. (2011) found self-reported chlamydia, candida, gonorrhoea and syphilis (as well as pubic lice). There are reports that in at least some communities HPV and associated symptoms such as genital warts may also be common. 23 Reported in USAID/UNDP (2010). 24 Bockting, Miner and Rosser(2007). 25 See e.g. Clements-Nolle et al.

The transgender experience somewhat mirrors that for gays and lesbians, e.g., Wright and Perry (2006); Meyer and Dean (1995); Abelson et al. (2006). 11 B. Some background: trans* people, HIV and the trans*-experience in Asia-Pacific towards situations and behaviour patterns (including sexual) that leave them open to many risks, including to HIV infection. Worse, on the way along that slope they often encounter poor healthcare (for transition-related, sexual or general health). Depending on where they live, the HIV positive trans* person may encounter few care and treatment services, or may be marginalized by and excluded from those that exist. Poverty, involvement in sex work and HIV infection can all add to the stigma they face.26 The stigma-sickness slope is as much part of the Asia-Pacific trans* experience as outside the region, if not more. There is now a large amount of anecdotal, case study and survey evidence that makes clear the slope exists,27 even in those parts of the region where there was once a more inclusive culture of gender variance (culture which has often decayed when exposed to forces of modernisation and Westernisation). Sadly, there are researchers in the Asia-Pacific and beyond who by their work arguably ensure the slope\u2019s place in the lives of trans* people.28 Largely as a result of awareness of this stigma (and what the stigma leads to) there is today a wide acceptance that HIV programmes targeting sexual and gender minorities should aim to combat stigma and focus on rights, and should engage affected communities to achieve that aim.

Once formed, these CBOs (and here we use to term to include non-registered networks and groups, as well as more formal and/ or funded organizations) have often found an unsupportive (or even hostile) social and legal environment in which to work.33 As a result local and national CBO coverage region- wide is uneven.34 Trans*-specific CBOs going beyond the local and national level are even more recent in origin.35 Some of the local and national organizations have in a very short time proved themselves effective advocates for respect, equality and dignity. Some have engaged in education initiatives and established services within trans* communities (often focused on vocational, health and rights issues). Others have worked with government bodies, law enforcement agencies, health authorities, universities, NGOs, other CBOs and the general public (including through the mass media) to build awareness of transgender issues. Still others have engaged in more direct forms of activism, often aimed at promoting changes in the law, or changes in policies impacting on trans* people\u2019s rights. Still others have engaged in community based research initiatives. 36 Some very effective work appears to be done in drop-in centres and through outreach.37 Sadly, across the Asia- Pacific region significant capacity building is still needed. When a working group from the American Psychiatric Association recently did a worldwide survey of 201 \u2018organizations concerned with the welfare of transgender people\u2019 to tap opinions on \u2018Gender Identity Disorder\u2019, the pathologising and therefore highly controversial diagnosis often applied to trans* people, it was only able to get responses from two organizations in Asia, and (apart from Australia and New Zealand) none at all from the Pacific! As time progresses one hopes CBOs (local, national and regional) will work more effectively to challenge the stigma and prejudice that has been so much part of Asia-Pacific trans* people\u2019s lives. There is real urgency to that task. As noted earlier, the Commission on AIDS in Asia predicts that by 2020 trans* people and MSM will together constitute the majority of new HIV infections in Asia. If this prediction proves correct, then HIV may in the public mind become ever more associated with these two communities. If HIV still carries the stigma it does today, MSM and trans* people will themselves become ever more stigmatized as community epicentres of HIV.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a3cada2c-9b98-452b-a7f6-bf37cdad53b6": {"__data__": {"id_": "a3cada2c-9b98-452b-a7f6-bf37cdad53b6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Lost in Transition: Transgender People, Rights and HIV Vulnerability in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c2e05b62dd82dcf47ec444078ed784d598dae63781ed030218f699801701423a"}, "2": {"node_id": "697040bb-5cb4-42e3-9bcf-2bc8c3f5bd4b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cdbbd503a1b95d3c4ea42cca6c8f8574ca55cc5eed45d4517fbd3bbba82a7a58"}}, "hash": "5614268b0d4cb88bc62754033cea35481c6e8c0b0edc2c2d865d9c4b5f6539f5", "text": "As always is the case, trans* people can expect the stigma to be harder than MSM to avoid; their very appearance and manner, as well as ID documentation that fails to reflect their gender identity, commonly advertises in a very public way that they are trans*.

They have also been promoting an antidiscrimination law. LABRYS, a leading group in Kyrgyzstan has been campaigning for administrative mechanisms that would enable trans* people to change their legal gender status. In Hong Kong and elsewhere trans* women have participated in awareness education on university campuses, as well as in training for healthcare providers. In India trans* women have worked as peer ethnographer researchers. 37 See for example AIDS Network Development Foundation (AIDSNet) of Thailand. (2011). 13 C. The stigma-sickness slope Stigma and prejudice Across much of the region trans* people are stigmatized (believed to be in some way less worthy than others) and the object of prejudiced beliefs (unfavourable stereotyping). Stigma and prejudice are evident at many levels of society,38 and appear to rest on beliefs, common across the region but variously held from place to place, that trans* people are (a) unnatural (an aberration of nature), (b) sick (mentally disordered), (c) sexually deviant (promiscuous), (d) deceptive (presenting as they do as a way of finding a potential sexual partner) or (e) otherwise immoral (contradict God\u2019s Will).39 All these beliefs share a common element; that the trans* woman is actually a man (albeit unnatural, sick, deviant, deceptive or immoral) and the trans* man actually a woman. These beliefs all therefore have the effect of undermining trans* people\u2019s claim for recognition in their self-affirmed gender. The links between these beliefs on one hand and stigma and prejudice on the other have not been the subject of much research. One study looking at some of the links found that the \u2018sickness\u2019 belief was linked to a range of transphobic attitudes.40 Where do these ideas come from? The research that has been done suggests the following cultural factors may feed (and reflect) them. They include: 38 For research in various parts of the Asia-Pacific see e.g. Matzner (2001a), Winter (2006c),Winter et al. (2009a), Winter et al.

They often face stigma, prejudice and discrimination, as well as harassment, abuse and violence. These experiences push many trans* people towards the margins of society, where two common consequences are involvement in risky situations and behaviour patterns, and poor physical and emotional well-being. These two consequences can reinforce each other. Many trans* people fall sick. Some die. Poverty, involvement in sex work, and HIV sero-positivity and AIDS all act to add to stigma. Inadequate healthcare across much of the region (in regard to general, sexual and trans* related healthcare needs) adds to the challenges faced by many trans* people in regard to well-being and health.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3170e812-2456-44b8-8a3d-ed9a88451c7a": {"__data__": {"id_": "3170e812-2456-44b8-8a3d-ed9a88451c7a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Lost in Transition: Transgender People, Rights and HIV Vulnerability in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8aad293648c95aa4fafe1c03acb74d2ff8b1cca849d3649ee80041413a347bb3"}, "2": {"node_id": "d31aa8a5-7296-4b30-ae69-d66f7890f71f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3104dce4482b517f49e95f261be55b675ad520d1147513cac3a15155cf48e7c8"}}, "hash": "2c9781cde9c992f4bd70a6a4a20ac911a00a4c6bbc1df5be62d850709e43c09d", "text": "Stigma Violence Harassment + Abuse Poor physical / emotional well-being Inadequate health care Poverty Sex work HIV/AIDS Risky situations + behaviours Prejudice + Discrimination Marginalization (social, economic, legal) Sickness Death Transgender persons, Human Rights and HIV vulnerability in Asia and the Pacific 14 (a) norms for masculinity and femininity, which stigmatize trans* people, as well as beliefs on sex and gender (sometimes linked to Christianity and Islam), which portray sexual relationships between trans* women and men (and trans* men and women) as same-sex relationships (and therefore immoral).42 Sadly, the common practice of NGOs and government agencies in conflating MSM and trans* people,43 and of researchers in using language which mis-genders trans* people (e.g. male pronouns for trans* women),44 only reinforce these ways of thinking.

The stigma-sickness slope from internalising the transphobia, protect their self-esteem (their sense of worth as human beings, their overall confidence in themselves) and provide a degree of resilience.53 These strategies have not been well researched. It is clear that for many others the stigma and prejudice get internalised and damages their emotional well-being and health. This will be discussed more in detail later. Discrimination, harassment and abuse, social and economic marginalization. Across the region stigma and prejudice lead to discrimination, social and economic marginalization (withholding of opportunities), harassment (intended assaults on dignity), and abuse (intended harm). The evidence is available in a range of case study compilations, surveys, reports and reviews of research (local, national international).54 It is also evident in autobiographical accounts.55 This research paints a picture of discrimination, harassment and abuse across society, and confronting trans* children and youths in their families and in their schools and colleges, as well as transgender adults in the workplace, in housing, at places of worship, in access to health and other services, in access to spaces that are otherwise open to the public, and in other aspects of public life (opportunities for marriage, adoption, or even to give blood). Those trans* people considered too \u2018obvious\u2019 or \u2018flamboyant\u2019 are especially at risk of being targeted. Many youngsters are driven out their homes or leave home early, and become cut-off or estranged from their families. They often drop out or are driven out of school (which are often rigidly organised on gender lines), or otherwise are deprived of the same educational opportunities their peers enjoy. Those who remain in education, often in strongly gendered settings, find their ability to concentrate on their studies severely compromised. Early school drop-out, or failure to achieve up to their educational potential, puts trans* people at a crucial disadvantage when they enter the workforce. Already stigmatized by being transgender, they suffer the additional employment challenges that come from being perceived as poorly educated. Even if they have suitable qualifications, they often experience difficulties getting a job, at least one that is full-time and commensurate with their abilities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7edbb4ff-2e29-4e26-a6dd-1f68cc297810": {"__data__": {"id_": "7edbb4ff-2e29-4e26-a6dd-1f68cc297810", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Lost in Transition: Transgender People, Rights and HIV Vulnerability in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c15cb4d3e06519c3e230098919c94916420cf16f9773e691c9425da9a94a6f02"}, "2": {"node_id": "4b472f1f-cf2a-4cd2-af6b-33e94fa41973", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "60af0ea2fbf1857dd0288d05cea3020be1661269194226e4ebe7e976a1daa521"}}, "hash": "82161b3608f1f8f3b6e073a5ebbc6e37011791677cc9ecb5a5bb3daec4ae827a", "text": "Often migrating to cities in search of a better life (particularly if cut-off from their families), trans* people may be confronted with the same employment difficulties there, and without being able to draw on any network of support.56 In order to get a 53 An exception is Winter (2006a). 54 Sood (2009) provides a good regional review of discrimination, harassment and abuse, as well as providing some cases studies of her own.

Note that in another Pakistani study (Hawkes et al, 2011), it was found that TSWs (as compared with FSWs and MSWs) were more likely to live outside their family and less likely to have any source of income other than sex work. Transgender persons, Human Rights and HIV vulnerability in Asia and the Pacific 16 job, they may have to conceal their trans* status (going to work each day in \u2018drab\u2019 \u2013 that is, dressed in a way that matches their birth-assigned sex but is incongruent with their gender identity). In highly transphobic societies such as Kuwait (in which even the voice, facial appearance, skin and demeanour of a trans* person can put him or her at risk of being prosecuted for \u2018imitation of the opposite sex\u2019), this is often easier said than done.57 Poverty is common in transgender communities; which serves to push youngsters into sex work. The subject of sex work will be revisited later in this report. As is so often the case, trans* men are severely under-researched; anecdotal evidence suggests many are pressed against their will into marrying cisgender men, or are rejected or disowned by their families and enter sex work to survive (often working as FSWs). Sometimes politicians and government officials, educators and others have become anxious about the trans* people assuming too high a profile in the media, in colleges and elsewhere. They have taken action, which can fairly be described as repressive (e.g. regulating media portrayals of trans* people, regulating trans* people\u2019s vocational opportunities, supporting the work of gender reparative therapists, or actually organising \u2018\u2019sissy\u2019 boot camps\u2019 for trans* youth). Sadly, local academics have sometimes ridden the wave of repression, feeding it further.58 Worse, trans* people have sometimes become targets of discrimination within the broader sexual and gender minorities communities (and their activist movements) from which they might reasonably hope for support and protection.59 Across much of the region violence, or the threat of it, stalks trans* people\u2019s lives.

Alarmingly, some of violence has been reportedly committed by police, the government agency one would expect to protect the weak. They commonly harass trans* people involved in (or assumed to be involved in) sex work, as well as other trans* people. There are clear cases of police violence (as for example in Bangladesh, Nepal, Karnataka in India, Cambodia, Kyrgyzstan, Kuwait and Iraq).65 The perpetrators sometimes benefit from a culture of impunity surrounding their acts. In some places the impunity sometimes appears government-backed.66 A few countries in the developed West (for example UK, USA and Netherlands) have offered refuge to Asia-Pacific trans* people fleeing or afraid to return to their home country on grounds that include fear of violence (for example recent cases of trans* people from Mongolia, Hong Kong or Malaysia).67 This is despite the fact that transphobic violence extends across much of the world,68 and in some cases is observed even in those countries offering refuge.69 Legal marginalization Throughout much of the region, trans* people find little comfort in the legal environments in which they live. Rather, in ways that both reflect and reinforce stigma and prejudice, they act to marginalize trans* people further. They fail to offer protection from discrimination. They themselves discriminate against trans* people by failing to recognise self-affirmed gender (either practically or legally), by criminalising trans* people\u2019s sexual or gendered behaviours, and by subjecting them to gender-inappropriate detention or incarceration. In some parts of the region they even fail to offer sufficient trans* people protection against the more serious forms of sexual assault.

For the purposes of this review, a short summary of legal issues facing Asia-Pacific trans* people follows. Absence of legal protection A few jurisdictions (for example most states in the Australian federation) offer trans* people legal protection against discrimination. However, across much of the Asia- Pacific region the situation is less satisfactory. Part of the problem is that human rights mechanisms are less well developed regionally than in, say, Europe. While many Asia- Pacific countries have signed up to international human rights instruments such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CPRD), Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), and Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), others have not,72 or do not match their international commitments under these conventions with legislative actions and enforcement at home \u2013 at least in regard to the rights of trans* people and sexual minorities more generally. Where any potentially useful anti-discrimination legislation exists, it is often limited in scope (e.g. Hong Kong\u2019s Bill of Rights Ordinance, modelled on ICCPR but offering protection only in the Government sector), remains untested in the area of trans* rights (e.g. Hong Kong\u2019s Sex Discrimination Ordinance), or premised on trans* people taking the unpalatable step of pleading disability (e.g. Hong Kong\u2019s Disability Discrimination Ordinance).73 In some jurisdictions (e.g. the Philippines and Hong Kong), attempts to protect the rights of sexual and gender minorities through legislation have met with opposition, and whatever progress has been made has occurred through litigation. Even where protection seems available, the costs of mounting a legal case can put legal action outside the reach of many trans* people. They are therefore left vulnerable to discrimination in education, housing, employment, services, and other areas detailed earlier. Note, however, that some Asia-Pacific jurisdictions appear to be moving forward in extending rights and offering protections to trans* people (for example Thailand, India (especially the state of Tamil Nadu), Nepal, Pakistan, and Fiji.74 Recently, UNDP India and ARTICLE 39, a division of the Center for Legal Aid and Rights, convened four Access to Justice and Social Inclusion Public Hearings to increase awareness and accountability towards transgender and hijra communities in India. 70 See many of the references at Footnote 54. 71 UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (2011). 72 For texts of key international treaties see the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights at http://www2. ohchr.org/english/law/.

The stigma-sickness slope As will be seen in the next section, trans* people across much of the region are unable to change their legal gender status. Where this is the case, trans* women often find themselves inadequately protected in law in yet another way. The problem arises when laws on sexual assault are framed so that the criminalised act involves penetration of a vagina, or so that only women can be victims. With offences defined in this way, those who perpetrate non-consensual penetrative sex against a trans* woman are not liable for prosecution under the same laws as would apply if the victim was a birth-assigned woman.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9ddf2ed0-2ebc-4464-b424-1caa8301fada": {"__data__": {"id_": "9ddf2ed0-2ebc-4464-b424-1caa8301fada", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Lost in Transition: Transgender People, Rights and HIV Vulnerability in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3237090eb2a693ba692a75bd7f439763981e1bc446eec4f08d271f43edab2b65"}, "2": {"node_id": "664fbf71-2ea4-43bc-aa5b-1d28e96affec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c606ff97f4e88c83ff1f1deac13fb8cc22ae0e5b3e7a7237e563487af5dd80b9"}}, "hash": "c8c67b292c24917c7dcce5a13308c116c247fb3aa34a957c97afa3c248200a8b", "text": "Unusually for countries across the Asia-Pacific, Thailand has recently moved forward in this area, changing the law on rape so that perpetrators of rape against trans* women can be prosecuted (albeit only because the law has been extended to male victims, and trans* women in Thailand are regarded in law as males).75 Failure to extend gender recognition Asia-Pacific countries allowing a change in legal gender status (or other documentation changes) are in the minority.

This is an important privacy issue for many trans* people. For many more, it is also an equality issue, as it leaves them even more vulnerable to discriminatory treatment than would otherwise be the case. Where trans* people are denied gender identity recognition, they often encounter difficulty conducting their everyday affairs; entering contracts in employment, housing, goods or services. They may also encounter difficulties wherever security forces check their ID, or when travelling through immigration points. In at least one country in the region, Nepal, the trans* community reports that the failure to extend recognition goes even further, with trans* people unable to gain the identity documentation they need to enable them to vote. Crucially for many trans* people, they may also be unable to enter a heterosexual marriage, and enjoy the usual benefits that accrue thereto (e.g. official recognition of one\u2019s relationship with one\u2019s partner; opportunities to adopt a child; taxation advantages; rights to public housing for married couples; joint loan, insurance and inheritance rights; and hospital visiting rights etc). As far as it is possible to ascertain there are currently only 10 countries and territories in the region in which it is possible for trans* people to gain gender status recognition as reflected in their right (clear or apparent) to marry heterosexually (i.e. a trans* woman marrying a man, a trans* man marrying a woman) and enjoy the rights that come with married status). They include (at time of writing, and moving broadly from East to West): New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Indonesia, China, South Korea, Taiwan, Viet Nam, Singapore and Iran.76 In some (for example South Korea 75 For more see Sood (2009). 76 Nepal is in the process of making changes that, by allowing a third gender status, may have the effect of allowing heterosexual marriage (though conceivably it may result in allowing marriage of each of the other two genders). Recent developments in Tamil Nadu and Pakistan appear to give certain rights to trans* people (though not, as far as can be seen, the right to marry heterosexually). A 2007 court decision in the Philippines has had the effect of revoking the right that trans* people once had to seek legal gender status changes there. Recent court decisions in Hong Kong (2010) and Malaysia (2011) have upheld their respective governments\u2019 refusals to change legal status. A campaign to allow Thai trans* women to change the gender marker on their ID cards (\u2018Mr\u2019 to \u2018Miss\u2019) (a campaign that held the promise of legal gender recognition) has so far been unsuccessful. Transgender persons, Human Rights and HIV vulnerability in Asia and the Pacific 20 and Singapore) the right to gender recognition is by statute (enacted law). In others (for example Indonesia) legal recognition is available to those who are able successfully to argue their case in court. Outside this list of 10 countries and territories, trans* people\u2019s right to marry are, in effect, restricted to the same-gender kind (a trans* woman marrying a woman, a trans* man marrying a man). This is an irony not lost on the region\u2019s same-sex communities, whose members do not generally enjoy the right to same-sex marriage, and may in some places even be prosecuted for their same-sex relationships. Where trans* people enjoy any sort of gender status recognition, it is usually strictly controlled. Conditions apply. They can be onerous. For example, in China requirements include gender affirming surgery, living and working in the gender that matches the new anatomy, informing direct relatives, divorcing if married, and being free of any criminal record. This presents a serious problem for many trans* people. Employment discrimination against trans* people is common, and sex work may often be the only way of earning money for surgery. With common police action against TSWs, the requirement to be free of a criminal record can be difficult to satisfy.77 Region-wide, the most common condition for legal gender recognition is that the persons concerned must have undergone gender affirming surgery. Gender affirming healthcare can involve a range of surgeries; including breast and facial.

The result is additional pressure to enter sex work. For those who cannot afford surgery, or choose not to enter sex work to fund it, legal gender status change effectively remains out of their reach. Those who can afford surgery are faced by another choice. Gonadal surgery is in effect one that sterilizes people. It may indeed make possible a (heterosexual) marriage (e.g. between a trans* woman and a man). But it also has the effect of making impossible any involvement in child conception.78 Rights to marriage and family are widely considered to be fundamental. But trans* people often have to choose between the two. In some of the countries not allowing change in legal gender status, it is nevertheless possible to obtain identity documentation (ID) that records the person\u2019s self-affirmed gender, facilitates a range of daily activities, and/or enables access (e.g. in parts of South Asia) to goods, services and political rights. For example, in Hong Kong trans* people after gonado-genital surgery are able to apply for issue of a new ID card that reflects their self-affirmed gender.79 A more unusual ID card arrangement (apparently available to all trans* women, regardless of surgical status) is the food ration or family card used 77 Mountford (2009). 78 In some parts of the Asia-Pacific it may be possible to arrange sperm or egg banking, but this can prove prohibitively expensive in many places. 79 Emerton (2004a). 21 C.

In summary, the failure (or explicit refusal) of many Asia-Pacific governments, either to employ gender affirmative policies in regard to legal gender status and documentation, have resulted in restrictions on trans* people\u2019s rights in regards to employment, housing, a range of other goods and services, as well as rights to privacy, marriage and family, and in some cases rights to participation in political life. Legal and law enforcement issues related to gendered or sexual behaviour Key areas here are laws used to prosecute trans* people on the grounds of their sexual behaviour, their pursuit (or perceived pursuit) of sex work, or simply the way they look; as well as issues concerning the incarceration of trans* people, and concerning prosecution of those who engage in sexual violence towards them. As was seen earlier in this paper, in many jurisdictions there is no opportunity for trans* people to gain legal recognition in their self-affirmed gender status. A consequence is that heterosexual behaviour (e.g. between a trans* woman and a man) is commonly criminalised under same-sex behaviour laws (for example in Bangladesh, Malaysia, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Tonga etc). Such laws hinder safer sex practices.81 In those places in which trans* people are (for various reasons outlined later) heavily involved in sex work, and where sex work is criminalised (for example Pakistan, Laos, Cambodia, China, Thailand) or otherwise regulated (India, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong), they find themselves targeted by law enforcement authorities. Across the region TSWs and others suspected of being TSWs are often arrested on sex work charges (sometimes with possession of condoms or lubricant as evidence), or on the basis of public order offences such as loitering, vagrancy, public nuisance, or begging.82 Region- wide, laws against human trafficking have been used (unsuccessfully) in an attempt to stamp out sex work.83 The case of Cambodia spotlights how laws against sex work can be both ineffective and oppressive. The recent (2009) law criminalises not only sex workers, but also anyone who has an association with them, even sexual health workers. It has led to grave concerns about arbitrary detentions, and abuse of and sexual violence towards trans* people by police. Brothels have been closed down, only to be replaced by other entertainment venues which, while providing a venue for sex work, present another face to the authorities by ostentatiously banning condoms on their premises.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a35e896-4652-4764-aa60-fc6aeac06054": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a35e896-4652-4764-aa60-fc6aeac06054", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Lost in Transition: Transgender People, Rights and HIV Vulnerability in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4fc0aac91bc548804b56eb465b0c6564f7c4809a55b7a81a4e269dd69b9df030"}, "2": {"node_id": "093a79a5-5375-4125-9a69-a7efb0d7808c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "06db2c89513a07efadc8ef782edd2bc6a2363062eba9a552dffb7acda4f2f81e"}}, "hash": "262ffca7e5187415aec6c4dce95160ac6343d70fcf01230d2ab8a209397f50f0", "text": "In an ominous sign of what the future may bring, it is reported that sex workers are now reluctant to attend sexual health clinics. 80 For more see Sood (2009). 81 For more see Godwin (2010). 82 For general overviews see Sood (2009), and APNSW, UNFPA, & UNAIDS (2011).

Transgender persons, Human Rights and HIV vulnerability in Asia and the Pacific 22 Many have been forced into rehabilitation programmes against their will.84 In some Asia-Pacific countries, laws criminalise the way trans* people look by outlawing cross-dressing as imitation or impersonation of the other sex, seen as un-Islamic or as indecent behaviour (Afghanistan, Malaysia, Samoa and Tonga).85 Laws such as the ones already outlined (laws on same-sex behaviours and sex work, as well as public order laws on loitering, vagrancy, public nuisance, begging, cross-dressing, or \u2018imitation of the opposite sex\u2019) often provide the context (perhaps sometimes the pretext) for much of the police violence against trans* people described earlier. Those detained by police, as well as those later imprisoned, run the risk of enforced haircuts, gender inappropriate uniform and curtailed access to gender transition healthcare.86 Trans* people may be incarcerated with inmates of their birth assigned sex rather than their self-affirmed gender. This puts trans* women particularly at very great risk of sexual assault (including rape) by other inmates and prison staff. In summary, Asia-Pacific legal environments serve to marginalize trans* people in many ways, failing to offer trans* people sufficient protection against discrimination and abuse, and themselves discriminating by withholding either practical or legal recognition of self- affirmed gender, criminalising trans* people\u2019s sexual or gendered behaviours, or subjecting trans* people to gender-inappropriate detention or incarceration practices. An attempt was recently made to categorise Asia-Pacific legal environments and law enforcement practices on a five-point scale running from highly prohibitive environments to those (at the other extreme ) offering protection with recognition (in regard to sexual and gender minorities). Only three Asia-Pacific countries and territories (Australia, New Zealand and the Pitcairn Islands) clearly fell into the category \u2018protection with recognition measures\u2019. By contrast, \u2018highly prohibitive\u2019 countries included Afghanistan, Brunei, Bangladesh, Cook Islands, Kiribati, Maldives, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nauru, Pakistan, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Samoa, Tonga and Tuvalu. A large number of other countries were listed as \u2018moderately prohibitive\u2019.87 The United Nations have been consistent in calling for removal of laws that marginalize trans* people (and MSM), pointing out that they constitute barriers to provision of and access to HIV services.88 Psychological health and well-being Relatively little systematic research has been undertaken to examine the health and wellbeing of trans* people in Asia-Pacific. However, it seems likely that the daily experiences of stigma and prejudice, discrimination, harassment and abuse, and consequent marginalization, often impact on Asia-Pacific trans* people\u2019s health and well-being, as is the case for their counterparts elsewhere in the world.89 Case reports, 84 For more on the Cambodian law see Overs (2009) and Godwin (2010). 85 For more see Sood (2009) and Godwin (2010).

Note also a Lao study (Winter and Doussantousse, 2006) indicating that lifelong experiences of being transgender predict trans* people\u2019s mental health - in terms of self- esteem, depression, fear of negative evaluation, loneliness, general well-being, satisfaction with one\u2019s appearance, comfort being known as a trans* woman, and suicidal thoughts and behaviour. Other findings of note were that trans* women who had more fully transitioned, and were more comfortable with their gender identity and appearance, also enjoyed better mental health and well-being. Trans* women who believed that gender variance was a disorder (whether mental, physical or moral) displayed poorer mental health and well-being. All these findings imply that stigma, prejudice, discrimination and marginalization can have a damaging effect on trans* people. 92 For more on this topic see e.g. Bavinton et al. (2011) (Fiji). 93 Almost all Asia-Pacific research in this area concerns trans* women; Malaysian, Singaporean, South Korean, Thai, Filipina, Lao, and Japanese. Most studies reveal that the most common pattern of sexual preference among trans* women is towards men (a heterosexual orientation when displayed by trans* women). In Malaysia, Teh (2002) reported that 97 per cent of her trans* female participants had a history of attraction to men and had a male as their first date. A similar figure (presumably largely the same participants) reported never being attracted to women. In a now old Singaporean study, Tsoi (1990) found that all the trans* woman participants in his study reported attraction to men. Kim et al.\u2019s (2006) found that 98 per cent of the trans* women in their Korean study reported attraction to men. Winter, Rogando-Sasot, and King (2007) found that 95 percent of their Filipina participants reported attraction to men. In Laos and Thailand the corresponding figures were 94 percent (Winter and Doussantousse, 2006) and 98 percent (Winter, 2006b). The only major exception to this picture of overwhelming heterosexuality is in a Japanese sample of trans* women, only 40 per cent of whom were attracted to men (though a further 14 per cent appeared to be bisexual): Okabe et al. (2008). \u201c Internalized transphobia is what it is called. Because some people are transphobic, I every now and then, admittedly and with all honesty, feel transphobic towards myself. It seems most true when I am with people whom I love deeply. I can take the name-calling when it is directed towards myself. What I find more difficult and painful is when other people, especially those I love, are supposedly shamed because of me. My parents, for example. I don\u2019t want them to feel that my being a transsexual is a reflection of their parenting. This is why I used to refrain from participating in family get-togethers or affairs that involve my parents, myself, and other people.\u201d \u2013 Dee, 33 years old trans* woman, Philippines90 Transgender persons, Human Rights and HIV vulnerability in Asia and the Pacific 24 long-term relationship with a trans* woman, whom they know to be a member of a widely stigmatized group, and with whom they cannot enter marriage or have children.94 Indeed, freedom from pressures to marry a trans* woman, and from concerns that she may bear a child, likely makes her a more attractive partner for a man wanting casual sex. At any rate, trans* women often feel that it is difficult to meet someone ready to commit to a long-term intimate relationship.95 The same may be true for trans* men; we just do not know. At this point we turn to a more detailed consideration of trans* people\u2019s sexual (and other) behaviours that put trans* people at risk.

Most Asia-Pacific trans* women are attracted to men and, consistent with their female (or feminised) social role, and in many cases their female identity, tend to adopt a receptive sexual role as penetratee, although it is clear a minority also engage in the insertive role, engaging in penetrative intercourse with their male partners.96 Their partners commonly resist gay and MSM labels (or local equivalents), identifying as straight (or \u2018real\u2019) men on the basis of their role as penetrator.

Nor apparently is the microfloral environment.98 It is not known what this means in terms of HIV transmission risk, although presumably there is a heightened risk of transmission for a trans* woman if the lining of the neovagina is damaged. Research is sadly lacking in this area. What about the sexual preferences of Asia-Pacific trans* men? Two studies are relevant here, both Asian. They suggest an overwhelming pattern of attraction to women (i.e. once again a heterosexual pattern). Similarly, Tsoi\u2019s (1990) Singapore study indicated that a majority of the trans* men in his study were attracted to women, though on this matter the precise figures are rather unclear. In Japan, Okabe et al. (2008) reported that 92 per cent of trans* men were attracted to women. How do these figures compare with Western countries? The most reliable research in this respect appears to be a study of 113 consecutive trans* women referred to a Dutch gender identity clinic, which reported that only 54.5 per cent who were exclusively attracted to men, a figure well below most of the Asian figures (Smith et al, 2005). A very recent European study by Nieder et al. (2011) reveals a similar figure (47 percent of trans* women in the sample reporting being attracted to men), and in addition provides some figures for trans* men (a much higher figure, 92 percent, reporting exclusive attraction to women). 94 This is most certainly true in the West (e.g. Bockting et al. 2007, Coan et al. 2005). It also seems true across much of the Asia-Pacific (e.g. Costa and Matzner, 2007, for Thailand; and Bavinton et al., 2011, for Fiji). 95 See e.g. Bavinton et al. (2011). 96 See e.g. Bavinton et al. (2011) (Fiji) and Chemnasiri (2010) (Thailand). 97 Baggaley et al. (2010). 98 Weyers et al. (2009). 25 C. The stigma-sickness slope As is found in much of the Western research on trans* women,99 protected sex is often inconsistent,100 and below the consistency level (suggested to be 60 percent) necessary to stabilise the HIV epidemic.101 Reasons are many. A trans* woman may believe that semen makes her stronger.102 Alternatively the reason may be poor knowledge about HIV, the risks, the various means of transmission and ways to protect oneself. Lack of knowledge may result from inadequate (or nonexistent) sexual health education (particularly at school).103 Alcohol and/or drug use may reduce caution.104 Sometimes condoms may not be easily available or affordable. They may be regarded by police as evidence of sex work, so that trans* women (including those who are not TSWs) are discouraged from carrying them. Among trans* women and their partners there may be a degree of message fatigue or complacency, the latter stemming from an awareness of new treatment regimens that have turned AIDS from a death sentence into a manageable condition.105 These areas remain under-researched. The absence of research is even more marked in regard to trans* men. One can speculate that age- and gender-based power relationships may enter the equation, making it more likely that a trans* woman will accede to her partner\u2019s reluctance to use a condom. Relevant here are findings that Asia-Pacific trans* women commonly report an early sexual debut, often involving an older partner.106 In some parts of the region coercive sex is quite common.107 It is known that early debut may put trans* women at greater lifetime risk of HIV infection,108 as sexual coercion may. Studies outside the Asia-Pacific region have investigated the use of female condoms in anal intercourse.109 There appears to be no Asia-Pacific research that examines the role female condoms might play in the lives of trans* women, perhaps as a way of empowering them in matters of safer sex. Again, we may speculate about other reasons a trans* woman may choose not to insist that her partner use a condom.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "89a704dc-dc35-4b10-ac2b-6d6ce8d6083b": {"__data__": {"id_": "89a704dc-dc35-4b10-ac2b-6d6ce8d6083b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Lost in Transition: Transgender People, Rights and HIV Vulnerability in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "10c39a7452bb118143dce29c37937871999157a0ae08cd2a5786515fb2ab511e"}, "2": {"node_id": "9dc7a203-97d3-4d88-a16c-890264841b0e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c1e6e4647f7c652b4dfecaf4f4292e6ad3f95b6c3067c4b4c63268a3a2dc8c10"}}, "hash": "2fe147693b987613f2e428628cdfcb7682310c9adf6cfd67cce5fe9120cf5dc2", "text": "She may see her role as one of providing pleasure to her insertive partner, and see the condom as diminishing the pleasure she can give.110 She may see condoms as undermining intimacy during the sex act.

Only 15 percent of Bavinton et al.\u2019s (2011) sample of Fijian trans* women reported always using a condom. See also the Hahm (2010) and Hawkes et al. (2011) in Pakistan, both of which studies report inconsistent or low condom use in the trans* community. 101 Brown and Peerapatanapokin (2004). 102 e.g. in Cambodia, where this is reported to be a common belief (Chanthan, 2006). 103 e.g. see Boonmongkon (2009) discussing sexuality education in Thailand. 104 Note however, the Bavinton et al. (2011) Fiji study failed to find any relation between alcohol/drug use and unprotected sex (although sadly in this regard the study conflates findings for MSM and trans* women). The Fiji finding conflicts with some of the Western research, e.g. Coan et al. (2005). 105 For example Chemnasiri et al. (2010) found that 34 percent per cent and 37 percent of the 241 trans* women sampled reported not being worried about STIs and HIV respectively, and 62 percent reported never previously undergoing an HIV test. As was reported in an earlier note (Footnote 100), inconsistent condom use was high, and many in the sample reported a history of ever having STIs. 106 See e.g. Bavinton et al. (2011) for Fiji. See also Hawkes et al. (2011) study of Pakistani sex workers, which reports an average age of 13.3 years for sexual debut among TSWs, lower than was the case either for FSWs or MSWs. 107 See e.g. Bavinton et al. (2011) for Fiji. 108 e.g. Guadamuz et al. (2010) in Thailand. 109 See e.g. Kelvin et al. (2011). 110 e.g. Bavinton et al. (2011) in Fiji. Transgender persons, Human Rights and HIV vulnerability in Asia and the Pacific 26 communicate commitment and trust, and respond to signs of each in her partner, by allowing (or even encouraging) unprotected sex.111 Her unwillingness to undermine commitment or communicate distrust may possibly be all the greater if she comes to the current relationship with a long history of others that have failed. The inconsistency is not just about condoms; it is about lubricants too,112 with inconsistent use presumably raising the risk of abrasions and tearing, and consequent HIV transmission. Lubricants, including the water-based kind that can be safely used with condoms, may be difficult to obtain or unaffordable.113 Worryingly, recent evidence from outside the Asia-Pacific suggests that certain commercially available lubricants may actually raise the risk of STI infection (including HIV) during receptive anal intercourse.114 Little appears known (other than that the oil-based lubricants are liable to damage condom integrity) about the risks (either for the trans* woman or her male partner) associated with some other lubricants used across the region, (e.g. engine oil, baby oil, vasoline, coconut oil, shampoo, moisturiser, saliva etc.) In a recent article focused on MSM, a leading researcher asked whether risk-reduction practices other than those involving a condom might have a role to play in fighting the HIV epidemic.115 The same question might be asked about trans* people. It seems likely that trans* women, like MSM, probably engage in a variety of safer sex practices that do not involve a condom. Yet, such practices have seldom been researched in the Asia-Pacific region. Exceptions to this pattern are provided by two recent studies, one in Fiji and the other in Japan. The Fijian study appears to suggest that trans* women engage in intercrural sex (sex between the thighs, sometimes called interfemoral sex) approximately as often as they engage in protected anal sex, and that this may be true during sex with both regular and casual partners.116 The Japanese study suggests that, at least among TSWs, fellatio and sumata (rubbing the penis with various parts of the body, including, in the case of the post-op trans* woman, the labia majora) is common.117 These findings beg questions about what other forms of safer sex trans* women and their partners might employ.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5870c606-126d-4498-85ed-47f12ee81397": {"__data__": {"id_": "5870c606-126d-4498-85ed-47f12ee81397", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Lost in Transition: Transgender People, Rights and HIV Vulnerability in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eeb84374c95099720ab4acfad7164e227260ca36f816367499cf7ae2118ee594"}, "2": {"node_id": "e5345ede-65a0-46a4-990a-085418e662ae", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f8091d6fe282f14711bb660d0b5a199168ee15146786e076bae04d91e23b5526"}}, "hash": "f5918587df5025d2fa5c1a520b32d300fcf00576572be1be21937471145fec8b", "text": "Other examples may be handjobs, footjobs, intergluteal sex (penis between the buttocks), mammary sex (penis between the breasts), and axillary sex (penis in the armpit), as well as presumably less-safe-but-low-risk practices such as frotteurism (penis-to-penis masturbation). Research into these areas could provide a basis for more nuanced safer sex messaging. Rather obviously, sexual exclusivity is a form of safer sex practice. There has been some interesting Western MSM research in this area.118 Many trans* women who are sexually active become involved in multiple relationships.119 Sometimes it is linked to a need to \u2018get the next guy\u2019 and thereby reaffirm their gender identity and attractiveness to men 111 For research and discussion on these issues see Melendez and Pinto (2007); and Coan et al.

The stigma-sickness slope (in which case the multiple relationships may be concurrent, even occurring in a group sex setting).120 Possibly it is also associated with a persistent and unsuccessful search for a long-term partner (in which case they may be serial). At times some trans* women may (in a reversal of the usual gender pattern) purchase sex from men. Throughout, the trans* women and their partners may not feel that restraints commonly imposed on female sexual behaviour apply to them. For one thing they have an uncertain social status as women. For the other they and their partners do not have to fear pregnancy. All these are currently under-researched areas. Modern technologies (e.g. mobile phones, texting, e mails, chat, videocam and social networking websites) provide new ways of developing sexual networks (and even of doing sex) and may facilitate the forming of multiple relationships.121 It is known that multiple sexual relationships aggravate HIV vulnerability. They may do so all the more in the case of trans* women, since there is some evidence (albeit Western) that HIV prevalence in male partners of trans* women is somewhat elevated.122 There appears to be no corresponding Asia-Pacific research. In some parts of the Asia-Pacific (e.g. Thailand and Fiji), it is common for men to scar their penises. Others inject olive oil or other substances to enlarge the penis, or insert implants (of plastic or glass beads) to make it more irregularly shaped. Piercing is also practiced. Two recent studies of Thai drug users indicate how common penile modification is. One reported that 26 percent of MSM and 9 percent of \u2018straight\u2019 men had penile bead implants.123 Another, with no indication of sexual orientation, reported a wide range of modifications, with the highest prevalence (61 percent) being for beads.124 Such practices may involve the use of unsanitary or shared equipment, and may therefore present a direct risk of male-to-male HIV transmission of a non-sexual kind. We do not appear to know what impact, if any, penile injections or implants have on condom use or breakage. We can only speculate that there may be an increased risk of condom breakage and rectal or vaginal (and neovaginal) tearing, and a consequently heightened risk of sexual HIV transmission to any trans* woman who acts as receptive partner (or indeed to any birth-assigned female partner). For this review it was not possible to identify any regional research on risks associated with these practices. In the absence of research into the sexual practices of trans* men in the Asia-Pacific we can only assume that many of the safer sex practices detailed above (and perhaps others) might play a part in their lives. TSW vulnerabilities A substantial number of Asia-Pacific trans* people evidently enter sex work. There are probably trans* men among them, perhaps in role as female sex workers (FSWs). This is most certainly the case elsewhere.125 However, across the region, the involvement of trans* men in sex work (both as MSWs and in the role of FSWs) appears severely under- researched.

With growing wealth across the Asia-Pacific, and growth in international air travel (regionally and intercontinental), more TSWs nowadays serve a tourist customer base, either serving them when they visit their home countries, or travelling overseas to serve them (albeit often on tourist visas, with consequent risk of breaking the terms of their visas). With the development of the internet some trans* women have entered chat room and videocam sex work (possibly the safest form of sex work around). Some trans* people turn to sex work when need or opportunity arises. Some take payment in forms other than money, and in the context of steady relationships.

To the extent that sex work carries any stigma, it serves to marginalize trans* women even more than would otherwise be the case. Sadly, there is evidence that TSWs are stigmatized even within transgender communities.140 Next is increased risk of harassment, hostility and violence.141 Customer violence is common, often (but not exclusively) when a TSW\u2019s gender status is discovered late on in a transaction.142 Police, under pressure to remove persons seen as undesirable elements, or enforce anti-sex work laws, may arrest (sometimes arbitrarily, even on the supposed basis of being a nuisance to tourists), fabricate evidence, abuse, beat up, sexually assault and/ or extract money from those that fall into their clutches. As noted earlier, public order laws covering cross-dressing, begging, vagrancy, indecent behaviour, loitering may be used against TSWs who work the streets, or who are assumed by police to be doing so. Possession of condoms or lubricant may be considered evidence of sex work, with the result that TSWs may not have them available when they are needed. For female TSWs 135 See e.g Suja et al. (2005) and Mahinchai and Ditsawanon (2008) for Thailand, and Winter (2009b) (for Asia more generally). 136 See data in Winter (2006b). 137 For more on the forces underlying the drift to sex work see Winter and King (2011). 138 See for example Hahm (2010), talking about Pakistani hijra. 139 See e.g. APNSW, UNFPA and UNAIDS (2011). 140 See e.g. Sood (2009). 141 Much of the material cited earlier in this review in connection with violence (including sexual) is relevant here. The case of Turkey is especially egregious; TSWs there have for some time been especially prone to violence, too often becoming victims of murder. Sections of a book edited by Ordek (2011) are particularly informative here. Customer violence is a phenomenon that is not limited to developing countries; Higashi et al. (2011) report levels of violence against TSWs in Japan. 142 In the Asia-Pacific as elsewhere perpetrators have defended their actions by claiming they had been deceived into thinking that the victim was a woman. Transgender persons, Human Rights and HIV vulnerability in Asia and the Pacific 30 who are imprisoned, incarceration with male inmates (with consequent risk of sexual assault) puts them at even higher risk of HIV infection. There may be a third cost, at least for some TSWs: relationship distress. Any trans* woman who hopes to find a stable partner through sex work and who becomes emotionally involved with a customer may be putting herself at risk of being abandoned. A customer showing signs of emotional commitment may simply be looking for a reduced or waived fee, or looking for more intimate (i.e. condomless) sex, and may be uninterested in a stable relationship at all. The tourist taking a TSW for a few days of beach holiday may simply regard his companion as sexual luggage, something to make the holiday even more enjoyable. In any case, a holiday romance may not survive beyond his return to his home country.143 These and other emotional costs attaching to the work of a TSW remain severely under-researched. Stigma, harassment and violence and relationship distress are all likely to add to the marginalization experienced by TSWs, and impact on their emotional health and well- being, making risky sexual practices more likely.144 Where the research has been done on TSWs in the Asia-Pacific, it is commonly found that they frequently engage in URAI.145 Reasons for inconsistent condom use in trans* sex work are many. Some of those discussed earlier in regard to the general trans* population probably apply here too. For example TSWs, like other trans* people, often lack adequate knowledge about HIV and safer sex,146 or leave themselves susceptible to emotional manipulation by customers who seem like they are becoming something more.147 However, special factors apply too, including the imperative to make money (a key consideration when the customer is demanding URAI or is prepared to pay extra for it).148 Older TSWs may be less attractive to customers, earn less, and consequently have less power to insist on condom use.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "992cdb85-98df-4748-b375-6addf077d425": {"__data__": {"id_": "992cdb85-98df-4748-b375-6addf077d425", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Lost in Transition: Transgender People, Rights and HIV Vulnerability in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8c69419e45393ef7a7e6300b5bc84fd16781995a3a777b8ef467f6a56310f86d"}, "2": {"node_id": "228dac4c-3525-4061-a2b6-1cbc504c889f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6cee651d94c087009d3179799b8c1807556bb9079d4d1ded6a702287d4aa7981"}}, "hash": "e8ec6740a282000c782707a51a50c32104f4a27e11c41e795c281719a61fc67d", "text": "The stigma of sex work combines with gender relationships to render TSWs particularly powerless in decisions about protected sex, especially where there is a risk the customer may turn violent.

The street sex acts between a TSW and customer may in any case be brief, leaving less time for the niceties of a condom. Use of alcohol and mood-changing drugs, either on the part of the TSW or her partners, may heighten the risk of unprotected sex.149 A rather different set of drugs, for male erectile dysfunction (Western pharmaceuticals \u2013 e.g. Viagra\u00a9 -- as well as local drugs \u2013 143 For more discussion of these issues see Winter, Slamah and Ordek (2010) and Winter and King (2011). 144 See e.g. Global Commission on HIV and the Law (2011) for an overview. 145 See e.g. Pisani et al. (2004) in Indonesia, and Hawkes et al. in Pakistan, both of which studies involved TSWs. The Indonesian study reported a 22 percent prevalence rate for HIV seropositivity (and 19 percent prevalence for syphilis), and found that 59 percent of the sample reported recent unprotected anal sex with customers. 146 e.g. Hawkes et al. (2011) (Pakistan). 147 See Winter and King (2011). 148 See here data from Higashi et al. (2011) indicating that large numbers of Japanese TSWs encounter clients who are reluctant to use a condom. 149 See findings of Bavinton et (2011) in Fiji indicating no relationship. 31 C. The stigma-sickness slope e.g. the herbal supplement Gambir\u00a9) may heighten risk from unprotected sex, through anal or neo-vaginal abrasions stemming from repeated and lengthy periods of sexual intercourse. There seems to be little data (indeed no Asia-Pacific data) on these risks. But there is good reason to suppose that these drugs are linked in some way to HIV transmission; a recent report drawing on data from a large scale MSM study in the US identifies the use of inhaled nitrites (\u2018poppers\u2019), stimulants and erectile dysfunction drugs as major predictors of HIV infection.150 The findings were all the more dramatic in view of the fact that these effects were observed even after taking into account the number of URAI partners. Worldwide there is a growing body of research on trans* women\u2019s HIV risk behaviours.151 However, Asia-Pacific research is comparatively scarce. Much of what is known in regard to trans* women in the Asia-Pacific region comes from small case studies and reports of CBOs and NGOs,152 as well as discussion papers written by individuals who have been researching trans* communities.153 Empirical studies looking at factors predicting risk for either unprotected sex or HIV seropositivity are relatively few.154 Sometimes the findings have been less than surprising (not a bad thing in itself). For example, a recent Thai study reported that inconsistent condom use among trans* female participants was predicted by a history of sexually transmitted infections, worry about HIV infection, and not carrying a condom on the day of the research.155 However, two studies are worth noting for some less obvious findings. Both aimed to identify predictors for HIV seropositivity in samples of trans* women. The first, a Thai study, found that trans* women who reported being role- versatile and having had a sexual debut under age 13 were more likely to be HIV positive than others. In an indication that there may be transgender underclasses with specific HIV care needs, HIV seropositivity was also more likely among the older participants, and those who had been recruited into the study from a park or from the street.156 The second, a Pakistani study, found that female TSWs who reported their first sex was forced were at higher risk for infection with HIV/Herpes Simplex Virus 2 (HSV2).157 This sort of finding underlines how important it may be for research to acknowledge trans* people as a heterogeneous group, taking account of different life styles and histories that may impact on HIV vulnerability.158 150 Ostrow et al.

Transgender persons, Human Rights and HIV vulnerability in Asia and the Pacific 32 Gender-transition vulnerabilities With the focus of research on HIV vulnerability firmly on sexual behaviour, there has been much less research on the HIV risks linked to gender affirming healthcare. Several possibilities exist. First, many trans* women employ injections of hormones and/or silicon as means to modify their bodies.159 When contaminated syringes are shared, there is quite clearly a risk of HIV transmission. However, the extent of needle sharing is not known. Feminising hormones (including both oral and injectable) usually interfere with the ability to have a penile erection,160 while gonado-genital surgery removes the possibility altogether. We can speculate that, as a consequence, an individual once capable of taking a penetrative role may now more likely take the (more risky) receptive role. Indeed, to the extent that her female identity may be further affirmed by either hormones or surgery, a trans* woman may in any case begin to prefer a receptive sexual role, as well delegate decision-making about protected sex. In the absence of relevant research, all this is speculation. More research into trans* people\u2019s sexual roles and behaviour is needed. The transition healthcare-related risks do not stop here. As we have seen, hormones and other transition procedures are expensive, eating away discretionary income,161 and tilting some trans* women towards sex work in order to pay for their healthcare. The sex work puts them at increased HIV risk. Moreover, recent research (albeit with birth-assigned women) raises the possibility that injectable hormonal contraceptives may increase risks of acquiring and transmitting HIV (and no effect for oral contraceptives).162 The implications for trans* women are worrying. Effects (if any) may be quite difficult to examine. On one hand, many trans* women report feminising hormones reduce their desire to have sex (reducing the occasions on which HIV might be acquired or transmitted). 163 On the other hand, the effects of feminising hormones on trans* women\u2019s erectile function may result in them increasingly adopting a receptive sex role (a higher HIV risk activity). As so often is the case in other important areas, our knowledge of the effects of hormones on HIV risk for trans* men is scarce. Research is badly needed on what impact (if any) injectable testosterone has on a trans* man\u2019s body, for example on the vaginal lining, and consequently on his risk of HIV infection. With so many factors acting to make trans* women vulnerable to HIV, and so many of their sex partners identifying as heterosexual and engaging in sex with birth-assigned women as well as trans* women, it is easy to see how trans* women and their partners have been viewed as HIV vectors. This said, trans* women may have more reason to feel victim than vector. Already stigmatized on account of their transgender status (and perhaps on the basis of being sex workers), HIV positive status adds a third layer of stigma. Belatedly, and with the extent and distinctiveness of the transgender HIV epidemic now being realised (by international organizations if not national governments) there is the beginning of a concerted effort to provide systematic education, prevention, testing, and treatment services for this beleaguered population, explicitly distinguishing their needs and those of their partners from MSM.164 159 e.g. Winter (2006b) (Thailand); Winter et al.

The situation in Kuwait is particularly egregious, with cases of doctors refusing to treat trans* women and/or reporting them to police for breaking the law on \u2018impersonation of the opposite sex\u2019.167 Access to appropriate transition healthcare (trans*-positive, trans*-competent, accessible and affordable) is often a particular problem. This is true whether the healthcare is pre-, post- or during transition, hormonal, surgical or counselling. The costs of available transition healthcare can be prohibitive. Publicly funded health services may not cover them. The costs sometimes help edge trans* people into sex work. Trans* people often seek out whatever health services there may be, relying on word-of-mouth recommendations. They pay for whatever transition they can afford; gender affirming surgeries, implants and/or high-quality silicone injections (for those trans* people that have the money), or \u2018backyard\u2019 castration and/or industrial quality silicone from medically unqualified \u2018fillers\u2019 and \u2018pumpers\u2019 (for those on a budget). Some take care of their own healthcare needs as best they can (e.g. getting hormones wherever and whenever they can and taking them with little or no medical supervision).168 Those who seek gender affirming surgery find that it is likely to be the most expensive procedure they ever undergo. The increasing tendency of surgeons and health authorities (most recently in Thailand and China) to mandate a mental health diagnosis (for \u2018gender identity disorder\u2019)169 adds to the expense (as well as legitimising the idea that trans* people are mentally disordered).170 Public subsidies for gender affirming surgery are seldom available; Hong Kong, Delhi, Mumbai and the Indian state of Tamil Nadu are rare cases. Moreover, other than Hong Kong it is currently uncertain as to how far these services apply to trans* men. In many countries transition-related surgeries (especially gonado-genital) are simply unavailable or else are prohibitively expensive. In Malaysia there is a fatwa banning Muslims from undergoing gender affirming surgery (while a different fatwa in Iran legitimizes the same procedure).

Data from Thailand for 2010 suggests around 21 percent of trans* women took an HIV test over a 12 month period. Data from Pakistan suggest 4 percent.174 We are unable to find any data for trans* men. The failure to address trans* people\u2019s sexual health needs is to some extent symptomatic of a more general failure extending across the broader sexual minority spectrum. A recent Global Forum on MSM and HIV (MSMGF) report across 42 low- and middle-income countries (nine of them in the Asia-Pacific region) found that the proportion of total HIV prevention spending targeted at MSM was recently reported at only 2 percent.175 The failure certainly applies to much of the Asia-Pacific region. An alarming 75 percent of countries region-wide do not have specific funding for MSM in their HIV country plans.176 In a recent review of low-to middle-income countries, South and Southeast Asia scored worst on four key HIV indicators for MSM (testing, prevention coverage, knowledge, and condom use).177 Within the greater Mekong sub-region (Cambodia, two provinces of China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Viet Nam) the spending on MSM recently accounted for anything from 0 percent to 3.8 percent of total government HIV prevention spending.178 A recent research report has called for action on MSM needs in the more economically developed societies of East and Southeast Asia, which, the author noted, have been the subject of particular neglect.179 171 Hahm (2010) reports that Pakistani hospitals provide emasculation surgery for between 100-200,000 rupees (around US$1100 at February 2012 exchange rates). 172 APNSW, UNFPA and UNAIDS (2011). 173 For example see Bavinton et al. (2011) for Fiji, and Sood (2009) for a broader Asian perspective. 174 AIDS Accountability International (2001a). 175 MSMGF (2011b). In an e mail advertising technical assistance for trans* abstracts for the 2012 Washington International AIDS Conference, MSMGF reported that only 2.6 percent of abstracts at the previous conference (in Rome) had focused on MSM needs. 176 Sarkar (2010). 177 Adam et al. (2009). 178 USAID (2008). 179 Lim and Chan (2011). 35 D. Health services for trans* people All this brings us to a more specific sexual health issue - trans* invisibility. The MSMGF report cited in the paragraph above notes that none of those 42 countries reporting spending on HIV prevention for MSM reported any corresponding figures for trans* people. Not surprisingly then, national statistics are hard to come by. AIDS Accountability International (AAI) notes that few countries (including in the Asia-Pacific region), report national statistics for their trans* female populations (as distinct from MSM) in regard to either HIV testing, HIV prevention or HIV knowledge.181 For example only two Asia- Pacific countries (Thailand and Pakistan) provide 2010 HIV testing statistics.182 It now seems clear that, for much of the course of the global HIV response, trans* people have been invisibilised; in that they have seldom been properly recognised as a distinct population for purposes of confronting the HIV pandemic. Key reports have subsumed trans* women under MSM, researching and reporting them in a way that implied they were coextensive with MSM,183 or an hardly recognised subpopulation within MSM.184 Even the most proactive of organizations in regard to trans* people\u2019s health and welfare have sometimes appeared to subsume trans* women under the MSM umbrella.185 In the light of all this, it is unfortunate that the recent UN General Assembly Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS, despite references to a number of high-risk groups (including, for the first time, MSM), entirely failed to refer to trans* women.186 Crucially, the invisibility of trans* men in key documents on sexual health is even greater than for trans* women. This is true for those whose partners are men as well as those whose partners are women.187 The portrayal of trans* women as MSM is often in direct conflict with their own identities as female or third gender.188 It undermines their frequently voiced claims to be treated as female. It often conflicts with the identities of their partners as heterosexual, or \u2018real men\u2019.

To a certain extent NGOs and CBOs have in recent years stepped in to provide trans* positive, informed and accessible HIV prevention and care services. However, many trans* people, both men and women, remain out of the reach of these services, and their work has sometimes been hindered through actions of police and officials who harass both the providers and recipients of health services, detaining outreach workers, confiscating materials, and raiding offices and events.189 Such actions may have served to discourage the development of such services, as well as services uptake.190 In the light of the range of rights abuses suffered by trans* people, and the intersection between rights and health, the recent report by the UN\u2019s High Commissioner for Human Rights on human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity is a welcome development.191 Thankfully, the status of trans* people as a special group may be changing. Some recent reports have begun to give trans* women status as a distinct group, albeit a group that shares many of the circumstances, experiences and HIV health and education needs of MSM.192 Exciting initiatives in places such as India193 and Thailand194 offer models for better HIV-related healthcare. The increasing ability of Asia-Pacific trans* communities to organise themselves for advocacy can only help this process along. The invisibility of trans* men and their health needs remains a serious problem; one that needs to be addressed in the research. 189 Many cases detailed in Godwin (2010). 190 For more details see Godwin (2010). 191 UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (2011). 192 e.g. Godwin (2010). 193 e.g. Chakarapani (2011). 194 e.g. Berry et al. (2012). 37 E. Conclusion and recommendations for a research agenda To summarise, the available Asia-Pacific research on trans* people is patchy. Across the region some research issues, geographical areas and demographic groups are better researched than others. Where research exists the research samples are often small, and focus on narrow sections of transgender communities (young, urban trans* women, and in a relatively small number of cities at that). As a result of the patchiness in the research, there is much that remains unknown about Asia-Pacific trans* people and their HIV vulnerabilities. It is not known how many trans* people (whether trans* men or trans* women) there are region-wide, but it is suspected that there are many, and (as already noted) that far too many are HIV positive. Trans* men appear to be an emerging identity group, about whose well-being, health and healthcare needs little is known. It is suspected that involvement in sex work greatly raises HIV risk for Asia-Pacific trans* people, but little is not for sure. It is not even known how many trans* people region- wide engage in sex work, though it is thought that many are involved at some points in their lives. Clearly there are many different patterns of sex work, but little is understood about the risks associated with each. Trans* men working as TSWs remain severely under- researched. Next to nothing is known about trans* men\u2019s HIV risks in the Asia-Pacific region. By contrast, we know something of the risks which trans* women face across the region.

Clearly there is throughout the Asia-Pacific a great diversity within each transgender community. Sadly, the elderly and rural have been almost entirely overlooked in the available research. Yet the elderly may, as a result of accumulated exposure to HIV risk, be bearing a heavy HIV burden, as may the rural, who possibly have been bypassed by whatever HIV programmes are available. Trans* men (urban and rural, and of all ages) have been almost entirely overlooked by researchers. While the research on Asia-Pacific trans* people is generally patchy, there is a great body of evidence revealing them to be the targets of stigma and prejudice. Though there has been little research into what actually drives this stigma and prejudice, it is clear that together they prompt patterns of discrimination (as well as harassment and abuse) in the family, at school, in the workplace, in the provision of services (including health) and in society more broadly (including in the law and law enforcement). These practices appear to marginalize trans* people (socially, economically, and legally). There is good reason to believe that these experiences can damage trans* people\u2019s psychological and emotional well-being, tilting them into lifestyles and behaviour patterns that put them at risk of E. Conclusion and recommendations /for a research agenda Transgender persons, Human Rights and HIV vulnerability in Asia and the Pacific 38 HIV (and well as risk of other threats to their physical health and well-being). As if this were not bad enough, there is clear evidence that health services are often inadequate to trans* people\u2019s needs, failing to deliver trans*-competent services in an accessible, affordable and trans* positive way. It is likely that inadequacies in healthcare for trans* people have been aggravated by a general failure to recognise trans* women as a distinct group outside the MSM umbrella, and a failure to recognise trans* men at all. A way forward is offered by trans* people themselves, increasingly organising to work for the enhanced health and well-being of their own communities. Given the above, it is not surprising that many recent policy briefs and reports touching on HIV and trans* people in Asia and the Pacific have produced somewhat similar recommendations, with all emphasising rights issues heavily.196 A recent report, produced by UNDP in collaboration with APCOM, focuses almost exclusively on such matters (albeit for MSM as well as trans* women), offering 43 recommendations (out of a total 62) regarding (a) support to leadership, community empowerment and advocacy to improve the legal environment and address stigma; (b) improvements to law enforcement practices and support to judiciary; (c) law reform; (d) legal services (e) research, evidence and monitoring (of laws and legal environments); (f) (legal issues as they relate to) national planning of HIV responses; (g) national human rights institutions (and how their work can contribute to the HIV response); and (h) donors and multilateral organizations (and how their own work can contribute to a rights-based HIV response).197 A paraphrased summary of those recommendations that are most relevant to trans* people are summarised in Appendix 2. It is to be hoped that the recommendations below (exclusively concerned with setting a research agenda) will align with recommendations in that earlier UNDP report. Donors may want to bear the following recommendations in mind when assessing HIV-and trans*- related proposals involving a research element. The first three recommendations are strategic in nature, applying to all HIV-related research that involves trans* people. 1. Ending the invisibility of trans* people. Researchers (particularly those involved in HIV-related health and rights research) should work to end the invisibility of trans* people. Clearly that means doing research on trans* people. It also means clearly identifying transgender sub-samples in larger research, and analysing data and reporting findings separately for those sub-samples. Only then will it be possible to get the sort of information on trans* people that is needed, including on their HIV vulnerabilities and healthcare needs.198 195 From \u2018Transpinay Rising\u2019 video, accessible on YouTube at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-EPrYgTYDc. 196 e.g.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da306bf5-d454-4b32-b110-4a68e0cd9b25": {"__data__": {"id_": "da306bf5-d454-4b32-b110-4a68e0cd9b25", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Lost in Transition: Transgender People, Rights and HIV Vulnerability in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3564d7250f9b29c7eb0250648c4fec4c493d495249656f9e6dde5c88a90da153"}, "2": {"node_id": "bdc6f39d-9859-46bd-9189-46541db3f62f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lost-transition-transgender-people-rights-and-hiv-vulnerability-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "71cef5979b4c694c5420b70e9c1e766d26e042f183f151f53e5b3e923defb88c"}}, "hash": "fb73331109710af7c0a365b19dbf405cb628d22f0b22551a0e62bf19ab4a2af8", "text": "196 e.g. Sood (2009), APNSW, UNFPA and UNAIDS (2011), Godwin (2010); Global Commission on HIV and the Law (2011); SAATHI(2008); South and Southeast Asia Resource Centre on Sexuality (2008); WHO (2011); Pant (2005); Cameron (2006); Jenkins et al.

Our gender does not determine our potentials. .\u201d \u2013 Rica Paras, trans* woman, Philippines195 39 E. Conclusion and recommendations for a research agenda Other levels of invisibility should also be addressed; in this case within trans* populations. Research should seek to recognise diversity within trans* communities, and the existence of hitherto under-researched communities of trans* people; in particular the elderly and rural, and trans* men, about whose life circumstances and needs little is known. Research on the elderly may be particularly important in view of the extended periods over which they may have been exposed to HIV risk. So too may be research on the rural, who may have been bypassed by urban-focused HIV programmes. Trans* men, perhaps the most invisibilised of all trans* communities, are in urgent need of research focused on their health and healthcare needs, and on their overall well-being. 2. Avoiding cisgenderism. Cisgenderism in HIV-related and trans* research is widespread. 199 Researchers should avoid letting it enter their research work at any stage; from choice of research questions to language used in their research reports. Researchers should be aware of cisgenderism in other people\u2019s work and note it when found. Of particular concern is research that portrays trans* people\u2019s gender identities as signs of mental disorder, or denies trans* people their gender identities (e.g. in references to trans* women as male). Such practices are likely to reinforce stigma and prejudice, and undermine trans* people\u2019s claims for gender rights. 3. Trans* people as research partners. Researchers should engage with trans* individuals and their communities as expert partners, encouraging them to participate as key members of research teams (paid on an equal-pay-for-equal-work basis alongside cisgender team members) in any research concerning their communities. This approach, which one might call \u2018trans*-researched trans*-research\u2019, is an effective way of avoiding cisgenderism in research. It also has the effect of facilitating more culturally sensitive and informed research on trans* issues. Finally, it also helps to build researcher capacity in trans* communities, and to enable trans* people as lead researchers. Across the region many examples of trans*-researched trans*-research already exist.200 The approach is consistent with the basic principle of \u2018engaging those who would benefit\u2019.201 A key step in building capacity may be to ensure that internationally published research (which is almost always in the English language) is made available (in summary if not in full) in the languages spoken (and written) by the very communities reported on in the research. There are clearly roles for international agencies (and donors) in all of this. More specific recommendations now follow on the subject of important research directions for addressing trans* HIV vulnerabilities. 4. Counting trans* people to make them count. It is not known with any certainty how many trans* people live in the Asia-Pacific region. It is likely that the numbers are large, 199 Cisgenderism is a way of looking at the world which gives preferred status to those whose gender identities are congruent with both their bodies and the roles society expects of them (i.e. \u2018cisgender\u2019 people; those who are not transgender). See Ansara and Hegarty (2011) for more information. 200 For example Jenkins et al. (2005); Winter et al.

Documenting and understanding trans* vulnerability. More research is needed on aspects of trans* people\u2019s lives that contribute to their vulnerability to HIV. In view of the way many factors (e.g. legal, social, economic, and psychological) intersect, combining to increase HIV vulnerability, it is important that research is multidisciplinary in nature.205 Some key populations are in particular need of being studied; e.g. TSWs (believed to bear a heavy HIV burden)206, young trans* people (sexually active and therefore at risk of HIV), the elderly (on account of an HIV burden accumulated through years of risk earlier in life), the rural (possibly untouched by HIV prevention programmes) and trans* men (who have been entirely ignored in Asia- Pacific HIV research). It is important to know about patterns of sexual behaviour (beyond receptive analy intercourse) in which trans* people commonly engage. Examples include those sex acts that potentially can lower risk of HIV transmission (e.g. axillary sex, intercrural sex, handjobs, footjobs, intergluteal sex, mammary sex, frotteurism, tribadism, and sumata), those that may heighten risk (e.g. group sex such as that which is common in Fiji) 207, and those whose risk is entirely unknown (e.g. neovaginal sex, neo-vaginal or anal sex involving non-standard lubricants including saliva). It is important to know more about the ways in which patterns of sexual behaviour may impact on HIV risk. While the laws, regulations, policies and practices that make life difficult for trans* people in the Asia-Pacific are relatively well documented, there is currently no central data base documenting Asia-Pacific trans* rights violations. A data base of 202 Winter (2009b); Godwin (2010). 203 Sood (2009). 204 This point is made in UNDP et al. (2009), WHO et al. (2010) and USAID /UNDP (2010). 205 The need for research drawing on multiple disciplines was noted at a transgender forum at the recent ICAAP 10 meeting in Busan. 206 Note that APNSW, UNFPA and UNAIDS (2011) identifies sex work as a major driver for the HIV epidemic in Asia, at least over the next 20 years, and involvement in sex work as a major vulnerability. The report claims that the most cost-effective interventions against HIV are likely to be those that focus on sex work, noting with regret that only 1 percent of global HIV funding goes to sex work. 207 Bavinton et al. (2011). 41 E. Conclusion and recommendations for a research agenda this sort, monitoring effects of rights violations upon people\u2019s lives, could become a valuable tool for those working in and for trans* communities region-wide. It could prove a valuable resource for those pressing for accountability and seeking change. Also valuable would be broader social sciences and multi-disciplinary research that provides a clearer picture of what life is like on the stigma-sickness slope, what aspects of stigma and prejudice, discrimination, harassment and abuse, and marginalization are most damaging to psychological health and well-being, and which have the strongest effects on HIV vulnerability. Larger and more comprehensive studies are needed on stigma, prejudice, discrimination, harassment and abuse, and on trans* people\u2019s overall health and well-being than have so far been conducted in the Asia-Pacific region, along the lines of work done in the USA,208 UK,209 Belgium,210 Netherlands,211 and Australia and New Zealand.212 Research of this kind could examine the impact of laws and legal environments on trans* people in the Asia-Pacific (including on TSWs). Longitudinal research may be particularly useful, detailing the progressive effects of stigma, discrimination, harassment, abuse and social, economic and legal marginalization upon people\u2019s lives, and where possible examining the impact of changes in laws and law enforcement upon the lives of trans* people. One possible research focus would be to examine the effect of repealing punitive laws, or of introducing protective laws, upon the provision and uptake of HIV services.213 6.

Such research will also counter the tendency, always present, to view trans* people as passive victims of circumstance, rather than active agents in their own lives. 7. Empowering trans* people through CBOs and NGOs. The importance of empowering trans* people in regard to their own health and well-being is already well known.214 It is well accepted that trans* CBOs (and trans* related NGOs, particularly those engaging trans* people in key roles) can play a leading role in promoting trans* people\u2019s welfare.215 Research is needed that examines ways to make trans* CBOs and relevant NGOs more effective in their work on behalf of trans* people. As a first step, it is important to map existing local, national and regional groups, perhaps in a way 208 e.g. Grant et al. (2011), as well as IOM Committee on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Health Issues (2011). 209 Whittle et al. (2007). 210 Motmans et al. (2010). 211 HRW (2011). 212 See Couch et al.

Transgender persons, Human Rights and HIV vulnerability in Asia and the Pacific 42 similar to that recently done in South Asia by SAATHI,216 and to a lesser extent in the recent ARROW Report217 and perhaps building on recent steps taken by APTN and ILGA-Asia in this regard. Mapping should enable us to identify gaps; transgender communities left underserved by CBOs or relevant NGOs. Where CBOs and relevant NGOs exist, mapping makes it possible to identify what each group is doing, providing a baseline (along the lines of the recent SAATHI report)218 and making possible recommendations for developing the work of trans* related CBOs and NGOs in South Asia.219 There is a particular need for research (perhaps longitudinal) into effective ways of developing the work of CBOs at the local, national and regional level (this last level especially underdeveloped currently in the Asia-Pacific).220 Especially important are studies that document the ways in which CBOs can work with others in civil society, such as: ( a ) media; ( b ) government officials (e.g. in education, social welfare, health and law) and elected representatives (from local upwards); and ( c ) other agencies and organizations (community, non-governmental and governmental) working for the welfare of sexual minorities, PLHIV, women, drug users, sex workers etc. In all this, trans* people, trained in methods such as participatory evaluation and research, may prove an important research resource.221 The focus of work for CBOs and relevant NGOs will necessarily vary from place to place; e.g. in terms of a focus on vocational or social activities, rights or health; in terms of general, transition or sexual health; in terms of prevention or care. Priorities will vary from community to community. Hence, it is difficult to identify a single research area that would facilitate the work of organizations region-wide. However, it seems likely that across much of the Asia-Pacific region there is a particular need to research ways by which CBOs and relevant NGOs (alone and in collaboration with partners) can ( a ) promote more trans* positive attitudes in the general population and more trans*-positive practices in key personnel who come into contact with trans* people; ( b ) promote a more sensitive transgender rights culture, making existing equality legislation work better for trans* people; ( c ) promote more effective provision of key health information to members of trans* communities; and ( d ) promoting more trans* positive, competent, comprehensive and accessible healthcare . Attention now turns to these. 8. Promoting trans* positive attitudes and practices.

Conclusion and recommendations for a research agenda are important tools in the struggle for enhanced rights and healthcare for trans* people.222 Documentation of innovative and good practice, properly disseminated, may prove useful in helping CBOs to develop effective and scaled up education campaigns.223 Guidelines for monitoring service providers and their staff may prove an important training tool, and perhaps can be adapted from elsewhere.224 Across the region mainstream mass media remain part of the problem rather than part of the solution, undermining respect, equality and dignity for trans* people. It is important to research and document ways of promoting a commitment to those values in TV, newspaper and magazine media, as well as across the internet. 9. Promoting transgender rights culture, making equality legislation work better. It is important to document the ways in which key conventions, declarations, court judgements and juridical and jurisprudential reports can be used to advance the rights of trans* people across the Asia-Pacific, and to find ways in which transgender communities across the region (and their advocates) can use that information in ways that make sense in the societies in which they live. The importance of such research derives from the widely accepted view that rights-based approaches offer an effective way forward for tackling the HIV epidemic in marginalized communities. This includes sexual and gender minorities in the Asia-Pacific.225 Rights-based approaches make particularly good sense in countries that have signed international instruments (and optional protocols), which would appear to offer opportunities for advancing trans* people\u2019s rights. Key of course is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to which all UN members states are signatories.226 Also important are ICCPR,227 ICESC, 228 CRC,229 CRPD,230 and CEDAW.231 Many Asia-Pacific countries are parties to these conventions, and yet few have so far enacted legislation to allow legal gender status recognition, or to provide effective (and enforced) protection against discrimination on the grounds of gender identity or expression. It may be that other potentially important global tools for rights advocacy exist, including the 1994 UN Human Rights Committee decision in regard to \u2018Toonen v Australia\u2019;232 commitments from the ICPD;233 the Yogyakarta Principles;234 the International Bill of Gender Rights;235 the ILO Recommendation Concerning HIV and AIDS and the World of Work;236 the Joint Statement on 22nd March 2011 from 222 Godwin (2010). 223 See Sood (2009) and APNSW, UNFPA and UNAIDS (2011) for examples of successful education campaigns. 224 Scottish Transgender Alliance (2009). 225 Godwin (2010); NGO Delegation (2010). 226 See http://un.org/en/documents/udhr/ 227 See http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm. 228 See http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cescr.htm. 229 See http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm. 230 See http://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/conventionfull.shtml. Note that the CRPD adopts a social perspective on disability, and may therefore be more palatable to trans* activists than if it were to adopt a medical perspective.

It is particularly important that these strategies are documented. 10. Getting health information out to trans* communities. It is important to document the various means (both well-established and innovatory) by which important health information can be disseminated through trans* communities. Interesting Asia- Pacific initiatives already exist; for example a healthcare booklet (and disk) produced by APNSW.247 Also useful would be research aimed at identifying ways of getting information to the hard-to-reach in trans* communities \u2013 particularly the elderly and the rural (who may neither be members of community groups nor linked to the internet, and may have limited literacy), as well as trans* men (for whom there is little readily available health information at all). sex work as a form of violence against women.

Conclusion and recommendations for a research agenda 11. Promoting trans*-positive, competent, comprehensive and accessible healthcare. The available research shows that current healthcare provision often fails on all four counts. Research is therefore needed that documents any good practice, particularly ones that help CBOs and other key stakeholders work with healthcare providers to scale up existing services, and develop new initiatives. Documentation on healthcare approaches outside the Asia-Pacific region is already available, providing guidance that might go some way to promoting trans*-positive practices across the Asia-Pacific,248 as well as provision that is more competent249 and comprehensive.250 A recent WHO report on prevention and treatment of HIV and other STIs may be useful in this regard.251 Such healthcare approaches might draw on recent research worldwide, particularly in regard to behavioural interventions in the field of HIV.252 However, it is likely that these approaches need to be adapted to local contexts. For the Asia-Pacific region one-stop services may be particularly useful (addressing a broad range of transgender needs; general, transition-related and sexual health).253 Also key is research that taps trans* people\u2019s own perceptions of their health (and related) needs, and which documents the needs of the elderly, rural, and/or uneducated. 248 Transgender Law and Policy Institute (2005), Transgender Healthcare Access Project (2008). 249 Tom Waddell Health Centre Transgender Team (2006); Hembree et al.

I\u2019ll refer to some of the material on that site. . However, there is surely some material out there (not just English-language, but also other languages) which I do not know about, and which may shine a light on laws, regulations, policies and practices that have the effect (or even intention!) of subjecting trans* people to stigma, reducing opportunities, restricting freedoms , increasing poverty , reducing access to basic services (including health) etc and making them more vulnerable to HIV infection. I am therefore writing to ask you if you know of any relevant material that you would like me to know about. This may include the following: Research reports - by community organizations, - by NGOs, - by university scholars, - by research students - etc Laws Legal cases Regulations, policies and practices - of national, regional or city governments - of police - of health, social welfare and education services. If you are able to send the material to me then please do so. If you know where I can find the material please let me know. If the material is in a language other than English we may be able to arrange funds for translation.

The consultation\u2019s aim was to document the experience of participants in the development and implementation of Global Fund multi-country grants and generate policy guidance and recommendations for the Global Fund and other stakeholders to strengthen the effectiveness, management and oversight of these funding streams. These recommendations are meant to ensure that community-based organizations can fully participate in Global Fund HIV programmes, inform the recently approved Human Rights Strategy and better meet the needs of their communities. Representatives from over 30 community-based organizations and individuals from key affected populations and people living with HIV representing Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Eastern Europe and Latin America attended the meeting. The participants had substantive experience and have played key roles during various phases of Global Fund multi-country grants, including proposal formulation, grant negotiation, programme implementation and evaluation. The Global Fund Secretariat and UN-based partners were also represented. Since the approval of Round 9 and 10 multi-country grants, specific issues relating to community-based organizations\u2019 grant management and implementation have been highlighted through both formal and informal communications with the Global Fund: \u2022\ufffd Current Global Fund grant signing, management, programme review and ongoing disbursement processes and procedures are designed primarily for government-led national grants. These risk mitigation structures often create a substantive barrier to community-based organizations, which serve as Sub-recipients (SRs) and Sub-sub- recipient (SSRs) under multi-country grants and national grants. \u2022\ufffd Risk management, overall expectation and communication needs of the Principle Recipients (PRs), SRs and SSRs are often inconsistent and different from traditional Country Coordinating Mechanism (CCM)-focused countries. \u2022\ufffd The role and operability of the Local Fund Agent (LFA) under community-led multi- country grants is perceived to be inconsistent and often impeded grant progress. The participants raised serious concerns about how current approaches to Global Fund proposal and grants management have hindered grantees abilities to develop and implement programmes that best serve their communities. The report provides a wide array of recommendations for the Global Fund Secretariat, Board, LFAs and Global Fund technical partners. The key recommendations are summarized below.

Recommendation: The Global Fund should recognize the added value of community- driven multi-country proposals, and in doing so, should consider development of separate application procedures and review processes tailored to meet the needs of such proposals. At the least, guidelines for multi-country proposal development using the new iterative process should be issued by the Secretariat. \u2022\ufffd The\ufffdGF\ufffdSecretariat\ufffdshould\ufffdclarify\ufffdthe\ufffdroles\ufffdof\ufffdCCMs,\ufffdPRs\ufffdand\ufffdSRs\ufffdin\ufffdthe\ufffdnew\ufffdapplication\ufffd process. CCM engagement is a difficult and time-consuming process, and getting CCM endorsement is contradictory to the reason why the regional proposal was developed in the first place. Even without CCM endorsement, a multi-country proposal can and should be able to align with national plans and demonstrate additionality. Recommendation: PRs and SRs should be identified early in the process in order to participate in programme development. CCM engagement should not be such a high criteria for approval. \u2022\ufffd The\ufffdgrant\ufffdnegotiation\ufffdprocess\ufffdtook\ufffda\ufffdgreat\ufffddeal\ufffdof\ufffdtime\ufffdand\ufffdrequired\ufffdmany\ufffdhours\ufffdof\ufffd staff time, not covered by the grant. 3 Executive Summary Recommendation: The cost for the grant negotiation process to meet GFATM minimum requirements should be included in the proposal. \u2022\ufffd The\ufffdGlobal\ufffdFund\ufffdHuman\ufffdRights\ufffdStrategy\ufffdmust\ufffdbe\ufffdimplemented\ufffdthrough\ufffdthe\ufffdFund\u2019s\ufffd grant making procedures. Recommendation: The Global Fund Board and Secretariat need to define rights- based services and how to reflect that definition in RFPs and proposal guidance, staff training, TRP member selection and proposal review criteria and other Global Fund policies.

This leads to decisions that impede the ability of these organizations to achieve their goals and provide high-quality services to their clients. Recommendation: LFAs and FPMs must have the capacity to understand how community-based programmes function, how community-based organizations are structured and how the needs of the populations they serve require flexibility in programme implementation. Increasing LFA and FPM capacity to work with and for key affected populations should be seen as a component of implementing the Human Rights Strategy. \u2022\ufffd The\ufffdmeeting\ufffdparticipants\ufffdprovided\ufffdmultiple\ufffdexamples\ufffdof\ufffdinflexibility\ufffdin\ufffdreviewing\ufffdand\ufffd approving budgets.

In one instance, 90% of the budget was cut, thus gutting the heart of the proposal.

Recommendation: Fiscal accountability should not be the only consideration in risk management.

If the goal of a Community Systems Strengthening (CSS) project is to increase the capacity of community-based organizations, the reporting requirements placed on those organizations must not expect the capacity to exist prior to engagement in the project. Recommendations: - The Global Fund should develop simpler, less burdensome administration requirements for community-led, SR/SSR multi-country grants. - The goals and objectives of the CSS Framework should be better reflected in the administrative processes developed by the Secretariat and by LFAs. - Provide bridge or start-up funding to community based SRs/SSRs so they can build capacity of their management and reporting. - Allow civil society PRs and SRs to have a three-year Phase One and two-year Phase Two schedule.

Making Global Fund Money Work for Communities: Community Partnership Consultation Pattaya, Thailand, 7-8 December 2011 6 Background Support for Key Affected Populations and Community Systems Strengthening Since its creation in 2002, the Global Fund has become one of the main funders of programmes to fight AIDS, TB and malaria, with approved funding of US$22.4 billion for more than 1,000 programmes in 150 countries (as of 30 June 2011), equivalent to one quarter of the international financing for HIV and AIDS. Although the Framework Document of the Global Fund1 does not explicitly refer to human rights, it takes a rights-based approach, stating that the Fund will support proposals which strengthen the meaningful participation of most-at-risk populations; give due priority to the most affected countries and communities; and aim to eliminate stigmatization of, and discrimination against those infected and affected. Within the HIV stream, most-at-risk populations \u2013 as defined by the Global Fund - are those sub-populations that have, within a defined and recognized epidemiological context and relative to the overall population, significantly higher levels of risk, mortality and/or morbidity, and significantly lower access to or uptake of relevant, rights-based services. Overall, despite an increasing trend of disproportionally higher prevalence, HIV prevention funding addressing most-at- risk populations represents only around 6 percent of its cumulative funding (or US$196 million) for the period 2002-2009 according to research undertaken by the Global Fund.2 The Global HIV Prevention Working Group has estimated that in epidemics where HIV is concentrated among most-at-risk populations, less than 10 percent of HIV-related expenditures target them3. In generalized epidemics the proportion is even lower with only 1 percent of expenditures supporting most at risk populations, with 0.5 percent for sex work, 0.1 percent for men who have sex with men, and 0 percent for people who inject drugs.4 To address this gap in financial resources and involvement in national programmes, the Global Fund has developed a number of mechanisms and policies to strengthen support for key affected populations, human rights protections, and community systems strengthening. These include the Gender Equality Strategy, the Sexual Orientation and Gender Identities Strategy (SOGI), the Community Systems Strengthening Framework, Dual Track Financing, non-CCM and multi-country proposal consideration, and the Targeted Pool for MARPs5.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1be808a0-1d00-47e8-9faf-223b515cbaf2": {"__data__": {"id_": "1be808a0-1d00-47e8-9faf-223b515cbaf2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-global-fund-money-work-communities-community-partnership-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making Global Fund Money Work for Communities: Community Partnership Consultation - Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-global-fund-money-work-communities-community-partnership-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5ac9380b1cc0df9dec2fdd3ffc0c2843fcba3e018c2ec6ec1943a0de6bf65d79"}, "2": {"node_id": "aec31406-4f93-4be3-9bca-cda9e590571e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-global-fund-money-work-communities-community-partnership-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d43abdab8620adefbf46abf138c6ace7cf47e7f6670051b77c112e6ea7178fb9"}}, "hash": "b03f94b1855c15ff93361b43b66841b8846c2bde63c764a82e7c2c8b5722d0e9", "text": "In response, community based organizations have successfully formulated and submitted multi-country proposals to the Global Fund with 15 multi- country grants in the current Global Fund portfolio.

Washington, DC. 4 Ibid. 5 These mechanisms are described and discussed in the MARPS paper annexed to this report. 7 Background offer community-based organizations an additional platform to address key advocacy, capacity and strategic information issues often missing from national proposals, which limit community participation. Multi-country grants are not \u2018business as usual\u2019 and can present some challenges in relation to: proposal development and review, programmatic focus, oversight and governance, and day-to-day management \u2013 both within the Secretariat and also for the key partnerships, including the Local Fund Agents. Since the approval of Round 9 and 10 multi-country grants, specific issues relating to community-based organizations\u2019 grant management and implementation have been highlighted through both formal and informal communications with the Global Fund: \u2022\ufffd Current Global Fund grant signing, management, programme review and ongoing disbursement processes and procedures are designed primarily for government-led national grants. These risk mitigation structures often create a substantive barrier to community-based organizations, which serve as SRs and SSRs under multi-country grants and national grants. \u2022\ufffd Risk management, overall expectation and communication needs of the PRs, SRs and SSRs are often inconsistent and different from traditional CCM-focused country. \u2022\ufffd The role and operability of the Local Fund Agent under community-led multi-country grants is perceived to be inconsistent and often impeded grant progress. The Global Fund Strategy Framework and Transformation Plan At the 25th Global Fund Board in November 2011, a new Strategy Framework and Transformation Plan were adopted that will impact how the Fund supports most-at-risk populations and strengthens community systems. Key elements include: \u2022\ufffd Replacing the rounds system with a two-step iterative proposal development process. \u2022\ufffd An increased emphasis on re-programming of current grants. \u2022\ufffd Increased focus on targeted, evidenced-based interventions that address the needs of key affected populations. \u2022\ufffd A revised approach to risk management that moves away from the current one size fits all models. \u2022\ufffd A specific Human Rights Strategic Objective intended to: (a) Integrate human rights considerations throughout the grant cycle; (b) Increase investments in programmes that address human rights-related barriers to access; and (c) Ensure that the Global Fund does not support programmes that infringe human rights. Impact of Decisions from the November 2011 Global Fund Board Meeting A lack of funding led to a series of decisions at the November 2011 Global Fund Board meeting that will also have a strong impact on efforts to support community systems strengthening and multi-country proposals supporting most at-risk populations. These include: Making Global Fund Money Work for Communities: Community Partnership Consultation Pattaya, Thailand, 7-8 December 2011 8 \u2022\ufffd Cancellation of the Round 11 grant cycle. A number of organizations representing key affected populations were already engaged in the development of multi-country proposals for Round 11, but these will not go forward until at least 2014. \u2022\ufffd Elimination of any proposals from G20 countries, including Phase Two renewals. \u2022\ufffd Development of a transitional funding mechanism to ensure continuation of services in countries where Global Fund grants will end prior to 2014. This transitional funding will not cover expansion of services and will be limited to \u201cessential services\u201d, the definition of which is in development. Consultation in Pattaya In December 2011, UNDP, Open Society Foundations, and the Global Fund partnered with UNAIDS, KHANA International AIDS Alliance and 7 Sisters to convene the \u2018Making Global Fund Money Work for Communities: Community Partnership Consultation\u2019 in Pattaya, Thailand. The consultation\u2019s aim was to document the experience of participants in the development and implementation of Global Fund multi-country grants and generate policy guidance and recommendations for the Global Fund and other stakeholders to strengthen the effectiveness, management and oversight of these funding streams. These recommendations are meant to ensure that community-based organizations can fully participate in Global Fund HIV programmes, inform the recently approved Human Rights Strategy and better meet the needs of their communities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "572e0d54-1d2b-4894-9043-d4d39939244e": {"__data__": {"id_": "572e0d54-1d2b-4894-9043-d4d39939244e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-global-fund-money-work-communities-community-partnership-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making Global Fund Money Work for Communities: Community Partnership Consultation - Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-global-fund-money-work-communities-community-partnership-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "11c299964d215465f6a656d625f0bb2b6510913fbbc8258140470c88ff61ac50"}, "2": {"node_id": "0355fe59-6b21-4aec-a442-62a6e6fd8c8e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-global-fund-money-work-communities-community-partnership-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "72b7599a8be9653eba5bf336386c649749526fd7d2823c97734749e4dc0ae68a"}}, "hash": "0815e27d3559d49973e2ef906e113fae2ecaf095f72ddb7c6a57a6e1c1edf4bf", "text": "Representatives from over 30 community-based organizations and individuals from key affected populations and people living with HIV representing Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Eastern Europe and Latin America attended the meeting.

Their questions, comments and strategies are described in each section of this report. The consultation focused on the following areas: (1) proposal development and grant negotiation; (2) programme implementation; (3) grant renewals and re-programming and; (4) advocacy. The meeting agenda, participant list, presentations and background documents are all available through a web index at: 9 Proposal Development Proposal Development The development of any Global Fund proposal is challenging. Multi-country proposals are even more so. Such proposals usually require the endorsement of the CCM from each participating country. To be successful, a multi-country proposal should adequately demonstrate the added value of a regional approach compared to country-level proposals, alignment and additionality with national plans, and administrative expertise to oversee a complex infrastructure. Technical and financial support for community-driven multi- country proposal development can be difficult to obtain when compared to government support for country-level proposals. Administrative capacity must often be developed in comparison to what governments can provide. The development of the proposal involves identifying and negotiating with multiple partners in different countries, often with varying needs and capacities. Historically, multi-country proposals have not been viewed favourably by the Global Fund Technical Review Panel and proposal submission and review processes favour country- level applications. However, in the past three grant rounds, there has been a gradual increase in the multi-country proposal approval and an improved understanding that such proposals can produce added value, especially in serving most-at-risk populations, strengthening community systems and addressing human rights programming. And, though challenging, the process of proposal development has been a valuable community mobilization opportunity in and of itself. Despite the difficulties of negotiating with multiple partners across a region, the proposal development process has helped affected communities articulate shared strategies that have strengthened coalition building.

Country grants focus more on quantity, but not quality of services. Treatment literacy and support services were not being provided. As there were few efforts at country levels to address these gaps, APN+ decided to develop a regional proposal to support peer-based services and advocacy for people living with HIV. \u2022\ufffd National PLHIV networks are underfunded, despite the amount of funding that the country receives through the GF grant. This has led country networks to become donor driven, and there is no continuity in their advocacy efforts. Staff members of national PLHIV networks are seriously underpaid, despite expectations of them being \u2018superman\u2019, responsible for mobilizing their communities, establishing relationships with government agencies, understanding UN languages, developing and implementing services, raising and administering funds. Proposal Development \u2022\ufffd Technical Support Facility for Southeast Asia and Pacific (TSF-SEAP) provided support for the proposal development. At the country level, UNAIDS Country Offices (UCOs) provide support for grant implementation. \u2022\ufffd Initially, 11 country networks were involved in the proposal but in the end only seven remained, with four dropping out for various reasons including difficulties in getting CCM sign-off.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e491f376-efa3-4613-8d16-b712864af11f": {"__data__": {"id_": "e491f376-efa3-4613-8d16-b712864af11f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-global-fund-money-work-communities-community-partnership-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making Global Fund Money Work for Communities: Community Partnership Consultation - Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-global-fund-money-work-communities-community-partnership-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "817e52f05024ace0463841f55cb479dcdbdf31b17f861197d6e5ddfb8851b715"}, "2": {"node_id": "5ca43c1c-2a17-460b-85bd-81c84d0d2cb4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-global-fund-money-work-communities-community-partnership-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ffcda3ad72599bea69b581e34e1380c0235d5a68e6bfba2a17b231b8628317a8"}}, "hash": "3847ebb226ee3013f82b468d987918905e7e85b318de8401adec568642d3e2df", "text": "Funded countries are: Bangladesh, Indonesia, Laos, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Viet Nam \u2022\ufffd The total spending of the proposal development process was US$ 84,000. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Fiji Indonesia Laos Pakistan Philippines Viet Nam 0, 0 2.8, 60.3 0.4, 18.3 0,7.6 0.4, 18.2 0, 27 Country Positive Network Total Funding Estimation from 2004 (not only from GF) (in millions) GF Grants disbursed in the country since 2004 (in millions) 11 Proposal Development", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4c97176f-e962-4156-8eaf-ba9ee2d95152": {"__data__": {"id_": "4c97176f-e962-4156-8eaf-ba9ee2d95152", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-global-fund-money-work-communities-community-partnership-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making Global Fund Money Work for Communities: Community Partnership Consultation - Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-global-fund-money-work-communities-community-partnership-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "938e20561f48873c7f693ec631c515fe883faff1d41acf06100b9be8651d3b9a"}, "3": {"node_id": "9ecfea7f-0b1e-47c8-ad2d-be9cc6f1ad0f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-global-fund-money-work-communities-community-partnership-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3d6ce29c600758b1b5f42a2f5fb021468bb3c47e446c431c892300d067db8df2"}}, "hash": "638b1c66fec4003761debbf58039abb6e147d7e41cbce6eb2bb891ac714c3e37", "text": "The Process Lessons Learned \u2022\ufffd The full involvement of potential SRs in proposal development significantly facilitates better grant implementation and management flow. \u2022\ufffd Mock TRP review process is important to ensure quality of proposal Results Although the proposal was awarded Category 2A by the TRP, 90 percent of the proposed budget was cut because the TRP felt that country activities should not be managed by a regional organization.

CCM engagement is a difficult and time-consuming process, and getting CCM endorsement is contradictory to the reason why the regional proposal was developed in the first place. Even without CCM endorsement, a multi-country proposal can and should be able to align with national plans and demonstrate additionality. \u2022\ufffd Up-front removal (cutting a proposed budget through the proposal review process) should be practiced carefully.

Quality of services and treatment literacy are considered low priority for country grants, but they are important to PLHIV and should be considered essential services in order for treatment to be effective. \u2022\ufffd What\ufffdis\ufffdleft\ufffdfrom\ufffdthe\ufffd90\ufffdpercent\ufffdbudget\ufffdcut?\ufffd - The remaining 10 percent budget approved by the TRP was the only regional SDA in the proposal to establish a regional information system. The regional treatment database establishes a set of community driven indicators to monitor provision of treatment for PLHIV. The proposed budget for this SDA was actually US$7 million, but for reasons unknown, only US$3 million was approved. APN+ is raising funds from other sources to cover the funding gaps. The new two-step iterative process for Global Fund proposal development The GF Transformation Plan proposes a revised two-step grant making process. This includes an initial submission of a Letter of Intent, which, if approved by the TRP, would be followed by further proposal development framed as a negotiation between the applicant, TRP and Global Fund Secretariat. In parallel, key stakeholders will discuss implementation matters so that the proposal that is eventually recommended to the Board will be substantially pre-negotiated and ready for signing shortly after approval. It is thought that this new approach will lead to higher proposal quality; less lost effort; improved risk management through earlier risk identification and management; and more informed decision-making on proposals. How this new process can be applied to multi-country proposals is not yet clear, nor addressed in the Transformation Plan. The two-step process includes ongoing negotiation with the CCM prior to approval. Whether and how multiple CCMs will be able and willing to participate in such negotiations requires further discussion.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9ecfea7f-0b1e-47c8-ad2d-be9cc6f1ad0f": {"__data__": {"id_": "9ecfea7f-0b1e-47c8-ad2d-be9cc6f1ad0f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-global-fund-money-work-communities-community-partnership-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making Global Fund Money Work for Communities: Community Partnership Consultation - Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-global-fund-money-work-communities-community-partnership-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "938e20561f48873c7f693ec631c515fe883faff1d41acf06100b9be8651d3b9a"}, "2": {"node_id": "4c97176f-e962-4156-8eaf-ba9ee2d95152", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-global-fund-money-work-communities-community-partnership-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "638b1c66fec4003761debbf58039abb6e147d7e41cbce6eb2bb891ac714c3e37"}}, "hash": "3d6ce29c600758b1b5f42a2f5fb021468bb3c47e446c431c892300d067db8df2", "text": "Issues, Concerns and Recommendations about Proposal Development \u2022\ufffd Does\ufffdthe\ufffdTRP\ufffdhave\ufffdadequate\ufffdexpertise\ufffdto\ufffdreview\ufffdcommunity-based\ufffdproposals\ufffdand\ufffd programme\ufffd designs?\ufffdThe\ufffd kind\ufffd of\ufffd expertise\ufffd required\ufffd to\ufffd understand\ufffd and\ufffd evaluate\ufffd multi-country proposals developed and led by organizations representing most at- risk populations is not well-defined by the Global Fund.

Not only had they spent a great deal of time working with partners and drafting proposals, but funding received for proposal development could have been used for other purposes. Significant amounts of funding have gone toward proposals that will not be considered for at least two years. 15 Grant Negotiation Grant Negotiation After TRP approval, a Global Fund proposal moves into the grant negotiation phase. As most proposals are written within a short time frame, the negotiation phase is where the real details of programme activities, budgets and monitoring processes are settled.

The Caribbean Vulnerable Communities Coalition (CVC) and El Centro de Orientaci\u00f3n e Investigaci\u00f3n Integral are the sub-recipients of the Vulnerable Groups Component of the PANCAP Round 9 Regional Global Fund Project, a five-year project which in Phase One will develop a strategy and model programming for preventing HIV among vulnerable groups in Trinidad, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic, and in Phase Two will expand programming to incorporate the Eastern Caribbean. The project has two key approaches: the first emphasizes mobilization and community development to foster collective commitment in prevention, secured through partnering with CVC member organizations (lead in-country, non-governmental and community- based organizations) throughout the Caribbean. The second approach stresses the added value of combining the forces of civil society with those of government. The CVC/ COIN Vulnerable Group Project seeks to achieve two lasting impacts: - Increased access to services among vulnerable groups. - Lower sero-prevalence among vulnerable groups. The strategy for achieving these impacts rests on four critical approaches: - Creation of an enabling environment; - Providing empowerment opportunities and options for vulnerable groups; - Addressing sexual and reproductive health needs of vulnerable groups; and - Scaling-up the scope of interventions. Making Global Fund Money Work for Communities: Community Partnership Consultation Pattaya, Thailand, 7-8 December 2011 16 In the Caribbean, there is a strong involvement of MARPs communities in proposal development and grant negotiations. In the Dominican Republic, five seats on the CCM are reserved for MARPs as follows: AIDS service organizations, networks of MSM, sex workers, youth and PLHIV. At a regional level, the membership of PANCAP - a multi- sectorial organization established to coordinate regional efforts on HIV \u2013 includes two community-based networks - the Coalition of Vulnerable Communities and COIN. The strength of civil society in the region and its meaningful engagement in Global Fund processes has resulted in solid proposals to support MSM, IDUs, prisoners, marginalized youth and sex workers. For the country proposal (in this case, Dominican Republic), civil society organized in working groups to develop content of RCC, based on three major axis: health system strengthening; care and treatment; and prevention. The implementation for the latter axis was to be spearheaded by civil society. The result of the collaboration through PANCAP on the multi-country proposal resulted in the strong involvement of civil society in the architecture of the proposal and a civil society-led programme focused on vulnerable groups as a core component of the overall project, which was vital to securing the grant. During the grant negotiation, there were successive rounds of budget cuts and changes to the work plan to arrive at GF approval of PANCAP R9 grant. The budget cuts and work plan revisions were done in full consultation with civil society through a transparent process. At the end, one-third of the final approved budget was assigned to the vulnerable groups\u2019 project with CVC and COIN named as the SRs. However, after the negotiation was supposedly complete, the Global Fund required a mandatory 15 percent efficiency cut on the full amount awarded. No directives given to the PR about how to make these cuts, or what procedures to follow to achieve them. The budget cuts were done through a closed-door negotiation between PR and GF Secretariat with no consultation with the SRs. The SRs were informed to expect a 15 percent across the board cut in their respective overall budgets. Examples of the additional \u201cefficiency\u201d budget cuts included: - No paid staff for the first three months of the project (Set-up and procurement period) 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 120% Original Budget After Imposed Cuts Actual Cuts (Final Budget) Series1 17 Grant Negotiation - Amount of mini-grants for pilot programmes reduced to under US$2,000, an amount not feasible to meet programme needs. - Funding to support implementation costs to NGOs/ CBOs were cut completely. - Funds to carry out project interventions in three countries in the first phase were cut to cover only two countries. - Funding for some key project components (e.g. support groups) were completely eliminated. - Changes were made to the budget, but not reflected in the work plan, performance framework or M&E plan. There were major disparities among these documents. For example, the budget for the peer education programme was postponed until Year Two, but performance framework still contained a target number of people to be reached through the programme in Year One.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b27041b7-2c2c-4266-b402-1136abda42ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "b27041b7-2c2c-4266-b402-1136abda42ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-global-fund-money-work-communities-community-partnership-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making Global Fund Money Work for Communities: Community Partnership Consultation - Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-global-fund-money-work-communities-community-partnership-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dbaabc3d20881b954689f29f62c1a54965ed400b516ded57167e3a10277df177"}, "2": {"node_id": "e15c52ad-4bfc-4322-899f-e5503f21f129", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-global-fund-money-work-communities-community-partnership-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "960159f865df0802c9782dfbdff00d2850a6a1f82fac4465125b18bd5834dbba"}}, "hash": "e8257e21a7c78c4d6138ffbdefa2b7286cd7035c8d127d4a5242b41429235fed", "text": "The budget cuts and delayed implementation resulted in extensive re-programming and consolidation including inadequate staff for the important set-up and procurement phase.

The programmatic distortion compromises a well thought-out and carefully crafted proposal.

The presentation ended with a strong message to the Secretariat regarding issues of ownership and liability. The Global Fund negotiates with PR who is liable for the grants, while the primary beneficiaries of the Fund are the SRs and SSRs as implementers.

LFAs often do not possess even a basic knowledge of HIV and are not familiar with on-the-ground realities, including political and social contexts as well as the needs of most-at-risk populations. Recommendation: In selection and training of LFAs and FPMs, they must have the capacity to understand how community-based programmes function, how community-based organizations are structured and how the needs of the populations they serve require flexibility in programme implementation.

The role of the FPM should be to ensure that programmatic and policy goals are the priority in the grant negotiation process and that financial oversight is performed in such a way as to promote and enhance the programmatic vision. Recommendation: The Global Fund should clarify the roles of FPMs and LFAs and provide FPMs with the capacity and authority to ensure that grant negotiations are transparent, focused on fulfilling programme goals, and conducted in the best interests of key affected populations. 19 Grant Implementation Grant Implementation No one has a greater stake in good fiscal management and oversight at the Global Fund than communities affected by HIV.

These CBOs invited PSI Nepal as the PR and UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre as the Technical Assistance Provider. The estimated cost of the proposal development was US$250,000 and the overall grant size is US$44 million. The grant negotiation process took 14 months. The service delivery areas are: 1. To increase capacity and improve the delivery of HIV related services for MSM and TG in South Asian countries. 2. To improve the policy environment with regard to MSM, TG and HIV related issues in South Asian countries. 3. To improve strategic knowledge on MSM, TG and HIV related issues in South Asian countries. The primary focus of the grant is community systems strengthening in all seven countries. In addition, direct service delivery is provided in Afghanistan and Pakistan. During the grant negotiation, the budget was cut by approximately 12 percent. The budgets were prepared in 2008 but the grant was not approved until 2010. The Global Fund continued to rely on the old budgets, despite changes in costs over time. There were other long delays in programme approval. For example, eight months after the start of the programme, the training plan was not approved. Despite this, Project Diva was still expected to meet all original targets. This presentation set the stage for key discussions about how the Global Fund defines and manages risk, how Global Fund accountability structures can actually impede the goals of funded programs, and how implementation of the CSS Framework will require development of new and innovative approaches for programme support and monitoring in order to be effective. 7 Participating countries include Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka Making Global Fund Money Work for Communities: Community Partnership Consultation Pattaya, Thailand, 7-8 December 2011 20 Issues, Concerns and Recommendations about Programme Implementation \u2022\ufffd In\ufffdan\ufffdeffort\ufffdto\ufffdreduce\ufffdfinancial\ufffdrisk\ufffdand\ufffdbetter\ufffdmonitor\ufffdprogramme\ufffdperformance,\ufffdthe\ufffd Global Fund has initiated risk management processes that actually threaten the ability of community-based organizations to implement programmes successfully. There is an emphasis on quantity, not quality. The content or outcomes from workshops and trainings are barely considered; instead there is an over-emphasis on quantifying the numbers of people attending events. Many examples were provided at the meeting, including: - Requiring workshop participants to provide copies of ID cards to prove their attendance. This jeopardized participant confidentiality, a priority for the target audiences of these workshops - MSM, sex workers and drug users. - Refusing to allow for budget changes to cover emergencies, including one instance in which people attending a workshop were injured in an auto accident on their way to the event and required medical care. - After workshop participants were required to sign two separate forms - one stating they were transported to a workshop and another to state they actually attended the workshop, outreach workers were forced to re-visit each of the attendees for a third signature because the languages of the first two documents were not the same. Recommendation: As the Global Fund Secretariat and Board revise risk management policies and procedures, approaches that best meet the needs of community-driven multi-country grants need to be considered. Fiscal accountability should not be the only consideration. The ways in which fiscal accountability is monitored must be re- examined to look at its effect on programme implementation. Flexibility in working with civil society SRs and SSRs, particularly those working with MARPs, is essential for effective programme implementation. Improved training about HIV and HIV service delivery for FPMs and LFAs would also lead to more rational implementation of risk management approaches. \u2022\ufffd The\ufffd administrative\ufffd burden\ufffd placed\ufffd on\ufffd PRs\ufffd and\ufffd SRs\ufffd is\ufffd high.\ufffd \ufffd For\ufffd SRs\ufffd involved\ufffd in\ufffd community-led multi-country grants, there is a significant danger of overwhelming the organization with administrative responsibilities that undermine their ability to serve its community.

There were several examples of multiple requests for the same set of documents and for requests to be made piecemeal. - Decision-making is very hierarchical.

Recommendations: - Include SRs and SSRs in the discussions between PRs and the Secretariat. - Increase budget lines for communications and coordination to support programme implementation. - Replace the current hierarchical structure with a more horizontal partnership structure. - Performance criteria for FPMs and LFAs should be established and SRs and SSRs should be involved in the evaluation of their performance. - Requests for documentation and information should be well coordinated and efficient so as not to waste staff time and reduce administrative burdens. Making Global Fund Money Work for Communities: Community Partnership Consultation Pattaya, Thailand, 7-8 December 2011 22 Renewals and Re-programming The Global Fund Strategy calls for an evolving funding model that supports strategic refocusing of existing investments. The Strategy also emphasizes the need for the Global Fund to support rights-based approaches to service delivery and policy. Phase Two renewals and re-programming of existing grants offer key opportunities to redirect funding toward those interventions with proven impact and which support human rights programming and the engagement of vulnerable populations. The Community Systems Strengthening framework and MARPs Targeted Pool both provide important mechanisms for funding proven efforts to reach most-at-risk populations through rights-based services that decrease HIV transmission rates and produce better health outcomes. The recent cancellation of Round 11 increases the importance of re- programming to ensure that scale up of rights-based programming focused on those most in need is continued. One example showing the added value is the EPOS evaluation, a study conducted by the Global Fund Commissioners to look at effectiveness of the models including the current support provided through multi-country grants. The results of this study have not yet been published but the study was discussed at the consultation. According to the EPOS, multi-country grants: \u2022\ufffd Fill in the gaps and needs that may not have been met by national HIV programmes, such as those of key affected populations. \u2022\ufffd Positively influence national programmes creating spin-off effects, such as alignment of treatment protocols throughout regions. \u2022\ufffd Address legal and policy barriers that undermine the effectiveness of HIV programme interventions and access of MARPs in accessing prevention, treatment and care services. \u2022\ufffd Strengthen national level networks for improved response. Communities use regional processes to address areas that are not met. Recommendations on Re-programming and Renewals: \u2022\ufffd Collect additional evidence on the outcomes and impact of multi-country grants. \u2022\ufffd Develop a better guidance on good programming for MARPs to ensure quality. The guidance would include human rights standards for implementers and the Global Fund. Communities must be involved in the development of this HR guideline. Develop specific proposal forms for Phase Two renewal processes for multi-country implementers that respond to specific multi-country proposal issues. Non-CCM options need to be validated, given the current multi-country proposal procedure that requires CCM endorsement, especially in countries where CCM oppose funding for MARPs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8920f220-dad4-4a92-a732-8b259fb1fdc1": {"__data__": {"id_": "8920f220-dad4-4a92-a732-8b259fb1fdc1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-global-fund-money-work-communities-community-partnership-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making Global Fund Money Work for Communities: Community Partnership Consultation - Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-global-fund-money-work-communities-community-partnership-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "18556112bf0bee4886276721d73a5f4c3f544dd5d0914a2b760f880bbdb54d32"}, "2": {"node_id": "8e5fdbfd-37a6-46bb-94a2-8d3654e5acc1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-global-fund-money-work-communities-community-partnership-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "db928a1ee96938fc9ef39ef0461e1282ce4b163b3b06818c17bffc7145354d3a"}}, "hash": "7b3fa1df965f080941aad6ee8ed76265436863ff32c37535b1fd670d71011d20", "text": "\u2022\ufffd Prioritise programmes that protect and promote human rights, using Phase Two as opportunities to stop funding for programmes that violate human rights (such as forced provider-initiated testing for sex workers and programmes that are supportive of criminalization of HIV transmission, sexual behaviours and drug use). \u2022\ufffd Develop a mechanism to directly fund communities.

Making Global Fund Money Work for Communities: Community Partnership Consultation Pattaya, Thailand, 7-8 December 2011 24 Conclusion Multi-country Global Fund grants led by and serving key affected populations strengthen community systems, improve access to health and prevention services for vulnerable groups, and successfully advocate for human rights protections for their communities. As a result of their unique ability to access hard-to-reach population, multi-country grants provide significant additionality to country-level grants. To be successful, the Global Fund should increase the expertise of its staff, the TRP and LFAs to better meet the needs of multi-country grantees. The Global Fund should develop application mechanisms, communications systems and risk management approaches that are specifically designed to encourage and support multi-county proposal development and implementation with a focus on key affected populations. Support for these proposals is an essential component for implementation of the Global Fund\u2019s human rights strategy.

Recommendations 26 References 29 MDG 3 anD 6: What Do they say? vi ForeWorD This report brings to us views of women and girls living with HIV from India, the Philippines, and Papua New Guinea (PNG) on progress that has been made in achieving Millennium Development Goal 3 (Promote gender equality and empower women) and Millennium Development Goal 6 (Combat HIV, malaria, and other diseases). Although the Asia-Pacifi c region as a whole is on track to reach the two Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the perspective from these women and girls is grim and gives little reason to celebrate. The report demonstrates that women and girls living with HIV are far too often stigmatised and discriminated against. This hampers them from accessing vital antiretroviral treatment and other health services, in many instances causing grievous harm to themselves and their children. Similarly, because of stigma and discrimination, many women continue to lose their livelihoods and employment, property, and inheritance. In addition, girls living with HIV, or from households with HIV, often face varying degrees of ostracism at school. Despite the tremendous work done in these countries to provide a conducive legal and policy environment, the challenges faced by women and girls are still not adequately addressed. For example, although social protection schemes exist in all three countries discussed, HIV-positive women found them only sporadically available and diffi cult to access. Women also reported that many of these schemes are reliant on donor/external funding, leaving them insecure about their sustainability. The report notes that violence against women is widespread in the region and is linked to HIV.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e449cdd4-c31e-4ebf-a90d-bca6cc4ab816": {"__data__": {"id_": "e449cdd4-c31e-4ebf-a90d-bca6cc4ab816", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-3-and-6-what-do-they-say", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "MDG 3 And 6: What Do They Say", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-3-and-6-what-do-they-say", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a9f576add423a1686f933ea4528e5d05d608840b7ee33f399f670b2b6d7196c1"}, "2": {"node_id": "ae26fd51-5701-4fb2-9452-b446a9c4a0be", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-3-and-6-what-do-they-say", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0527bc3c87d3c7b1950211716ea932006ad05516f7933906f4470e3d5f3b4a29"}}, "hash": "573ba322a9f8dc6e2b7daa4c9d286eb1bd9a6f55653fe89f0e5c3c90ae2cbcf1", "text": "The report notes that violence against women is widespread in the region and is linked to HIV.

Implementation of the recommendations of this report is critical to accelerate the agenda on achieving MDGs 3 and 6. Advocacy and awareness eff orts must be accelerated, while ensuring that such campaigns do not further stigmatise women living with HIV.

In early 2010 it was reported that \u201cThe region as a whole is an early achiever for a number of indicators: reducing gender disparities in primary and tertiary education; [and] stopping the spread of HIV and AIDS\u201d (UNESCAP, ADB, UNDP 2010: 1). Despite this encouragement, however, ground assessments from country progress reports are mixed. HIV infections among women in the region are on the increase. Of all positive people in the region, the proportion of women living with HIV rose from 19 percent in 2000 to 35 percent in 2008 (UNAIDS 2009). Prenatal transmission also continues to be on the rise, the latter accounting for 5.1 percent of new infections in 2005 (SPC 2009). Joint research by WHO, UNAIDS, and UNICEF conducted in 2009 estimates that only 12 percent of pregnant women in East, South, and South-East Asia receive an HIV test. The extent of antiretroviral (ARV) coverage likewise appears to be in the need of urgent attention. The same research suggests that only a quarter of HIV-infected pregnant women were receiving ARVs, while ARV coverage across the whole population was marginally more than a third. In early 2010, as input to the 2010 UN Millennium Development Goals Summit, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) lead a process by which national-level networks or organizations of women living with HIV across the globe could analyse their region\u2019s progress in achieving MDGs 3 and 6 from the perspective of women and girls\u2019 HIV-related vulnerabilities and resilience. This is in line with UNAIDS\u2019 2010 \u201cAgenda for Accelerated Country Action for Women, Girls, Gender Equality, and HIV,\u201d which emphasises that while the political commitment to empowering women and addressing the drivers (and the impact) of HIV among/on women and girls continues to be unequivocally articulated, achievements on the ground remain, at best, limited. Under this initiative the UNDP HIV Practice Team, Regional Centre, Bangkok, engaged women living with HIV in three countries in the Asia-Pacific region: Papua New Guinea (PNG), the Philippines, and India. Focus group discussions involving a total of 135 women (35 in three centres in PNG, 30 in one centre in the Philippines, and 70 in four cities India) were conducted over a staggered period of 30 days. The findings of these consultations form the crux of this Regional Report.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3221946d-1d61-4244-90ee-b8bfd384e6c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "3221946d-1d61-4244-90ee-b8bfd384e6c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-3-and-6-what-do-they-say", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "MDG 3 And 6: What Do They Say", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-3-and-6-what-do-they-say", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ffefd5e9e0fefe41337f04b76731f45b9154068c6b34dddcd280b82ae8fa2533"}, "2": {"node_id": "ab632786-18e2-4161-8cbd-2e81ca60ab52", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-3-and-6-what-do-they-say", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "018384dae41509cd793025ac9dad23c477af06791abf8f9031eabe9628988fe5"}}, "hash": "a358856cfcd55a60b38096acf7380cf3f22d861bfcde65ae03cb7dcae34f46e7", "text": "The findings of these consultations form the crux of this Regional Report.

Awareness of sexual and reproductive rights among girls is negligible. \u2022\ufffd Although condoms are easily accessible, women rely on male partners/spouses to procure and use condoms.

In the light of these findings, this report makes the following recommendations: \u2022\ufffd More resources need to be allocated to improve the extent and quality of post-testing and PMTCT counselling, especially to train healthcare workers and by forging partnerships with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and networks of people living with HIV (PLHIV). \u2022\ufffd Time-bound plans are needed to address discrimination in service delivery settings, particularly in view of the barriers it poses to accessing life-saving treatments, through legal and behavioural steps. \u2022\ufffd Avenues for lowering costs of accessing ARV treatment need to be explored, for example, home delivery of treatment and of portable CD4 diagnostic machines for home-based use (CD4 is the type of cell attacked by HIV). \u2022\ufffd There is a clear need to push for institutionalised delivery of age-appropriate sex education for children and adolescent. \u2022\ufffd Specific efforts should be made to ensure that girls affected by HIV are not pulled out of school. \u2022\ufffd Because male condoms remain the most effective-HIV prevention intervention, there is an urgent need to educate and involve all stakeholders in condom use.

In early 2010 it was reported that \u201cThe region as a whole is an early achiever for a number of indicators: reducing gender disparities in primary and tertiary education; [and] stopping the spread of HIV and AIDS\u201d (UNESCAP, ADB, UNDP 2010: 1). Despite this encouragement, however, ground assessments from country progress reports are mixed. HIV infections among women in the region are on the increase, with the proportion of women living with HIV raising from 19 percent in 2000 to 35 percent in 2008 (UNAIDS 2009). Prenatal transmission also continues to be on the rise, the latter accounting for 5.1 percent of new infections in 2005 (SPC 2009). Joint research by WHO, UNAIDS, and UNICEF conducted in 2009 estimates that only 12 percent of pregnant women in East, South, and South-East Asia receive an HIV test. The extent of antiretroviral (ARV) coverage likewise appears to be in the need of urgent attention. The same research suggests that only a quarter of HIV-infected pregnant women were receiving ARVs, while ARV coverage across the whole population was marginally more than a third. In early 2010, as input to the 2010 UN Millennium Development Goals Summit, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) lead a process by which national-level networks or organizations of women living with HIV across the globe could analyse their region\u2019s progress in achieving MDGs 3 and 6 from the perspective of women and girls\u2019 HIV-related vulnerabilities and resilience. This is in line with the 2010 UNAIDS \u201cAgenda for Accelerated Country Action for Women, Girls, Gender Equality, and HIV,\u201d which emphasises that while the political commitment to empowering women and addressing the drivers (and the impact) of HIV among/on women and girls continues to be unequivocally articulated, achievements on the ground remain, at best, limited. Under this initiative the UNDP HIV Practice Team, Regional Centre, Bangkok, engaged women living with HIV in three countries in the Asia-Pacific region: Papua New Guinea (PNG), the Philippines, and India. Focus group discussions involving a total of 135 women (35 in three centres in PNG, 30 in one centre in the Philippines, and 70 in four cities India) were conducted over a staggered period of 30 days. The findings of these consultations form the crux of this Regional Report. It is envisaged that the women\u2019s narratives will draw attention to both best practices and bottlenecks in the design and delivery of HIV prevention and treatment technologies and social support systems for women and girls living with HIV. Ultimately, by contributing to the discussions at the 2010 UN MDG Summit, this report hopes to contribute to the formulation of effective HIV and gender empowerment policies that are sensitive to the particular perspectives, vulnerabilities, and social contexts of these women in Asia and the Pacific. This report is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a statistical overview of the state of the epidemic in the region and summarizes the latest MDG progress reports from the three countries under study. Section 3 provides a description of the methodology used in the report\u2019s preparation; and the findings of the consultations with women living with HIV in these countries are presented and evaluated against the country reports in Section 4. Based on identified gaps and best practices, recommendations for accessing prevention/treatment technologies, economic support systems, accurate HIV-related knowledge, and supportive institutional and social environments are presented in the final section.

In the same year, AIDS accounted for an estimated 330,000 deaths. India accounts for roughly half of Asia\u2019s HIV incidence (AIDS Epidemic Update 2009). Despite low prevalence rates in Asia (most Asian countries have adult prevalence rates of less than 1 percent), the absolute size of the epidemic has immense development implications: the Commission on AIDS in Asia (2008) estimates that the epidemic will account for the poverty of 6 million additional households. While Asia\u2019s epidemic has had a history of being localised within specific populations, sexual modes of transmission is significantly contributing to the spread of infection to groups hitherto considered to be at low risk.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ae9c7aa-0e8f-45b2-9ef4-736c99cbc32b": {"__data__": {"id_": "6ae9c7aa-0e8f-45b2-9ef4-736c99cbc32b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-3-and-6-what-do-they-say", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "MDG 3 And 6: What Do They Say", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-3-and-6-what-do-they-say", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "74cef6ff9dd29783070f0e1e985b98ae7280af61aa299f3370faa30ca581f4c0"}, "2": {"node_id": "21519c2f-3694-4dd6-9b77-fb4c33564a6e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-3-and-6-what-do-they-say", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5d4bbcd6692c6ca7b0a7d361438d7e3ce50a23be14493d342cac75149cc85559"}}, "hash": "f04925019e0ce6dd39bee10496c8bca613e3c1ea22e0073caf109bcb9f46b994", "text": "In India, for example, barring the North East, sexual transmission accounts for a staggering 90 percent of all new infections.

Especially as a result of risky sexual behaviour of male partners and a relative lack of female empowerment, women are particularly vulnerable to infection. The proportion of women among all HIV-positive people in the region rose from 19 percent in 2000 to 35 percent in 2008. In particular country contexts, women\u2019s lack of resilience to HIV is dramatically manifest. For example, India\u2019s National AIDS Control Organisation (2008) estimated that women account for 39 percent of nation-wide HIV prevalence. Attempts to scale-up treatment coverage in Asia has been met with mixed success. According to UNAIDS (2009), in 2008 marginally more than a third of all PLHIV in need of ART were receiving it. While this represents a seven- fold increase in treatment coverage over a five-year period, it is still below the global average for all middle- and low-income countries. Data from 2008 estimates that 21,000 children in Asia below the age of 15 were newly infected with HIV that year. While the percentage of prenatal transmission among new HIV infections remains modest, there is a threat that a significant shift might occur if ARV coverage of pregnant women does not expand rapidly; and UNAIDS estimates that only about a quarter of positive pregnant women were receiving antiretroviral therapy as of 2009. While this is a significant improvement over the 8 percent coverage reported in 2004, it is still 20 percentage points below the relevant global average for middle- and low-income countries. 2.2 Country level review of MDG 3 and MDG 6: Progress reports from Papua new Guinea, the Philippines, and India It is not surprising that in the developing world progress in meeting MDG 3 targets is, more often than not, correlated with progress in meeting MDG 6 targets (especially with respect to HIV/AIDS). Gender equality and the empowerment of women (comprising increased and equal access of women to educational opportunities, increased and equal participation by women in formal employment outside such traditional sectors as agriculture, proportional representation of women in political processes, and immunity from gender-based violence, among 2 MDG 3 anD 6: What Do they say? 6 others) are indispensable in counteracting the prevalence, incidence, and spread of HIV/AIDS. Conversely, there is valid concern that an inability to contain and reverse the spread of HIV can severely compromise the push towards gender equality. Thus, acknowledging the complementarities between MDG 3 and MDG 6 is critical to designing, implementing, and reviewing effective interventions at the global, national, and community level. 2.2.1 Papua new Guinea Papua New Guinea (PNG) provides the most convincing evidence for the nexus between gender disparity and the surge in HIV incidence and prevalence. According to the country\u2019s latest progress report, issued in 2009, there is very little cause for optimism that it will be able to meet the 2015 deadline in terms of MDGs 3 and 6. With respect to MDG 3, Gender Parity Indices (GPIs) of both primary and secondary Gender Enrolment Ratios and Cohort Retention Ratios continue to remain low, dropping below the 1990 base year values in several instances. Even after adjusting for the spatial variability in statistics (gender disparity is significantly more pronounced in the Highlands area than elsewhere), it appears highly improbable that PNG can achieve the targeted values on the education related GPIs by 2015. The report yields more disheartening news on the progress on other dimensions of gender equality and female empowerment in the non-agricultural sector; female representation in the national Parliament is at less than 1 percent; and gender-based violence shows an increasing trend. Poor performance on the MDG 3 front is mirrored by poor performance on the HIV component of MDG 6. Even though the annual rate of increase in HIV infections has stabilised, the annual number of new infections as well as HIV prevalence and incidence show steady increases; as such, it is highly unlikely that targets under MDG 6 will be met by 2015. A spatial disparity in relevant statistics corresponding to the one observed in gender equality- related indicators is also observed (infection, prevalence, and incidence rates are highest in the Highlands area), confirming the thesis that MDG 3 and MDG 6 are highly correlated. The report acknowledges as much, on the one hand highlighting gender disparity as the prime driver of the HIV epidemic, while on the other hand identifying high HIV/AIDS incidence as the most significant impediment to the empowerment of women. Nonetheless, on some fronts the country\u2019s performance in combating HIV/AIDS gives reason for optimism.

In the rural areas, however, the transmission of HIV-related knowledge is still restricted to the information provided by healthcare workers. Similarly, the coverage of the ART programme, which started in 2004, has increased to more than 60 percent. Heartening, close to 20 percent of health facilities across the country were equipped to provide ART in 2008. The PNG report identifies several factors that impair the country\u2019s capacity to eliminate gender disparities and manage HIV-related concerns effectively. Low nominal wages in the rural sector; high un- and underemployment in the urban sector (as much a consequence of institutional factors as of high fertility rates); and inadequate allocation in the national budget for the education, employment, and healthcare for women all exacerbate traditionally high economic disparities. Further, the sociocultural context is such that it condones (or, at least, does not condemn) institutionalized preferential treatment for boys over girls. Girls, for example, are more likely to be withdrawn from school to look after a person living with HIV/AIDS, as well as being more likely to bear the economic burden of an HIV-related drop in household income. The situation is further worsened by such practices as the marriage of girls below the age of 15 and endemic gender-based violence. MDG 3 anD 6: What Do they say? 7 In terms of managing HIV-related issues, significant obstacles as identified by the report include inadequate HIV surveillance (partly attributable to infrastructure scarcity and partly to the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS); a complacent political leadership that under allocates funds for HIV/AIDS interventions; a high incidence of seasonal, economically motivated migration to high HIV-prevalence areas; HIV-induced reduction in income earning opportunities and consequent poverty; low levels of education and literacy that compromise HIV awareness and sustain the stigmatization of persons living with HIV; high-risk sexual behaviour, including unsafe sex and sex with multiple partners; and the routine occurrence of gender-based violence, including rape and incest. An examination of these challenges clearly reveals the nexus between a failure to empower women and their heightened vulnerability to HIV, as well as the inability of women living with HIV to function normally and effectively within society. Conversely, it is also apparent that HIV mitigates against women\u2019s empowerment by marginalizing those living with HIV and depriving them of opportunities to realize their economic, social, and, ultimately, human potential. 2.2.2 the Philippines The Philippines report provides a mixed assessment of the country\u2019s progress towards meeting MDG 3 and MDG 6 targets by 2015. In primary, secondary, and tertiary education, the enrolment, retention, and survival statistics demonstrate a marginal disparity in the favour of women. Further, while the report is silent on gender gaps in wage employment in the formal sector, an analysis of the discipline-based decomposition of female enrolment at the tertiary level, combined with the increasing feminisation of migration for overseas employment, gives reason for optimism. Female representation in politics also show an increasing trend, with the number of elected women representatives across the spectrum of government (from federal to local) increasing from 2,226 in 1995 to 3,040 in 2007. However, the extent to which this increase constitutes an improvement in female empowerment is dubious; political offices remain dominated by men, and a large number of female representatives are elected on the basis of their \u2018male\u2019 connections (that is, their political assets are attributed to being either the mother or daughter of a male politician). An additional cause for concern is the trend in gender-based violence. According to the report, the number of such incidences rises and falls over time; nonetheless, 10,440 cases \u2013 the largest number over a decade \u2013 were reported in 2009, indicating that gender-based violence constitutes a formidable obstacle to female empowerment. In terms of progress on meeting MDG 6 targets, especially with respect to HIV, the Philippines remains a low HIV- prevalence country, with prevalence rates below 1 percent. That said, infection rates show an alarming rate of increase; over the last couple of years the average number of cases reported on a daily basis has doubled, while within the most-at-risk populations prevalence rates have increased between 2007 and 2009 from 0.08 percent to 0.47 percent. Age disaggregated HIV data gives cause for further concern. People in the 20\u201339 age group \u2013 the most productive age category in the labour force \u2013 made up 74 percent of all HIV cases.

Based on these data, the report suggests that the growth in HIV infection rates is driven by an increase in risky behaviour as well as by the limited coverage and efficacy of HIV-prevention related interventions. The case in favour of this hypothesis is bolstered by the findings of the 2008 National Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS). The NDHS made some disturbing revelations about the HIV-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviour of women. Notably, only 11 percent of women in the 15\u201324 age group reported using a condom at their last high-risk sexual encounter; and less than 5 percent in the same age group had comprehensive HIV- MDG 3 anD 6: What Do they say? 8 related knowledge (the corresponding proportion is negligible when it comes to women with no education). In this context, the importance of community-level action to increase HIV awareness and for designing and delivering prevention interventions targeted at MARPs cannot be overestimated in terms of keeping the country on track to meet the MDG 6 targets by 2015. Despite this rather gloomy picture, the Philippines has made substantial progress in expanding ART coverage to those in need. By 2009 the proportion of the population with advanced HIV infection (that is, the proportion with low a CD4 cell count) receiving ART reached 89 percent. Based on this progress, it is reasonable to anticipate full coverage by 2015. In terms of outstanding challenges to meeting MDGs 3 and 6, the Philippines report identifies several institutional and resource bottlenecks that compromise the country\u2019s efforts in eliminating gender disparity and combating the HIV threat. On the first front, significant barriers to women\u2019s empowerment \u2013 despite the government\u2019s efforts to the contrary \u2013 take the form of negligible female participation in bureaucracy and politics; the pervasiveness of gender-based violence; the gender-based inequities inherent in a migration process that systematically discriminates against women, either through labour or immigration laws or by exposing them to exploitation, harassment, and abuse. Efforts to contain HIV, on the other hand, are reportedly frustrated by a multitude of related factors. The coverage of HIV-prevention programmes, especially among MARPs, remains low. While this contributes to insufficient and inaccurate HIV-related knowledge, it also feeds back into lowering HIV-risk perceptions, which, in turn, precipitates an increase in the incidence of risky behaviour. Thus, though the report does not explicitly mention the linkages between the elimination of gender disparity and the mitigation of HIV risk, it is a highly plausible hypothesis that unempowered women \u2013 given their significantly lower resilience \u2013 are most vulnerable to the observed trends in high-risk behaviour. 2.2.3 India Comparable to the Philippines, India\u2019s progress in meeting MDG 3 and MDG 6 targets is encouraging on some fronts and dispiriting on others. Initiatives to eliminate gender inequality and empower women have resulted in a substantial improvement on the education/literacy front; government estimates of primary and secondary enrolment and retention and literacy GPI suggest that at current levels and rates, the country will be able to attain gender parity in this regard by 2015. Nonetheless, gender gaps in tertiary education and wage employment in non-farm sectors persist. Similarly, the proportion of women in the national and state parliaments continues to remain below 7 percent. According to government statistics, overall, India has witnessed a steady decline in the incidence of HIV/AIDS. Prevalence among adults dropped from 0.45 percent (2002) to 0.34 percent (2007); prevalence among pregnant women in the 15\u201324 age group dropped from 0.86 percent (2004) to 0.49 percent (2007); prevalence among pregnant women in the 25\u201349 age group dropped by more than 50 percent, from 1.09 percent (2004) to 0.52 percent (2007); and the number of women living with HIV/AIDS has declined from 1.07 million (2002) to 0.95 million (2007). Nonetheless, there are a few caveats to what appears to be a success story. In contrast to the overall decline of HIV/AIDS, prevalence among MARPs has marginally increased, prompting speculation that the epidemic in India is largely concentrated among high-risk groups. Incidence of HIV/AIDS among IDUs, female sex workers (FSWs), and male sex workers (MSMs) are reported to have increase within the two assessment periods by 0.3 to 1.3 percentage points.

The gap in awareness between rural and urban populations is pronounced, as it is in terms of condom usage. Official statistics suggest that less than 4 percent of the rural population prefers to use condoms over other forms of contraception. Given that sexual transmission has been identified as the primary form of HIV transmission in India, there is considerable potential for this reluctance toward condom usage to undo the advances that the country has made thus far. MDG 3 anD 6: What Do they say? 10 3 MetHoDoLoGy The Asia Pacific Regional Center of UNDP, conducted a situation analysis, including a brief literature review, to identify critical issues related to women\u2019s vulnerability to HIV in region. This was used to develop a list of critical HIV- related indicators (see below) for achieving MDG 3 and MDG 6 and an analysis of critical pathways among these indicators, HIV vulnerability, and the attainment of the two Goals. Based on this list, the consultant formulated key questions regarding how these indicators have contributed to progress in the two MDG areas, as well as country- specific examples of successes and obstacles that have been identified. The indicators were drawn from a number of sources, namely the UNAIDS Action Framework on Women and Girls (2009); a document entitled \u201cTaking Action: Achieving Gender Equality and Empowering Women,\u201d written for the Millennium Project by Caren Grown, Geeta Rao Gupta, and Aslihan Kes (2005), and the website of the Global Coalition on Women and AIDS (www.womenaids.net). 1.

UNDP staff and professional consultants led the FGDs, which were recorded, transcribed, and analysed for this report. MDG 3 anD 6: What Do they say? 11 4 FInDInGs: PuttInG Country ProGress rePorts In PersPeCtIVe While statistical data on gender disparity and HIV phenomena provide concise and comparable bases for measuring country level progress, an over reliance on these assessments runs the risk of obscuring the impact of gender and HIV-related policies on the everyday lives of women living with HIV. Women living with and affected by HIV are, thus, uniquely placed to evaluate the effectiveness of state, NGO, and community-based responses to gender inequality and HIV/AIDS. Their accounts play an invaluable role both in corroborating and contesting the claims made by state assessments of progress. Further, directly involving these women in evaluating the achievements and failings of the various entities involved increases the potential for their participation in the design and delivery of future HIV interventions and in the amendment of current ones. Even more importantly, inclusive projects such as this can make immense contributions to developing social capital among and between HIV-positive networks and organizations as well as between and among the networks, other civil society organizations, and the government. This section compiles and discusses the findings of the focus group discussions conducted with organizations of women living with/affected by HIV/AIDS in India, PNG, and the Philippines, comparing them, where possible, to best practices and bottlenecks identified in the country reports. 4.1 key findings 4.1.1 sexual and HIV-related awareness Given that sexual transmission has emerged as the primary mode of transmission for HIV, increasing sexuality and HIV-related awareness plays a key role in minimising the incidence of risky sexual behaviour. Awareness activities also have the potential to empower women through the provision of timely and accurate information, which will boost their resilience to HIV. Consultations with women from the three countries suggest that, despite improvements in awareness, there is no systematic, coordinated delivery of relevant information.

While awareness, in general, has improved, key obstacles \u2013 as the subsequent discussion will show \u2013 remain. These include a lack of institutionalisation of information delivery; a lack of standardisation in informational content; and a lack of comprehensive coverage of awareness programmes. Participants in the FGDs revealed that a Life Skills Module (which included a sexuality/HIV component) that was taught to secondary and higher secondary school students had been discontinued for several years. While MDG 3 anD 6: What Do they say? 12 representatives from HIV-networks are sometimes invited for sessions on sexuality and HIV in schools and colleges, school authorities forbid discussions about and demonstrations of condom use on the grounds that it would promote sexual experimentation. Primary sources of sexuality-related knowledge among adolescents include the Internet, television, magazines, and peer groups. It was also reported that in rural communities sporadic attempts are made by NGOs, women\u2019s organizations, and state-based child-care (Anganwadi) workers to disseminate sexuality/HIV-related knowledge. Social mores surrounding sexuality prevent the family from being a vehicle for transmission of sex and/or HIV- related knowledge and information. b. Papua new Guinea Focus group participants in PNG revealed that sexuality and HIV-related information was formally integrated into the school curriculum. However, there is a lack of standardisation of the content of such instruction across schools. While in certain schools the coverage is comprehensive, including information on sexual health, safe sexual behaviour, contraception as a way of family planning, and HIV, at other institutions instruction is restricted to only a few aspects of sexuality. Women also noted that the information is either in Tok Pisin or English. In a country of over 850 languages, communicating this information remains a major challenge. Mirroring the findings from India, the discussants revealed that primary sources of sexuality/HIV-related information for adolescent girls included the electronic and print media and peer groups. Women noted that in many instances the reliance of girls on these sources contributed to their having inaccurate information, which, in turn, promoted risky sexual behaviour and increased their vulnerability to HIV. C. the Philippines According to the participants from the Philippines, sexuality and HIV awareness programmes for adolescents are neither comprehensive nor frequent. Despite the creation of a relevant formal curriculum, implementation of the same in schools is not enforced. Catholic schools are reported to steer clear of any instruction of sex and HIV- related matters and concentrate on the biological dimension of sexual activity. Further, efforts by some NGOs to deliver sexuality/HIV-related knowledge to adolescents through classrooms is compromised by their lack of resources. Although participants acknowledged the crucial role that families could play in disseminating critical information on sexual health to teenage girls, they also acknowledged that this potential remains under-tapped due to social and religious norms that frown upon sex-related discussions. Consequently, girls are forced to rely on often inaccurate information provided over the Internet and through movies. 4.1.2 Access to and frequency of use of prevention technology (including condoms and female condoms) Given the primary role that sexual transmission plays in the spread of HIV, promoting and ensuring regular and habitual use of condoms becomes critical to containing the actual or potential epidemic. Two key aspects of ensuring that condoms become an integral part of the sexual lives of individuals are (1) facilitating access to condoms and (2) generating a social climate that normalises condom use. Findings from the FGDs show that while the participating countries have made significant advances on the first aspect, women\u2019s dependence on their partners\u2019 willingness to use condoms, as well as men\u2019s widespread reluctance to do so, create conditions that increase women\u2019s vulnerability to HIV. MDG 3 anD 6: What Do they say? 13 A. India Participants reported that condoms are widely and easily available (and, in many instances, for free) through NGOs, government health care facilities, pharmacies, rural and urban local government centres, and even in boxes in public toilets. Female condoms are more difficult and more expensive to obtain, and only a few participants had heard of female condoms, although some NGOs are reported to distribute them, free of cost, to female sex workers. Nonetheless, participants reported that women must depend on their male partner to procure and use condoms. The social stigma, especially in rural areas, associated with condom use (it is perceived as \u201cdirty\u201d and a woman\u2019s insistence on its use designates her as \u201ccarrying some disease\u201d) and a pervasive male perception that condom use lowers sexual pleasure contribute to the fact that women are most often powerless in ensuring that they are practicing safe sex. b.

They reported an increase in condom usage (although one participant mentioned that she had to commute by bus to get condoms), which they attributed to a variety of sources, including voluntary counselling and testing centres, health clinics, NGOs, family planning clinics, and charitable trusts. Female condoms however, were found to be not as easily available and tended to be relatively more expensive. Women reported that those in steady relationships rarely used condoms, often on account of their partner\u2019s insistence; several women mentioned that fights with their partners over condom use were common. It was also revealed that the condom is socially projected as a device to be employed only in casual sexual relationships. For many women in the group, condom use only acquired priority after they had given birth. C. the Philippines According to the focus group participants from the Philippines, while condoms were readily available from the same sorts of sources as mentioned above, and at affordable rates, conservative religious norms often militated against habitual condom use. It was also identified that the frequency of condom use suffered from a social stereotyping of the condom as a symbol of mistrust between partners; reluctance of male partners to use condoms; and, in some instances, women\u2019s allergic response to condoms. More significantly, HIV-positive women whose partners were also positive routinely avoided condom use due to a lack of knowledge about the potential for cross-infection. 4.1.3 Access to confidential testing and counselling While testing for HIV constitutes a critical component of any holistic anti-HIV strategy, ensuring the confidentiality of test results, especially in social contexts where HIV is highly stigmatised, is crucial to persuading women to opt for voluntary testing. Similarly, the quality of post-test counselling plays a crucial role in providing women with the incentive to undergo voluntary testing. Counselling is also important in equipping HIV-positive women with the knowledge to manage their infection so that they can continue to lead normal lives. Participant responses with regard to the accessibility of testing facilities, confidentiality of test results, and the availability and quality of post-test counselling varied substantially across the three sampled countries. MDG 3 anD 6: What Do they say? 14 A. India Participants from India reported that testing for HIV (and other sexually transmitted infections) was widely available through government and private-sector healthcare facilities; nonetheless, while government test centres treated test results confidentially, private-sector testing facilities routinely flouted confidentiality requirements. Similarly, only government facilities provided pre- and post-test counselling. However, women expressed grievances with the quality of counselling, citing inadequate healthcare resources. Surprisingly, despite the advantages that government facilities offered over those in the private sector, a substantial proportion of women reported taking recourse to the latter for fear of running into friends or family members at or in the vicinity of government testing centres. b. Papua new Guinea Most urban participants in the PNG discussions confirmed that testing was both anonymous and supplemented by post-test counselling. The evidence of women from rural areas, however, suggests that counselling services, even when available, remain inadequate. Women from both domains, however, were strongly in favour of reviewing the confidentiality of HIV test results. Almost all women highlighted the fact that confidentiality clauses allow their partners/husbands to avoid disclosing their status, which exposes women to substantial HIV risks. C. the Philippines Participants from the Philippines reported that while HIV-testing facilities were easily accessible, the confidentiality of test results were not always maintained. Evidence from the women also suggests that there is no systematic provision for post-test counselling. 4.1.4 Access to PMtCt/PPtCt services and support Provision of adequate and effective PMTCT/PPTCT-related counselling and care is indispensable not only to containing the spread of HIV but also in guaranteeing women\u2019s reproductive rights. To enable women living with HIV to enjoy full reproductive lives, holistic support services \u2013 including equipping them with accurate information; ensuring their access to treatment during and post pregnancy; and providing help in terms of nutritional and dietary supplements \u2013 are essential. Focus group discussions show that while awareness about PMTCT/PPTCT has witnessed a significant increase (which signals the effectiveness of antenatal clinics in disseminating information and functioning as links between HIV-positive pregnant women and PPTCT centres), participants across countries differed over the adequacy and quality of counselling and supplementary support services. A. India Most participants had relatively comprehensive awareness of PMTCT/PPTCT. Government hospitals and PPTCT centres routinely test pregnant mothers for HIV, and in the event of a positive test result, post-test counselling is provided.

Participants further disclosed that post-counselling follow-up services are virtually non-existent, especially after the withdrawal of outreach workers (who had previously been deployed under GFATM). Moreover, women revealed that within the private healthcare sector there was no attempt to provide any form of counselling. Notably, pregnant women are reportedly tested without consent; caesarean procedures are employed where normal deliveries are possible; and Nevirapine is administered without providing information on its side effects. On the positive side, women reported that government facilities provided them MDG 3 anD 6: What Do they say? 15 with informed access to ART during and after pregnancy, and that they also received some quantity of dietary supplements through NGOs and Anganwadi workers (local health personnel). Nonetheless, the need for scaling- up such measures was unanimously voiced. Based on the discussions, the inability of women who are not aware of or do not disclose their HIV status and who resort to non-institutional delivery settings to access relevant counselling and care facilities emerged as the key obstacle to expanding PMTCT coverage. b. Papua new Guinea PNG participants affirmed that women had access to comprehensive counselling and care during pregnancy, labour, and post-delivery period. These services were provided by organizations of pregnant women, networks of women living with HIV, and government PPTCT clinics. Attendance levels at antenatal clinics are high, and these clinics perform effectively as referral and information centres. Women requiring post-pregnancy ARV coverage reported being able to continue staying on ARVs. Further, they reported receiving some nutritional supplements for themselves and their infants and, in many instances, enjoyed free or subsidised transportation to antenatal clinics, PPTCT clinics, and nutrition centres. Participants acknowledged this as a significant improvement over circumstances in 2007, when nutritional support was limited to a weekly supply of milk. C. the Philippines The responses of women in the Philippines provide evidence for a rural/urban divide in terms of access to PPTCT- related information, as women from the national and provincial capitals were found to be more aware than their counterparts from more remote regions. The latter group further indicated that medical personnel in these regions often did not have accurate, up-to-date information; and several women reported having been recommended inappropriate courses of action during pregnancy and in the post-natal period. 4.1.5 Access to treatment Strategies to manage HIV are key components of any holistic HIV intervention programme, in so far as they enhance women\u2019s capacity to function effectively and fully in spite of their HIV status. Further, ensuring that HIV-positive women have access to affordable treatment (ARVs and treatment for opportunistic infections) is an integral constituent of any HIV-management strategy. In the three countries sampled for this report, as well as in the Asia-Pacific region in general, ARV coverage has expanded significantly over the course of the past five years. Nonetheless, in absolute terms ARV coverage is still accessible to only about a third of the population that needs it. Findings from the FGDs provided sufficient cause for optimism to believe that ARV coverage will, in time, be universally accessible; but at the same time participants across countries identified a common set of problems in accessing treatment, including the logistical cost of accessing ART (the therapy itself is, invariably, dispensed free of charge); the cost of diagnostic tests (including those for CD4 counts); and the cost of medication for opportunistic infections. A. India All participants were well informed about ART and several were themselves availing themselves to the therapy. Of the women who were not, some were postponing the start of therapy by using a nutritious diet to maintain their CD4 counts, while others had been diagnosed to be not in need. Though ART is provided free of charge through government facilities, the cost of treatment is pushed up by commuting costs to ART collection centres. Further, MDG 3 anD 6: What Do they say? 16 second-line treatment is available only in state capitals, which can imply long commutes and even overnight stays for many women. While participants agreed that the setting up of local ART centres in various districts would reduce commuting costs and time, they also revealed a reluctance to procure their medication from these centres on account of an anxiety of running into family, friends, colleagues, or acquaintances.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9ce0f78c-3fb2-4268-afc4-cea46d4ac7f0": {"__data__": {"id_": "9ce0f78c-3fb2-4268-afc4-cea46d4ac7f0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-3-and-6-what-do-they-say", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "MDG 3 And 6: What Do They Say", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-3-and-6-what-do-they-say", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "61d2e64d6a5a1a850df20c25a393dfdc0c18bc086fe457aacee7810d9fcfbf9b"}, "2": {"node_id": "a7016239-9d5f-4c33-a4ac-d6279552a6f5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-3-and-6-what-do-they-say", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4e0d456a986d7101f30a03c98ef6ca7f5997e2e8885c3bb17de2718fe1d035e6"}}, "hash": "da2787a8c6f85a81787b1f09dc183d343f8005ab563855b98bf74db4c110d693", "text": "Even though HIV-related diagnostic tests (for CD4 counts as well as for opportunistic infections) are available free of charge in government facilities, participants noted that physical and human resource bottlenecks (common complaints included \u201cdoctors not on duty,\u201d \u201cno more x-ray films available,\u201d \u201cCD4 machine not operating,\u201d etc.) often", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8125a82b-325c-41d3-9f15-a302c7f25e40": {"__data__": {"id_": "8125a82b-325c-41d3-9f15-a302c7f25e40", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-3-and-6-what-do-they-say", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "MDG 3 And 6: What Do They Say", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-3-and-6-what-do-they-say", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "19902abba4da1ab2ee8a3e72839b12152c9444a681feace32ba1bf1a57bdf822"}}, "hash": "19902abba4da1ab2ee8a3e72839b12152c9444a681feace32ba1bf1a57bdf822", "text": "forced them seek expensive private-sector testing and treatment facilities. Further, only limited medication for opportunistic infections (Septran, for example) is made available free of charge. b. Papua new Guinea All PNG participants demonstrated an awareness of the need to be on ARVs in order to lead normal and functional lives, and all were on ARVs at the time of discussion. While they acknowledged that the drugs and related counselling were provided free of charge, commuting distances, times, and costs were identified as key obstacles to accessing treatment and care facilities. C. the Philippines Mirroring the findings from India and PNG, all participating women were aware of the importance of ART. Approximately 67 percent on ARVs; of those who were not, some had high CD4 counts, while others had recently been infected. Though ART was provided free of charge, many women reported knowing others who were unable to access ART and other HIV-related testing and treatment due to economic hardship. Participants reiterated that commuting time and distance imposed significant costs, and they related accounts of women who had consequently been unable to start ART. The ongoing political/military conflict in Mindanao was also identified as responsible for restricting access to treatment in that region. 4.1.6 HIV-related stigma and HIV-based discrimination Clearly, HIV-related stigma is the primary driver of discrimination against persons (and especially women) living with HIV. Discriminatory practices can be localised within institutional, employment, or social contexts or, in an extreme case, can spill over across all three to become a defining feature of the overall social life of PLHIV. Stigma and consequent discrimination can deter testing and disclosure, leading to detection failures, which feed back into ineffective intervention design and delivery. More significantly, HIV-related stigma probably represents the single greatest obstacle to the ability of HIV-positive women to live empowered, dignified, and functional lives. The FGDs suggest that stigma and discrimination \u2013 to various degrees and in various settings \u2013 exist in all three countries under discussion. Discrimination is most rampant in India, pervading all aspects of an HIV-positive woman\u2019s life, depriving her of access to effective healthcare and productive employment opportunities as well as denying her a sympathetic social environment. A. India Participants reported experiencing a high level of stigma and discrimination in healthcare settings. Common instances of discriminatory behaviour include: rudeness of doctors, nurses, and diagnostic staff towards PLHIV; doctors\u2019 avoidance of physical contact with PLHIV (for medical examination, surgery, and even tooth extraction); and breach of confidentiality of HIV status during routine visits to the healthcare facility. In addition, participants MDG 3 anD 6: What Do they say? 17 reported being asked to use separate toilets; and there were instances of individuals\u2019 HIV status visibly indicated on their treatment charts. The women in the FGDs also suggested that disclosure of HIV-positive status is a significant impediment to their being gainfully employed. Many reported having lost their jobs and finding it hard to secure alternative employment when colleagues or employers discovered their condition. Such conditions encourage nondisclosure of one\u2019s HIV status, which can prevent timely access to necessary and urgent treatment. Indeed, several women indicated that they routinely had to make excuses to colleagues and employers to take time off to collect ARVs from relatively remote centres where their anonymity would be maintained. On the brighter side, women working for HIV-positive networks and NGOs reported that they did not feel deterred from disclosing their status. The responses of women indicated that HIV-based discrimination spills over to other social contexts, and even to interactions within the family. There is constant anxiety among family members that \u2013 based on previous experiences \u2013 the family would not be able to find accommodations. The women are also worried that their children\u2019s/sibling\u2019s marital, social, educational and economic prospects would suffer. The participants related stories about being forced to use separate vessels even within their own families, and of being excluded from using community resources such as the village well. As mentioned earlier, the threat of ostracism contributes to women adopting a multitude of ways to hide the fact that they are HIV-positive; but, again, participants who belonged to support networks displayed substantially lower insecurity and were more willing to be open about their status. Participants noted that the electronic and print media could be vital tools in any campaign to alter social mindsets about HIV and PLHIV. While they were generally appreciative of media efforts to foster attitudinal changes, they highlighted key aspects that compromised the effectiveness of media messages on HIV. These include the relative lack of HIV-related messages on the increasingly popular private television channels; the lack of women-", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fca7b392-3be4-4a7b-870f-fb48da7387eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "fca7b392-3be4-4a7b-870f-fb48da7387eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-3-and-6-what-do-they-say", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "MDG 3 And 6: What Do They Say", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-3-and-6-what-do-they-say", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b0dab865507ac54421f29b31c25bf14bcdc07ba30bb5371d329cb6f1121caedf"}}, "hash": "b0dab865507ac54421f29b31c25bf14bcdc07ba30bb5371d329cb6f1121caedf", "text": "specific content in media messages; the negative portrayal of HIV and PLHIV (HIV-related posters were reported to frequently have black backgrounds, and images of PLHIV feature weak and thin men); and, the occasional transmission of misinformation. b. Papua new Guinea The PNG discussions suggest that the stigmatisation of HIV is significantly lower in comparison to India, consequently disclosure of HIV status is far more pronounced. The degree of disclosure varied among the women; some only let their spouses know, others included immediate family members, while a few women shared their status with colleagues and neighbours. Commonly cited reasons for disclosure included the need to seek help from their spouse; advised to do so by doctors and counsellors; and for the protection of members of their family, especially children and siblings. However, participants who were reluctant to disclose their status revealed that their reluctance was founded on anxieties about post-disclosure stigma and ostracism. Heartening, PNG participants reported that they were not stigmatised in healthcare settings; where discrimination existed, especially in HIV-related facilities, it took the form of positive discrimination Women were divided on the question of discrimination experienced within their community: while some narrated episodes of being verbally (and, in some few instances, physically) harassed by people in the neighbourhood, many said that most members of the community were tolerant and supportive. Participants, like their counterparts in India, were generally appreciative of the content and tone of media messages, and believe that the media plays a key role in sensitising society to the needs of PLHIV. Nonetheless, a MDG 3 anD 6: What Do they say? 18 common complaint was that media messages invariably targeted members of the larger society and not women living with HIV; in this context, the need for media to be employed to disseminate specific information for women living with HIV was expressed. It was further highlighted that while media messages were commonly designed to generate social sympathy for PLHIV, there was an urgent need to demonstrate that women living with HIV could, with the right medical and social support, lead fully functional lives. C. the Philippines Accounts provided by the Philippines participants indicated that these women routinely experienced various forms of discrimination based on their HIV status. In most cases disclosure was limited to immediate members of the family only, and wider disclosure was pre-empted by anxieties about potential discrimination. While the participants did not relate any account of prejudicial treatment in healthcare settings, they identified loss of jobs, failure to find alternative employment, and residential displacement as common instances of discriminatory practices. Stories of harassment through text messages were also common. Some of the women reported being denied access to taxis in their neighbourhood, and some narrated how they had been differentially treated by vendors at neighbourhood food stalls (the vendor would wear gloves only if he was serving these women). Participants suggested that media attention to HIV and PLHIV was inadequate. PLHIV were portrayed narrowly in media messages: in the very few images of women living with HIV, they are presented as silent silhouettes, which contributes to the stereotyping of women as victims. 4.1.7 social attitudes towards MArPs The success of Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices-based interventions among MARPs depends on enhancing their access to information, harm reduction technologies, treatment facilities, and institutional and social support. These preconditions can only be met in friendly institutional and social environments. Findings from the FGDs, however, suggest that FSWs (and, where applicable, IDUs1) operate in a hostile and prejudicial social climate that condones institutional harassment, often by law enforcement officials. Routine abuse contributes to lowering the resilience of women to HIV while heightening their vulnerability. A. India Due to the concentration of IDUs in the remote north-eastern regions of India, only participants from those regions had any awareness of IDUs and harm-reduction technologies. The availability of clean needles is reported to be only sporadic. Intervention programmes targeting IDUs overlook rural areas and focus on the urban population. Both IDUs and FSWs are reportedly harassed by the police. The latter are often illegally detained and sexually abused. Participants indicated that FSWs were discriminated against at government healthcare facilities and even at ART centres, and find it difficult to find places for their children in educational institutions and hostels. In many instances the pervasive social stigma against MARPs is nourished by rigid religious norms. All of this contributes to low disclosure rates for vocation and HIV status, which, in turn, contributes to low HIV awareness. Participants mentioned that NGOs and support networks are playing a strategically vital role in bringing FSWs (and IDUs) under the coverage of HIV-related", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "284087dd-7721-4d2c-8a05-84f832176619": {"__data__": {"id_": "284087dd-7721-4d2c-8a05-84f832176619", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-3-and-6-what-do-they-say", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "MDG 3 And 6: What Do They Say", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-3-and-6-what-do-they-say", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "120cd203eab7c34a2bd22996b728d1776c871f773eab1a4478d1d0dd0fa90672"}}, "hash": "120cd203eab7c34a2bd22996b728d1776c871f773eab1a4478d1d0dd0fa90672", "text": "interventions by disseminating information; facilitating testing; 1 The IDU component of the questionnaire was deemed not to be applicable in PNG and the Philippines. MDG 3 anD 6: What Do they say? 19 ensuring access to ART; and, most importantly, providing much needed social capital and support. Despite this, it was reported that HIV-positive FSWs are wary of participating in network activities on account of a worry that discovery of their involvement will earmark them for further harassment and have a negative impact on their vocation. b. Papua new Guinea Participants from PNG reported that access of FSWs to information and testing and treatment facilities is inhibited by discriminatory social attitudes that prevent disclosure. FSWs are often mistreated, humiliated, and sexually abused by the police. However, participants from the urban areas noted improvements in the situation after a sexual offences desk was created at police stations. Healthcare workers were also said to be guilty of discrimination, as well as of providing ill treatment and routinely publicising confidential information about FSWs. Participants observed that discrimination against FSWs is negligible within churches and in interactions with faith-based organizations (FBOs). C. the Philippines In contrast to the findings from India and PNG, the participants from the Philippines observed that, despite sex work being illegal in the country, police and healthcare workers did not usually discriminate against FSWs. As a result, FSWs had normal access to HIV-related information and to prevention, testing, and treatment facilities. 4.1.8 Violence against women The incidence of violence against women constitutes one of the greatest challenges to the empowerment of women. As such, it significantly contributes to their vulnerability to HIV. Violence against women is multidimensional, both in its nature and locus: violence could be gender based (simply for being a woman); motivated by vocation (as in violence against FSWs); or triggered by HIV status (violence against women living with HIV). Violent conduct could be located within the family or could be directed against women by their immediate communities. The discussions revealed that violence against women is commonplace in the contexts of all three countries. Findings also suggest that the source of violent conduct is most likely to be a male within the family. A. India Participants from India reported that discussions of violence against women feature prominently in self-help group meetings, which is an indication of how widespread the phenomenon is. Most participants reported having to endure physically, sexually, and emotionally violent conduct on a regular basis. While duress is inflicted from both within and outside the family, the women reported that the incidence and impact of within-family violence is substantially greater. Being beaten by husbands, abused by fathers and other male relatives, and physically harassed by in-laws (often in the absence of the husband) were common grievances. Social mores are identified as contributing to normalising the phenomenon of gender-based violence; and women are encouraged to bear the trauma rather than seek redress, since \u201cit is in the women\u2019s fate.\u201d Lax enforcement of laws against such violence (police officers are reported to ask for bribes or sexual favours before recording complaints or acting on them) is also highlighted as being instrumental in preventing women from bringing instances of physical and sexual abuse to light. MDG 3 anD 6: What Do they say? 20 b. Papua new Guinea Reports from PNG participants suggest that while gender-based violence (and, more specifically, domestic violence) features in community-level discussions, these do not translate into any concrete action to stem violent conduct. Women report being subjected to psychological harassment, both from within the family and by members of the community. Indeed, an overwhelming majority of the participants reported having to encounter violence almost on a daily basis. Domestic violence accounts for almost all of the episodes of violent conduct reported by the women, followed by sexual abuse. Their responses also suggest that incidents of physical and sexual abuse go unreported, primarily due to a worry that reporting will merely serve to increase the intensity and frequency of future violent conduct, as well as a belief that they cannot receive any form of protection against domestic violence. C. the Philippines Participants\u2019 responses to the questionnaire items seem to suggest that violence against women, despite its prevalence, is not on the agenda for community-level discussions. Mirroring the findings from India and PNG, the women revealed that violence and other forms of psychological harassment were commonplace and more likely to be located within the family. It was also indicated that the reluctance of the police to act on complaints against domestic abuse and the inability of women to take legal recourse (\u201cwe cannot afford", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f9fdd31d-8d53-4acc-9eda-3d525880a6c2": {"__data__": {"id_": "f9fdd31d-8d53-4acc-9eda-3d525880a6c2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-3-and-6-what-do-they-say", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "MDG 3 And 6: What Do They Say", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-3-and-6-what-do-they-say", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1c365ebfa3c5e73784a4ba7e6ec582c36b318df9a2aca4345195e23399baba30"}}, "hash": "1c365ebfa3c5e73784a4ba7e6ec582c36b318df9a2aca4345195e23399baba30", "text": "lawyers\u201d) constituted major deterrents to bringing episodes of abuse to light. 4.1.9 sexual and reproductive rights Ensuring that sexual and reproductive rights of women are legally recognised and effectively enforced is key to empowering women to exercise choice and discretion on issues that directly determine their well-being. For women in general (and for women living with HIV, in particular), the recognition and enforcement of such rights allow them to be more resilient and less vulnerable to HIV and to lead functional, fulfilling lives of their own choosing. Discussions conducted in these countries suggest that there is a fracture between law and convention in both the recognition and enforcement of these rights. While the countries constitutionally guarantee such rights, social norms militate against their enforcement \u2013 leading to a situation where women and girls are generally unaware of their rights and are powerless in having them enforced. A. India Most of the Indian participants had limited knowledge about their sexual and reproductive rights. As such, several violations were reported. The women mentioned that doctors routinely advise pregnant women with HIV to abort babies and discourage HIV-positive women from having children altogether. On an encouraging note, women belonging to support networks reported having conducted occasional sensitisation sessions for medical staff in hospitals in response to such violations. Networks were also identified as playing a valuable role in encouraging pregnant HIV-positive women to continue their pregnancy and supporting them throughout the process. In terms of violation of sexual rights, participants from India mentioned that there were mechanisms available to lodge complaints about sexual harassment at the work place or about general sexual abuse. Nonetheless, women rarely utilise these channels to seek redress as enforcement authorities seldom pursue such complaints without a MDG 3 anD 6: What Do they say? 21 monetary incentive to do so. Participants also highlighted that redress procedures were needlessly complicated, and pointed out that they were altogether powerlessness to take any form of action if their sexual rights had been violated by their husbands. b. Papua new Guinea PNG participants indicated that while the country\u2019s laws and policies are designed to protect the rights of women (and, especially, of women living with HIV), its cultural norms do not readily acknowledge these rights. This translates into a lack of awareness about these rights among women and girls, as well as into a lack of enforcement of laws related to these rights, especially in the rural areas. The participants reported further that even if healthcare and law enforcement officers were aware of these rights, they would make no attempt to ensure that these were respected; as such, routine violations are condoned and, indeed, regularised. C. the Philippines The responses of women from the Philippines indicate that, in general, women have no comprehensive awareness of their sexual and reproductive rights. Women who had some knowledge of their rights believed that the country\u2019s laws guaranteed them these rights, but they also indicated that the laws were generally not enforced. 4.1.10 socio-economic support for women living with HIV A positive HIV status, especially in societies where HIV-related stigma is high, can compromise the ability of women to function normally by, on the one hand, increasing the cost of living and need for social support, and, on the other hand, by jeopardising employment prospects and destroying social support networks. In the case of the Philippines, for instance, testing positive eliminates a woman\u2019s chances of being employed abroad, a key source of income and economic freedom for a large number of women. There is, thus, a clear need to redress the fragile circumstances of living with HIV through social and economic interventions that can boost women\u2019s resilience to their HIV-positive status. Such interventions, which can take the form of increasing the social capital of PLHIV and providing them with economic assistance, provide ample scope for fruitful and sustainable partnerships between and among governments, NGOs, civil society organizations, and the media. Focus group discussions found that in all three countries there has been some attempt to correct the socio- economic imbalances that a positive HIV status inflicts upon women. However, participants were unanimous in their opinion that existing services were largely inadequate. The consultation also provided evidence for the fact that governments, civil society organizations (CSOs), and NGOs worked in relative isolation from each other. A. India Participants from India mentioned that various welfare schemes were available to them. These schemes provide a wide range of economic assistance, including provision of midday meals for children; food grains at highly subsidised prices; pensions for widows; loans for PLHIV engaged in agriculture; child support; and monthly rations", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f98b0f29-5e53-49d0-ac6b-e98430854220": {"__data__": {"id_": "f98b0f29-5e53-49d0-ac6b-e98430854220", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-3-and-6-what-do-they-say", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "MDG 3 And 6: What Do They Say", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-3-and-6-what-do-they-say", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "41c1e4c757fe6b1d19b2f0f1d403c42b326265fed9c7373cf8ca05f74b18c4a8"}}, "hash": "41c1e4c757fe6b1d19b2f0f1d403c42b326265fed9c7373cf8ca05f74b18c4a8", "text": "of food staples. While some schemes (like the widow pension programme) are centrally funded and, hence, accessible to all women irrespective of their domicile, others are state funded and are available only to those who are state residents. Participants reported that information about these schemes were not readily available, and mentioned that in many instances it is necessary to bribe officials in order to be listed as beneficiaries. Women belonging to support networks highlighted resource bottlenecks as the primary cause of their inability to publicise these welfare services as widely as they would like to. MDG 3 anD 6: What Do they say? 22 It was reported that NGOs, CSOs, and HIV-positive networks are more actively engaged in boosting the social capital of women living with HIV and in facilitating their access to testing and treatment facilities than in providing financial assistance, though some NGOs, \u2013 often backed by corporations \u2013 do provide financial support for transportation, nutrition, regular and emergency medical care, children\u2019s education, etc. b. Papua new Guinea PNG participants indicated that there was limited avenues for receiving economic assistance. Although cash is provided for voluntary work with support networks and NGOs, there are no provisions for cash transfers or food subsidies on a regular basis; no available help with children\u2019s education; and no micro-credit schemes for women living with HIV. Sporadic attempts at providing economic assistance, contingent on the availability of external funds, are not advertised well enough for PLHIV to benefit widely. The focus group also reported that social support is provided by NGOs, FBOs, the Church, and HIV-positive networks. However, all participants agreed that the extent of support remained grossly inadequate. C. the Philippines With the focus group a few participants reported to have received grants, scholarships for children, or loans. These forms of assistance are only made available to women who have not previously benefited from economic support schemes. These women also reported that the magnitude and scope of economic support was insubstantial, and they demanded better employment opportunities, support for children\u2019s education, and better access to credit facilities. In terms of social support schemes, participants\u2019 responses identified that urban women have better access to these services, often provided by NGOs, than women who live in more remote provinces. 4.1.11 empowerment of women While social and economic assistance to women living with HIV constitutes attempts to help them manage their fragile socio-economic circumstances, ultimately they are not sustainable. In order to ensure that women develop the capacity to be resilient to their HIV status; that their HIV status does not compromise their ability to lead normal, functional, and productive lives; and that living with (or being affected by) HIV does not jeopardise the educational, economic, and social prospects available to their children, long term strategies to empower women are imperative. Such strategies comprise guaranteeing the inheritance and property rights of women (so that HIV does not push them into resource poverty); ensuring that girls receive an education (so that they are more aware and better placed to take advantage of economic and social opportunities); and enhancing women\u2019s participation in and control over economic decision-making at the household level. Our consultations suggest that even though laws provide women with inheritance and property rights across the three countries, these rights are scarcely enforced. In general, in families with male members, women have little control over household expenditures; however, those living alone or with their children have complete control over the way in which their incomes are expended. HIV/AIDS-related declines in household incomes are met by mortgaging existing assets, borrowing, and engaging in economic activities in the informal sector. Participants from all three countries affirmed that their children (especially daughters) attended school and reiterated their commitment to educating them beyond the secondary level. MDG 3 anD 6: What Do they say? 23 A. India Participants\u2019 responses indicated that women are generally unaware of their inheritance rights. Of those who were aware, several suggested that having those rights enforced involves participating in a cumbersome and expensive legal process. Some reported being deprived pf any share of their deceased husband\u2019s assets and property by their in-laws; in such cases the women desisted from lodging complaints with the authorities due to fears of a backlash from their in-laws and other relatives. Responses from various groups indicated that there is a discriminatory attitude toward the education of girls in families affected by HIV, and discrimination in schools against HIV-affected families was reported to exist to varying degrees. However, the only constraint on continuing a daughter\u2019s education was reported to be financial in nature.

All participants emphasised the importance of frugal consumption behaviour, and also mentioned using the resulting savings to acquire assets either in their own or in their children\u2019s names. b. Papua new Guinea Participants indicated that cultural norms promote the claims of men on inheritance over those of women. While the inheritance of property showed a distinct male bias, some women reported receiving their husband\u2019s or father\u2019s house. However, most of the women mentioned that they had been installed by their husbands as \u201cnext of kin\u201d \u2013 often after the husband had been diagnosed as HIV-positive. These women then received some fraction of their husband\u2019s savings after his death. All participants reported sending their daughters to school and expressed a desire to educate them beyond the secondary level. Participants from PNG indicated that they had control over economic decisions of the household and that household assets were jointly owned. Women were unanimous in their view that their HIV status had adversely affected their economic circumstances; and that the additional HIV-related expenditures were often met by seeking financial support from NGOs, CSOs, FBOs, and HIV-positive networks, as well as by scaling-up their activities in the informal sector. C. the Philippines Participants from the Philippines were aware that laws gave women equal inheritance rights as men, and indicated that they had indeed received their share of inheritance after the death of their husbands. All of the women reported sending their daughters to school and expressed an eagerness that they should receive tertiary education. Most of the women sent their children to public school, where education is provided free of charge; some were able to avail themselves of financial assistance in the form of scholarships. The participants also indicated that care for PLHIV is equally shared between men and women in the family; consequently, they saw no threat to the continuation of the education of girls on this account. Several of the women reported having a control over household expenses and indicated that decisions to acquire assets were jointly taken. These women highlighted that their post-diagnosis economic condition had worsened. MDG 3 anD 6: What Do they say? 24 In the context of the Philippines, where a significant proportion of the female labour force migrates for lucrative overseas employment, a positive HIV test can be as morally devastating as it is economically. In the absence of significant domestic employment opportunities, the women reported relying on welfare schemes and home- based economic activity in order to manage their loss in income and the additional HIV-related expenses of testing and treatment. 4.2 summary of key findings \u2022\ufffd Sexual and HIV-related awareness among adolescents remains low. There is a lack of formal dissemination of standardised information. Girls depend on media-based information and peer group discussions for sexuality and HIV-related knowledge. \u2022\ufffd While condoms are widely available, women have to depend on their male partners for regular condom use. Male partners are reluctant to use condoms due to social stigma associated with condoms and a male perception that their use lowers sexual pleasure. \u2022\ufffd Evidence from India and the Philippines suggests that the confidentiality of test results is not always maintained. Participants from PNG called for a review of confidentiality rules, citing that the rules allow husbands/partners to expose them to HIV by allowing them not to disclose their HIV status. \u2022\ufffd Participants from all three countries suggested that post-test counselling was neither comprehensive nor adequate. \u2022\ufffd Participants in India complained that PMTCT/PPTCT counselling was only provided in government healthcare facilities; nonetheless, the content of counselling was restricted to the provision of information on breastfeeding and Nevirapine. PNG participants affirmed that comprehensive counselling and care was accessible during pregnancy, labour, and post-delivery periods. Participants from the Philippines provided evidence of a significant rural/urban divide in women\u2019s access to PMTCT/PPTCT counselling and care facilities. \u2022\ufffd While ARVs are made available free of charge in government healthcare facilities, women\u2019s accessibility to treatment is compromised by the logistical difficulties in accessing these facilities. These difficulties include commuting time and costs in travelling to and from ART centres; the cost of diagnostic tests; and the cost of treatment for opportunistic infections. \u2022\ufffd HIV-related stigma and HIV-based discrimination was found to be present, albeit to different degrees, in all three countries where the FGDs were conducted. Stigma and discriminatory practices were most evident on India, which deprived HIV-positive women of access to effective healthcare, productive employment opportunities,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "34a7e92b-3f6f-4931-ab44-664cb96e201d": {"__data__": {"id_": "34a7e92b-3f6f-4931-ab44-664cb96e201d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-3-and-6-what-do-they-say", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "MDG 3 And 6: What Do They Say", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-3-and-6-what-do-they-say", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "95a4a5ba11cbadaa5790192b155523fbfbab9ed2f1709e67ba40591c1ac9e7fa"}}, "hash": "95a4a5ba11cbadaa5790192b155523fbfbab9ed2f1709e67ba40591c1ac9e7fa", "text": "and a sympathetic social environment. \u2022\ufffd FSWs (and, where applicable, IDUs) operate in a hostile and prejudicial social climate that condones their systematic harassment by healthcare and law enforcement officials. \u2022\ufffd Violence against women was found to be endemic in all three countries, and more often than not the source of such violence is the women\u2019s immediate family. Episodes of violence against women go unreported on account of social mores that regularise the phenomenon and lax enforcement of laws against gender-based violence. Some participants highlighted the limited sensitisation and engagement of the police and other law enforcement in programme implementation, which keeps them ignorant of some laws and rights designed to protect women. MDG 3 anD 6: What Do they say? 25 \u2022\ufffd Consultations with women in the three countries suggest that there is a fracture between law and convention in recognising and enforcing women\u2019s sexual and reproductive rights. A pervasive society-wide reluctance to acknowledge that women have these rights contributes to low awareness among women themselves about these rights. \u2022\ufffd While economic assistance and social support in various forms and to various degrees is made available to women living with (or affected by) HIV, participants were unanimous in their view that these welfare schemes are in urgent need of being scaled-up. Cooperative practice between and among the government, NGOs, CSOs, and HIV-positive networks needs to be developed in order to improve the well-being of women affected by HIV as well as that of their families. \u2022\ufffd Women\u2019s rights to inheritance and property are enforced to varying degrees across the three countries. While in India women are likely not to receive any part of their husband\u2019s assets after he passes away, participants from PNG and the Philippines reported receiving some or a substantial part of the inheritance from their deceased husbands. \u2022\ufffd Participants across the three countries affirmed that HIV had placed them in compromising economic circumstances. Being tested positive deprives women and their households of income, while pushing up the cost of living (due to increased HIV-related expenses). Most of the women reported attempting to plug this income gap by resorting to mortgaging existing assets, applying for government/NGO-sponsored welfare schemes, and by engaging in income earning opportunities within the informal sector. MDG 3 anD 6: What Do they say? 26 5 reCoMMenDAtIons Based on a survey of the country level progress reports and the insights gained from the consultations conducted with women affected by HIV in India, Papua New Guinea and the Philippines, this section identifies best practices that need to be scaled-up, and suggests ways in which the identified gaps in female empowerment and HIV interventions can by filled. Following the structure of Section 4 (Key findings), recommendations are presented under corresponding headings. \u2022\ufffd Increase sexuality and HIV-related awareness. Standardised, country-specific curricula containing sexuality, HIV, and life skills-related information need to be developed and delivered in a formal manner. Such curriculum should contain information on the sexual reproductive and inheritance rights of women. The success of such curricula in plugging the awareness gaps that have been identified in the three countries is contingent on: (i) training personnel to deliver the content in a value neutral manner; (ii) enforcing content delivery, if necessary, through statutory provisions; and, (iii) supplementing institutionalised content delivery with informal campaigns involving NGOs and HIV- positive networks. \u2022\ufffd Improve access to and frequency of use of prevention technology. The practice of making condoms easily accessible needs to be continued and improved. However, it is imperative that (i) the power to insist on condom use be vested in women, and (ii) the male resistance to condom use be overcome. In India, women\u2019s access to condoms can be enhanced by deploying women (working for NGOs/ networks or as a functionary in the village government) to distribute condoms, however discreetly, to other women. In all countries, female condoms should be popularised and made widely available. Condom popularisation campaigns, with a decentralised focus and suitably tailored messages, need to be carried out and, where they exist, scaled-up. \u2022\ufffd Ensure confidentiality of testing and provide adequate and effective counselling. Practices related to confidentiality need an urgent and thorough review. Medical councils in respective countries should be tasked to enforce statutory provisions regarding breach of confidentiality. In PNG, where confidentiality is suggested to be counterproductive, the feasibility of instituting a practice whereby test results are disclosed not to the male alone but jointly to the male and his spouse/partner should be accessed. In order to improve the content and quality of counselling, staffing bottlenecks in counselling facilities should be eliminated through an injection of funds. \u2022\ufffd Expand PMTCT/PPTCT coverage.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "27928e7d-c978-438a-beea-7b0d849f95d8": {"__data__": {"id_": "27928e7d-c978-438a-beea-7b0d849f95d8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-3-and-6-what-do-they-say", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "MDG 3 And 6: What Do They Say", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-3-and-6-what-do-they-say", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e89fae70f3d615ace0f73c1126ad786795400a7a0676fe8f21e491e1f2b161d4"}, "3": {"node_id": "798657f5-079e-413c-905f-2fbd63c71c88", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-3-and-6-what-do-they-say", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c6ad26fb17022a61fc870815759d219a9df296748ce6cca642fc5e018da3b34e"}}, "hash": "04c32fd45c84b058bd89c585e4af0af525c1d287e764063b1e8644c5b5dfa56f", "text": "Institutional deliveries among rural women should be promoted by village level interventions and incentivised by providing transfers of cash or kind. At the same time, there is a need to reinstate post-counselling follow-up mechanisms to ensure that the practices of HIV-positive pregnant women and mothers are in accord with the counselling they have received. Training for healthcare workers in remote and rural areas \u2013 to equip them with PPTCT/PMTCT know-how \u2013 is a priority in order to break the rural/urban divide in PPTCT/PMTCT access. There is MDG 3 anD 6: What Do they say? 27 also a need to popularise IVF as an alternative among HIV-positive prospective mothers and make it accessible and affordable. \u2022\ufffd Expand ARV coverage. While decentralisation appears, at least on paper, to be a sound way of lowering the cost of accessing ARVs, the lack of popularity of Link ARV Centres in India suggests that alternative methods of ARV delivery need to be studied. The feasibility of door-to-door delivery of ARVs \u2013 by involving NGOs and support networks \u2013 needs to be studied. It is also recommended that a technical committee be established to explore the possibility of designing portable and user-friendly CD4 diagnostic devices so that women can access their need for ARVs at home. \u2022\ufffd Combat HIV-related stigma and HIV-based discrimination. While changing social attitudes towards HIV is a long-term project, it can be catalysed by a combination of media-based campaigns, sensitisation projects, and statutory provisions. To eliminate HIV-based discrimination in healthcare settings by doctors and nurses, it is recommended that healthcare workers be provided mandatory and, if needed, periodic sensitisation training. Medical councils should be incorporated to play a more proactive role in monitoring and imposing sanctions on discriminatory behaviour by doctors. The prospect of an anti- discrimination bill, imposing penal provisions on doctors found to have discriminated against patients on the basis of HIV, should be studied. Even though it is possible that women would lack the legal resources to enforce such provisions, the symbolic value of such a bill cannot be underestimated. Finally, extensive and sustained media campaigns that seek to normalise HIV as \u2018any other infirmity\u2019 should be planned and implemented. \u2022\ufffd Alter social attitudes towards MARPs. Law enforcement officials must be made to undergo mandatory courses that sensitise them to the needs of and the problems facing FSWs. Rights committees, empowered to probe allegations of abuse, should be established. Imposing and publicising deterrent sanctions against errant officials is also recommended as a way of setting precedents. The setting up of independent review groups to periodically monitor HIV/MARPs-related discrimination and abuse is also recommended. \u2022\ufffd Combat gender-based violence. In order to strengthen the enforcement of laws against GBV, it is recommended that special enforcement cells and fast-track courts be established. The jurisdiction of these courts should be expanded to include the enforcement of women\u2019s sexual and reproductive rights. PNG\u2019s experience with the village court system shows that interventions designed to catalyse attitude change are most effective if targeted at the village level. It is recommended that village level committees under the stewardship of community leaders be set up for regular village level dialogue on violence against women. \u2022\ufffd Scale-up socio-economic support. This report identifies an urgent need to scale-up socio-economic support schemes for women living with/affected by HIV. As such, it strongly recommends a larger allocation of the national budget to finance welfare schemes for PLHIV. It also advocates that global funds be made available on a needs basis for welfare interventions in specific areas (such as nutrition support, income support, healthcare support, etc.). A multinational monitoring committee to oversee the disbursement of HIV-related aid is also recommended. MDG 3 anD 6: What Do they say? 28 \u2022\ufffd Enhance employment opportunities for women living with/affected by HIV. Given the importance of the informal sector in sustainably augmenting household incomes for families affected by HIV, this report recommends the expansion of micro-credit facilities for women \u2013 for example, micro-credit schemes to loan minimal capital for the starting up of small-scale businesses. The discrimination of women affected by HIV with regard to employment opportunities in the government sector needs to be statutorily addressed. In terms of the private sector, it is recommended that governments provide economic incentives (in the form of tax breaks, for example) to firms that hire PLHIV or retain HIV-positive on their payroll.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "798657f5-079e-413c-905f-2fbd63c71c88": {"__data__": {"id_": "798657f5-079e-413c-905f-2fbd63c71c88", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-3-and-6-what-do-they-say", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "MDG 3 And 6: What Do They Say", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-3-and-6-what-do-they-say", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e89fae70f3d615ace0f73c1126ad786795400a7a0676fe8f21e491e1f2b161d4"}, "2": {"node_id": "27928e7d-c978-438a-beea-7b0d849f95d8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-3-and-6-what-do-they-say", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "04c32fd45c84b058bd89c585e4af0af525c1d287e764063b1e8644c5b5dfa56f"}}, "hash": "c6ad26fb17022a61fc870815759d219a9df296748ce6cca642fc5e018da3b34e", "text": "MDG 3 anD 6: What Do they say? 29 reFerenCes Goldberg, C.

This means all interventions and services have a cost, even if they are provided free or even if it is envisage that individuals will bear that cost as an out-of-pocket expense. Both capital and recurrent costs need to be included in total cost estimation (UN Millennium Project 2005b). The total cost needs to be considered when determining and calculating coun- try specific unit costs. Once the response is costed, financing options can then be discussed. The focus is on costing all cash flow components, which then corresponds to projecting the cash flow re- quired to fund the MDGs. However opportunity costs associated with communities investing their time in an intervention is not included (UN Millennium Project 2005b). It is important to understand that total cost estimation is distinct from estimating the cost-effectiveness of interventions or projecting the impact of interventions on the future course of the epidemic such as modelling. HIV Modelling and Costing Tools There are a number of tools available for measuring the impact of and costing the response to HIV/AIDS. These tools have different purposes as mapped out below.

Developed by UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo in partnership with UNAIDS Regional Support Team for Asia and the Pacific and UNDP MDG Support Team. Some of these tools have objectives broader than costing interventions and may be employed by countries to provide epidemiological inputs to costing exercises, to help prioritise interventions, and to monitor the impact of interventions on country goals and targets. 2 MDG-Consistent HIV/AIDS Costing Model for Asia and the Pacific << Contents Using the MDG-Consistent HIV/AIDS Costing Model for Asia and the Pacific (MDG Model) This section focuses on estimating the total cost of HIV/AIDS responses using the MDG-consistent HIV/ AIDS Costing Model or the MDG Model. The MDG Model is principally built upon the widely-used Resource Needs Model developed by the Futures Group and partially upon the Cape Town ARV Costing Model developed by the University of Cape Town. It has been developed by UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo in partnership with UNAIDS Regional Support Team for Asia and the Pacific and UNDP MDG Support Team (the former UN Millennium Project). The MDG Model was primarily developed to assist the governments in Asia and the Pacific carrying out MDG needs assessment exercises, based upon recommendations from experts from the region that the existing tools had not addressed some of the key issues that are critical to Asia and the Pacific region and some tools had been highly complex and unfriendly to users. The MDG Model is making constant adjust- ments and improvements based upon feedback from users in the region. While inheriting strengths of the above widely-accepted models, the MDG still offers useful functions, unique features, and high utility. The key features of the MDG Model are as follows: 1. Flexible, MDG-consistent timeline Users can plan up to or beyond 2015, the MDG target year \u2022\ufffd \u2022\ufffd Users can define start and end years (up to a range of 10 years), which makes the single model useful for multiple planning horizons (short-, mid- and long-terms) 2. UNAIDS targets for the 2010 universal access goal incorporated \u2022\ufffd All UNAIDS non-negotiable and other key targets for Asia & Pacific for the 2010 universal access have been incorporated, making the tool consistent with both the 2010 (universal access) and 2015 (MDG 6) goals:. In 2007, the universal access became one of the HIV MDG targets (6B) for Asia and the Pacific, on which countries are required to report. 3. Target, result-based costing \u2022\ufffd All the interventions in the MDG Model have their own target(s), defined by each country and prominently listed at the top of respective data entry section. The target enables result-based costing and provides a good system of accountability and monitoring the progress towards the target. 4. Expanded Scope \u2022\ufffd New interventions, which have been shown as important for an effective HIV/AIDS response in Asia and the Pacific, have been added under the heading \u201cEnabling Environment.\u201d Particularly this section addresses human rights, gender and governance dimensions of HIV responses. \u2022\ufffd Flexible interventions have been included, allowing users to define and add country-specific interventions (e.g., Other Programs to Support PLWHAs) 3 User MANUAL << Contents \u2022\ufffd Human resources have been expanded to include more than only physicians; in fact, users can define multiple cadres of human resources as necessary, including managerial and administrative staff Facility capital and recurrent costs have been added \u2022\ufffd 5. More detail and disaggregation \u2022\ufffd Major cost components of interventions are clearly defined (e.g., costs of home-based Care include salaries/incentives to providers, salaries of supervisors, transportation equipment or reimbursements to each cadre, etc.) STIs and OIs are disaggregated and costed by individual infection, as defined by users \u2022\ufffd Where applicable capital and recurrent costs are differentiated \u2022\ufffd 6. Increased transparency and simplicity \u2022\ufffd All data and calculations for each major HIV/AIDS category (e.g., prevention, treatment, etc.) occur on a single worksheet that runs top-to-bottom No hidden assumptions \u2022\ufffd \u2022\ufffd The Model calculates total capital costs, which are extremely important in expenditure analysis and resource mobilization. 7.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ff8da5d7-21be-4f6c-9e96-7fdc24fd9149": {"__data__": {"id_": "ff8da5d7-21be-4f6c-9e96-7fdc24fd9149", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-consistent-hiv/aids-costing-model-asia-and-pacific-user-manual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "MDG-Consistent HIV/AIDS Costing Model for Asia and the Pacific: User Manual", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-consistent-hiv/aids-costing-model-asia-and-pacific-user-manual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f9624ef65e57e26eef623fe0227e5d83af2a5546c29e64ce854d98597e8a8e8f"}, "2": {"node_id": "061686c6-fb36-41df-a822-27c978f9469b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-consistent-hiv/aids-costing-model-asia-and-pacific-user-manual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0d91b09fbfeaf26a3702d1580c77331761ef33914b9e8a93b3c2530df38b3be2"}}, "hash": "d1e923f7912195a0963961cf7a6a6ca61fe4180d4d8676839026af9174ff1e28", "text": "7.

Synchronised with an MDG-consistent HIV/AIDS needs assessment user guide \u2022\ufffd The MDG Model can be used in tandem with the MDG-consistent HIV/AIDS needs assessment user guide. As needs assessment and prioritization have vital implications on the total cost of intervention, synchronization between the needs assessment user guide and the MDG Model provides a principled approach to the needs assessment and costing exercises. 4 MDG-Consistent HIV/AIDS Costing Model for Asia and the Pacific << Contents 1. Overview of the MDG Model: The MDG model is an Excel-based tool, with imbedded formulas. The tool calculates costs per intervention, sub totals costs at the level of the following five categories or \u201cResponse Fields\u201d: Enabling Environment, Pre- vention, ARV Treatment, Care and Support, and Health Systems. It also calculates an annual grand total for the HIV/AIDS response. It has a dynamic 10-year time period that users can specify start and end years for. The following section describes the basic features and functions of the MDG Model. 1-1. Worksheet The MDG model has 7 active worksheets (working areas) as shown below: (1) TOP, (2) Enabling Environ- ment, (3) Prevention, (4) ARV Treatment, (5) Care & Support, (6) Health Systems, and (7) Cost Summary. Each tab has a different colour for easy identification: The worksheets with gray tabs such as \u201cTP\u201d and \u201cEE\u201d as shown above are not for use (and should not be altered or deleted. See 6-4 for more details). 1-2. Structure Each worksheet for specific intervention area (Enabling Environment, Prevention, ARV Treatment, Care & Support and Health Systems) is consisted of 4 sections. List of interventions Data entry section Cost summary section Graphical representations of the costing results 5 User MANUAL << Contents 1-3. Colour Scheme The MDG model uses the following cell colour scheme to visually guide users for easy data entry and analysis. 1-4. US Dollar - Local Currency Conversion Users can work either with the US dollar or the local currency of choice. The default setting is US dollar, but it can be changed to the local currency at any time by selecting [Currency Converter] - [Convert] located at the menu bar. Note: Currency Converter does not appear unless Macros are enabled (See 2: Getting Started). This will translate all USD figures in the model into the local currency across all the worksheets as per the US exchange rate defined in the TOP worksheet. If you want to go back to USD, simply select [Currency Converter] - [US dollar]. The currency unit can be converted between the US$ and the local currency at any time. When conversion is performed, all the financial values across all the worksheets in the model will be converted into the cur- rency of choice. It is a useful function, as it allows users to work with the local currency unit while the cost can be converted into the US$ for resource mobilisation purposes. Additionally, the conversion function allows only one cur- rency unit to be displayed as opposed to two different currencies as seen in some other costing models, which can sometimes be quite confusing. In case of Excel 2007: \u2022\ufffd Click on the \u201cAdd-Inns\u201d tab in the menu bar (see below) and the [Currency Converter] will appear. 6 MDG-Consistent HIV/AIDS Costing Model for Asia and the Pacific << Contents 1-5.

Issues specific to a particular worksheet or intervention will be addressed separately. 4-1 Including/excluding interventions in the total cost calculation As outlined in Part 3 of this user guide, country teams need to identify interventions that are relevant for their epidemic which will allow them to achieve their HIV/AIDS Millennium Development Goal and target. The MDG model offers flexibility in including relevant interventions for each country\u2019s response to the epidemic. Each worksheet has default interventions listed at the top (See the list of default interventions in Annex 1). All the listed interventions are \u201cselected\u201d (a tick in the box as below) as default, which means costs of these interventions will be included in the total cost. However, you can also exclude particular interventions as shown below by ticking off a box. This function also allows users to assess the financial impact of particular interventions on the total cost by checking the box on and off. Also, users can change the name of interventions. To change the name, right click on the cell containing the intervention you wish to change. This will show the name of the intervention in the formula box (see below) in which you can enter a new name. If an intervention is not relevant simply leave the check box.

Setting the target One of the unique features of the MDG model is that each intervention is accompanied by its specific target(s) defined by users. These targets are defined by each country and enables results-based costing with a system of accountability and monitoring of the progress. The default targets, which include UNAIDS non-negotiable targets for universal access to prevention, treat- ment and care by 2010 (which were officially incorporated into MDG targets for Asia and the Pacific in 2007), can be easily redefined by double-clicking on the cell that contains the target. In some interventions, these targets are then entered (manually) into the model as below. First you enter the Target Year (\u201c2010\u201d in the above example), followed by a coverage level of the current or Start Year (\u201c50%\u201d) and that of the Target Year (\u201c80%\u201d). The model then assumes a linear increase between the start and the end year and automatically generates a coverage level to be achieved in each year in order to achieve the target (see below). The coverage level after that target year will sustain the target level. However, the coverage levels can be changed manually (as they are in orange cells), allowing users to front- load or backload efforts and to make adjustments midway depending on the progress. The model assumes a linear increase in the coverage level Years after the target year maintain the target coverage level at default 12 MDG-Consistent HIV/AIDS Costing Model for Asia and the Pacific << Contents 4-3. Data entry Data entry is straight forward in the MDG model in most cases. Users simply enter required data in yellow cells. Some sections require all yellow cells to be filled with data \u2013 missing data will produce either no or incorrect calculations. In an example below, the user enters interventions that are considered necessary to achieve the target. This is followed by the annual frequency of each intervention and its unit cost that are entered into appropriate yellow cells. In some other cases, interventions are pre-determined such as HIV prevention among sex workers, fol- lowed by the coverage level and unit cost. In the below example, an intervention \u201cCommission baseline studies\u201d will take place once in 2007 at the cost of $3000. An intervention \u201cDissemination workshops\u201d will take place 3 times in 2008 at the cost of $5000 per workshop. Note that the unit cost is always entered into the \u201c2007\u201d or \u2018Target Year\u2019 column. In the case of \u201cCommission drafting of a bill,\u201d the unit cost of $2000 is entered into the 2007 column despite the fact that the activity will take place only in 2008. However, the $2000 in the 2007 column is shown faded, indicating that it will not be calculated. As mentioned previously, the MDG model has a useful \u201cRESET\u201d button to clear a particular field and restore its original state. This could be a very powerful function, which allows an easy entry of different figures to assess their impact on the cost without manually erasing each cell for a different figure. Enter activities that are considered necessary to achieve the target Dissemination workshops will happen 3 times in 2008 The unit cost must always be entered into yellow cells in this first (\u201cStart Year\u201d) column. 13 User MANUAL << Contents 4-3-1. Unit costs Before entering unit costs, users need to decide what currency to use. The model uses the US Dollar as a default currency unit. If a local currency, as defined in the Top worksheet, is preferred, you need to change the working currency unit from US$ to a local currency. The working currency unit can be changed from US$ to a local currency by selecting [Currency Converter] - [Convert] as shown in 1-4 above.

Locally developed unit costs will be more accurate, provide a better understanding of intervention costs, and their associated implications, and thus greater ownership of the costing outputs (Alban and EASE International n.d.). \u2022\ufffd Ensure the unit cost equates to the intervention. For example, if the intervention is to provide harm reduction for injecting drug users, including pharmacotherapy, needle exchange programs, condom provision, shelter and life building skills, ensure that the unit cost includes all of those elements, not just pharmacotherapy and needle exchange. \u2022\ufffd Capital and human resource costs. (The INPUT model and Costing Guidelines for HIV/AIDS interventions strategies illustrates how to include these costs in the unit cost (UNAIDS and ADB 2004).) Alternatively the proportion of infrastructure and human resource unit costs attributable to HIV can be entered on the Health Systems worksheets as discussed below. \u2022\ufffd Ensure that the unit cost is reflective of the scope and coverage of the intervention. Questions such as follows need to be examined when determining the appropriate unit cost: - Does the unit cost vary between rural and urban populations? - Does the unit cost vary for interventions targeting youths in school to those out of school? \u2022\ufffd The model assumes unit costs are constant across the time period. However, this can be changed to reflect the impact of marginal costs over time and as coverage increases (UN Millennium Project 2005b). Note that the cell colour for unit costs are orange, which means users can change values. \u2022\ufffd Country teams need to develop and identify unit costs specific for their country and chosen interventions. It is envisaged that available country specific resources and involvement of key stakeholders conducting interventions on the ground will facilitate the process of collecting country specific data. \u2022\ufffd Identifying unit costs is vitally importance as they provide concrete criteria and key information (e.g. operational efficiency & effectiveness) to help prioritise interventions within limited financial means as well as help project future costs of particular interventions. \u2022\ufffd However, when there are no local unit costs available, users can refer to proxy indicators as a reference, which can be found in Annex 3. Some proxy indicators are also available in the model where a \u201cprox\u201d button is located. 14 MDG-Consistent HIV/AIDS Costing Model for Asia and the Pacific << Contents 4-3-2. Entering costs that cannot be included anywhere or that are shared by multiple interventions Sometimes there are costs that are not specific to a particular intervention or are better to be calculated independently. Examples include vehicles and other capital investments that are used for multiple inter- ventions. The MDG model provides a space to accommodate such cross-cutting costs. At the end of the Cost Sum- mary section in each Worksheet, there are yellow cells that can accommodate such costs. Double-click on a cell \u201cOther\u201d and enter the name of the cost. If it is a capital cost, a small box needs to be ticked so that it will be properly reflected as such in the Cost Summary Worksheet. Additionally, this space also provides a flexibility of plugging in the total cost of a particular intervention or response field that is already available or generated using different tools. For example, if a country wishes to calculate the total cost of ARV medicines with a high level of details such as combination regimen-specific estimates, which is not available in the MDG model, it can be performed by such a tool as the Cape Town Model. Then the total amount calculated can simply be copied and pasted in this space, while keeping all the other areas unused. 15 User MANUAL << Contents 5. Reviewing the results After entering appropriate data, costs can be viewed at 3 different levels: (a) intervention, (b) response field (e.g. prevention), and (c) aggregate total. (a) Total cost of a particular intervention A total cost of a particular intervention is shown at the bottom of the data entry section of each interven- tion, in the Cost Summary section towards the end of the Worksheet as well as in the Cost Summary Work- sheet. (b) A total cost for a particular field of response Total annual costs for a particular field of response such as enabling environment, prevention and ARV treatment is shown in the Cost Summary section as below as well as in the Cost Summary Worksheet. (c) Aggregate total costs The Cost Summary Worksheet gives a comprehensive summary of all costs, by response field, intervention, year, and aggregate total.

The Health Systems Worksheet As a component of the cost of HIV/AIDS medical interventions will include the cost of the health facilities and human resources associated with delivery of that intervention, users need to decide on how to incor- porate those costs. There are two possible ways these costs can be incorporated: 1) a component included in the unit cost of the medical intervention, or 2) by entering health facility and human resource details, and then specifying the HIV/AIDS propor- tion of those construction, maintenance and human resource cost details on the Health Systems Worksheet. If the latter is chosen, users need to take the following steps: a. Check the boxes in the default intervention list to include the cost of Health Systems in total cost calculations. At default, these boxes are NOT checked. b. Specify: the number of health facilities, \u2022\ufffd unit costs for construction, equipment, operations and maintenance and rehabilitation of facili- \u2022\ufffd ties, the number of health staff, \u2022\ufffd staffing costs, and \u2022\ufffd attribution of these costs to HIV/AIDS as shown in an example below: \u2022\ufffd Ensure that these boxes are checked before entering data Users specify the percentage of operations and maintenance costs attributable to HIV/AIDS. 18 MDG-Consistent HIV/AIDS Costing Model for Asia and the Pacific << Contents 6-2. Condom provisions in the Prevention Worksheet Caution needs to be exercised when estimating the total cost of condoms distributed. As condom provi- sion is found in multiple interventions, there is a risk of double-counting and overestimation. To minimise this overestimation risk, the model automatically adjusts the total costs of condom provision. The model subtracts the sum of costs of condom provision (male condom only) in all relevant prevention interventions (other than that of 10. Condom Provision) from the total cost of prevention interventions. In this way, the total cost for Prevention can exclude double-counting of condom provision costs. This ad- justment is performed at the Cost Summary section in the Prevention Worksheet: 6-3. Unlocking the Worksheet All the Worksheets are protected or \u201clocked\u201d except for data entry cells, in order to prevent accidental de- letion of cells, texts and other important information. However, users can unprotect or \u201cunlock\u201d the work- sheet to make specific changes in default texts, settings or formulas. To unprotect a particular worksheet, select [Tool] \u2013 [Protect] \u2013 [Unprotect Sheet] and then changes can be made in any place and any settings under that particular worksheet. In case of Excel 2007, select [Review] \u2013 [Unprotect Sheet] as shown below. 6-4. Saving the work It is recommended that, once data are entered, the work be saved as a different file name to keep the original file intact. Although the RESET function can restore certain cells to the original state, keeping the original file is always a recommended practice. 6-5. Customising the MDG Model As the MDG Model is an Excel-based tool, it offers the flexibility of customisation to best suit local circum- stances.

For example, the following formula shows that the first cell range to be effected is between C47 to L55 in the Enabling Environment Worksheet. RangeArr(1) = \u201c\u2019Enabling Environment\u2019!C47:L55,\u2019Enabling Environment\u2019!C87:L95, Therefore, changes in the location of cells that are subject to currency conversion need to be reflected in the cell range in the currency conversion macro. If, for example, a new raw is inserted between rows #46 and #47 in the above example, it will affect the location of all the cells after row #47. In this case, the entire cell ranges for Enabling Environment in the macro need to be adjusted accordingly to capture the new cell range. You can see that there are five blocks of formulas, which correspond to the 5 Worksheets/response fields of the model. The adjustments such as above need to be made only within the block of a particular Worksheet where changes have occurred. In the example above, changes in the cell range need to be made only in the block of formulas for Enabling Environment. After all the changes have been made, the entire worksheet needs to be copied and pasted into its cor- responding \u201creserve\u201d worksheet. Each Worksheet has its own reserve worksheet such as TP, EE, P, T, which stand for \u201cToP,\u201d \u201cEnabling Environment, \u201c \u201cPrevention,\u201d and \u201cTreatment,\u201d respectively. These reserve worksheets are used to restore the original state of specific cells when the \u201cRESET\u201d function is used. Therefore, when changes are made in the structure of a Worksheet, they need to be reflected in its reserve sheet. Cell range C47 to L55 \u2013 all the cells within this range are subject to currency conversion calculations 21 User MANUAL << Contents 7. Hands-on Exercise - The best way to get accustomed to the model Often the best way to get started and familiarised with the tool is by actually using it.
