The DGTTF Allocation Committee in 2008 emphasized the need for innovative and catalytic proposals.8 The methodology of this assessment tried to reflect that focus. The Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative states as its intended outcome to \u2018strengthen UNDP capacities for informed policy advice and targeted programming on access to justice by the poor and most disadvantaged groups in Asia and the Pacific\u2019. The human rights-based approach focuses not only on the intended goal of a programme or project, but also on the process of its design and implementation. This assessment and its report will accordingly analyze AP-A2J through the dual lens of process and results. In analyzing the process and results of the Initiative, the methodology prioritized political economy, effectiveness and sustainability, as prescribed by the terms of reference. Where possible, the assessment also applied other OECD/DAC criteria, in particular strategic positioning and efficiency. Due to the nature of the assignment, the approach was more qualitative than quantitative. Relevant regional initiative documentation, external reports and articles on A2J and the human rights-based approach, and country case studies were analyzed, and interviews conducted with a wide range of stakeholders from UNDP, donors, government institutions, academics and civil society. The assessment also launched a survey through the A2J practice network to collect first-hand perceptions of practitioners on the results, sustainability, lessons and way forward for the initiative. However, results were limited as only 12 people responded. In accordance with the terms of reference, the methodology focused on the following instruments: a Desk study: Collection and review of DGTTF Guidelines, DGTTF annual reports, the DGTTF 2008 Evaluation Report, project documents, country and outcome evaluations and materials produced as outputs of DGTTF-funded projects such as the programming guide and its impact for country offices, the A2J practice note, case studies, lessons learned, reports and other tools developed during the formulation of AP-A2J. a Interviews: Interviews were held either in person or by telephone, and included a broad spectrum of key respondents. Primary beneficiaries, civil society representatives, government officials, UNDP country office and Regional Centre staff, senior management, and other relevant stakeholders were consulted. a Site visits: Site visits were conducted to assess the impact of the regional initiative in Indonesia, Cambodia and Sri Lanka. The assessment also integrated lessons from other countries in the region, notably Timor-Leste, and India. The main purpose of the site visits was to determine the extent to which country projects have been innovative and catalytic in supporting progress in sensitive democratic governance issues and in generating broader activities, as well as the degree of influence (positive or negative) of the regional initiative on programming at the country level. a Codification of tools and instruments: In order to gauge the potential for further use/adaptation throughout UNDP of the training manuals, laws, regulations, knowledge products, methodologies used to achieve project results, the assessment systematically analyzed and documented lessons learned during the project. Particular emphasis was placed on effectiveness of innovation and catalytic ability, sustainability, relevance, strategic positioning, and efficiency. The assessment team was comprised mainly of five members: an international consultant that served as the team leader responsible for the country assessment of Sri Lanka and Indonesia as well as for the regional initiative report and for the overall editing of the final consolidated reports (country assessments); a policy analyst from the RCB that supported the Indonesia assessment and the overall editing of the final reports; a national consultant and a team member form the OGC, together", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "28e56264-4bbb-431b-b2a1-6940bf95a6f0": {"__data__": {"id_": "28e56264-4bbb-431b-b2a1-6940bf95a6f0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-regional-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative: Regional Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-regional-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "80ea3f6ac1aa1299365ca11e84982d035e21caf8552adeded60dd9dd05a87f9e"}}, "hash": "80ea3f6ac1aa1299365ca11e84982d035e21caf8552adeded60dd9dd05a87f9e", "text": "with a programme officer from the Serbia country office seconded through the fellowship programme to conduct the country assessment in Cambodia.

The assessment was conducted between 14 April and 14 May 2009. In the first week the Indonesia country assessment was fielded (team leader and policy analyst from the RCB). The national counterpart continued the Indonesia assessment after the departure of the RCB counterpart; in the second week the two team members returned to Bangkok to draft the country report and were joined by the Cambodia assessment team. The third week was dedicated to the Sri Lanka and Cambodia assessment and the final week to the overall drafting and consolidation of reports. This complex methodology required constant exchange of information, and the team took every opportunity to confer on strategy and preliminary findings. The multiple purposes for which the assessment was intended made consistency and coherence of approach all the more challenging and essential. Moreover, the very nature of the initiative being assessed produced a rich and varied set of knowledge products that had to be carefully identified and analyzed. Each country assessment covered over a dozen documents while the overall regional assessment examined at least 30 reports, manuals, guides and other documents. Since the primary goal was to assess AP-A2J results through various instruments but notably through country studies, with various observers responsible for data collection and analysis, it was critical to ensure that all involved followed a common set of guiding parameters to ensure consistency of results. The original terms of reference provided a set of key questions to be used in the approach. These questions are important not only to ensure that the objectives of this assessment are on the right track for RCB purposes, but also to ensure consistency among the conclusions of country studies. The team leader provided additional questions to guide the country assessments. This exercise was guided by the following key questions: Effectiveness and efficiency: a How and to what extent has the project achieved its objectives? Has the project generated quality outputs? What were the relevant constraints and enabling factors (internal and/or external)? a Has the project supported innovation in a way that helped to mobilize funds? Has the project been a catalyst, substantively, financially (TRAC and non-core) and in terms of developing and/or strengthening partnerships? Is there evidence that the results extend beyond the individual project? a What difference/impact has the project made in terms of democratic governance in the country concerned? a Were the resources (all types) adequate to manage the process? How instrumental was partner support in achieving the reported results? Sustainability: a What measures have been taken to ensure the sustainability of project achievements? a How have issues of ownership and participation of target groups/clients been addressed both in formulating and implementing the project? Did the project continue without further DGTTF funding? a Has the project contributed significantly to capacity development? Is there any evidence that the capacities at the individual, organizational and/or systems level have been strengthened through the project? a Did the project seek synergies with other democratic governance strategic areas? a What impact/influence did the regional initiative have on the country level A2J projects? a How did the DGTTF A2J projects contribute to knowledge management? Which tools produced by the project could be used to ensure better dissemination of knowledge emanated from the DGTTF? Political economy: a What was the political context (e.g., institutional set-up, change in government, degree of autonomy/ dependence of the partner institution in relation to others)? Who were the key national/international stakeholders? What were their interests? a Were partners able to promote these interests through formal or informal channels? How did this affect the performance of the project? 15 Regional Assessment a How does the political context enable forward thinking on a human rights-based approach to A2J?

The team posed additional questions to: a Identify innovative methodologies to approach key development issues; a Examine national capacities developed through DGTTF assistance; a Gauge the level of stakeholder contribution to the outcome, i.e., to ascertain whether the assistance provided by the project was of a participatory nature; a Identify indirect beneficiaries and record their own perceptions of how they have benefited from the DGTTF assistance. 16 UNDP and the human rights-based approach to A2J Until the early 1990s there was very little contact and exchange between people working on human development and those working with human rights. In part because of the work of UNDP, over the last decade debate has grown around the integration of human rights into the practice of development cooperation.9 Today the concept of development has abandoned the economic growth-centred approach to integrate new dimensions that reflect people\u2019s real needs, evolving into the widely accepted concept of human development. Two trends in the 1990s contributed to the gradual convergence of the two approaches (Sano 2000): developing countries increasingly demanded international assistance as an entitlement, as a right; and developed countries increasingly demanded good governance and the democratization of developing countries as a condition for assistance. The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action emerging from the World Conference on Human Rights (1993) states that \u201cThe World Conference on Human Rights reaffirms the right to development, as established in the Declaration on the Right to Development, as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human rights\u201d (Article 10). In other words, human development is a necessary but not sufficient condition for human rights realization. The Programme for Action of the World Summit for Social Development (Copenhagen, 1995) states that \u201c ...[i]t is essential for social development that all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to development as an integral part of fundamental human rights, be promoted and protected...\u201d (Article 15) and elaborates on the process of how to promote and protect these rights. The rule of law and access to justice are necessary conditions for human development. In other words, the realization of human rights is a necessary but not sufficient condition for human development.10 A similar convergence took place between human rights groups and human development groups. Although human rights are the very foundation of the UN through the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, the organization did not take the lead in promoting human rights during the first forty years of its existence, mostly because of the varying positions held by member states during the Cold War. After the end of the Cold War and under the leadership of the Secretary General Kofi Annan, a radical change took place and a UN reform programme was launched in 1997 with a clear emphasis on human rights. The respect of all internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to development, form the normative basis for the Millennium Declaration that sets forth the crucial elements of a desirable future world. There exists global consensus around the international development goals, the Millennium Development Goals, as evidenced by the over 160 world leaders who endorsed the United Nations Millennium Declaration in 2000. UNDP has placed these targets at the centre of its development strategy. These elaborate development goals cannot be achieved without poor people\u2019s participation in the decisions and processes that affect their lives. It is therefore natural that respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms features prominently in the Millennium Declaration. Human rights provide a means of empowering all people to make decisions about their own lives rather than being the passive objects of choices made on their behalf. At the policy level, the trigger for UNDP\u2019s work on the human rights-based approach was the 2000 Human Development Report that stressed that human rights and human development share a common vision and purpose: to secure the freedom, well-being and dignity of all people. The 2003 UN Common Understanding (UNCU) deepened this approach Political economy 9 Amartya Sen\u2019s seminal work", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c4da2150-f91a-4d3e-8fd5-6e88fc0ccd99": {"__data__": {"id_": "c4da2150-f91a-4d3e-8fd5-6e88fc0ccd99", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-regional-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative: Regional Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-regional-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "30942c9911becf6ee049c95089f7fcbbac6392ff39721a966d63b0d0f24a7c77"}}, "hash": "30942c9911becf6ee049c95089f7fcbbac6392ff39721a966d63b0d0f24a7c77", "text": "freed the development and poverty practice from the narrow schemes of economic growth and macroeconomic performances, shifting the attention from income poverty to a more complex and dynamic analysis. The work of Mahbub ul Haq as Director of the UNDP Human Development Report Office further applied and developed Sen\u2019s ideas with the help of experience acquired in the field, emerging as one of the most effective tools for mainstreaming the human rights paradigm into development practices. 10 In Reinventing Development by Paul Gready and Jonathan Eanser 17 Regional Assessment by bringing a shared understanding of the human rights- based approach to the UN system and providing a framework to guide implementation of the human rights-based approach to development programming by all UN entities. As stressed in the UNDP Administator\u2019s Note,11 applying the human rights-based approach will require that the UNDP adopt innovative and strategic thinking and leadership to mobilize support of decision- and policy-makers. It will also be important to cultivate new civil society partnerships and alliances. Human rights values, standards and principles should be underscored during all phases of programme development and in all UNDP activities. Access to justice and a human rights-based approach to development The focus on access to justice by all is a recent approach in development cooperation. UNDP views justice as closely related to poverty eradication. Rather than simply a mechanism to foster economic growth, access to justice is a means to prevent and overcome human poverty by strengthening disadvantaged people\u2019s choices to seek and obtain a remedy for grievances, and thus effectively levelling the playing field in the pursuit of human development. In 2009 at the global level, justice and human rights represented around 18% of the overall DGTTF allocation. At the regional level, 21 out of 25 country offices in Asia and the Pacific are currently involved in justice and human rights- related initiatives. The human rights-based approach to development on which AP-A2J is based regards access to justice as a fundamental right, as well as a key means to defend other rights. The focus on human rights brings two important values to development work: a framework for policies and programmes; and an emphasis on enhancing the capacity of poor people to demand accountability. UNDP defines access to justice as \u2018the ability of people, particularly from poor and disadvantaged groups, to seek and obtain a remedy through formal and informal justice systems, in accordance with human rights principles and standards.\u2019 UNDP\u00b4s framework for A2J is based on two goals: human rights and capacity development.12 Access to justice is a human rights-based objective. However, not every access to justice strategy has a human rights-based outcome as its objective. A human rights approach focuses not only on the intended goal of a programme or project, but also on the process of its design and implementation. Therefore, when adopting a human rights-based approach, one also needs to make sure that initiatives to ensure access to justice are present.13 Human rights-based programming or rights-based programming is a methodology to develop programmes and projects that include the key elements of so-called \u2018good\u2019 programming. It is based on a human rights framework. Human rights-based programming promotes empowering development processes while enhancing accountability and effectiveness of development initiatives. Key features of rights-based programming for access to justice Human rights-based programming is different from conventional tools and methods in that it: \u2022 Situates access to justice in the context of a human rights/legal framework; \u2022 Analyzes degrees of vulnerability with regard to a particular problem, and selects those groups who may be more seriously impacted as priority beneficiaries of the project; \u2022 Divides relevant stakeholders into claim holders and duty bearers; \u2022 Focuses on empowering people with legitimate claims, and on holding accountable those who are mandated or able to respond; \u2022 Assesses the capacity of both claim holders and duty bearers to address the problem, and aims to ensure that capacity development strategies exist on both sides; \u2022 Attempts to establish participatory processes where those affected are freely and meaningfully involved. 11 In Programming for Justice: Access for All, Chapter 1. 12 In A2J Programming Guide: Justice for all, Chapter 1. 13 Idem 18 Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative Within this framework grew the idea of a human rights-based approach to development as a new way to foster development with particular attention to protecting, fulfilling and promoting all human rights. There is a general consensus around the main characteristics of a human rights-based approach to development. These include free, active and meaningful participation, equality and non-discrimination, empowerment of the poorest and most disadvantaged groups, clear connection between duties", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c12cd456-841f-4254-8b73-83404b95fd29": {"__data__": {"id_": "c12cd456-841f-4254-8b73-83404b95fd29", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-regional-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative: Regional Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-regional-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e25f95ca179b9b7376409818838d8ce700e7ccdaa34cda149fbbf712f9d3bc54"}}, "hash": "e25f95ca179b9b7376409818838d8ce700e7ccdaa34cda149fbbf712f9d3bc54", "text": "and responsibilities, and a comprehensive and integrated long-term vision of the development process as contributing to the further realization of human rights. Many years after the publication of the first UNDP Human Development Report and the 2000 Human Development Report on Human Rights and Development, the debate continues over whether and how development and human rights intersect. Many UN bodies, national development cooperation agencies, international and national NGOs are mainstreaming human rights into development practice. There is still no comprehensive UNDP global commitment to strategically adopt a human rights-based approach to development.14 The human rights-based approach to development, broadly understood, is a perspective that considers traditional goals of development activity, such as the provision of health or educational services, food or shelter, as human rights. At the theoretical level, it represents an attempt to harmonize the main elements of human development theory with the normative framework of internationally recognized human rights. These two visions share a common set of principles and values that encompass all relevant aspects of development activity and provide a blueprint for an appropriate development process. The main points of convergence are: a Attention to process; a Direct linkage to human rights; a Participation and empowerment; a Non-discrimination; a Attention to the most vulnerable groups; a Accountability. Little here is new in terms of development theory and practice. But seen in the light of human rights standards, these attributes gain additional relevance. The first element of the human rights-based approach is to be aware of the process of development. This calls for a rethinking of the means-goals relation. In the traditional theory, means are appraised for their effectiveness in reaching goals. A human rights perspective examines the actual nature of the means: their adherence to human rights standards, their capacity to empower poor people and disadvantaged groups, their cultural, economic, political and social sustainability. In this way, a human rights approach to development shifts attention from the outputs of the development process to its dynamics, from the feasibility of means to their intrinsic value, and from the results to the process in itself. If this aspect seems common to other perspectives, the real innovation for the traditional approach is the link to the international human rights normative framework. Integrating human rights into development activities means not only avoiding activities and programmes that are expressly against the spirit of human rights (such as projects that reinforce discrimination against individuals or groups, involve large- scale evictions or displacement of persons, or are implemented from the top down), but also expressing civil, economic, political and social targets in terms of human rights, taking into account human rights norms at every stage of project development, from needs assessment to evaluation. This is perhaps the most relevant value-added of the human rights approach: the core of human rights treaties, covenants and international instruments, as well as the interpretations, recommendations and guidelines provided by treaty bodies, UN agencies and other international mechanisms, can greatly enhance the accountability, transparency, and clarity of development programmes and activities and build consensus around them.15 14 The Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor (CLEP), while seeking to empower the poor through focusing on property rights, business rights, land rights and access to justice, missed an opportunity to integrate human rights into their framework by not adopting the human rights-based approach. 15 In The Role of the Right to Development in the Human Rights Framework for Development, Alessando Sitta and Implementing Human Rights Based Development, Dan Banik 19 Regional Assessment Accountability is particularly important in development processes. Clearly identifying duty bearers and rights holders in a specific context and situation can enhance transparency and effectiveness. The human rights approach to development, for its normative nature, can help this identification. Participation is a common pillar of human rights and human development concepts. That people should have control over the fundamental choices of their lives, taking part in all processes that affect them, is usually a common principle in most development interventions. The human rights-based approach emphasizes this aspect with a normative framework for monitoring and advocacy. Again, the goal itself may not be new; but conceiving economic and social goals in terms of human rights makes persons, communities and groups active agents of their own development process \u2013 changing the paradigm from aid provision to claiming rights and entitlements where beneficiaries become the real directors of the project. The universality of human rights implies that all human rights are applicable to all human beings without exception. It implies equity and non-discrimination.

The diffusion of human development theory has deepened the integration of human rights concerns into development theory and practice. The human rights-based approach to development merges human development and human rights paradigms. At the theoretical level, however, there is still some lack of consensus on how to articulate development and human rights.16 This articulation will be critical for a human rights-based approach to A2J and to poverty reduction in general. The last section of the report addresses this issue. Asia-Pacific A2J strategy: objectives, outputs and process Access to justice is critical for poverty reduction, and a major area of the UNDP democratic governance practice. AP-A2J was a substantive, results-based and tightly facilitated regional practice initiative, responding to the call for greater knowledge exchange among the various governance initiatives supported by UNDP in many countries. The Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative was an attempt to develop organizational capacities in this field by providing a regional community of practitioners on access to justice with adequate knowledge, tools and networks. As such, it was meant to complement the work of the large, mainly demand- driven global networks. Objectives and outputs17 The objectives of this initiative were the following: a To develop the capacities of UNDP country offices in the region to use the human rights-based approach in designing and implementing A2J programmes. a To strengthen knowledge sharing among UNDP practitioners through a community of practice that enhances overall capacities and knowledge. a To refine UNDP\u2019s work in the sub-practice area by raising awareness on international comparative experiences in adopting the human rights-based approach to A2J (e.g. ongoing efforts in Latin America) and defining the UNDP niche in the area while raising the prominence of access to justice within overall UNDP policy. a To expand UNDP networks in the justice sector at the national and regional levels, and promote UNDP as a key partner in Asia and the Pacific. a To strengthen individual capacities of UNDP programme staff in the justice field. a To develop rights-based tools and methodologies for A2J practitioners. 16 In The Role of the Right to Development in the Human Rights Framework for Development, Alessando Sitta. 17 For a detailed breakdown of the identified six objectives see Section 2 on Methodology in this report. 20 Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative Traditional Rule of Law Approach MARKET-CENTRED \u2022 Assumption: For the effective functioning of markets that leads to economic growth, the rule of law is necessary \u2013 it reduces political risks to investors and cuts down transaction costs, promoting businesses and investments and therefore alleviating poverty. \u2022 Focus on markets: Impact on poverty indirect (through economic efficiency). \u2022 Supports predominantly state institutions, particularly judiciary. Civil society support a means towards institutional development (consultation, advocacy, etc.) \u2022 Overemphasis on formal systems. \u2022 Poor people\u2019s obstacles to access justice defined in terms of transaction costs, esp. affordability. \u2022 Laws are neutral.

Process premises and outline20 AP-A2J process premises The idea of addressing the human rights-based approach to A2J as a knowledge management issue was based on the following premises: a Active involvement and participation of country offices and field staff, aiming to: a) Strengthen knowledge on A2J and capacities in assessment, analysis and programme design from a rights perspective; b) Expand justice networks at country, regional and global levels; and c) Strengthen institutional learning through knowledge sharing and codification. a Respecting basic requirements of a human rights- based approach, particularly including participatory dimensions and focusing on the concerns of disadvantaged groups as well as on the capacities of institutional duty-holders to respond to such concerns. The initiative took into account country office needs for further familiarization with a rights-based approach to development in pursuing this objective. a Practice orientation: In line with UNDP efforts to build vibrant communities around thematic sub\u2013practices, the initiative was active in identifying links and seeking partnerships with RBAP, BDP/IDG (nowadays BDP/DGG), the Oslo Governance Centre, and programmes such as PRAJA, GOLD, PARAGON and HURIST under which complementary activities can be pursued once entry points are identified \u2013 e.g. scanning national legislation in the region. Results and lessons are shared with the larger UNDP networks such as DGP-Network and HURITalk. a External partners \u2013 governmental, non-governmental and inter-governmental partners active in the justice sector (such as DFID, ADB, the World Bank, Asia Foundation, the Ford Foundation, etc.) participated in the initiative, sharing their knowledge and experiences on the justice sector in Asia and the Pacific. A special partnership with OHCHR provided professional expertise on human rights as required and helped identify relevant national partners, particularly among NGOs.

Field practitioners collected and codified internal UNDP knowledge with SURF support. Twelve country offices21 contributed 17 case studies with specific lessons and recommendations for A2J programming. The network also sought lessons from internal partners in areas where UNDP experience was considered insufficient. At the same time, internal research was being conducted at the regional SURFs to screen additional lessons. The distillation of various inputs for the final tools also started in this phase. In November 2003 these processes converged at a second regional workshop in Sri Lanka, attended by 15 country offices and 17 external partners. This workshop had a very different focus from the first: while the visioning workshop had screened the general A2J field for valuable lessons, the second workshop focused on discussing and validating those lessons (through country office case studies, outsourced studies and in-house research) that had been compiled in the meantime. Finally, the fifth phase of the initiative concentrated on the distillation and packaging of the compiled lessons into a number of tools,22 to make the various experiences amenable to better and more targeted programming. The guide and website were launched in September 2005. Throughout its life cycle the Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative evolved around the concept of a community of practitioners, involving approximately 40 UNDP staff from over 17 country offices in the region, and supported by an electronic network of more than 80 members globally. A 2005 workshop brought together UNDP and external partners to promote the UNDP A2J initiative and foster partnerships. At that time, more than 10 country offices in the region were implementing or had implemented A2J pilot projects and studies, and the initiative strived to link regional and national institutions around its tools, concept and methodology. This approach significantly influenced the quality and type of results of the initiative. 21 Including Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Fiji, East Timor, India, Indonesia, Iran, Mongolia, Nepal, the Philippines, and Vietnam. 22 Tool development occurred throughout the initiative. While some tools are necessary to gather lessons and collect information, phase 5 concentrated on knowledge codification tools. 23 On the whole, the assessment concluded that AP-A2J has successfully achieved all of its expected outputs and the core of its two outcomes. It has clearly increased codification of knowledge and production of tools on the subject, and contributed immensely to the capacity development of both UNDP practitioners and national and external partners. It has promoted policy development at the global level and raised the visibility and credibility of UNDP\u2019s work on applying the human rights-based approach to A2J, thereby establishing UNDP\u2019s niche in the area of access to justice. The initiative successfully launched a regional community of practice which adopted a bottom-up practice approach drawing on the knowledge of practitioners and strengthening organizational learning. The AP-A2J initiative was found to be radically innovative in both process and results. The approach, emphasizing process and results, had far-reaching impacts which extended beyond the region and to other development partners, including civil society organizations. Financially, it boosted interest from donors keen on earmarking funds for access to justice projects in the region which had adopted the human rights-based approach.23 It also effectively demonstrated that with very little initial funding,24 low-cost activities and one full-time dedicated resource facilitator, it was possible to create an inspiring movement owned by the core practitioners. Lastly, while the ownership, capacity development and partnership strategy was effectively geared to promoting sustainability, there are challanges in ensuring that the human rights-based approach to development is not seen merely as a passing fad and that the momentum built by the initiative continues on. On the other hand, it is still early to adequately assess impact of the initiative in promoting sustainable country programming on a human rights-based approach to A2J as no proper independent client survey has been conducted in most of the AP countries. This is a crucial element for accountability \u2013 an aspect inherent to the human rights-based approach strategy.

So while the initiative did appear to strengthen the UNDP niche on A2J from a rights- based perspective, its progress towards becoming an essential strategy for human development and poverty reduction remains difficult to measure. The assessment tried to answer a set of questions on effectiveness that can be grouped in the following categories: overall results in terms of outputs and objectives; innovative ability; and catalytic capacity. Results on outputs and objectives For the sake of coherence, the process results (related with using a practice approach) will be discussed first, followed by the substantive results on the effectiveness of applying a human rights-based approach. As mentioned previously, the assessment concluded that the initiative did successfully achieve all expected outputs in light of its practice approach.

Effectiveness 23 SIDA in particular is one of the partners that supported many projects on the human rights-based approach at several country offices in the region, including Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Timor-Leste. 24 From documentation and interviews available, it was possible to conclude that the initiative mobilized approximately USD 185,000 from DGTTF and the Global Hurist Programme. UNDP SURFs offices in Bangkok and Kathmandu further contributed an estimated USD 20,000. 25 Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Maldives, Mongolia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Timor-Leste, Vietnam. 26 At a minimum Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, and Nepal. 24 Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative As highlighted by several interviewees that were part of the core team of the initiative \u201c\u2026even more important than the products of the initiative was the process as a key focus\u2026\u201d The major results from using a practice approach included the following: a Knowledge codification and production of tools tailored to UNDP\u2019s needs: The tools that have been produced as a result of AP-A2J are tailored for UNDP needs, largely due to an innovative process that systematically linked knowledge production to capacity development. The Practitioner\u2019s Guide \u2018Programming for Justice: Access for All\u2019 has been considered a major breakthrough (despite implementation difficulties highlighted during the country assessments by UNDP staff) for conceptualizing and operationalizing the human rights-based approach. It is considered a fundamental tool by UNDP practitioners, despite its heavy technical structure, as well as by external human rights experts and other development partners. Testimonials collected from the Canadian Bar Association as well as from academia experts researching and working in development indicated the value of this tool for both programming and advocacy. In Papua New Guinea, for instance, development partners use the guide as a resource in policy-making. In Sri Lanka, the assessment mission observed that legal departments of the police and law faculty frequently referred to the UNDP guide for training and research. a Capacity development of UNDP practitioners: The process of AP-A2J developed the capacity of some 30 country office practitioners in the region. They have developed substantial knowledge on A2J and instruments to apply it in policy and programme development. Learning channels have included the two workshops (which were designed in a participatory format, as learning rather than training events) and tasks through which practitioners were engaged in rethinking their own work (e.g., extraction of lessons). The network also reached some 80 members through electronic network activities, which resulted in additional learning and knowledge-sharing. However, the ability to expand and retain this capacity in a sustainable way is now being questioned as the first generation of dedicated practitioners has been dispersed to other country offices and the current practitioners do not have the same ownership of the material. Capacity development must continue to ensure sustainability. The community of practice needs to be regenerated every few years to keep its momentum and to ensure that staff are trained and mentored on applying a human rights-based approach to A2J.

Guided by the UNDP human development framework and MDG paradigms, a clear substantive niche for UNDP A2J was developed, profoundly influencing the global practice note for UNDP. AP-A2J had a notable impact on practice initiatives in A2J in RBEC, RBAS and RBLAC. a Organizational learning beyond the regional community of practice: In addition to carving out a substantive niche, AP-A2J has produced a wealth of lessons on process and knowledge management. Here again the initiative has influenced regional A2J initiatives in RBEC, RBAS and RBLAC as well as overall human rights- based programming in practice areas beyond democratic governance. In India, a similar knowledge management initiative has been adopted by the UNCT (Solution Exchange). Influenced by the initiative in India, the MDG community of practice generated eight similar networks that now have more than 10,000 members. At the outcome and overall framework level the assessment examined the results of applying a human rights- based approach to development programming. While it is clear that the initiative contributed to policy alignment, with more UNDP country offices applying a human rights-based approach to A2J and more civil society partners targeting disadvantaged groups, it is important also to determine to what extent the UNDP programming framework has changed meaningfully and sustainably as a consequence of applying a human rights perspective. It is important to recall that the \u2018human rights approach\u2019 is not an end in itself, but rather a framework for human development. It complements existing approaches and is in line with the UNDP policy on integrating human rights with sustainable human development. The AP-A2J initiative opted for a human rights-based approach to strengthen development effectiveness, that is, to support \u2018processes that are pro-poor and promote equity\u2018.27 A human rights approach uses human rights as universal and normative guidance for human development processes and results. The approach clarifies accountabilities, and explicitly guarantees against discrimination in development policies and programmes, to protect the most vulnerable groups. The added value of the approach is in guiding what programmes do (substantive value) and how (process value). Below some illustrations of each, from country experiences: a A human rights-based approach focuses on the most disadvantaged people and their entitlements as human beings. In the AP-A2J experience, applying a human rights approach helped to define a framework for UNDP\u2019s action on access to justice that was centred on disadvantaged people and their rights. Whereas previous approaches to justice programmes had largely put markets at the centre of the analysis, highlighting the strong links between rule of law and economic growth, the starting point for AP-A2J became disadvantaged people, rather than markets, viewing rule of law in wider terms as a means for people to protect themselves from abuses of power. A focus on disadvantaged people seeks a more direct impact on poverty eradication and other Millennium Development Goals. In Indonesia, for instance, an A2J assessment piloted in five provinces was critical to identify the most disadvantaged groups as well as their perceptions of their justice needs. This gave way to very different justice perceptions and needs \u2013 from gender-related issues to poor local governance administration - that are now being addressed at the national level by the National Strategy for Access to Justice.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0eb493a7-b0ac-4c2f-bc48-574a55d59641": {"__data__": {"id_": "0eb493a7-b0ac-4c2f-bc48-574a55d59641", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-regional-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative: Regional Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-regional-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b116571bcd6e156dfc1e4b6c9fee45be7f3d19f2d4d931b6d1a9355626f8fcb1"}, "2": {"node_id": "25df9c99-617e-41e4-8d3c-289285aa3ac4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-regional-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d03c1a2b1f99207ea87d91275fc98793957201b208bb2c6e0419724295c4b074"}}, "hash": "4781daa83f62bef51210fc0905d90aa6e94591e4f80aa7d050f87085dc10259a", "text": "Similarly, in Sri Lanka, a nationwide survey on A2J and an assessment of the legal aid sector led the project to better target the most disadvantaged groups identified by these assessments, in particular internally displaced persons from the north and the most impoverished population from the estate sector. a The human rights-based approach contributed to strengthening human development and capacity development perspectives.

Human rights imply human obligations; claiming rights and fulfilling obligations require different capacities. Strategies to develop capacities on A2J need to improve the supply and the demand sides of justice (claiming rights and fulfilling obligations), as well as the legal framework governing them. 27 UNDP Development Effectiveness Report (DER) 2003: Partnerships for Results, UNDP Evaluation Office, 2003, page 6 26 Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative Under this framework for action, effective access to justice implies that people\u2019s rights and entitlements are recognized within the scope of formal or traditional justice systems (legal protection); that people are capable of demanding justice; and that institutions are able to provide fair remedies. Human rights standards help to assess how such capacities are deployed with respect to access to justice (for instance, the availability of quality legal counsel to detainees, even those who cannot pay for it, or the impartiality of dispute resolution mechanisms). Some of the countries assessed have made strides to balance capacity development and legal awareness among duty bearers and claim holders. Traditionally, rule of law programmes focused mainly on the institutional development of duty bearers, in particular on state institutions such as ministries of justice, courts, prosecution services and public defence mechanisms. This is the case in Timor-Leste, which only in 2008 began to strengthen A2J elements in informal justice mechanisms. In Indonesia, the LEAD project seeks to develop capacities of duty bearers in civil society while reinforcing links with state actors such as the formal sector or local public administration. The programme also has a large component dedicated to legal empowerment and legal awareness of claim holders. In Sri Lanka, another project focuses on capacity development of duty bearers through training on the human rights-based approach while institutionalizing capacity development strategies in key institutions at the local level, such as the Grama Niladaris. At the same time the project is working with community-based organizations to promote legal empowerment at the community level. Meanwhile, in Cambodia, the A2J project has supported alternate dispute resolution at the community level through the Maison de Justice. a The human rights-based approach has helped bring the process of development to the forefront. A human rights-based approach helps to bring the process of development to the forefront, thereby clarifying the relationship between outcomes and the processes by which outcomes come about. It stresses the importance of the development process and recognizes development as a process in itself. An \u2018empowering process\u2019 is one that develops disadvantaged people\u2019s capacities for meaningful participation. Indonesia provides a good example of this in its strategies focusing on A2J assessments and legal empowerment. An emphasis on process has now been adopted by the national planning agency, with potential replication for the judiciary sector in its new blueprint for reform. Key conclusions The human rights-based approach to A2J was effective as an approach to development programming, although the actual level of impact on people\u2019s lives and the sustainability of such an approach remain still to be seen. Concretely, the countries assessed offered good grounds for the assertion that the human rights-based approach has strengthened development effectiveness for the following reasons: 1. Country programmes are moving away from more traditional outcome formulations, such as \u2018strengthened administration of justice\u2019, towards those that explicitly include disadvantaged people \u2013 e.g., \u2018Legal empowerment of, and increased access to justice for the disadvantaged\u2019.29 The more holistic perspective of the human rights-based approach expanded assessment to new areas in which UNDP justice programming had previously been scarce, such as perceived obstacles of disadvantaged people to seeking justice, legal-empowerment strategies, traditional justice mechanisms, police and prisons and civil society oversight. When applying a human rights-based approach Access to justice is people\u2019s ability to seek and obtain justice remedies respectful of basic human rights, using formal or traditional justice systems. Prior to applying a human rights-based approach Access to justice is people\u2019s ability to use public and private justice services 28 UNDP, Programming for Justice: Access for All, 2005. 29 As illustrated by UNDP programming in Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Sri Lanka.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "173f6e51-3bad-4de1-ae10-4f006ff2beb4": {"__data__": {"id_": "173f6e51-3bad-4de1-ae10-4f006ff2beb4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-regional-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative: Regional Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-regional-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f4bdec5884165f9ea950f1f9c29a3dde18224d502431225b6b2760b2c2ec2828"}, "2": {"node_id": "dfe336fc-5ef8-40c5-890a-ae9b03489d5c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-regional-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d9f3d8551628d9061201b8172d74682681fa2d558f2b50843dfc55b56d443ef2"}}, "hash": "f63529f2cff2e218fce882143cef4fe561f77619a01f9248bff927907cf9e8fe", "text": "In the AP-A2J context, using a human rights approach helped to refine the operational definition of A2J: 28 27 Regional Assessment An indicative overview of UNDP support to A2J for poverty eradication in Asia and the Pacific (2004) NORMATIVE PROTECTION OF RIGHTS By international and constitutional law FIJI SRI LANKA INDONESIA CHINA NEPAL MONGOLIA IRAN RRRT By legal and regulatory frameworks INDONESIA BANGKADESH CHINA VIETNAM NEPAL RRRT CAMBODIA By customary law INDIA PHILIPPINES LEGAL EMPOWERMENT Legal", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c4f25ea0-aca3-4f9e-8bc1-422d3ea1f083": {"__data__": {"id_": "c4f25ea0-aca3-4f9e-8bc1-422d3ea1f083", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-regional-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative: Regional Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-regional-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e6cb79c206b7bdd79ad90941e08c6c906579872808106ca492d5879baf89aa1b"}, "3": {"node_id": "7b1841ac-0c4e-45e0-8052-4a1146e7f789", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-regional-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "12729d717fafd851f47676983071d7d421d185e4deedd34fba230a43420875f4"}}, "hash": "4603555216e4e66658fa112ab9477d8a8cb78a4339ae5a7476e52f314b7b410d", "text": "awareness BANGKADESH FIJI NEPAL IRAN PHILIPPINES INDIA MONGOLIA RRRT INDONESIA Legal counsel BANGKADESH CHINA IRAN Other empowerment- related capacities INDIA INDONESIA SRI LANKA CAPACITY TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE REMEDIES Accessible adjudication Judicial system CAMBODIA NEPAL FIJI IRAN INDONESIA RRRT PHILIPPINES Quasi-judicial bodies NEPAL INDONESIA BANGKADESH MONGOLIA SRI LANKA PHILIPPINES Indigenous/ traditional system INDIA NEPAL EAST TIMOR PHILIPPINES Enforcement Police Prison system INDIA BANGKADESH RRRT PHILIPPINES Civil society oversight SRI LANKA INDIA PHILIPPINES INDONESIA 28 Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative Country Afghanistan Bangladesh Cambodia China India Indonesia Iran Lao PDR Nepal Philippines Sri Lanka Vietnam UNDP Projects \u2022 Rebuilding the Justice Sector in Afghanistan (RSJA) \u2013 2002-2004 -

For UNDP, development effectiveness \u2018is about processes that produce results, especially results that are pro- poor and promote equity\u2019.30 The Indonesia A2J programme is an example of a best practice of a human rights-based approach to A2J that has led to significant results at the national policy level balanced with appropriate response to grievances at the grassroots level and legal empowerment. 2. The human rights approach improved the holistic assessment and analysis of capacity development at all levels, allowing for a more strategic identification of entry points (claim holders and duty bearers) while identifying the most critical capacities of disadvantaged people to claim their rights, together with those of institutions to fulfil their essential duties. All projects assessed struggled to maintain the right balance between capacity of duty bearers and claim holders. Additionally, the human rights-based approach places stronger emphasis on \u2018meaningful\u2019 participation, stressing that disadvantaged people\u2019s perspectives are fundamental for identifying problems and possible solutions. In some of the projects assessed people were not merely \u2018consulted\u2019 on their views, but actively participated in decision-making (as in the case of Indonesia). In other contexts (e.g., the conflict-sensitive situation in Sri Lanka) such consultations with disadvantaged were politically difficult (leading to the national A2J survey being put on hold by the Ministry of Defense in December 2008). Similarly, in Nepal, a study on A2J in conflict situations was not published for concerns about being too controversial. 3.

Innovative character The AP-Rights and Justice Initiative can be considered one of the most innovative approaches in terms of UNDP practice. This can be seen in the practice approach of building a bottom-up community of practitioners to foster knowledge management and in the strategies that it influenced at the country level, and in its contribution to advancing one of the most sensitive issues in development. Key innovative aspects: 1. The use of knowledge management through a community of practice to turn individual knowledge into collective knowledge, providing platforms to facilitate knowledge-sharing though a bottom-up or non- hierarchical approach centred around connecting people through the community of practice, with the community as the driving force (external help being only a last resort). 2. The linking of tool production with in-house capacity development. For instance, the visioning workshop relied fully on in-house resources in a participatory process that brought practitioners together, identifying gaps and building cohesion among a core group that became the driving force of the initiative. 3. The wealth of research, case studies and assessments that have directly or indirectly resulted from the initiative are a major breakthrough allowing policy and programming to better target the real needs of beneficiaries. The Practitioner\u2019s Guide to Applying a Human Rights-based Approach to Access to Justice is the most comprehensive tool, developed with external partners from academia and civil society whose experiences enriched the process. It is conceptualized as a programming handbook, outlining typical obstacles and interventions to enhance A2J for disadvantaged people. Some external partners interviewed felt that the consultative and incremental process contributed to a coherent approach to justice. Additionally, several guidelines on how to conduct participatory consultations in the justice sector have been produced and are considered instrumental by internal and external partners. 30 UNDP Evaluation Office, UNDP Development Effectiveness Report 2003: Partnerships for Results, 2003, p. 6. 30 Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative 4. Substantively the overall human rights-based approach to A2J represented a clear shift in UNDP policy for justice reform, simply by stating the holistic problem in human rights terms with all the implications analyzed in the previous section. 5. The initiative influenced notable breakthroughs at the country level. In India, the project Assessment of Justice by Poor and Disadvantaged People developed in partnership with the National Judicial Academy was considered by the assessment team as an innovative project that addressed a critical democratic issue. Groups seldom targeted for research of this kind participated in the process. Despite the shortcomings assessed from the project it was considered a step forward, with potential to change some judicial approaches. A similar conclusion was drawn in Sri Lanka, where the project addressed a critical governance issue and targeted the most disadvantaged in conflict areas. The project was found to have contributed to the enhancement of the human rights-based approach, gender and A2J at the community and national levels. It allowed for networking and exchange among different actors and partners in the formal and informal sectors \u2013 an innovative approach, as the government had been very concentrated on organizational structures but was seeking other approaches. The Indonesia project was considered the most innovative of the four assessments: its project design was based on comprehensive prior research on A2J that brought together state institutions, civil society researchers and academia. 6. The human rights-based approach to A2J was less successful in prompting innovative thinking and new strategies on the interface between formal and informal justice systems and ADR. Some positive approaches have taken place: in Cambodia, the A2J project places particular emphasis on indigenous peoples and customary justice systems. But the country assessments suggest that this area would benefit from additional research and strategic advocacy. Catalytic capacity Positive conclusions can be drawn on the catalytic potential of the initiative, in terms of substantive results extending beyond the initiative itself and the fostering of extensive partnerships. Financially, although the initiative did not mobilize additional resources apart from the HURIST Global Programme and the DGTTF, its influence at the country level was crucial in attracting additional programming resources. Key findings demonstrating catalytic capacity 1. The DGTTF funds along with the HURIST contribution had the catalytic effect of creating a movement at the regional level, bringing together over 30 UNDP staff from more than 18 country offices in the region supported by an electronic network of over 100 members, in a joint effort that led to a human rights-based approach to A2J programming in a dozen country offices. It also had the effect of attracting additional funding", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2d8ec93a-a3cd-4c1b-8e1c-915e45501165": {"__data__": {"id_": "2d8ec93a-a3cd-4c1b-8e1c-915e45501165", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-regional-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative: Regional Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-regional-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "da98d80a16d746e7ab335931770c38500fa02e6627cc60400afaae4acdc1ea89"}}, "hash": "da98d80a16d746e7ab335931770c38500fa02e6627cc60400afaae4acdc1ea89", "text": "from UNDP SURFs and later from the UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok where, in addition to programme funds, staff time was also dedicated to the initiative. While resources (human and financial) were very necessary to initiate and sustain the initiative, some participants surmised that, in retrospect, the initiative may have benefited from starting out small and building on demand rather than being overwhelmed with funding and obliged to cater to a donor-driven agenda. 2. Financially the initiative was also catalytic, as it triggered additional resources from specific partners, in particular the Nordic countries that earmarked their contributions to different country offices for implementation of a human rights-based approach to A2J. In Indonesia, the A2J assessment was critical in attracting over USD 1.5 million from SIDA to the LEAD project; in Sri Lanka, SIDA was the main donor of the Equal Access to Justice Project together with the Netherlands (over USD 2 million). In Cambodia, the project managed to secure over USD 2 million of non-core funds from the Spanish Agency for International Co-operation and Development, in addition to DGTTF funding. 3. The initiative brought together external partners with UNDP practitioners to discuss a critical development and governance issue. Partners from civil society, donors and academia were present in workshops and during the preparation of the Practitioner\u2019s Guide. This was highly appreciated by some of those interviewed and formed the basis for strong advocacy. At the global level, however, the initiative failed to attract more corporate policy cross- practice support. However, several UNDP country offices including in other regions are increasingly adopting the human rights-based approach to development. In some cases, this can be partly attributed to members of the initiative applying their experience and knowledge on the human rights-based approach to development in their new positions in different countries. Examples of the influence of the initiative include the Transition and 31 Regional Assessment Recovery programme in Sri Lanka, the Local Governance programme in Bosnia and the Solutions Exchange programme in India. 4. Most of all, the initiative was substantially catalytic in fostering strategic national policy planning for A2J and bringing different partners, often with opposing interests, to the table to discuss a critical issue of common importance. Bringing into closer contact development partners and multilateral agencies working for the same purpose at field level, regardless of the different titles given to the approaches, helped to harmonize the global development agenda. Efficiency From the data available, the assessment concluded that the Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative was adequately efficient. These results need to be juxtaposed with the financial and human resources as well as opportunity costs of the initiative: a Financial: From 2003 until 2005, the initiative spent approximately USD 185,000, funded both from the DGTTF (USD 150,000) and HURIST (USD 35,000). Most of the funds were used for the visioning workshop, the second workshop and the task facilitator. Other short- term contracts and website development costs make up for the rest. From 2005 onwards an investment was made in terms of additional programming and staff cost (including contracting a full-time facilitator) and approximately USD 570,000 was spent. a Human resources: Apart from the international task facilitator who worked full time for nine months, short- term national consultants worked on Special Service Contracts for an additional nine months on the initiative. Additional opportunity costs were incurred as SURF international staff worked for about five months on the initiative. a Considering only the achievements in terms of tool development, the cost-benefit ratio compares very favourably to similar policy development undertakings at the regional level. If external consultants had been used for the exercise, few if any of the additional results, such as in-house capacity development and real organizational learning, would have occurred. The fundamental value added of the practice approach is that it connects abstract knowledge to action \u2013 this task cannot be outsourced. 32 The sustainability of the AP-A2J initiative as well as the impact and effects of the initiative can be difficult to gauge. The main challenge is in maintaining the momentum of the community of practice, with its attendant benefits for ownership and capacity development. Many original community members have dispersed to different UNDP country offices including outside the region and some members continue to incorporate the human rights-based approach into their work in their new capacities. However, the country assessments have identified that sustainability of A2J interventions continues to be the biggest concern for UNDP offices and the national counterparts. The AP-A2J initiative, at face value, has all the elements necessary to ensure sustainability of its interventions.

Especially since there is as yet no indication that the human rights-based approach to access to justice has gained ground within UNDP at the corporate level, it is necessary that the initiative continue building the momentum from the bottom up. Some notable opportunities to ensure that human rights are mainstreamed into access to justice work globally include - the 2008-2011 Strategic Plan, the Global Justice Programme and the Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor (CLEP) initiative. If opportunities to capitalize on the groundwork established by the AP-A2J initiative continue to be missed, the positive impact of the initiative may well fade and with it, the opportunity for serious engagement on the human rights-based approach to development. Ownership Ownership has been highlighted as the strongest aspect of the initiative. The initial stage of the initiative, before the involvement of external partners, provided an opportunity to consolidate internal resources and build capacities. Staff involved in the initiative felt connected with fellow practitioners and empowered to work professionally on access to justice issues. Even staff not part of the core team expressed feeling inspired by the initiative - whether by participating in the visioning or learning workshops or else by using the Practitioner\u2019s Guide. Many practitioners within and outside the initiative have noted that AP-A2J can be considered one of the most successful development of a community of practice within UNDP. Several practitioners have praised the initiative for empowering them with knowledge and skills to work in an area where they had little prior knowledge. In some cases, partly due to the personalities involved in coordinating the initiative, it has been described as an absorbing process and the expression of \u201ca family\u201d community of practice was mentioned. Most practitioners listed the following as the ingredients for success: a clear mandate; unity behind human rights principles; and a joyful working environment. Indeed, most practitioners considered the process as important as the product and the process as contributing to a stronger product. For example, as part of the initiative, a writing retreat was held in Laos in 2004 where ten practitioners spent a week immersed in developing the drafts of the Practitioner\u2019s Guide. The intensive inter-personal experiences where people with different experiences and competencies worked together to produce a single product was seen as a valuable exercise in itself in learning from one another and contributing to the development of a practical tool. One of the most fruitful strategies used in terms of developing ownership over the initiative was to invite practitioners for short fellowships at the regional SURFs to research specific topics under the guidance of a more experienced resource person. This was effective not only as a source of essential research for the initiative, but also helped to foster a sense of ownership and investment in the initiative among practitioners involved in the exchange. From the country assessments, it is possible to see that there is a high degree of commitment among national partners, state institutions, civil society organizations and project staff. Having learned by doing, many report feeling empowered to advance the human rights-based approach to A2J (though in some cases they raise doubts and perception of the human rights-based approach as a foreign concept, e.g. Sri Lanka). In Indonesia, the government is leading the agenda and has developed a National Strategy for A2J that Sustainability 33 Regional Assessment has been integrated into its mid-term development plan, and will be taken further in sector plans and local-level planning processes. The AP-A2J initiative benefited from a core team and members who had a good blend of competencies - managerial rigor, analytical substantive capacity, passion and commitment to work on access to justice and human rights issues, and leadership skills capable of energizing and developing a free spirit within the whole community. Despite a few constructive clashes \u2013 the result of strong dedication and commitment \u2013 the experience was a fertile one that led to something bigger than expected. A key resource person who was widely considered the \u2018soul\u2019 of the initiative was Amparo Tomas who worked full time on developing the initiative, providing substantive guidance and steering the community of practice in its initial phases. Her passion and unique and valuable energizing force helped in bringing dozens of persons from different countries together.

The danger of losing an empowered and capacitated team and the chance to build on its success is a very real concern that warrants careful consideration for the future of the initiative. Capacity Development Despite the successful capacity development among practitioners involved in the initiative, staff at the country level still confronted considerable complexity in designing and implementing a human rights-based approach to A2J projects. Most of this staff ended up learning by doing, and learning from mistakes. Although this approach did yield extensive capacity gains in offices that developed and implemented A2J projects, those gains came at the expense of overwhelming and exhausting the project staff. In most countries it was difficult to assess the capacity development dimension of the projects, which are still ongoing and have had no comprehensive impact evaluation. However, there were positive indications of enhanced project staff capacity on the human rights-based approach. Capacity development initiatives targeted key stakeholders, such as the Grama Niladaris in Sri Lanka or the prison officers and civil society organizations in Indonesia. In most cases projects targeted capacity development of both duty bearers and claim holders, with the balance tilted somewhat to the demand side (claim holders). For instance, in Cambodia, the project has made significant efforts to develop the capacities of right holders while capacity development for duty bearers has been addressed only to a limited extent and mostly focused at the local level. The same is true in Indonesia, where LEAD is mostly targeting claim holders and there is less focus on duty bearers (although some measures are now being introduced to improve this). In most cases, the capacity of implementing partners was overestimated. Projects would have benefited from prior capacity assessments as recommended as part of step by step process discussed in the Practitioner\u2019s Guide. However, these did not usually take place often due to time constraints. Sri Lanka is now in the process of preparing a capacity assessment for the main (and only) state provider of legal aid, the Legal Aid Commission. Some key conclusions on capacity development a Capacity development of UNDP practitioners: The process of AP-A2J developed the capacity of some 30 country office practitioners in the region. They have developed substantial knowledge on A2J and on instruments to apply it in policy and programme development. Learning channels have included the two workshops (which were designed in a participatory format, as learning rather than training events) and tasks through which practitioners were engaged in rethinking their own work (e.g., extraction of lessons). The network also reached some 80 members through electronic network activities, which resulted in additional learning and knowledge-sharing. a Capacity development of COs: With stronger individual capacity comes stronger capacity of country offices in A2J and a substantively stronger position within the donor community. Despite occasional shortcomings in individual staff capacity development, as a whole country offices in the region are much better equipped now (possibly more so than any other region) to formulate and implement a human rights-based approach to A2J projects. They are working on the ground to build capacities of right holders to seek and access remedies for their grievances, and of duty bearers to fulfil their obligations and be able to provide remedies. 34 Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative a Capacity development efforts and effects functioned reciprocally, bottom up and top down. The process of developing the Practitioner\u2019s Guide itself had significant impact on how UNDP approached A2J within the region. Through the AP-A2J, many programme officers were provided support and training and became involved in developing the guide based on field experience. In many cases, it was not just the development and application of the guide, but the development process itself, that generated momentum and resources for country offices to take on the agenda and develop projects based on principles that were then crystallized in the guide. As a result, some programmes that were developed during this time played a critical role in contributing to the guide and vice versa. a In at least three of the country assessments, UNDP programme and project staff felt they had limited exposure and training on a complex issue on which the programme guide proved too technical. They would have benefited from more regional exposure and more training. The assessment took note of several requests made to simplify the programme guide. The human rights-based approach is very specific and practical, and requires longer horizons to achieve lasting results at the country level.

Gradually more donors and developing partners are coming to recognize the shortcomings of the traditional rule of law approach. AUSAID, for example, is a partner that traditionally focused on institutional reform but is now, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, working more on A2J targeting the poor and more vulnerable. a Building on the experience of the UNDP Regional Centre and the Global Human Rights Strengthening Programme on developing and conducting capacity development workshops at the country level on applying the human rights-based approach to A2J, UNDP is developing a sustainable alternative grounded in institutions in the region to spearhead a regional capacity development initiative on the human rights-based approach and A2J. This initiative would focus on capacity building for ministries of justice, judiciaries, bar associations, legal aid bodies, civil society organizations etc. and could include activities such as training programmes and courses, development of communities of practice and networks and a roster of resource persons from the region. An idea in discussion at the RCB is the development of a regional consortium that would provide training on a human rights-based approach to A2J based on the programming guide. Partnerships Many external partners observed that global progress on advancing a human rights-based approach to A2J is very much a matter of policy dialogue and partnership-building among stakeholders. The AP-A2J has planted good seeds in this process, but a lot of work remains in external networking and advocacy. At the national level, policy dialogue for A2J involves political judgment. UNDP should clearly determine at the outset whether there is adequate political will to address justice for the poor and other disadvantaged groups before it supports such a programme. In Sri Lanka and Nepal, two conflict- affected environments, projects and assessments have been undermined by the lack of meaningful political will to address human rights and adapt rights-centred approaches to planning. Effective partnership-building for A2J is guided by three main considerations: (a) to ensure reforms are sustained in the long run, (b) to ensure the optimum use of resources through coordination and collaboration, and (c) to reach the most disadvantaged people. How this is done and the type of partners involved would vary according to country context. Most effective strategies link a range of different actors to address the problem, from government institutions to NGOs, universities and the communities themselves. Broad-based social and institutional support has often proven to have a significant impact. Senior officials in judicial institutions and other oversight bodies, such as national human rights institutions and Ombudsman offices, can function as champions of sensitive reform processes as they tend to enjoy greater independence and security of tenure. However, these same characteristics may also compromise transparency and accountability. Reform processes, therefore, also need to involve other government stakeholders and civil society organizations. A good example of this combination occurred in Indonesia, where there was adequate involvement of different stakeholders in the projects and at the national policy level. Note the contrast in Sri Lanka, however, where despite the 35 Regional Assessment broad coalition of national partners involved in all stages of the project, its results have failed to yield significant impact on state policy, most likely due to the lack of political will in regard to human rights. While the initiative did succeed in involving partners at different stages with good indicative results, concrete impact results are still not sufficiently in evidence (e.g., evidence of meaningful partnerships at the national level). From the beginning, the initiative aimed to complement in- house lessons with external ones. This approach made sense, as UNDP lessons were available only in a few areas in of the sub-practice (perhaps 10% of overall lessons). External partners were an effective resource for the initiative in areas where UNDP lacked sufficient expertise (e.g., police and prison reform, links between formal and traditional justice systems). AP-A2J, in cooperation with the relevant country offices, contracted external partners \u2013 academic institutions and NGOs \u2013 to conduct action research studies. Outsourcing proved to be very effective. The research was of a higher quality, particularly where the contracted institution and researchers had analytical as well as practical experience (this may have been the reason that some NGO papers were of better quality than academic ones). Outsourcing research to regional institutions well experienced in certain areas was a cost-effective way to capture additional lessons. Partnerships were sometimes more important than the quality of the papers: in two cases, AP-A2J", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a39c03ac-bae2-4647-bfe7-85c255665d7e": {"__data__": {"id_": "a39c03ac-bae2-4647-bfe7-85c255665d7e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-regional-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative: Regional Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-regional-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7b277d7906dd930c6be2d715eb162ba0d659df1e2d401dbd4e541c147356cbb1"}}, "hash": "7b277d7906dd930c6be2d715eb162ba0d659df1e2d401dbd4e541c147356cbb1", "text": "had to accept papers of limited quality for the sake of preserving the country office partnership with the external partners in question. Effective partnerships with donors require their engagement in frank discussions regarding programme design and implementation, and in identifying solutions. To a great extent the initiative did foster increased donor involvement in projects at national levels, broadening funding opportunities. However, more coherent strategies and better resource management are needed to sustain long-term support to A2J strategies. One strategy may be to involve donors early in conceptualizing programmes and inviting their full participation in formulation exercises. However, if the initiative did manage to achieve good results as to donors\u2019 involvement, the same conclusion cannot be reached regarding meaningful UNDP involvement at the corporate level. Moreover, despite the success of the initiative in bringing different partners to the table (especially civil society organizations at the national level31), UNDP is still perceived by many civil society partners to function in isolation and with traditional core partners (normally government partners). This is seen to limit UNDP involvement in certain sensitive issues that are often brought to light by non-state partners, especially in conflict or post-conflict contexts (such as Nepal and Sri Lanka). 31 For instance, it was often mentioned that UNDP works only with the more state-accepted, less controversial civil society organizations. 36 Due to its importance as a critical result for advancing a human rights-based approach and generating wider consensus around the human rights-based approach to A2J, special attention should be given to the capacity development and substantive programming results achieved using the Practitioner\u2019s Guide \u2018Programming for Justice: Access for All\u2019. Below are some examples from within and outside UNDP on how the guide has influenced A2J programming in the region. Practitioner\u2019s Guide: development phase As noted previously, the process of developing the Practitioner\u2019s Guide itself had significant impact on how UNDP approached A2J within the region. Through the AP-A2J, many programme officers received support and training and lent their field experience to developing the guide. In many cases, it was not just the development and application of the guide, but the development process itself, that generated momentum and resources for country offices to take on the agenda and develop projects based on principles that were then crystallized in the guide. As a result, some programmes that were developed during this time played a critical role in contributing to the guide and vice versa. Examples of A2J Assessments that took place as the Practitioner\u2019s Guide was being developed These assessments were being developed using a human rights-based approach as articulated by the guide. They sought to focus on disadvantaged groups and establish disaggregated baseline data so that programmes could be developed to better target those least able to access justice. Some details on the assessments are provided below: a India (perceptions of disadvantaged groups on access to justice) - In 2003, the AP-A2J commissioned a study on perceptions of access to justice by the poor and disadvantaged in India. The research was conducted using participatory methods and focused on three questions: How do disadvantaged people define \u2018access to justice\u2019? Which obstacles prevent them from seeking justice when they are subject to grievances? Which strategies have they developed to overcome them? a Cambodia (focus on women and indigenous groups) - Cambodia adopted a participatory approach to its access to justice assessment and has conducted workshops to inform people of their rights while gathering information on A2J and use of formal and informal justice systems. It also provided participants an opportunity to propose recommendations to the Council on Legal on Judicial Reform to include in the Legal and Judicial Reform Strategy (2004-2005). a Nepal (disadvantaged groups in conflict) - Nepal initiated a qualitative assessment to examine people\u2019s access to justice (with a particular focus on disadvantaged groups) during a conflict situation. The study sought to understand how the conflict has affected the justice system and impacted A2J at the community level, examining both formal and informal systems (2004- 2005). Unfortunately, for reasons presumably related to the sensitivity of the results within the conflict context, UNDP never published this study. a Indonesia A2J assessment \u2013 Indonesia undertook a comprehensive A2J assessment in five conflict-affected provinces as well as Banda Aceh including both desk and field research. The desk research focused on a literature review of the legal sector. Surveys were carried out on public perceptions of the justice system as well as court operations. Interviews and consultations were held with stakeholders, including Acehnese in Jakarta and NGOs. A review of court documents and relevant legislation was also done to get an overall picture", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "90c62280-b2fd-4a72-a04e-18ed95082a09": {"__data__": {"id_": "90c62280-b2fd-4a72-a04e-18ed95082a09", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-regional-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative: Regional Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-regional-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6eafd90bd09b65a327ad1aebb3d0581e2e9bf9950c94aceecc17e38c5d660285"}}, "hash": "6eafd90bd09b65a327ad1aebb3d0581e2e9bf9950c94aceecc17e38c5d660285", "text": "of perceptions of justice in conflict situations (2003). Country programmes and projects developed as part of the AP-A2J, whilst contributing to the development of the Practitioner\u2019s Guide. The programmes below partly draw on the assessments done in-country (see above) and also on the A2J framework of the guide. Many of these projects were developed by practitioners involved in writing sections of the guide. a Afghanistan \u2013 Access to Justice at the District Level - Two programmes in Afghanistan focus on the capacity of duty bearers to provide justice remedies and of claim Access to Justice Practitioner\u2019s Guide 37 Regional Assessment holders to demand those remedies. The guide advocates supporting justice institutions (judiciary, ministry of justice, attorney general\u2019s office and higher legal education institutions) to strengthen institutional capacity and implement reforms to ensure participation of poor and disadvantaged groups. It also calls for heightened awareness of district-level A2J for poor and marginalised groups through focus on traditional justice mechanisms and increased legal awareness and capacity of community and religious leaders. a Cambodia Access to Justice Project - Cambodia developed its programme on the basis of a comprehensive needs assessment carried out over one year and involving in its design and research the targeted disadvantaged groups (including indigenous peoples and women). The analysis of the results of this study has informed the design of the Cambodia A2J programme. a Sri Lanka Equal Access to Justice Project - This project focused on legal empowerment and increased access to justice for the disadvantaged mainly by providing human rights education and supporting legal aid. a Indonesia Access to Justice and Legal Empowerment Projects - Indonesia undertook a comprehensive approach to the A2J assessment in five provinces to understand the impact of conflict on formal and informal justice systems, as well as community perceptions and priorities on how to overcome barriers and increase access to justice and empower themselves to seek remedies. Based on this assessment, the Legal Empowerment and Assistance for the Disadvantaged Project (LEAD) was developed. This project focuses on increasing A2J by supporting legal services, legal capacity development and related development activities for the poor and other disadvantaged groups. a A separate programme drawing on an assessment on the effect of the conflict and tsunami was undertaken in Aceh and another programme was developed specifically for Aceh entitled Access to Justice for Peace and Development in Aceh. This programme was meant to support the peace process by enhancing citizens\u2019 access to justice and supporting the development of a more responsive justice system. Practitioner\u2019s Guide: post-development phase Subsequent to its publication, the following country programmes and projects were developed based on the Practitioner\u2019s Guide: a Maldives - In the context of the reforms initiated in 2008, the Maldives new country programme and Governance CPAP include a comprehensive project on A2J that was designed by applying principles and strategies in the guide. Among its initial activities the project will develop a comprehensive A2J assessment taking a human rights-based approach and following the A2J guide and experiences of other countries in the region. The assessment is receiving support from the DGTTF. a Nepal - As part of their new country programme 2008- 2010, UNDP Nepal has developed a new comprehensive A2J project. The strategic entry points for the project are to focus on the full A2J cycle, including normative protection, capacity to provide justice remedies and capacity to demand justice remedies and ensure the link between supply and demand; and to adopt a human rights-based approach by ensuring respect for international human rights standards, participation of claim holders and accountability of project interventions to claim holders in all phases of the project. a Sri Lanka - The Equal Access to Justice Project in Sri Lanka was reformulated in 2007 to focus more on conflict- affected and other disadvantaged groups in the country. a Timor-Leste \u2013 The Justice System Programme in Timor- Leste was fully evaluated and revised in 2008 to include a justice decentralization strategy and a large component dedicated to A2J and the interface between formal and informal justice systems. Conclusion The Practitioner\u2019s Guide has influenced and been influenced by a vast range of experiences from countries in the Asia- Pacific region. The tool itself and the process of developing the tool can be considered a good practice which has generated substantive results. The Practitioner\u2019s Guide is particularly impressive in conceptualizing the issues and in making the case for a step-by-step approach to practically developing and implementing justice programmes from a human rights-based perspective. However, it has been recommended that the guide (published in 2005) should be updated and made more user-friendly.

The guide has generated a great deal of interest in the region and has been translated, distributed in regional forums and circulated widely. It was disseminated to the members of the Asia-Pacific 38 Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative Judicial Forum and presented at the International Conference and Showcase on Judicial Reform in Manila in November 2006. The conference was organized by the Philippines Supreme Court and supported by UNDP, World Bank and Asia Development Bank among other donors. The delegations present consisted of Chief Justices from Asia and the Pacific and other countries (49 countries). The guide was formally presented and introduced as a best practice in terms of both its content and the knowledge management process. The conference was also a forum to discuss the creation of a high-level judicial reform network in the region. Thanks to the interest raised among participants in the well-documented community of practice approach to developing the guide, UNDP secured partnerships with the Supreme Court of the Philippines and the High Court and Federal Court of Australia, who formed the Secretariat for the Asia-Pacific Judicial Reform Forum, a network of judicial institutions in the region. The APJRF Secretariat and UNDP then partnered with the UN Democracy Fund to implement a two-year project designed using lessons from the AP-A2J initiative. The project is currently supporting the APJRF Secretariat to expand and sustain its network and to develop a volume of case studies of successful approaches to judicial reform based on regional experience. The guide was translated and/or reprinted in several countries (India, Indonesia, Nepal, Philippines, and Sri Lanka) and distributed to counterparts in government and civil society. The assessment mission noted that in several meetings with national counterparts in Sri Lanka and Indonesia, the guide was either on the table of interviewees or mentioned as a reference document in the national context. Staff of some of the access to justice projects suggested that the Practitioner\u2019s Guide\u2019s key messages could be simplified so that they could be more easily adapted to the different country contexts and better understood by national counterparts. They felt that adapting the current document to the local context and simplifying its messages required a lot of work. They highlighted the need for capacity development and training of access to justice project staff on the guide so that its content and spirit could be understood and consciously adapted to local circumstances rather than mechanically reproduced in designing and implementing A2J projects. Capacity development and training focused on \u2018unpacking\u2019 the guide would avoid the risk that its suggestions would be seen as prescriptions and applied without analyzing and tailoring responses to each specific context. The guide is meant to facilitate taking a human rights-based approach to justice, and its suggestions need to be adapted to each national context. It discusses general steps to be taken to determine country priorities, such as an assessment to target and identify disadvantaged groups in terms of A2J. As those groups vary from country to country, so too should the approaches and interventions to target vary. Experiences from the different projects applying the framework proposed in the guide underlined the importance of assessing the access to justice and human rights situation in a country and contextualizing responses. Many external partners also point to the influence of the guide as a policy tool. In an interview, the Director of International Development of the Canadian Bar Association described the guide as a critically important tool for advocacy with donors as well as for practical use for training programmes for their lawyers and international development projects in Laos and Vietnam. Quoting CBA: \u2018\u2026Being associated with UNDP and the Practitioner\u2019s Guide has given higher credibility to the development work of the CBA.\u2019 Other partners such as the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) have used the guide to develop their country programmes in Asia (Nepal and Thailand) and have translated part of the guide into Thai using their own resources. According to ICJ\u2019s Asia Pacific Programme: \u2018The ICJ Asia-Pacific Programme closely referred to the UNDP \u2018Practitioner\u2019s Guide to a Human Rights-Based Approach to Access to Justice\u2019 when developing its programme on \u2018Building local capacity to address impunity and promote access to justice and the rule of law in Thailand\u2019.

An extremely useful and, crucially, a practical tool towards implementation on the ground.\u2019 39 Much of the rich experience of the Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative, especially regarding process, has been captured and documented over time, benefiting the current assessment. This in itself remains a rare and commendable achievement for DGTTF-supported projects (and other UNDP interventions). At the country level, there is often a need to strengthen documentation of the work being done including lessons learned and case studies. UNDP as a whole would benefit from gathering lessons from country-level implementation such as innovative projects and processes using the human rights-based approach to A2J. One exception was Indonesia, where the programme manager did capture several lessons through almost three years of project implementation. Country offices are in the forefront of the approach right now and it is important to try and document positive as well as negative experiences to benefit the wider development community. This is critical to better inform policy development and programming. Indeed, the current assessment was itself a response to the need to document lessons from successful and less successful DGTTF-supported projects. As highlighted in the 2008 Evaluation of the Democratic Governance Thematic Trust Fund: \u2018The greatest weakness of DGTTF has been that UNDP HQ (in New York), the Regional and Country Offices, and DGTTF\u2019s donors have not learned as much as they might have from both the successful and unsuccessful projects (in a venture capital fund such as DGTTF, investors and the market learn as much from failure as from success).\u2019 The AP-A2J initiative is an exception since it placed a strong emphasis on knowledge management and was successful in documenting and disseminating its lessons throughout the process (this assessment further contributes to this effort). Generally speaking, DGTTF has been successful in fostering innovative projects that have led to larger programmes and projects aimed at making major improvements in democratic governance. This is notably the case in Indonesia, where DGTTF support launched a flagship project and helped make UNDP a lead agency within national and international partners in A2J. It also can be seen in Sri Lanka, where Phase II of the Equal Access to Justice Project is just starting. In India, DGTTF was critical to trigger the Strategic Access to Justice Initiative (SAJI) signed by UNDP with the Department of Justice which produced a set of reports on five themes: the formal court system with focus on lower courts; the informal justice system; the criminal justice system (police, prison and prosecution); legal empowerment; and legal aid. In Cambodia, despite constraints at the national level, the Peace Tables, capacity development of IP elders, new ADR institutions and community awareness programmes around domestic violence and support for legal aid for women and indigenous people all had positive impact on target groups. Finally, the regional initiative that largely influenced the design and implementation of the above country experiences was considered the most innovative example of a regional DGTTF- supported intervention, given its unique practice approach process and the substantive results that have contributed to promoting a human rights-based approach to A2J in the regional and global development agenda. The regional assessment team also concluded that DGTTF supports innovative projects that are catalytic. Although DGTTF funding to most projects has been small (the largest contribution being USD 221,000 to a project in Cambodia), in most cases this funding has been instrumental in attracting TRAC funds and donor funds. In Indonesia, the DGTTF catalyzed the project and generated trust within the country office to invest almost USD 1 million in TRAC funds. This visioning of the country office has proved beneficial, as LEAD is now a USD 10 million donor-supported programme. And in Cambodia, DGTTF funds were also important in mobilizing USD 2 million from the Spanish Agency. Most projects assessed have since scaled into larger programmes; their innovations have helped position UNDP in the donor community and amongst governance partners. National and international staff value DGTTF, despite its short time frame and somewhat taxing administrative burden. A more effective thematic sharing of experiences would raise project quality. Lessons learned 40 Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative One critical lesson learned takes us back to the starting point of this section. A failure to document results (positive and negative lessons) exacerbates knowledge management problems. The AP-A2J is one notable exception, and can provide good examples for more proactive assembly, analysis and dissemination of project experience.

Funds have also been set aside for Regional Service Centres to work on codifying DGTTF projects. The current assessment is one of the first attempts at this. Generally speaking, DGTTF can play an even greater role as a sponsor of innovation by leveraging UNDP\u2019s position at the forefront of democratic governance breakthroughs, by safeguarding its reputation for objectivity and good relations with governments and governance institutions, and with increased donor support. The specific AP-A2J lessons learned highlighted below can also contribute to this strategic positioning of DGTTF. AP-A2J process and results Codified process-oriented lessons 32 The core lesson from the AP-A2J experience is that while practice development may be a complex and time-consuming process, it produces tailored and relevant tools, and enhances the capacity to apply knowledge. Technically, policy advisors or external experts in isolation can also develop tools and knowledge products, but in these cases the result is often a document, which is informative, but not truly capturing practical know-how. A practice approach is critical to ensure that knowledge produced is \u2018shared\u2019 rather than \u2018shelved\u2019. Specific Lessons: 1. Results-oriented communities of practice are a powerful approach to knowledge development: The AP-A2J experience is an important validation of the practice approach to knowledge development. Involving practitioners from the field enhances the chances of consolidating a policy position and tools in a sub-practice that is relevant to the field while developing the individual and organizational capacity to translate it into action. 2. Relevant knowledge is difficult to find and develop: Much of the knowledge that UNDP practitioners need is applied knowledge to be gained when substance meets process. It is difficult to find externally. However, UNDP has not systematically codified its knowledge in the past: it resides in the people, not in the institution. This is why development of applied knowledge should rely considerably on in-house expertise. 3. Practice-building was more resource-intensive than anticipated: Meaningful knowledge sharing, codification and development through a practice approach, is immensely time-consuming. Lessons are rarely readily available in documents; more often they are dispersed in many sources, and need to be screened and adapted to be useful for knowledge development. Another lengthy exercise is in implementing an organizational learning and capacity development process, distilling raw inputs and setting a policy position backed by useful tools. AP-A2J itself required a total of 2.5 years to establish the community of practice and launch its knowledge products including developing, publishing and launching the Practitioner\u2019s Guide. 4. Funding is necessary, but not from the beginning: Communities of practitioners evolve organically and don\u2019t necessarily have to follow a grand plan supported by resources right away. When funding was not forthcoming at the start, AP-A2J focused on a number of low-cost activities, such as the set up of a core group, a management structure, a network and a web page. Funding opportunities were pursued throughout the initiative in an effort to respond flexibly to emerging requirements. Practitioners even reported that limited initial funding may have prompted efforts to consolidate knowledge and instead focus primarily on demand- driven interventions. 5. Sub-practice as unit of analysis is useful: The analytical unit of sub-practice is a viable entry point for an initiative such as A2J that shared, codified and developed knowledge in a field that was relatively new for UNDP. As a result of the learning process during the initiative, the analysis penetrated increasingly complex dimensions and led to the successive disaggregation of a once \u2018plain\u2019 playing field. A follow-up knowledge- building exercise may focus on a few clearly defined key 32 Most of these lessons have been extracted from the AP-Rights and Justice Initiative, Lessons from Operationalizing the Practice Concept, March 2004 and from the AP-A2J presentation at the communities of practice Learning and Training Workshop, Colombo, January 2006. Some of these lessons were built further with testimonials from specific assessment interviews with practitioners; new lessons also came out of these interviews. 41 Regional Assessment problems of A2J knowledge areas rather than the whole sub-practice, an indication of the degree of particularity as achieved. The challenge with a narrowly defined theme, however, is to mobilize the interest of a sufficiently large number of practitioners working in different country situations. 6.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8d33304-192d-45fb-8c61-73e64d8fbbb7": {"__data__": {"id_": "f8d33304-192d-45fb-8c61-73e64d8fbbb7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-regional-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative: Regional Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-regional-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "63adce73658cf3e2bc59e8e8ca2d29fc73de956361289c3e22a3652eb980dc2a"}, "2": {"node_id": "35a87812-8d58-4fab-ae27-43c0ead95317", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-regional-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2d19114f878a330ddb4a945cb364dc0bb82a3a1a9d557b45c849ed497ac37ea4"}}, "hash": "f7960a682cf2ac1db3dd9a2d665c964854fcabe24e7f9dd5f7cb2d394a399bdf", "text": "6.

While the AP-A2J experience shows that regional networks can flourish and produce results, participation could have even been more extensive if knowledge-sharing were considered part of the work routine rather than an \u2018add-on\u2019. Better incentives are needed here. 7. Results-oriented networks need a clear conceptual framework: A clear conceptual framework motivates practitioners to contribute and to achieve specific results. This was evidenced by the experience of extracting case study write-ups. With proper guidelines, a facilitation mechanism and a clear time frame, a number of practitioners participated in the exercise. This becomes even more important when contributions are solicited from a variety of participants that interact with each other (mainly) virtually. 8. Strong facilitation is needed: It is unrealistic to expect the facilitation of a complex process such as AP-A2J (especially of the outputs include the production of distilled tools) to be done as a side job. The process should be spearheaded by a UNDP manager or policy advisor, but needs to be backed up by a full-time facilitator with relevant experience within UNDP, particularly in the field, and a thorough understanding of the subject. Because knowledge-development initiatives are dynamic processes, it is difficult to predict from the outset the actual dimensions of research and the type of tools and products that need to be developed. In the case of AP-A2J, the task facilitator got overburdened with the production of drafts, research, etc., that distracted her from facilitating electronic discussions. This harmed some of the components of the initiative, such as electronic discussions. Given the unpredictable nature of communities of practice, it is important to respond swiftly and flexibly to emerging resource requirements. 9. Bonding is important for thriving communities of practice: AP-A2J would not have led to the same achievements without face-to-face meetings that, apart from clarifying the conceptual framework and fostering a common objective, were also about building trust through human interaction. This trust can encourage participants to share information on an electronic network. 10. Ownership is necessary: Another precondition for working together in the primarily electronic realm is ownership over the exercise. The AP-A2J experience demonstrates that a facilitation approach is more successful than an \u2018expert\u2019 approach to build ownership. Apart from using a facilitation approach, face-to-face meetings and engaging practitioners in the tasks of the initiative served to build ownership. UNDP practitioners were driving the process, while external expertise was tapped only for specific purposes and as a last resort. 11. Knowledge development must have a delivery mechanism: If one trusts the premise of knowledge management theory that knowledge is primarily in people\u2019s heads and therefore difficult to codify or transfer, it is essential that a process of capacity building includes elements of connection rather than only codification. With AP-A2J, workshops were by far the most important elements of capacity development in drawing on field experience and developing practitioner capacity. 12. Knowledge needs should be assessed before codifying: Because of the vastness of development knowledge, it is essential to link codification to specific needs. Hence, a results-based initiative ought to define what knowledge is needed, identify whether it is available within the organization, and identify how it can be provided. During the visioning workshop it became clear that the knowledge and capacity side of the practice 42 Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative approach was more demanding than anticipated; knowledge was fragmented and difficult to scan so practitioners opted to scan experiences from external partners, which led to the following lesson. 13. Knowledge codification should take into account external lessons: From the very beginning the initiative aimed to complement in-house lessons with external ones. This approach was justified, as UNDP lessons were available only in a few areas of the sub-practice (perhaps 10% of overall lessons). 14. Not only experts can contribute: The AP-A2J experience demonstrates that in applied knowledge development there is often no clear dichotomy between \u2018novices\u2019 and \u2018experts\u2019.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "938fff5a-ad23-4e65-a708-5e9be4b587f7": {"__data__": {"id_": "938fff5a-ad23-4e65-a708-5e9be4b587f7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-regional-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative: Regional Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-regional-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2101dd7482d9b2b585374ec2fdb05877c16752010ce78f79083fd5a76af5aa93"}, "2": {"node_id": "f1a265e5-36a7-491a-ab48-cdd11bdd8657", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-regional-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a506cd4960b39e4b3fa22606f9f4d88e5e2396ea416ded399c421a3553685442"}}, "hash": "daec9e916ec79b575f96d85f803d6423693e5c7c1fb10731a94190130dcff078", "text": "Knowledge that is needed is often \u2018practical\u2019 and \u2018analytical\u2019, where practitioners other than substantive experts can contribute significantly. 15.

Also, an initiative such as this required a range of different competences, from strict managerial skills to analytical rigor and open thinking. 16. The bottom-up approach inherent in the human rights-based approach proved successful: The initiative grew from within with no corporate UNDP support. This is a good example for country-level replication, as the approach tends to generate increased demand for justice with the potential to trigger effects at the national policy level. Tool development The following principles guided the challenging and time- consuming process of tool development: a Thorough assessment of UNDP\u2019s knowledge needs at the start; a Reducing knowledge uptake time among practitioners; a Rigorous prioritization and screening of resources; a High-quality analysis; a Optimization of already existing resources, avoiding reinventing the wheel. In the end several lessons were extracted through the difficult process. When the community of practice was launched, few other communities of practice existed and practitioners had more time to participate in it. As the number of communities of practice has grown, commitment among practitioners has been diluted. Still, the A2J initiative has produced several tools that have become familiar to many country offices in the region. In a May 2009 survey33 on the Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative (annexed to this report), 75% of respondents claimed to have used the most relevant tools that came out as one of the results of the initiative; 8.3% were familiar with the tools but had never used them; and 16.7% were not familiar. The Practitioner\u2019s Guide was considered the best tool by the majority of stakeholders interviewed by the assessment at both the regional and country office levels. The same can be concluded from the survey results. For example, one of the respondents noted that, \u201cThe Practitioner\u2019s Guide is an excellent tool to charter the waters and is very innovative in this field.\u201d 1. Electronic network: One should not overestimate the power of e-networks. They may be efficient for queries and dissemination of information, but may not be adequate for the production of knowledge. Participation in the e-network was not always satisfactory. It regularly picked up after face-to-face workshops, but there were also periods where traffic was low. This may be due to a lack of incentives to contribute (despite efforts to build ownership and trust among community members), the absence of a clear agenda (workshops tended to be used to discuss specific topics), and the competing daily tasks of community members. 2. Workshop approach for knowledge and product development: For sharing experiences and overall knowledge development, it appears to be more effective to bring people together in results-oriented workshops. This was the case with both the visioning workshop and the Practitioner\u2019s Guide writing workshop, that were considered cornerstones of the process for their 33 The assessment didn\u2019t request practitioners to identify respective country offices. From some of the responses provided, it appears that not only Asia country offices responded. There is at least one respondent from another region that is in the process of launching an A2J programme. 43 Regional Assessment participatory approach, clear role distribution, non- hierarchical atmosphere and action-oriented agenda. The writing workshop was a rich experience where a handful of practitioners came together for a week to share knowledge and draft chapters of the guide. Contributors discovered that although much of the material had already been shared among the group, the process of writing it up was too time-consuming to be integrated into their daily country office routines. 3. Case study production requires strict, clear guidance: Case studies aimed to capture in-house UNDP knowledge (lessons learned from experience) on A2J issues and to develop practitioner capacity. However, the process of extracting lessons itself required some degree of capacity development. Case studies tended to focus on reporting achievements rather than on learning from failures, which had been the core of the exercise. The write-up process entailed virtual groups of four practitioners, each tasked with conducting a peer review of advanced drafts. These peer reviews did not occur as expected, possibly because of capacity gaps or the time involved in the task. 4. External outsourcing of research and case studies proved an effective strategy for quality control and partnership engagement: The research was of a higher quality, particularly where the contracted institution and researchers had analytical as well as practical experience. Outsourcing research to regional institutions well experienced in certain areas was a cost-effective way to capture additional lessons. It was also a good way of involving NGOs and academia in the initiative. 5.

It has been recommended that the guide be simplified where possible or divided into separate volumes. In some cases, it may be useful to draw on the guide and develop resources particularly aimed at national partners. With a \u2018new generation\u2019 of UNDP practitioners working on justice and human rights, it may be possible to bring them together in a joint, results-oriented exercise (potentially as part of the rejuvenation of the regional community of practice) to review the Practitioner\u2019s Guide and find ways to make it more user-friendly as well as adapt it to different national contexts. Human rights-based approach to A2J programming The human rights-based approach puts people at the centre of the development process and seeks to analyze underlying problems that prevent people from exercising their rights. It examines the roles of both duty-bearers in fulfilling their obligations and rights-holders in claiming their rights. A focus on disadvantaged groups seeks a more direct impact on poverty eradication and other Millennium Development Goals. Though the causality link between the human rights- based approach to access to justice and its impact on poverty reduction is sometimes questioned, the explicit focus of A2J programmes on empowering the poor and the disadvantaged in realizing their rights (including economic, social and cultural rights) cannot be ignored. This report concludes that adopting a human rights-based approach in analyzing access to justice for poverty reduction improved problem identification, identification of target groups, scope of assessment and identification of entry points for capacity development. The country assessments held in Cambodia, India, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka also contribute to this conclusion. Specific Lessons:34 A human rights-based approach can help to do \u2018better development\u2019 and is relatively simple to apply in programming, but: 1. The human rights-based approach is still evolving and it cannot be viewed as a prescriptive methodology. A \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach can lead to damaging results. The guide itself, while providing a general framework on how to apply the human rights- based approach in access to justice programming, notes the importance of assessing the access to justice and human rights situation in a country and contextualizing responses. In some cases, however, the guide\u2019s suggestions were seen as prescriptions and applied without analyzing and tailoring responses appropriately to the specific context. For example, the UNDP Sri Lanka Equal Access to Justice project expressed concern that the rote application of the capacity development strategies suggested in the guide overstretched the project and diluted its focus. 34 Some of these lessons were extracted and/or adapted from Lessons on Applying a Human Rights-Based Approach to Development Programming, a Case Study from the UNDP Asia Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative, April 2004. Many were prompted by evidence from the country assessments. 44 Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative In Indonesia, the UNDP access to justice project sought to adopt the human rights-based approach from the inception of the project. In Timor-Leste, where institutions are being rebuilt after years of conflict, AP-A2J approach has been introduced during project revisions (i.e., not following the 10-step approach of the guide). Both cases have yielded some success. A2J and the human rights- based approach are not linear mechanical processes; the guidelines merely provide an analytical framework for developing A2J programmes, to be adapted to local context. To this end, much capacity development is still needed among practitioners, governance institutions and civil society working for A2J. 2. The impact of a human rights-based approach on poverty eradication remains to be assessed. A human rights-based approach demands assessment of the impact of programmes on the most disadvantaged segments of target groups, and on other disadvantaged groups who may be indirectly affected. Projects need to improve monitoring and evaluation frameworks to allow for evaluation by the direct beneficiaries and civil society organizations. In the meantime, the human rights-based approach should not be presented as a development \u2018panacea\u2019. While its technical value added to development programming may improve potential for effectiveness, the extent to which such potential is materialized remains to be assessed. 3. A human rights-based approach offers better protection of poor people by ruling out harmful trade-offs:35 The most common trade-offs encountered in development work involve compromising needs, equality and liberty for the sake of economic growth (Donelly, 1989). The human rights-based approach pays more attention to exclusion, discrimination, disparities and injustices, and emphasizes basic rights. 4.

A human rights-based approach to A2J prioritizes the ability to seek and obtain remedy for grievances, through formal and informal justice mechanisms, in conformity with basic human rights. Currently, A2J is often limited to people\u2019s ability to use public and private sector justice services. In a human rights-based approach, justice is seen as a social process, not just a legal one. A human rights-based approach better protects people from abuses of power and can be used as a tool to challenge those in power. It can stimulate social movements and mobilize civil society as a means to accountability of duty bearers. 5. The human rights-based approach does not guarantee the realization of human rights, a task that requires both willingness and capacity: UNDP support needs to take into account the existing political context in a county. In many situations political will is critical to implementing human rights-based programmes. The human rights-based approach is also useful in highlighting risks and conflict, which are often overlooked. The human rights lens sheds light on the potential conflict involved in development and empowering processes more generally, and provides concrete guidance to deal with them. Using this approach, UNDP can carve out a niche where it can support justice systems in combating the culture of impunity for perpetrators of human rights violations. The human rights-based approach calls for UNDP to clearly repudiate human rights violations and demand accountability of perpetrators. In times of conflict this position is difficult, and often UNDP, in its attempt to remain neutral, misses opportunities to take a more proactive stance regarding human rights. For instance, UNDP Sri Lanka can seek to enhance the justice system to better protect and promote human rights by explicitly focusing on protecting fundamental rights and providing means of redress for cases concerning disappearances and abduction, illegal detention, torture, extra-judicial executions and gender- based violence. Similarly, UNDP Nepal, can take the lead in ensuring that the report of an assessment on A2J in conflict situations supported by them is published despite the potential sensitivity of the report (despite the fact that the report, also commissioned by UNDP, has not been released for three years). In many cases, this approach causes frustration among partners in what they see as UNDP\u2019s reluctance to take a stand on and lack of commitment to addressing core human rights issues. 35 Gready, P., Ensor J., Vide, Reinventing Development? Translating Rights- Based Approaches from Theory into Practice. 36 Normally the judicial operators tend to fall in this category and remain somewhat resistant to A2J applying the human rights-based approach to access to justice initiatives. 45 Regional Assessment 6. A human rights-based approach requires a practitioners\u2019 deeper understanding of the impact of inequalities on development, human rights norms and conflict management. It also calls for developing UNDP practitioners\u2019 mediation and communication skills, particularly with disadvantaged groups. Managing risks and overcoming resistance are critical for effective A2J programmes. Programmes should identify not only potential benefits for target groups, but also potential risks as a consequence of the programme (e.g., domestic violence repercussions against women who become more assertive in claiming their rights). Strategies to minimize such risks should be built into the programme. 7. The human rights-based approach has good potential to improve accountability systems, but realizing such potential requires improving existing programming tools and other capacities at the UNDP country office level: In particular, the UNDP needs to focus on developing its capacities to reach disadvantaged people and communicating with them effectively. Implementing a human rights-based approach calls for simplifying existing tools (e.g., logical frameworks, programming guidelines, indicator systems) and better capturing the process of development (e.g. through the inclusion of process indicators). Better risk analysis and programme accountability mechanisms are needed, as well as innovative ways to ensure that disadvantaged people\u2019s voices are heard and responded to. All this requires substantive changes in UNDP\u2019s assessment processes, monitoring and evaluation systems, partnership and networking strategies. In most country assessments, it was noted that projects lack accountability, feedback mechanisms and monitoring and evaluation frameworks. In Cambodia, one of the issues identified was the lack of mechanisms for ensuring credibility and fostering trust in ADR institutions. There was no oversight over work quality. In Sri Lanka the lack of baselines, indicators and a monitoring and evaluation framework hampered project achievements. One exception, however, is Indonesia, where the team has developed a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation framework which is an essential part of the grant mechanism. 8.

Their active participation is essential to analyzing the scope of A2J problems, obstacles and solutions. A human rights- based approach considers the right of disadvantaged people to determine their own solutions to poverty not as mere rhetoric, but as programmatic guidance. This guidance finds obvious resistance at national and international levels, particularly from those who benefit the most when disadvantaged people do not participate. Furthermore, disadvantaged people generally lack the capacities to participate meaningfully through existing channels. A lesson from all country assessments is that conducting people-centred research and assessments prior to programme development yields more meaningful involvement of target groups in the process of identifying the most adequate responses to their grievances. Through a participatory research study in India, AP-A2J sought perspectives from poor and disadvantaged people to understand how they perceive justice, what obstacles they face and how they handle them. AP-A2J incorporated these perspectives into the elaboration of the A2J model. Although the study cannot be considered representative of marginalized populations in the region as a whole, disadvantaged people\u2019s perspectives occupied a central role in the analysis. In Sri Lanka, the project had a hard time identifying whose lives it was trying to improve and what for, because of a lack of qualitative (or quantitative) information on the most disadvantaged and their grievances. In Indonesia, the A2J assessment that led to the report Justice for All was critical in identifying and addressing the real issues facing the most disadvantaged as reflected in the National A2J Strategy. 9. Meaningful human rights-based A2J entails financial and time commitments: A human rights- based approach emphasizes the process of development. Some key development results naturally take time, but development cooperation functions under growing financial and time constraints to produce concrete results. A focus on process should not be done at the expense of results, but sidelining process given very limited time and resources can lead to overestimating a programme\u2019s potential. 10. Need to strengthen existing human rights framework: The human rights framework, including civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, reflects humankind\u2019s fundamental achievement in protecting human dignity through legal norms \u2013 but it requires implementation. It can be rendered more legally concrete at national and international levels. Furthermore, the 46 Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative existing legal framework should be more actively protected, as human rights are invariably threatened by situations of violent conflict, and national and international security risks threaten existing human rights safeguards. 11. Need to find the right balance between targeting duty bearers and right holders. Most of the projects were found to concentrate on claim holders and grassroots-level work. This has hampered in some cases broader policy achievement in promoting A2J. In Cambodia, the project has achieved significant results on the demand side of A2J by empowering and significantly raising awareness among targeted groups (mainly women and indigenous people). The project has addressed the supply side only by assisting the government in setting up ADR mechanisms and capacity development of these institutions. In Sri Lanka the project in its first phase focused mostly on legal awareness and providing services to disadvantaged groups, through mobile clinics for internally displaced persons or community-based legal aid desks. Only recently has the project focused on more institutionalized capacity assessment and development for the Legal Aid Commission and on policy advocacy. In Indonesia, the LEAD project clearly targets mostly claim holders, and is now turning its attention to the supply side to foster sustainability at the local government level. 12. Building on the prior lessons, while targeted training on a human rights-based approach for A2J for different stakeholders is important to generate momentum on human rights standards and principles focusing explicitly on marginalized and disadvantaged groups, A2J interventions must ensure that the capacity of existing structures is enhanced to respond adequately to increases in claim holder demand. To this end, training must be complemented with more targeted institutional capacity development. 13. In human rights-based A2J projects it is important to stick to basics and not to strive for the optimum: A good A2J project reflects the perceptions of the most disadvantaged groups and helps empower them to advocate for change on their own behalf. Human rights- based programming is most effective when it is simple and accessible to practitioners working in the field and national partners. 14.

Projects enjoyed greater success in countries where this combination of elements was present, in addition to a range of external contributing factors. 15. The human rights-based approach to A2J would benefit from more research on the interface between informal and formal justice mechanisms: Human rights-based A2J efforts should identify links between the two systems and focus more on ADR. Experience indicates that service providers and beneficiaries alike prefer to resolve disputes outside the court system. 16. Some A2J projects tend to focus much on legal aid for fundamental rights issues, which tend to emphasize individual rights as opposed to group rights or public interest litigation to achieve broader social impact. Individual cases have limited ability to empower and secure justice among larger groups of marginalized and vulnerable communities. In conflict countries like Sri Lanka, this limits the power of a human rights-based approach to A2J. 47 The advancement of the human rights-based approach to A2J faces serious constraints and resistance both within and outside UNDP as it affects sensitive power relations. One challenge may be that the approach is layered and can be difficult to communicate, explain, and apply. It is often relegated to \u2018window dressing\u2019, mentioned in a token manner in documents, when its real power obviously lies in its application. The approach can also encounter resistance from national governments. But the human rights-based approach should be perceived as an opportunity, not only for the population but also for politicians: those who deliver will be re-elected. UNDP country offices may be wary of adopting the approach, or need to frame it with care. Much work remains in raising awareness among governmental counterparts. Development research over the past few decades has consistently highlighted a wide range of interrelated factors that contribute to poverty. These include low growth of income, inequality, social exclusion and entitlement failures, inadequate social services, high population growth, environmental degradation, economic inefficiency, social and political instability and vulnerability to debt, disease and natural disasters. Any improvements in A2J for the poor must be linked with the general problem of development at large and this is a human rights issue. Despite numerous references to human rights principles and approaches in the legal-empowerment discourse,37 the conceptual link between legal empowerment and human rights remains unclear. Moreover, given the relative popularity of human rights-based approaches to development and poverty reduction there is already some confusion over how and to what extent this and the legal-empowerment approach relate to, and perhaps complement, each other. Dan Banik suggests that, despite persistent scepticism over the human rights-based approach, (particularly around the legal enforceability of social, economic and cultural rights), one way of strengthening the legal-empowerment approach would be to view it as a subset of the broader human rights- based discourse. This approach has been embraced by Arjun Sengupta (2008). Viewing legal empowerment as an integral part of the human rights discourse allows for the use of existing international human rights instruments that have been largely accepted by the international community. This includes the idea that the obligation to fulfil the rights of the poor transcends national boundaries and extends to all countries that have ratified the human rights treaties and conventions. This is an important angle to consider for the future of the human rights-based approach. Some practical suggestions for the way forward: 1. Conduct independent evaluations of the impact of a human rights-based approach to A2J in countries that have been adopting the approach for a longer time (for instance, through a clients\u2019 survey). It is important to ensure that the achievements or failures of the human rights-based approach are measured from a client\u2019s perspective. Only with proof of impact can UNDP sustain this approach over the long term and shore up accountability. 2. Reenergize the community of practice by bringing practitioners together to simplify the Practitioner\u2019s Guide. The guide was a product of a collective exercise by multidisciplinary teams, and this major achievement needs to be built on. Currently the guide may be too linear (e.g., its 10-step approach) and rigid to adapt to all situations. This exercise could coincide with the reactivation of the network, for which full-time dedicated facilitation is essential. Though the original core community members have dispersed, performing results-oriented tasks may be a way to build momentum among newcomers. Recommendations 37 Banik D., Implementing Human Rights Based Development, 2007. 48 Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative 3. Ensure that the human rights-based approach and its tools, namely the revised guide, will provide better orientation to law-making.

The guide should also provide programming tips to link projects at CO level on law reform to the human rights-based approach. 4. Forge closer links between traditional and formal justice. It is important that UNDP do more to help integrate human rights principles into informal justice mechanisms. The initiative should devote more attention to public interest litigation.38 5. Pool regional resources and expertise to foster more capacity development and training. A regional consortium on applying the human rights-based approach to access to justice is a good way forward. This initiative would focus on capacity development for ministries of justice, judiciaries, bar associations, legal aid bodies and civil society organizations, and could offer training programmes and courses, develop communities of practice and networks, and maintain a roster of resources. Reaching out to partners that may be currently applying human rights-based approaches under other names will be key. There is a need to decentralize and bring the approach more to the national level, with a longer-term perspective and broader involvement. Training (including of trainers) will be critical in this regard. 6. To promote UNDP corporate interest in the HRBA, the Global Human Rights Strengthening Programme and the Global Thematic Programme for Justices should be fully utilized by the regional and national initiatives. 7. Semantic divisions among legal empowerment for the poor, justice for the poor, access to justice, the human rights-based approach etc. can frustrate the broader development agenda. UNDP should strive to ensure that legal empowerment initiatives are based on the foundation of A2J as defined in the Practitioner\u2019s Guide established according to a human rights-based approach. The RCB could take the lead in producing a second-generation toolkit focusing on legal empowerment and HRBA. 8. The A2J initiative did not wait for corporate guidance to flourish. It was a bottom-up process and this approach succeeded. There must be commitment to a set of human rights principles and to a process. One clear lesson from this initiative \u2013 a lesson in empowerment \u2013 is that dedication and commitment can inspire far better results than hierarchical, top-down or state-centred arguments that rely heavily on senior managers or governments to sanction one approach or another. 38 Gargarella, R., Domingo, P., Roux, T., Courts and Social Transformation in New Democracies: an institutional voice for the poor? 49 Regional Assessment Annex I \u2013 List of codified tools UNDP, Access to Justice Case Studies from the Asia-Pacific Region, Codification of Case Studies, Bangkok, 2004.

This initiative was supposed to be innovative and catalytic in nature to strengthen democratic governance in the region. In April 2009 RCB commissioned an assessment to analyze the results of this regional project. This assessment is primarily expected to assess the results of AP- A2J with a view of strengthening the DGTTF role in supporting innovation in democratic governance by codifying, analyzing and sharing lessons from past experiences to enhance regional and global interventions. The assessment team has conducted extensive desk review, country studies, interviews, collection of tools and the present online survey targeting members of the AP-A2J community of practice or justice practitioners and programming officers. Please reply to the survey below that is comprised of multiple-choice questions, direct open-ended questions and questions where you can share your lessons learned and recommendations for the future. Your answers should be concise and straightforward.

The assessment reviewed several project related documents, annual progress reports and evaluation reports, and held interviews with UNDP country office staff, partners, national state institutions, NGOs, civil society organizations and CBOs, universities, donors and other indirect beneficiaries. EA2J had two main phases and an intermediate transition phase that took place in 2008. The first phase, from 2004 to December 2007, addressed legal empowerment and A2J for the disadvantaged using a human rights-based approach. The project was extensively evaluated, revised and extended through 2008. Phase II began in 2009 to build on the lessons of Phase I and to reorient activities toward conflict prevention, while shifting the focus primarily to the East and North and to the estate sector. This phase sought to build trust and faith in the justice system by addressing gender equity, peaceful conflict resolution and mediation through the rule of law and A2J. This assessment will focus on Phase I (considered for this purpose until the end of 2008) and review Phase II progress, providing an overview of results, strategies and lessons learned. The country study assessed results based on the criteria of effectiveness, sustainability, relevance and strategic positioning, efficiency, political economy, and codification of lessons learned and tools. Main findings and lessons learned EA2J was significantly influenced by the regional initiative. In the words of one interviewee, \u201cwe wanted to follow the human rights-based approach programming guide blindly\u2026\u201d However, in Sri Lanka, project formulation and implementation fell short of successes in other countries, notably Indonesia. Nevertheless, the seeds have been planted, and the country office succeeds in attracting more partners2 for longer-term intervention; the impact on targeted communities could be very positive. Phase I achieved some significant results in terms of dispensing responses to the grievances of disadvantaged groups and raising awareness among claim holders at the community level as well as duty bearers. The project used innovative strategies, such as mobile clinics that provided identification and legal documents to internally displaced persons in the East and estate region. It was catalytic in securing a broad coalition of partners from state institutions, civil society and academia. However, the project had serious shortcomings,3 starting with the way outputs were formulated. There was a lack of baselines and data to effectively target core issues and groups. The project also failed to incorporate the voices of claim holders in designing and implementing the project, |and had limited engagement with the Ministry of Justice and limited guidance or accountability. These shortcomings affected overall project implementation, as the project was spread thin in an attempt to cover a multitude of activities, overwhelming the field operation and yielding little macro impact. It is important to note at the outset that the UNDP EA2J Project was initially conceived in 2004, when the ceasefire agreement was in place and the country was assumed to be moving towards peace. Since then, the situation has changed dramatically, with the December 2004 tsunami and periods of escalating conflict in areas of the North and East. These events have contributed to numerous grievances as large numbers of people have been displaced (some repeatedly), livelihoods have been compromised and people have faced Executive summary 2 The II phase of the project 2009-2013 is budgeted at approximately USD 8 million and so far secured budget is of 3 million from the Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery (BCPR) 3 These shortcomings are well documented in the Annual Project Review (April 2007), the mid-term evaluation (December 2006) and the HURIST review (September 2004) and will not be analysed in detail in this report. 8 Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative ongoing security concerns and threats from various armed groups. The project did not anticipate such events, and tried to rise to the occasion \u2013 especially with respect to the tsunami. This responsiveness, though highly commended, has cost the project some focus in its initial purpose. Despite these setbacks, the project is now on course to achieve good results. It has undertaken a number of assessments and studies to serve as baseline and guiding tool for a more policy-oriented impact; it is adopting innovative, bottom-up strategies likely to impact the regulatory framework and boost policy development; it has achieved a better balance of focus between claim holders and duty bearers; and it has been catalytic in assembling a broad coalition of partners from all segments of the justice system while building on regional and provincial coordination mechanisms launched in Phase I.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b56ea211-3ed8-4d1a-b867-d60d29415402": {"__data__": {"id_": "b56ea211-3ed8-4d1a-b867-d60d29415402", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-sri-lanka-country-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative: Sri Lanka Country Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-sri-lanka-country-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b2982c0fbec9718a1294f485f4a578e9460852b6b5e6fcd1acd6bc0c02ad3665"}}, "hash": "b2982c0fbec9718a1294f485f4a578e9460852b6b5e6fcd1acd6bc0c02ad3665", "text": "The main accomplishments so far result from a shift of focus from geographical regions to specific disadvantaged groups, to redress ongoing disparities and contribute to conflict mitigation. As a result, the project is channelling its resources to the North and East, the plantation sector and selected prisons. Key strategic interventions include supporting the main legal aid providers, training paralegals and state institutions such as the police and prison officers on the human rights- based approach, and fostering university legal aid clinics. The project has also supported a baseline survey and participatory consultations on A2J to generate data needed to ensure that its interventions respond to current needs. The project was able to balance its grassroots work with overarching sector strategic interventions, such as the Legal Aid Assessment and the Evaluation Study on the Legal Aid Foundation and the ongoing national baseline survey on A2J. Recommendations from these interventions are now being discussed and are expected to pave way to a National Action Plan on A2J and a Legal Aid Policy. 9 Purpose, objective and scope of the assessment This assessment was conducted in April 2009 and examined the results of EA2J in Sri Lanka. It measured innovation and catalytic ability in supporting breakthroughs in sensitive democratic governance issues and in scaling up activities. This assessment is not a project evaluation. Rather than an evaluation of progress, it provides an overall analytic review of results. It aims mostly to internalize and collect valuable information, and to analyze and document country office experiences with a view to strengthening knowledge management. Methodology The assessment analyzed relevant documentation, project reports, case studies, and conducted interviews with a wide range of stakeholders from donors, government institutions, academics and civil society. The primary beneficiaries could unfortunately not be visited during this assessment. The main criteria were effectiveness, sustainability, relevance and strategic positioning, efficiency, political economy and codification of lessons learned and tools. The assessment examined whether project results had been achieved or advanced. It identified external factors that influenced the result, and assessed the contribution of DGTTF and AP-A2J to national capacity development and participatory processes. It looked at the effectiveness of the partnership strategy, and whether innovative approaches had been found to key development issues. It examined the perceptions of indirect beneficiaries on DGTTF assistance. For this purpose the assessment examined Phase I of the EA2J as well as progress on Phase II. One international consultant conducted the assessment from 26 April to 1 May 2009. The mission met with UNDP programme staff and EA2J project staff from both phases, the national counterpart Secretary of Ministry of Constitutional Affairs (MoCA), Police Attorney General, Prison Director, the implementing partners from Sarvodya, Institute for Human Rights, Centre for Human Rights Studies, Faculty of Law, Legal Aid Commission (LAC), Legal Aid Foundation (LAF) and other civil society organizations, Asia Foundation and donors. The mission also observed a human rights-based approach training workshop conducted by the project targeting the GramaNiladares and held a group discussion with participants. The mission was able to obtain relevant information on project results, ownership issues and national partnerships, sustainability of interventions, and the UNDP role of supporting A2J in the national agenda and its implications for UNDP strategic positioning. Time was the main constraint: the mission did not have time to visit project sites nor to speak with direct beneficiaries. Another constraint derived from the fact that the project has generated little qualitative or quantitative data, and few tools or instruments. Still, the mission was able to collect some relevant tools used for the surveys and assessments with the support of the project team and the country office. Country context, project background and strategy Country Context Sri Lanka has recently emerged as a middle income country (MIC) with a growth rate averaging 5-6% over the past few years. Despite its MIC status and the impressive gains made towards achieving several of the MDGs, significant challenges remain with regard to poverty, income disparity and social inequality. The ethno-political conflict that endured over three decades continues to hinder the country\u2019s growth and development. This is particularly true of the Northern, Eastern and border districts, which because of decades of violent conflict suffer developmental lags due to inadequate infrastructure, limited economic opportunities, weak public institutions and scarce access to public services. The populations of the North and East have withstood the worst of the country\u2019s three-decade long ethno-political conflict. The war interrupted productive activities there, pervasively damaged the economic and social infrastructure, Introduction 10 Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative deterred private sector investment, discouraged tourism and contributed to an exodus of qualified professionals.

Consequently, the marginalized minority has resorted to violence to defend their interests. As is often the case, the conflict and its consequences have taken their heaviest tolls on the more vulnerable groups in society, including women, children, the economically disadvantaged and minority groups. Conflict and conflict- related displacement in particular halts productive economic activity and places a heavier socioeconomic burden on communities already facing enormous personal and social challenges. Several districts in the North and East were further devastated by the 2004 tsunami. Internally displaced woman typically find it harder to recover their socioeconomic capacities, given pre-existing vulnerabilities, additional security challenges during the transition, and diminished access to financial and training resources and opportunities to participate in decision-making. The ceasefire agreement brokered in 2002 between the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) provided a window of opportunity for donor and development support. Beginning in 2006, GoSL renewed military offensives against LTTE to regain control over Northern and Eastern Sri Lanka. The ceasefire agreement was officially abrogated in January 2008. Once the GoSL had regained full control of the Eastern Province in July 2007, elections to provincial councils and local authorities were held in 2008, resulting in the establishment of a representative body for the first time since 1988 and in the re-establishment of local-level elected bodies for the first time in 14 years. Most of those elected are relatively inexperienced in governance (many of them former paramilitaries), accountable to a constituency that itself has little experience of being governed. One of the fundamental challenges in the Eastern Province is to develop trust in the new sub-national democratic institutions. For this to occur, these institutions and newly elected members need to deliver and improve administrative services, pursue recovery and development priorities yielding genuine peace dividends, and remain accountable. At the time of the writing of this report, military operations were squarely focused on the North and heavy fighting resulted in the massive displacement of civilians, particularly those fleeing the conflict zones of Killinochchi and Mullaitivu into government-controlled areas. At the time of the publication of this report, the GoSL had defeated the LTTE and UNHCR estimated the number of IDPs to be more than 260,000. Project background and strategy To understand the complexity of bringing a human rights- based approach to A2J project implementation in a country context like Sri Lanka, some important factors should be considered. A human rights-based approach demands that events be examined through the prism of human rights. For instance, when government increases spending on conflict issues, spending on healthcare, education and other basic public amenities is reduced, with long-term detrimental effects. In Sri Lanka, human rights have become mainly a matter of legal justice. However, the ratification of treaties does not make the rights within those treaties automatically enforceable: GoSL has to incorporate them into domestic law by passing legislation. The Sri Lankan Constitution has a chapter on human rights, which defines certain civil and political rights as fundamental. These are legally enforceable. Economic, social and cultural rights, however, fall under the Directive Principles of State Policy and are not enforceable. Most international human rights have still not been codified into law, such as the right to life. However, Sri Lanka does have most other basic rights such as the principle of being innocent until proven guilty, freedom of movement, and so on. There are some important restrictions on the available rights: they will not be enforceable if they go against or disrupt the interest of national security, racial and religious harmony, the national economy, public order or public health, or morality. The Prevention of Terrorism Act has further attenuated some of these fundamental rights and is a good example of local legislation misaligning with international human rights standards. Detainees are provided only limited access to lawyers, as they are allowed to meet only in the presence of an officer. The detention is usually under a detention order rather than a judicial order, meaning that the detention can last for however long it takes for the detainee to be 11 Sri Lanka Country Assessment charged. If a detainee charged under this act is unable to obtain bail, the burden of proof falls to the detainee. There is also no provision for a suspended sentence on a guilty plea. Sri Lanka has an independent human rights commission, but new appointments have lagged following expiration of the first term of the constitutional council, casting doubt on the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f503f69-d6ee-45cb-8d26-1c663fa40b3e": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f503f69-d6ee-45cb-8d26-1c663fa40b3e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-sri-lanka-country-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative: Sri Lanka Country Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-sri-lanka-country-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "58b655aedf3119e6d30d090d8eb285035735a29de7bf447434877513797cafe9"}}, "hash": "58b655aedf3119e6d30d090d8eb285035735a29de7bf447434877513797cafe9", "text": "legitimacy and capacity of the commission.

Laws such as the ICCPR Act, Domestic Violence Act and Witness Protection Act have actually done a disservice to the public with weak public scrutiny. These laws are widely seen as token gestures to appease the international community. Though it has been greatly criticized, the GoSL has improved in such areas as the right to due process and free legal assistance. EA2J was designed in 2003 through a working group established by UNDP and comprised of stakeholders from state institutions, academia and civil society. This group examined the root causes of A2J challenges in Sri Lanka and devised a plan to overcome obstacles faced by the poor and disadvantaged. The project was initially conceived to increase A2J for disadvantaged persons using a human rights-based approach. Phase I was funded by UNDP, SIDA and the Government of the Netherlands, and was nationally executed through the Ministry of Constitutional Affairs and National Integration (MoCA). The project had five key objectives: 1. To increase the number and diversity of persons receiving effective legal services 2. To increase the number and diversity of persons receiving information on their rights 3. To decrease barriers to accessing the legal system 4. To increase the number and diversity of persons receiving community-level ADR services 5. To better promote and protect human rights The project envisaged a number of innovative efforts to bring legal services to the people using a three-pronged approach: a Training and incentivizing lawyers and other service providers; a Increasing awareness of legal rights among beneficiaries; and a Increasing the efficiency of the courts. The project strategy was grounded in a human rights-based approach, and integrated relevant actors in the justice sector. Its top\u2013down, bottom\u2013up management style prioritized flexibility in responding to transitions in the country, and sustainability through changes in policy and practice. A high-level steering committee expected to meet quarterly ended up meeting rarely because of the high level of its members. In Phase II a smaller and more effective project board replaced this steering committee. The project also had a working group tasked with coordinating key justice sector actors in the development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of project activities. It included representatives of the Judicial Services Commission; Ministry of Justice/Legal Aid Commission; Bar Association of Sri Lanka/Legal Aid Foundation; Selected Non- Governmental Organizations; Human Rights Commission; Centre for the Study of Human Rights; The Faculty of Law of the University of Colombo; Department of Law, Open University; and Sri Lanka Law College. The working group continues to function well. The project established regional committees at the local level, comprised of representatives of many of the agencies listed above, to ensure effective coordination and implementation. The committee expected to play an important role in monitoring and evaluation.4 This project has taken specific and targeted measures to address certain pressing national challenges in providing legal aid services for vulnerable groups. These included raising awareness of available rights among vulnerable people and promoting the concept of human rights. 4 This group was supposed to be introduced to the The Urban Governance Initiative (TUGI) Good Governance Report Card System, a tool for self- monitoring and corrective action. However, this has not happened. 12 Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative Phase I identified 20 locations from the North and East (Mannar Town, Chavakachcheri, etc.), the estate sector (Hatton, Ambagamuwa, Kolonna, etc.) and others such as Rasnayakapura, Katuwana and Siyamblanduwa. In 2007, the project was reformulated to concentrate on the North & East and the estate sector, and although some of the groups and areas were somewhat broadened, the activities were limited to some extent. After a major evaluation in 2006 and a revision process in 2007, the project further streamlined activities to reduce objectives in Phase II (2009-2012). Over 2008 the project focused on addressing pressing national A2J challenges facing disadvantaged groups, including those living in the targeted areas, internally displaced persons, conflict\u2013affected families and those of missing or abducted persons, criminal detainees and estate sector workers. It also supported the provision of legal aid services to disadvantaged groups, and promoted human rights and human rights-based approaches. The revised objectives for 2008 were as follows: 1.

Lessons learned by project staff, partners and the public from implementing the project 6. Effective project administration, documentation and monitoring To strengthen the capacity of duty bearers and claim holders to ensure better A2J, a baseline survey and comprehensive assessment were undertaken by UNDP and other UN partners to uncover capacity gaps among duty bearers and claim holders and identify the main A2J issues facing the poor and disadvantaged. Phase II builds on the lessons and partnerships of Phase I to deepen its focus on priority right holders (internally displaced persons, estate workers, conflict-affected persons, especially women and children, and victims of gender-based violence) and strengthen the project staff component, particularly by supporting and developing capacities at field offices. The six key results targeted by Phase II reflect the lessons of the first phase by adopting a more qualitative approach to project formulation.5 The results are: a Progress in achieving A2J for all, particularly priority right holders, measured and monitored a Detainees, particularly pre-trial detainees, informed of their legal rights, with better access to legal aid services and improved prison standards and conditions a Duty bearers within formal and quasi-formal justice institutions better able to deal with grievances, specifically with regard to priority right holders a Priority rights holders more aware of their rights and have increased access to legal services a Priority rights holders better able to obtain civic documentation (birth certificates, identity cards, citizenship certificates, etc.) and access legal services a Effective project administration, documentation and monitoring for project staff, partners and the public 5 Phase I project objectives were formulated purely in a quantitative manner, without baseline data. 13 Effectiveness The assessment reviewed the project for overall objectives and results, innovative ability, catalytic capacity, and its impact on cross-cutting issues. It focused on the first phase, including the 2008 results, and on how lessons from Phase I were integrated into Phase II. The quantitative nature of the output formulation, failure to identify target groups and lack of a baseline and project indicators made it difficult to assess progress qualitatively.6 Nevertheless, the project succeeded in contributing to increased A2J, supporting such activities as the provision of legal services, dissemination of information on rights and duties and the promotion of human rights. As noted earlier, the project benefited from a sharpened focus beginning in 2007.7 During this year the project achieved significant results and laid a solid foundation for ongoing work. Objectives, results and overall framework Objective 1: An increase in the number and diversity of persons receiving effective legal services The project has supported a number of activities that extend the geographical reach of services such as legal advice, litigation, referrals, mediation and information on legal services in remote areas. At the same time the project has ensured that services are provided through mechanisms that enable the poorest and most vulnerable groups to have access. The project has also provided training for relevant service providers. Specific interventions have included the following: Nineteen regional legal aid desks have been established through the LAF of the Bar Association. The coordinators of these desks are lawyers who, in addition to providing legal advice and litigation services, offer court representation to clients with incomes below 6,500 rupees. In 2007, among the 10 desks that reported information, there were 1,697 cases of representation. In 2008, the project conducted an evaluation of these legal aid desks to gauge the productivity and capacity of LAF over the four years of UNDP support. As a result, in 2009 the project reduced support to the 10 desks considered most effective. To extend the reach of legal services beyond the towns to the grassroots level the project has also supported the activities of partners such as Sarvodaya, a community-based organization that supports mediation, legal service provision and awareness-raising at the rural community level. The capacities of service providers to address the most common grievances of clients have also been strengthened through training and legal awareness on topics such as public interest litigation, domestic violence, and women\u2019s rights.

These literacy programmes included group discussions to identify problems and discuss legal aid options. \u2022 Workshops with government officials on the rights and entitlements of the internally displaced, and the obligations of the state to protect them Objective 3: A decrease in barriers to accessing the legal system One of the major activities of the project has been support for mobile documentation clinics to provide disadvantaged groups with legal documentation such as birth, marriage and death certificates, national identity cards, citizenship certificates (to estate populations), drivers\u2019 licenses and passports. The lack of legal documentation registered as a priority concern in almost all areas and as a general problem for the country as a whole. Because of language differences, high transport costs, lack of information and the prevalence of bribes, the most vulnerable groups face significant barriers in accessing these documents through regular channels. The clinics address each of these issues \u2013 providing information through the GramaNiladaris (the lowest state administration presence at the community level) in advance of the clinic to allow people time to prepare their papers, providing free photograph services for ID cards, ensuring the presence of Tamil and Sinhala speakers, and staying vigilant to abuses of power (e.g., demands for bribes). In 2007 the project provided documentation services to 14,000 people in the estates sector through four mobiles, a nd served a further 113,000 in the East through 36 mobiles, organized under a GoSL \u2018180 days plan\u2019 to accelerate development in the East. However, the project failed to enhance the capacity of the Register Departments to address the root causes of state inefficiency in providing legal documentation. Together with Asia Foundation and UNHCR, the project produced an assessment of the legal aid sector. This was a comprehensive exercise of mapping legal aid services to identify strengths and weaknesses, explore options for ensuring sustainability and making long-term recommendations. The report was a significant breakthrough for A2J at the policy level, since it is expected to lead to a National Policy for Legal Aid and a National Action Plan. This achievement will be further discussed in the section dedicated to sustainability. Objective 4: Increase in number and diversity of persons receiving community level Alternative Dispute Resolution services The project contributes directly to this objective through support to Sarvodoya and the legal aid desks. The project supports the 20 village committees that have been established across the island as part of Sarvodoya\u2019s grassroots legal empowerment project. These committees provide alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms for village communities. Village committees maintain a good relationship with local authorities such as the police, divisional secretary\u2019s office, zonal education office, labour office, child care and probation office, and local lawyers to coordinate resolutions for minor disputes, thereby reducing litigation. The legal aid desks have provided another avenue for alternative dispute resolution services. In many cases the legal coordinator is able to facilitate mediation between parties, especially on family matters. Some examples of interesting case studies have been included in the 2007 Annual Project Report. Objective 5: Human rights better promoted and effectively protected A key intervention under this objective is support for the promotion and protection of prisoners\u2019 rights. The project has supported the following interventions: a Provision of legal advice to prisoners through visiting legal aid providers including LAF and LAC. For example, through the LAF desk in Monaragala the project organized a legal aid clinic for prison inmates at the Monragala Remand Prison, providing over 50 inmates with legal aid services including filing bail applications or revisions in court.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "23bb9311-5ae7-402d-ba27-46da9129aeeb": {"__data__": {"id_": "23bb9311-5ae7-402d-ba27-46da9129aeeb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-sri-lanka-country-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative: Sri Lanka Country Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-sri-lanka-country-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7349ccda861b4e3d9757a684f9f3fe26b60c1ec6ff5ff0a358a7c86301e49895"}}, "hash": "7349ccda861b4e3d9757a684f9f3fe26b60c1ec6ff5ff0a358a7c86301e49895", "text": "Results of this intervention are still inconclusive but the practice seems worth pursuing. With 13,500 prisoners currently in remand, legal aid works to ensure that inmates are not in jail more than two years before trial (anecdotes exist of inmates being kept in remand for 10 years without a lawyer). More than 228 officers have also been trained. 15 Sri Lanka Country Assessment a Development of a pilot computerized tracking system of prison inmates and remands in Welikada Prison.

The sub-committee exemplifies the participatory aspect of the human rights-based approach. a Commission of a nationwide A2J assessment. The data collected will be used by UNDP, for the Ministry of Constitutional Affairs and the Ministry of Justice. The survey was put on hold in December 2008 by the Ministry of Defense (allegedly for security reasons), after collecting data from 13 districts. From these myriad interventions, three main results emerge as key to project continuity and impact: a The nationwide survey commissioned by EA2J, examining the capacity of vulnerable groups to access justice and of service providers to deliver it. The survey will take a comprehensive view of the justice process, from the occurrence of a grievance to the provision of remedies. The findings and the process itself will be used to support national partners in the design of a national action plan for providing equal A2J. Quantitative data generated through the survey will provide a much- needed baseline to allow for effective monitoring and evaluation of national and UN/UNDP interventions. The results of the assessment also fed directly into the design of a new UNDP A2J project to begin in 2009. To support EA2J to conduct this assessment, the project has partnered with UNOPS to conduct a household survey of approximately 4,000 vulnerable people. Local NGOs were conducting focus groups after to understand the \u2018whys\u2019 of the baseline data. Unfortunately, the research started in June 2008 but had to stop in December as decreed by the Ministry of Defence, due to security reasons. However, the survey was able to collect data from 13 districts and conversations are ongoing between MoCA and Ministry of Defence to resume it. a The legal aid assessment that led to the publishing of the report The Legal Aid Sector in Sri Lanka: Searching for Sustainable Solutions - A Mapping of Legal Aid Services in Sri Lanka, initiated by UNDP and UNHCR, and carried out by a team of sector specialists led by The Asia Foundation. Its goal is to contribute to a national solution for systematic provision of legal aid. The research served as an advocacy tool at the policy level, and the Bar Association of Sri Lanka and the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) are now more committed to unite efforts for increasing the legal aid budget. a Mobile legal aid clinics providing documentation for internally displaced persons and for other disadvantaged groups. The mobile clinics not only provided legal documentation quickly, but they now also have a comprehensive database of document- holders that is currently being used in monitoring and evaluation efforts. This last result merits closer analysis and appraisal, for in addition to the four mobile clinics in the estate area, the project contributed to a government initiative to accelerate development in the Eastern Province through a 180 day plan under the theme \u2018Nagenahira Navodaya\u2019 :8 The MOCA in collaboration with the Ministry of Public Administration and relevant district secretaries were involved in organizing mobile documentation clinics for each divisional secretariat division in the three districts. The Project assisted the MOCA in organizing and funding 11 mobile documentation clinics held in 11 divisional secretary divisions in the Trincomalee district. In addition the Project co-funded and supported the mobile clinics held in Batticaloa and Ampara districts. The purpose of these mobile service camps was to issue legal documentation such as birth certificates, marriage certificates, death certificates, national identity cards, etc, and provide other necessary services to disadvantaged and vulnerable persons, including internally displaced persons and resettled families.

Moreover, Ministry of Youth Affairs and Vocational Training provided valuable information for youth and the Ministry of Women\u2019s Empowerment was also present. A total of 113261 persons attended the mobile clinics held in the three districts. 36 mobile clinics were held to cover the 36 Divisional Secretary divisions in the three districts. In the Trincomalee district out of the 11 divisions more than 25,000 people participated at the clinics. Out of 2763 applications received by the RG\u2019s department for issuance of birth, marriage or death certificates 978 were issued. Out of 5410 applications received by the ROP\u2019s department for issuance of a national identity card 4619 applications were attended to. In the Ampara district more than 35,000 people participated at the clinics. Out of 5134 applications received by the RG\u2019s department for issuance of birth, marriage or death certificates 4291 were issued. Out of 8948 applications received by the ROP\u2019s department for issuance of a national identity card 7679 applications were attended to. In the Batticaloe district more than 45,000 people participated at the clinics. Out of 9024 applications received by the RG\u2019s department for issuance of birth, marriage or death certificates 4144 were issued. Out of 12164 applications received by the ROP\u2019s department for issuance of a national identity card 11744 applications were attended to. Apart from the services provided by these two departments numerous other services such as free distribution of spectacles by the Social Services Department, dental clinics and health clinics, legal aid services by LAF, LAC and SLSM, vocational training services, driving licenses by the Motor Traffic department, passport services by the Immigration department, etc were provided at the clinics. This was the first time in more than 20 years the government initiated mobile documentation clinics to provide an opportunity for people in the East to obtain lost legal documents. Many local organizations sent letters to the MOCA in appreciation of the work done by them. Innovation Despite initial shortcomings, the project has been clearly innovative in terms of results and strategies. The project has been critical for promoting A2J at the community level and, through its working group, among national state partners in the justice sector. It facilitated networking among partners in the formal and informal sector \u2013 an innovative approach as the government had been concentrating on organizational structures but was seeking other approaches. The project succeeded in introducing the human rights- based approach, a new concept for Sri Lanka. The approach is still a foreign concept to Sri Lankan civil society and government partners and needs to be tailored to local context, a task that the project is now trying to address through development of a manual with local case studies and partner training. UNDP Sri Lanka has taken the lead on promoting human rights-based approaches, and is focusing these efforts on promoting and protecting the rights of disadvantaged groups. Though many challenges lie ahead, there is now a strong foundation for advancing the approach. Another innovation for potential policy change is legal aid representation for criminal cases. Despite being implicit in the law there is no legal representation at Magistrates Court (the lower instance). Suspects are placed in remand almost automatically. Only after an indictment from the High Court can they access legal representation, but very few lawyers are willing to work pro bono. UNDP efforts to introduce legal aid for suspects are facing some resistance from the Bar Association. UNDP seeks to draw attention to the fact that pre-trial practices are overwhelming the prisons. The LAC has started to advocate this view in its five pilot centres. UNDP is also planning to work with the centres to promote a programme for reinstalling the rarely practiced option of alternative sentencing. Another innovative strategy has been the use of legal aid clinics promoted by the law faculty with support of EA2J. The dean of the faculty has been a consistent member of the working group for three years, and the faculty has been working with A2J in the areas of legal aid for vulnerable groups, legal literacy and counselling. The clinics place committed graduate students in remote areas to provide legal advice. Around 40 students were sent off together with 10 teachers to these areas for legal aid clinics.

The law faculty is now trying to revise its curriculum to make legal aid clinics compulsory. UNDP has funded three programmes; based on their positive experiences, the faculty has promoted a fourth one at its own expense. 17 Sri Lanka Country Assessment Catalytic capacity The project has not been catalytic financially. Its main donor, SIDA, was not satisfied with project results in Phase I, and the second phase is being funded only by BCPR. Donors such as SIDA and the Netherlands are phasing out support for Sri Lanka. Most are not keen to continue support for human rights strategies with the government given its perceived lack of commitment to human rights. Recent 2009 events have reinforced this perception. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka\u2019s designation as a MIC has further reduced aid support. Against this backdrop, Phase II is encountering serious problems in mobilizing resources. It is hoped that the government will adopt the recommendations of the legal aid assessment and begin to prepare a Legal Aid Policy and National Action Plan for A2J. A strong vision for legal aid could bridge the somewhat different orientations of the LAC (service delivery) and NGO service providers (promotion of justice, equality and equity for all) and better respond to the communities\u2019 real needs. This development may also lead to the establishment of an independent body to administer the legal aid scheme, a global trend among legal aid systems. Such an intermediary body would be responsible for monitoring legal aid activities and priority needs in the country. Through its working group and regional committees, the project has been catalytic in strengthening partnerships at national and local levels. A prisons sub-group has also been established among the partners to find solutions to identified needs in the prison. The project has to date served as secretariat for the sub-working group, but many of the agreed interventions are conducted by partners directly and do not require project funding. In this regard, the legal aid assessment was catalytic in securing the buy-in of the Ministry of Justice, which has accepted the recommendations and is now moving forward on a national policy and action plan. Finally, the project strengthened ties within the UN family, drawing UNOPS and UNHCR into assessments. UNDP Sri Lanka continues to seek synergies among local government, A2J, human rights and transition and recovery programmes \u2013 all solid entry points for the East at district level. A BCPR mission is assessing the possibility of joint programming. Further detail on partnerships will be provided in the section on sustainability. Cross-cutting issues There is clear evidence that EA2J has contributed to enhancing gender integration and human rights-based approaches. The AP-A2J Initiative and the UNDP HRBA Programming Guide influenced project design and revision. The project has helped increase A2J, although the impact of such access cannot be so clearly ascertained. The project sought to move away from the traditional definition of A2J, which generally meant access to lawyers and courts, and offer alternate dispute resolution and solid partnerships with community-based legal empowerment organizations and state stakeholders (prison, police, community-level administration bodies, and academia). The working group adopted a broader, integrated approach defining access by the elements of normative protection, effective remedies including implementation and enforcement, and empowerment to seek a remedy. Justice was defined to encompass treaties, constitution, laws and regulations, and customary law; the judiciary, police, prisons, and Human Rights Commissions; and lawyers, civil society and law students. The project supported 19 desks established in collaboration with the Legal Aid Foundation to mediate family and minor disputes. The major clients for legal aid are women: more than half the clients in all 19 areas were women. Most cases involved maintenance, divorce, land issues and accident claims. In areas such as Anamaduwa and Uhana, Hatton, Hingurakgoda, Siyambalanduwa and Kolonna, more than 60% of the cases filed in 2007 were related to maintenance or divorce. Additionally, the project developed and conducted training for judges to adjudicate human rights cases, especially as related to women and children. 18 Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative Sustainability The sustainability of A2J interventions in Sri Lanka is a major concern. Several measures have been introduced to promote sustainability, with apparent success: a An evaluation of LAF was done to focus support on the best legal aid desks, reducing the number from 19 to nine a The legal aid assessment was completed to launch the debate at policy level for more sustainable solutions for legal aid and advocate for more policy changes a Legal aid clinics", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f922c5c4-b3a6-47b5-be60-da0c4ec32917": {"__data__": {"id_": "f922c5c4-b3a6-47b5-be60-da0c4ec32917", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-sri-lanka-country-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative: Sri Lanka Country Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-sri-lanka-country-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5b09e4593f63726a584eb098362fee9915763c25cf29c40fa6bf0c7b386d0409"}}, "hash": "5b09e4593f63726a584eb098362fee9915763c25cf29c40fa6bf0c7b386d0409", "text": "with the law faculty expand access to free legal assistance and raise awareness a UNDP focuses its legal aid efforts on pre-trial detainees, freeing resources for legal aid if advocacy efforts with the Ministry of Justice prove fruitful a Efforts to streamline and institutionalize the human rights-based approach gain traction at the local level There is also growing state interest in sustainable solutions, such as the expansion of LAC services over the past several years and a recent increase in the government budgetary allocation for LAC.10 As a group, the NGO legal aid providers appear strongly motivated by a sense of social responsibility, service and social empowerment. All legal aid service providers operate independently of the government, including LAC (despite state funding). Nevertheless, sustainability of A2J interventions remains a concern. Ownership There is excellent indication of ownership from the national counterpart MoCA. The nationally executed project has been commended for its lack of management problems and spurred increased ownership by MoCA. The project established two district project offices with staff originally from the North and East regions. The project coordinator stated that \u201c\u2026when the project started working for A2J it was quite donor driven but now it is strong in the national agenda. There is more participation and more transparency. Ten years ago the state would not invite partners for planning processes and now they always do. This approach has sort of been replicated by the state from learning with the donors. The project document was revised in a very participative manner and now MoCA is doing the same for their planning. Also the Ministry for Human Rights is using this approach for the national strategy for ex combatants. The A2J project has contributed much to this. A2J is also part of the working group for the combatants\u2019 strategy as well as other similar working groups. The clear ownership of the project and MoCA\u00b4s leadership, in particular the Secretary, has enabled the project participation in different policy level forums for A2J with other ministries.\u201d CASE EXAMPLE9 HINGURAKGODA The case related to a woman with three children whose eldest child was allegedly sexually abused by the husband. The police arrested the husband on a complaint made by the woman through the GramaNiladaris. While the criminal proceedings were pending, the woman and children were left without any income as the husband was the sole breadwinner for the family. Therefore, the Crime OIC who is a committee member of the A2J project in Hingurakgoda referred the matter to the legal coordinator, who in turn filed a maintenance case against the husband. The woman now receives maintenance of Rs. 4000/- per month. In the same case, the husband who was released on bail tried to threaten the woman to settle the matter amicably. The woman informed the legal coordinator, who filed a motion in the Magistrates court. As a result the Magistrate summoned the husband to court and issued an open warning not to threaten the woman. Following is an illustrative example of conjunction of efforts: 9 Taken from the 2007 Annual Project Report. 10 For fiscal 2007-2008, GoSL has provided LAC with almost USD 500,000. 19 Sri Lanka Country Assessment The MoCA Secretary shared this view: \u201cThe plus of the project is that it has never left a syndrome of dependency as it was very nationally implemented and owned. Now the second phase will be even better with more focus on areas and targets.\u201d Ownership is also evident among other partners that have been implementing the project for some years and have been members of the working group since inception \u2013 such as the Prison Directorate, the LAC, civil society organization Sarvodya, and notably the law faculty. Unfortunately, the Ministry of Justice has been the weak link of the project, although the relationship has improved following their participation in the legal aid assessment. There is also good appropriation of the project at the local level thanks to the involvement and role of the regional committees. Capacity development The limited time frame made it difficult to assess the capacity development impact of the project. However, project staff was found to have improved in the human rights-based approach, and focused capacity development initiatives with key stakeholders, such as the GramaNiladari Services, have helped sustainability for the A2J agenda. Project officers received little initial training in the human rights-based approach and A2J. With direct hands-on experience, they have come to be considered the best resource for stakeholder training, but would have benefited from exposure to other experiences and better knowledge exchange.

This initial lack of exposure contributed to the attempt to follow the guide to the letter, a rigid approach that hampered project formulation and initial implementation with fragmented strategies. A 2006 evaluation to this effect led to increased training from RCB. Still, more knowledge-sharing is recommended between country offices in the region with similar experiences and more regional exposure, since Phase II has a strong emphasis on training and capacity development. Since 2007 the project has been focusing on institutionalized capacity development for different types of duty bearers. The project is also starting a capacity assessment of the LAC to provide more strategic training. The team is targeting CBO and NGO capacity development to foster legal empowerment. The project has issued a call for proposals for 15 to 20 CBOs to develop capacity among paralegals and referral systems. It is also seeking model communities to demonstrate how awareness can lead to empowerment. One of the recommendations of the legal aid survey was to support capacity development for the GramaNiladari, by promoting legal awareness and operating through the secretary divisions to target the lower level of village-based local government village, the GramaNiladari Services. This group has been identified as a viable local entry point with direct access to the communities. Consequently, the project has been implementing an extensive training programme for them, with the cooperation of the Ministry of Public Administration. The GramaNiladari Service was created in 1963. Its 14,016 divisions are recognized as the backbone of the village-based administrative system. GramaNiladari Services act as peace officers to settle village disputes, and are the first contact point of state administration in issues related to mediation, land, wildlife, personal documents, nuisances, and elections. Naturally, perceptions vary on their effectiveness and capacity to perform their role. The project will now embark on a long-term GramaNiladari training programme through the Alternative Dispute Resolution Institute, an NGO recognized for paralegal training, in collaboration with LAC from 2009-2012. At the time of the assessment, the project was training 48 newly recruited National Integration Officers for the GramaNiladari Services. In the words of one recruit: \u201c\u2026 this was the first contact we are having with legal issues and A2J concepts as well as human rights. Some of us had previous experiences working with mobile clinics for documentation in isolated islands and felt it was a very good experience as they were targeting very remote isolated population with no access to the mainland and providing documents free of charge. We have now been recruited by the Division of Secretary to work with Muslim and Tamil communities to advice and assist communities with awareness programmes and cultural programmes to attempt to bring people more together through national integration. This type of training is important to open more thinking and to give us tools to work in villages where there is no legal aid or even if there is people are not aware of it. We need to know how 20 Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative to provide information and serve as referrals and for that we must receive more training to be able to then raise awareness.\u201d Partners such as the Asia Foundation and the Centre for Human Rights Studies have recognized the importance of the GramaNiladari Services to resolving disputes and supporting referrals at the local level. As a first point of contact, they \u2013 as well as mediation boards \u2013 may be more effective than the LAC, as only a minor percentage of cases go to court and legal aid services. The UN system is also working with the Human Rights Office to develop a syllabus for officer training by the Police Training Institute. The second phase of the project also targets capacity development for attitude changes among duty bearers. Strengthening institutions entails more than providing training. Solving problems such as prison overcrowding requires changes in attitude, knowledge and skills among the various stakeholders. The project and its partners are working to rise to the challenge. Partnerships and synergies The broad partnership strategy appears to have brought good results in terms of sustainability. Initially the project was to be developed with MoJ but a shift in government structure made it move towards MoCA. The partnership with MoCA has been fruitful in gaining support for the project and promoting A2J. Meanwhile, the initially strained relations with MoJ are now improving. The project\u2019s working group, comprised of almost all key stakeholders with an important role to play in A2J, is considered best equipped to provide management and orientation to the project.

It has enabled strong partnerships and active participation throughout the project. The Regional Committees (local working groups) are a crucial component of the project structure, providing a vehicle for decentralized decision-making and for local contextualization. The project has established solid partnerships with many state institutions, NGOs, CBOs, and academia. The Asia Foundation hailed the legal aid assessment as a truly effective partnership, with everyone, including MoJ, united in purpose. Unfortunately, the partnerships with donors have not adequately supported A2J and legal aid work. There has been no attempt by the main donors interested in supporting legal aid to coordinate and rationalize the process of grantee selection and funding allocations, resulting in a situation where donor resources fall short in impacting A2J for marginalized and vulnerable groups. Donors must coordinate their efforts and achieve consensus on funding transparency and expenditure of legal aid. Donors such as SIDA and the Netherlands are phasing out their support, partly for corporate strategic reasons and partly because of a perceived lack of government commitment to the human rights agenda. The project is now trying to engage private sector on legal aid. The banking sector has expressed interest in making awareness-raising activities part of their social corporate responsibility. Discussions are ongoing with one bank on a proposed job bank for young offenders. Partnerships also extended beyond government-based partnerships to civil society organizations such as Sarvodya. Some donors still feel that the project should seek more conflict-sensitive, outspoken and rights-based partners. Sarvodya was the first civil society organization to be involved in the project and is the oldest partner in the working group. It was involved during the planning phase and has been active since 2002. It recognizes the project as a good avenue for networking with other partners. In the first phase, Sarvodya had district coordinators working in all 14 project areas. The organization\u2019s good relations with its partners, including state institutions, are due to its extensive community presence, which also reduces programme implementation costs. Everything is done at local level, involving the community. Even the networks of paralegals working on legal empowerment are volunteers. Relevance and strategic positioning The project has become one of the flagship projects for the country office. It grew from a USD 2 million project in 2004 - 2008 to USD 8 million for the period 2009 - 2012. The total budget for the project is USD 8,281,800, out of which the country office, in line with the Country Programme Action Plan (CPAP) commitments, has allocated USD 550,000 TRAC resources and BCPR/UNDP has funded USD 3,000,000. So far the project has not been able to mobilize external donor funds, most likely because of its shortcomings in the first phase in addressing critical policy issues concerning human rights and conflict. 21 Sri Lanka Country Assessment Two of the four CPAP outcomes apply to A2J: Outputs 13 (duty bearers better able to deal with grievances experienced by disadvantaged groups) and 14 (disadvantaged groups have increased knowledge of their rights and are able to access and benefit from legal services). The project was relevant to position UNDP within the realm of national stakeholder partnerships. National partners, both state and civil society organizations, now see UNDP as a main A2J partner. In the view of MoCA, A2J is the domain of UNDP and the Asia Foundation. UNDP has further room for expansion in addressing serious vulnerability issues. MoCA has a good working relationship with the UNDP team and encourages its interventions. For the United Nations Country Team, transitional recovery is a bigger programme. However, A2J has fostered partnerships with UNICEF and UNHCR and is considered to be the project that best targets gender issues. Efficiency The overall conclusion on efficiency is quite positive. In the first phase the policy-making body, the Steering Committee, demonstrated a good grasp of relevant issues as well as coherent and decisive direction. However the committee met very few times over the course of the Project and has left several policy issues unaddressed. A new Project Board remedied this situation in the 2008 revision. The PSO is responsible for the daily management, implementation and monitoring of the project. It is placed in the MoCA and is fully nationally staffed. Its high efficiency has improved further with the project refocus in 2008. Other management structures (the project working group and regional committees analysed in the partnership section) are considered adequate for their purposes. Harmonizing partner vision and strategy was identified as a challenge. However, as the assessment revealed no major issues of lack of coordination, the project may be considered successful in this respect.

Initially the project was perceived to have a \u2018Colombo Orientation\u2019, but a stronger focus or the North and the estate sector and the establishment of two district offices covering those regions have improved coordination and monitoring. It was the President who approved the project, and under the NEX modality the Ministry of Finance and Treasury have been cooperative in expediting disbursements. MoCA and other partners have expressed appreciation for their interactions with UNDP, particularly with current management. Response time is swift, audits have been positive and funds well utilized. On the whole, NEX has been a good experience. Political economy The 2006 evaluation report characterized EA2J as \u2018a made-in- Sri Lanka response to a made-in-Sri Lanka problem\u2019. The project was prompted by the perception that, \u2018Sri Lanka is now in a transition stage moving towards the achievement of permanent peace\u2026 This state of hope for the future needs to be further strengthened by providing vulnerable groups with avenues of access to justice and peaceful dispute resolution leading to their legal empowerment\u2019. With high ambitions of contributing significantly to the peace process in Sri Lanka the project initially asserted that \u2018the environment of peace and reconciliation emerging throughout the country has held without any permanent damage\u2019. As such, the assumption was that improved A2J and peaceful dispute resolution for vulnerable groups could contribute \u2018towards the achievement of permanent peace\u2019. In 2004 and 2005 the project focused on strengthening rule of law, even during periods of ongoing conflict, to counter heightened tensions marked by an increase in defence spending, armed conflict, and the introduction of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (granting sweeping powers to the police to conduct warrantless arrests and hold people in custody without charge for up to three months on suspicion of involvement in terrorist activity). Against this backdrop, the project was conceived as a means to support the transition to peace and was well received as such by national partners. 11 The TUGI Report Card System, although referred to in the Project Document Phase I as a key element in project monitoring and evaluation, has never been implemented. 22 Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative However, in 2006 these fundamental assumptions crumbled. As Human Rights Watch noted: \u2018Sri Lanka is in the midst of a human rights crisis. The ceasefire between the government and the armed secessionist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam exists only in name. Since mid-2006, when major military operations resumed, civilians have paid a heavy price, both directly in the fighting and in the dramatic increase in abductions, killings, and \u2019disappearances.\u2019 The return to war has brought serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law.\u2019 12 The situation has changed drastically since the EA2J project was conceived. Events in 2007 and again in 2009 have plunged the North and East into conflict, displacing thousands of people. For this reason, the project has had to shift focus to address the most pressing justice and human rights issues currently facing people in those areas. Meanwhile, the tsunami has had its most acute and enduring impact on the East, with multiple displacements and numerous unresolved grievances. It was an unprecedented disaster that called to action every Sri Lankan, individuals and institutions alike. The project rose to the occasion during this time, working through mobile clinics to assist affected populations. The United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) for Sri Lanka for the period 2008-2012 has identified \u2018effective and efficient structures and mechanisms in place and operational to provide access to justice and redress mechanisms\u2019 as one of its outputs. UNDP has committed to working on A2J in its Country Programme Document (CPD) where it seeks to strengthen the capacity of duty bearers and claim holders to ensure better A2J. The UNDAF and the CPD have targeted certain particularly disadvantaged specific groups for intervention: the conflict- affected and internally displaced persons, the estate sector workers, and survivors of gender-based violence. The alarming increase in the scale of human rights violations in Sri Lanka correlates directly with the heightened difficulty of channelling grievances through any justice mechanism. EA2J shifted its approach to prioritize the lack of redress of these grievances.

Some of the most relevant lessons learned are also presented below. Codification of tools There is an urgent need for the project to better document its work. As is all too typical in UNDP-implemented projects, little has been documented whether in the form of case studies, success stories, or manuals. In terms of the human rights-based approach the project has not developed any particular tools, although it has developed presentations for human rights-based trainings tailored to various target groups. It also produced a pre-workshop questionnaire to assess participants\u2019 main A2J issues, perceptions and awareness. Several tools were developed for the legal aid assessments and A2J survey. Some of the most relevant are: a Legal Aid Assessment \u2022 Questionnaire for Legal Aid Service Providers in Sri Lanka \u2022 Questionnaire for Beneficiaries of Legal Aid Services \u2022 Guide Questions for Focus Group Discussions \u2022 Guide Questions for Policy Makers a A2J Survey \u2022 Request for Proposal for undertaking the Qualitative Component of an Access to Justice Survey and ToR for A2J Assessment (qualitative component) \u2022 Sample questionnaire for field research (qualitative) \u2022 Draft Statistic Results from District Putalam Survey Lessons learned Listed below are the most relevant lessons regarding effectiveness, the human rights-based approach and overall sense of purpose. a As a basic rule of results-based management all programmes must have a solid baseline reflecting the point of departure and an adequate monitoring and evaluation framework. This is especially vital to a human rights-based approach for A2J project given its participatory, accountability and rights-based nature. The Sri Lanka project and other experiences in Asia illustrate that A2J justice assessments and surveys are critical to better A2J programming and essential to accountability. EA2J is the best example of this assertion: although it has done a great deal of work to increase A2J, without baseline indicators, accurate data on target groups and adequate monitoring and evaluation, its impact is difficult to ascertain. Fortunately, these lessons have been applied in the design of Phase II. a A2J interventions must strive to maintain a balance between grassroots work (legal awareness and empowerment, provision of free legal aid and dispute resolution) and overarching policy impact to advance the issue in the national agenda and improve sustainability while providing immediate responses to grievances at the community level. a While dedicated and targeted training for various stakeholders on the human rights-based approach for A2J is important for advocacy and buy-in, A2J interventions must work to enhance the capacity of existing structures to provide services responding adequately to the increase in demand from claim holders. Training must therefore be complemented with more targeted institutional capacity development. Codification of tools and lessons learned 24 Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative a Projects must capitalize on synergies with other UNDP and UN projects and avoid functioning in silos. Working in joint programmes can ensure that an A2J component is built into other relevant projects. a Documentation is critical to support the claim for results, especially in pioneer projects applying the human rights-based approach to A2J. Case studies, relevant publications and success stories that reflect the impact on people\u2019s lives are essential ingredients in a global movement for human rights-based A2J or legal empowerment. EA2J should make more of an effort to document the following: \u2022 Case studies on different legal aid cases \u2022 Lessons from establishing legal aid desks in rural/ remote areas \u2022 Lessons on applying the human rights-based approach \u2022 Information booklets on legal aid services available in Sri Lanka \u2022 Information booklets on services provided to internally displaced persons and other conflict- affected populations through mobile clinics \u2022 Study on promoting A2J in conflict situations \u2022 Lessons from the A2J assessment exercises 25 a UNDP and human rights-based approach advocates in general should give due consideration to the fact that in many places, the human rights-based approach is still a very foreign concept to civil society and government partners. Messages need to be better tailored to local context. Local case studies and references to national law resonate better with national partners, and committed, passionate staff can be effective advocates. a To make effective advocates of staff as recommended above, adequate time and attention should be given to capacity development and exposure to comparative experiences. a A human rights-based approach", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b8799a25-a964-4d96-8a88-c951656a7534": {"__data__": {"id_": "b8799a25-a964-4d96-8a88-c951656a7534", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-sri-lanka-country-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative: Sri Lanka Country Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-sri-lanka-country-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2be016af7bea88326b6d64cb937c4d8ff438a820b87c63c0b3edad8280a4d272"}}, "hash": "2be016af7bea88326b6d64cb937c4d8ff438a820b87c63c0b3edad8280a4d272", "text": "to legal aid requires the participation of, and accountability to, the poor and disadvantaged. The development of legal aid services should therefore be informed by an assessment of the needs, grievances, and perspectives of the population, particularly those who are most at risk of rights violations. Evaluations of legal aid schemes also need to take into account the views of the most disadvantaged users. a Experience grounded in adequate assessments (as the legal aid assessment in Sri Lanka) demonstrate that both service providers and beneficiaries prefer to resolve disputes outside the court system. A2J interventions should try to foster more work with ADR systems. a Some A2J projects tend to focus much on legal aid for fundamental rights issues, consequently focusing more on individual rights than on group rights and public interest litigation to achieve policy change. Individual cases have limited ability to empower and secure justice for larger groups of marginalized and vulnerable communities. In conflict contexts like Sri Lanka, this limits the power of a human rights-based approach to A2J. a In order to promote equal access for all, UNDP must find a niche where it can support the justice system in combating the culture of impunity for perpetrators of human rights violations. UNDP Sri Lanka can seek to enhance the justice system to better protect and promote human rights by explicitly focusing on protecting fundamental rights and providing the means of redress when these rights are violated. EA2J, for example, has not specifically targeted serious violations of rights such as \u2018disappearances\u2019 and abduction, illegal detention, torture, extra-judicial executions and gender- based violence.

Introduction 1.1 What are human rights? \u201cAll human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights\u201d1 Every individual, as a human being, is entitled to certain rights that are not dependent on their sex, ethnicity, colour, race, language, age, religion, political or other beliefs, national or social origin, property, economic status, disability, birth or other factors. These individual human rights are inalienable in that they cannot be taken away, violated or given away. Human rights are by their very nature indivisible and without ranking. They include entitlement to free, active, and meaningful participation, contribution, as well as enjoyment of civil, social, cultural, economic, and political development. Human rights are interrelated as well as often interdependent of other rights. For example, the right to health may be dependent on the right to information, or even education to be adequately fulfilled. 2. Journalists and Human Rights 2.1 Journalists\u2019 Role in Communications, Media, and Human Rights Today, due to the globalization of services, information, and labour \u2014 the media holds a powerful and much-depended upon role in communication. In the arena of communication it is journalists who serve as the main actors in reporting the world\u2019s events and conveying valuable information. Journalists hold the power to determine what news is and to construct stories and select words in ways that affect people. Our views of history can be strongly influenced by journalists. Journalists carry the ability to inform the public, to connect remote worlds, and to shape an individual\u2019s knowledge and understanding of the world live in. They have the opportunity to increase public awareness, to educate the public on their rights, and, above all, to help in monitoring human rights.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "94030896-a8f1-4593-ab9c-f4035fb04962": {"__data__": {"id_": "94030896-a8f1-4593-ab9c-f4035fb04962", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-rights-based-approach-journalism-training-manual-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Human Rights-Based Approach to Journalism: Training Manual Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-rights-based-approach-journalism-training-manual-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "03f952e126ca8d434dfc0f07d24dffc7bb67340d0ae60ee68b58317950b34ede"}, "2": {"node_id": "476baafc-3386-4423-b6a0-49cb37938eab", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-rights-based-approach-journalism-training-manual-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cedf205160f4de24535405298be7da9e0a790b0d254eee9b24423b3ec79cbd12"}}, "hash": "1f63ba5197dc9289609fa5f084d3254043971eab5801e522812dae8321aba449", "text": "2.2 Why should Journalists contribute to the human rights movement? Journalists can use their ability to communicate and their access to mass media sources, not only to report events, but also to add more in-depth analysis. Through analysis and the bringing together of multiple perspectives, journalists create the potential for a more knowledgeable, well-rounded and aware public. This increased awareness can lead to a stronger civil society and a more active population. 1 \u201cArticle 1,\u201d Universal Declaration of Human Rights, G.A. res. 217A (III), U.N.

Tolerance of differences, as well as recognition and acceptance of differences including gender, economic status, race, ethnicity, disability and age are pertinent to avoid discrimination and advocate for equality. 2) Human agency is the capacity for human beings to make choices and to impose those choices on the world. With respect to human rights, \u201cagency\u201d both emphasizes an individual\u2019s right to act as they wish, and their obligation to ensure their action does not infringe upon the rights of others. 4. Human Rights Modern history has seen gross violations of many human rights including; hate crimes, genocide, the subordination of women and the abuse of children. These violations have led to international frameworks, treaties, and regulations to help prevent further violations and neglect of these rights. It is important to not only understand what entitlements are attached to various rights and who they refer to, but also to be informed and aware of which international treaties, conventions and regulations have been created to uphold these rights. 4.1 Civil and Political Rights Civil and political rights relate to the civil and political freedoms and entitlements that individuals should be able to enjoy. They include; the right to liberty, the right to 2 WordNet\u00ae 3.0,\u00a9 2006 by Princeton University. 3 \u2018HISTORY OF UNIVERSAL HUMAN RIGHTS - UP TO WW2\u2019 by Moira Rayner. 4 Random House Unabridged Dictionary, \u00a9 Random House, Inc. 2006. 9 freedom from arbitrary arrest, and the right to own property. Civil and political rights can be considered simple and uncontroversial in some nations, yet in other countries they may be seen as complex and highly political. Civil rights are outlined in the UDHR under articles 2 through to 18. These rights are often considered to be the most fundamental of human rights. \u2022 Article 3 - Right to life, liberty, and security of person; \u2022 Article 4 - Freedom from slavery; \u2022 Article 5 - Freedom from torture and cruel or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; \u2022 Article 6 - Right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law; \u2022 Article 7 - Right to be equal before the law and free from legal discrimination; \u2022 Article 8 - Right to an effective remedy by the competent national tribunals for acts violating the fundamental rights granted him [to one] by the constitution or by law; \u2022 Article 9 - Freedom from arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile; \u2022 Article 10 - Right to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal; \u2022 Article 11 - Right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty and the freedom from laws passed after the act to create guilt; \u2022 Article 12 - Right to freedom of privacy and from attacks upon a person\u2019s honour or reputation; \u2022 Article 13 - Freedom of movement within and across the borders of a country; \u2022 Article 14 - Right to asylum from persecution; \u2022 Article 15 - Right to a nationality; \u2022 Article 16 - Right to found a family; \u2022 Article 17 - Right to own property; \u2022 Article 18 - Freedom of thought, conscience, and religion. \u201cPolitical Rights\u201d, which are often associated with the freedom to actively participate in political life and to be free from unnecessary, excessive or inappropriate governmental regulation, are enumerated in Article 18 through to 21 of the Universal Declaration: \u2022 Article 18 - Right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; \u2022 Article 19 - Right to freedom of opinion and expression; 10 \u2022 Article 20 - Freedom of political assembly and association; \u2022 Article 21 - Right to take part in the government of one\u2019s country. These rights directly relate to journalists, not only as topics to report on, but as something they must respect and adhere to as journalists. Without freedom of expression, communication and information, journalism and the media could not exist. 4.2 Economic, Social and Cultural Rights Economic, social, and cultural rights include; equal pay for equal work, the right to an adequate standard of living, the right to education, and the right to freely participate in the community. These rights are laid out in articles 22 through to 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.5 This set of rights is regularly considered as a \u201cprogressive obligation\u201d, under which governments offer to act \u201cto the maximum of their", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7e76feef-d5a0-486e-89c6-9ad5a5fcb8e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "7e76feef-d5a0-486e-89c6-9ad5a5fcb8e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-rights-based-approach-journalism-training-manual-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Human Rights-Based Approach to Journalism: Training Manual Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-rights-based-approach-journalism-training-manual-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c03919b939c722dadb232d15c04f607df5173ddbe16d218d80743ea0615f62dc"}, "3": {"node_id": "8a601540-7a95-45bc-b4e6-9fa8307533a1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-rights-based-approach-journalism-training-manual-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8bcb5bb724856595a05eca6f9c83e1d719c86b5432ef09d809e347377c056092"}}, "hash": "3a1f40b7e321f5b109d96be228d6dc708d9e79b61fb5cacf95adfe50ab9ca793", "text": "available resources\u201d to achieve their full realization. If a country has limited resources this means that they have the obligation to do what they can, in light of the resources available. For many governments, economic, social and cultural rights are of secondary importance to the implementation of civil and political rights, yet many rights are interdependent and rely on the realization of other rights so that they can be carried out. For example, the right to life, liberty and the security of person must be realized before a government can fulfil many of its citizen\u2019s economic rights. Once these rights are secured, the government must then decide how to allocate limited resources to secure the various economic, social and cultural rights of its people including, the right to adequate medical care, education and housing. 4.3 Third Generation Rights Sometimes known as communal or solidarity rights, third generation rights are those rights that go beyond civil and social rights. The term \u201cthird-generation human rights\u201d remains largely unofficial, and thus includes an extremely broad spectrum of rights, including: \u2022 The right to political, economic, social, and cultural self- determination; \u2022 The right to economic and social development; \u2022 The right to participate in and benefit from the common heritage of humanity; \u2022 The right to peace; \u2022 The right to a healthy and sustainable environment; \u2022 The right to humanitarian disaster relief. 5 \u2018Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\u2019 Adopted and proclaimed by General Assembly resolution 217 A (III) of 10 December 1948. 11 5. Human Rights Law and International Frameworks 5.1 International The United Nations (UN) is the only multilateral governmental agency with universally accepted international jurisdiction for universal human rights legislation. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) provides secretariat support to the different human rights monitoring mechanisms in the United Nations system. These monitoring mechanisms include the UN Charter-based bodies which consists of the: (1) Human Rights Council; and (2) the UN Special Procedures, in addition to the Treaty Bodies made up of independent experts who monitor State parties\u2019 compliance with their treaty obligations. The roles and functions of these charter and treaty based bodies are described below. 5.1.1. Charter Bodies 5.1.1.1 The Human Rights Council (HRC) The Human Rights Council (HRC) (previously the Commission on Human Rights) is the main political body in the UN that deals with human rights. This intergovernmental body is composed of 47 elected United Nations Member States who serve for an initial period of three years, and cannot be elected for more than two consecutive terms. The Human Rights Council is a forum empowered to prevent abuses, inequity and discrimination, to protect the most vulnerable, and to expose perpetrators of human rights abuses. 5.1.1.2 Special Procedures Established by the previous Commission on Human Rights, \u201cSpecial Procedures\u201d is the name given to mechanisms that address human rights issues in specific countries, or that focus on violations of particular rights around the world (e.g., the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography). Currently, there are 29 thematic and nine country mandates. Special Procedures\u2019 mandates usually call on mandate holders to examine, monitor, advise an publicly report on human rights situations in specific countries or territories, or on major phenomena of human rights violations worldwide, known as thematic mandates. Various activities can be undertaken by Special Procedures, including responding to individual complaints, conducting studies, providing advice on technical cooperation programming at the country level, and engaging in general awareness raising activities. Special Procedures are either an individual (called \u201cSpecial Rapporteu\u201d \u201cSpecial Representative of the Secretary- General\u201d\u201cRepresentative of the Secretary-General\u201d or \u201cIndependent Expert\u201d) or a working group usually composed of five members (one from each region). 5.1.2 International Human Rights Treaties According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, there are nine core international human rights treaties, one of which - enforced disappearance- has not yet entered into force. Since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, all UN Member States have ratified at least one core international human rights treaty, and 80 per cent have ratified four or more. 12 There are seven human rights treaty bodies, which are committees of independent experts that monitor implementation of the core international human rights treaties. They are created in accordance with the provisions of the treaty that they monitor.

The ICC was adopted in Rome, Italy on July 17th 1998, and is legally binding for the 1066 countries that have joined to date. 5.2 The Asia-Pacific Region and Human Rights Laws There are no Asia-wide conventions to promote or protect human rights. Countries vary widely in their approach to human rights and their record of human rights protection. There are, however, a number of Asian associations that address economic, social and political issues in the region which include some human rights objectives. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is a geo-political and economic organization of 10 countries located in Southeast Asia, which was formed in 1967 by Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. The organisation now also includes Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Viet Nam. Its aims include the 6 About the Court,\u2019 International Criminal Court, http://www.icc-cpi.int/about.html Accessed June, 2008. 13 acceleration of economic growth, social progress, cultural development among its members, and the promotion of regional peace. The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) is an economic and political organization of eight countries in South Asia, representing almost 1.5 billion people. It was established in 1985 by Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal ,Pakistan and Sri Lanka. In April 2007, at the Association\u2019s 14th summit, Afghanistan became its eighth member. The Asia Cooperation Dialogue (ACD) is a body created in 2002 to promote Asian cooperation at a continental level, helping to integrate the previously separate regional organizations of political or economical cooperation. Among the main objectives of the ACD is to promote interdependence among Asian countries in all areas of cooperation by identifying Asia\u2019s common strengths and opportunities. The ACD\u2019s aims include reducing poverty and improving the quality of life for Asian people whilst developing a knowledge-based society within Asia and enhancing community and people empowerment. While none of the above organizations currently have a specific mandate to promote or protect human rights, each has identified the realization of a number of economic, social and cultural human rights in their objectives. There has however, been some recent developments with respect to the establishment of a regional approach to human rights promotion and protection. In June 25, 1993 at the 26th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting in Singapore, foreign ministers agreed that ASEAN should consider the establishment of an appropriate regional mechanism for monitoring human rights. In July 1995 in Manila, The Working Group for an ASEAN Human Rights Mechanism was set up by the Human Rights Committee of the Law Association of the Asia and the Pacific Region. The Working Group for an ASEAN Human Rights Mechanism\u2019s (Working Group) primary goal is to establish an intergovernmental human rights commission for ASEAN. It is a coalition of national working groups from ASEAN states composed of representatives of government institutions, parliamentary human rights committees, the academe and NGOs. The human rights mechanisms that are currently being explored are; a declaration of human rights principles, a monitoring and promotional commission, and/or a court that can further bind decisions.7 Finally, when examining regional approaches to human rights monitoring it is worthwhile noting the Asia Pacific Forum. Though not an explicit mechanism for providing a regional framework for addressing human rights across the region, the APF is a regional, member-based organisation made up of national human rights institutions from across the Asia Pacific.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "74bab749-a465-4e71-acfa-cb1b9b1c4eca": {"__data__": {"id_": "74bab749-a465-4e71-acfa-cb1b9b1c4eca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-rights-based-approach-journalism-training-manual-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Human Rights-Based Approach to Journalism: Training Manual Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-rights-based-approach-journalism-training-manual-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f48af88ce20e3ba4fb7ba6ce89569a303eee7d4bb278168b43c4884279859d04"}, "2": {"node_id": "ed5038b7-91d0-4515-ab69-dcb2a993d4e4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-rights-based-approach-journalism-training-manual-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7da2b14288d130f0de859334f762cdd5d76a5d033f97e9efe32c46fa703e4d57"}}, "hash": "2e0583d5f5c5385b7e63e2e38b72c2522f44b18dd3de5c87056cac4eeef55567", "text": "This organisation provides a supportive role to its members and encourages dialogue in this area. 5.3 National Legislation and Other Human Rights Mechanisms 5.3.1 Constitutional, Criminal Law and Human Rights Commissions At the national level, policy makers and politicians use national documents", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "16d2d83d-7da6-45ba-9041-ff7ac53218c3": {"__data__": {"id_": "16d2d83d-7da6-45ba-9041-ff7ac53218c3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-rights-based-approach-journalism-training-manual-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Human Rights-Based Approach to Journalism: Training Manual Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-rights-based-approach-journalism-training-manual-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ba3a9f6d3a438e6f0c67ab55d5d876576ba223a34ff6e36dea75928228f6d3c2"}}, "hash": "ba3a9f6d3a438e6f0c67ab55d5d876576ba223a34ff6e36dea75928228f6d3c2", "text": "such as constitutions and legislation to promote and uphold human rights.

Legislation based on the principles outlined within national constitutions defines what is considered a human rights violation under the law and the consequent legal recourse for these violations. A further mechanism adopted by national governments to ensure that the human rights of citizens are realized is the establishment in law of human rights commissions. The responsibility of human rights commissions can include; the monitoring and reporting of human rights violations, the promotion of human rights and the investigation and prosecution of human rights violators. 5.3.2 Civil Society When a government is unable or unwilling to uphold human rights and prosecute abuses in an adequate manner, a citizens\u2019 ability to call upon civil society is crucial. Civil society is composed of all the non-governmental voluntary civic and social organizations and institutions in a society. The UN views civil society as a necessary tool towards the maintenance of peace, security, and prosperity around the world. Kofi Annan, the United Nations Secretary-General stated: \u201cThe United Nations once dealt only with Governments. By now we know that peace and prosperity cannot be achieved without partnerships involving Governments, international organizations, the business community, and civil society. In today\u2019s world, we depend on each other.\u201d If a journalist can adequately express public sentiment through the media, it can be used as a means to get the message across to the government. As such, the media is often considered a part of civil society, since its role includes: \u2022 Informing citizens about their rights; \u2022 Informing citizens truthfully about what is going on in their societies; \u2022 Educating citizens on democratic participation; \u2022 Creating a culture of space for debate. 5.4 Viet Nam and Human Rights Legislation 5.4.1 Viet Nam, Human Rights and the International Community The Socialist Republic of Viet Nam has signed, ratified or ascended to the following human rights treaties: \u2022 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights - ratified 1982; \u2022 International Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women \u2013 ratified 1982; \u2022 International Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination \u2013 ratification 1982; \u2022 International Convent on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights \u2013 accession 1982; \u2022 Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities \u2013 signed 2007 (not yet ratified); 15 \u2022 Convention on the Rights of the Child \u2013 ratified 1990; \u2022 Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict - ratification 2001; \u2022 Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography \u2013 ratification 2001. Viet Nam has participated and been engaged in Human Rights dialogue with the international community for a number of years. Viet Nam was one of the 53 members of the Human Rights Commission in 2003. Viet Nam has also participated in an annual Human Rights Dialogue with countries like the United States and Australia. While not directly related to human rights, it is still worth noting that Viet Nam is currently sitting on the United Nations Security Council. As a member of the council it is directly involved in the broad oversight of global security issues which has significant implications for human rights world-wide. 5.4.2 Viet Nam, the 1992 Constitution and Human Rights The following are a number of key references to the human rights of the people of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam in the 1992 Constitution. The human rights that are enshrined in the constitution, form the legal framework for the guarantee of human rights in Viet Nam. \u2022 All citizens are equal before the law. \u2022 The citizen has the right to participate in the administration of the State and management of society, the discussion of problems of the country and the region; he can send petitions to State organs and vote in referendums organised by the State. \u2022 The citizen, regardless of nationality, sex, social background, religious belief, cultural standard, occupation, time of residence, shall, upon reaching the age of eighteen, have the right to vote, and, upon reaching the age of twenty-one, have the right to stand for election to the National Assembly and the People's", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7bc224e6-9bcf-41eb-881d-827252f8f02a": {"__data__": {"id_": "7bc224e6-9bcf-41eb-881d-827252f8f02a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-rights-based-approach-journalism-training-manual-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Human Rights-Based Approach to Journalism: Training Manual Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-rights-based-approach-journalism-training-manual-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3e7da08e3136e2fe12a5504387d4386c30697b7f8f55af43e99bb3470fe66cf1"}}, "hash": "3e7da08e3136e2fe12a5504387d4386c30697b7f8f55af43e99bb3470fe66cf1", "text": "Councils in accordance with the provisions of the law. \u2022 The citizen has both the right and the duty to work. \u2022 The State protects the citizen's right of lawful ownership and right of inheritance. \u2022 Primary education is compulsory and dispensed free of charge. \u2022 The citizen has the right to get general education and vocational training in various ways. \u2022 The State and society shall create the necessary conditions for handicapped children to acquire general knowledge and appropriate job training. \u2022 The citizen has the right to carry out scientific and technical research, make inventions and discoveries, initiate technical innovations, rationalise production, engage in literary and artistic creation and 16 criticism, and participate in other cultural activities. \u2022 The citizen is entitled to a regime of health protection. \u2022 Male and female citizens have equal rights in and fields - political, economic, cultural, social, and the family. \u2022 All acts of discrimination against women and all acts damaging women's dignity are strictly banned. \u2022 The State and society shall recognize no discrimination among children. \u2022 Children enjoy protection, care and education by the family, the State and society. \u2022 Old people, infirm people and orphans without support shall receive State assistance. \u2022 The citizen shall enjoy freedom of opinion and speech, freedom of the press, the right to be informed, and the right to assemble, form associations and hold demonstrations in accordance with the provisions of the law. \u2022 The State shall promote information work the press, radio, television, cinema, publishing, libraries and other means of mass communication.

Therefore, despite the presence of constitutional and frameworks and the assurance and efforts of the UN and civil society in preventing human rights violations; abuses may still occur. The non binding nature of international agreements implies that even if a country is signatory to a declaration or a convention, there is no guarantee that these rights will be embedded in the laws of the countries and contraventions of these agreements can still occur. However, even those countries that have not ratified the International Bill of Rights must adhere to a moral code under \u201cinternational customary law which forbids: \u2022 Slavery; \u2022 Torture; \u2022 Arbitrary deprivation of life; \u2022 Arbitrary arrest and detention; \u2022 Denial of freedom of thought, conscience or religion; \u2022 Presuming a person guilty until proven innocent; \u2022 Executing pregnant women and children; \u2022 Permitting the advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred; \u2022 Denying people of marriageable age the right to marry; \u2022 Denying minorities cultural, religious or language rights. Despite these safeguards, enforcement and upholding of human Rights remains a controversial subject due to variation in interpretation and implementation across cultures. These gaps in the system, such as the inability to force actors to fulfil their obligations, make the furtherance and perpetuation of human rights extremely difficult. This is why the role of the journalist is so crucial. It is their role to report on rights violations and contraventions of international guidelines and commitments. 6.

These issues include; the international and national legal frameworks for rights, the cultural context in which the journalist is reporting, the socio-economic situation of the country or area, the environment and the political situation. All of these issues will have an impact on whether individuals are able to realize their rights in any particular situation. While a number of factors impact on the realization of human rights there are also a number of key human rights issues that need to be considered when reporting. While this list is not exhaustive nor complete, the issues discussed below have a particular 18 relevance to Asia and are worth considering when adopting a human rights based approach to reporting on social issues (which will be explored in greater detail in the following section). 6.1 Gender \u201cGender\u201d is a term referring to the socially constructed roles of men and women. They can be determined by social, political, economic, and cultural beliefs and contexts. In several parts of the world, women are tied to \u201cfemale\u201d roles and are limited to opportunities and responsibilities for the home and household\u2014missing out on educational opportunities, and other basic rights such as freedom of speech. In these cases women\u2019s voices may be stifled in public and in other areas of their lives. These ideas of the \u201cfemale role\u201d in society can result in significant violations of their rights including simple and basic human rights such as health, non-discrimination, participation, and equality of opportunity. When women are denied their voice, they are immediately limited and have lower status within social power structures. This loss of power directly affects their overall right to a livelihood, to education, and to freedom from violence, significantly increasing their chances of living at or below the poverty level. Even though all the rights addressed in international law are the same for men and women, the rights of women are explicitly addressed in the \u201cConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women\u201d (CEDAW)8, which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1979. By accepting the Convention, States agree to commit towards the eradication of discrimination against women. Within this Convention, States shall ensure that women receive: \u2022 Equal employment opportunities as men; \u2022 Free choice of profession and employment; \u2022 Equal pay for equal work; \u2022 Ability to freely choose a spouse and marry only with their free and full consent; \u2022 Equal rights and responsibilities during marriage and if it breaks up, as men; \u2022 Equal rights to decide on the number and spacing of children; \u2022 Equal rights, whether married or single, to choose a profession and occupation. As a journalist, it is important to observe how gender based inequality may be impacted by other factors. Inequality experienced by women can often be more severe depending on the age, economic status, health and ethnicity of a woman or women. Sourcing data that is disaggregated by variables such as sex, age, ethnicity and socio-economic status can help to highlight inequities and provide a valuable tool to advocate for women\u2019s rights. Further, providing the opportunities for women to talk about these issues to the media (if undertaken in a sensitive manner that does 8 \u2018Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women,\u2019 Division for the Advancement of Women: Department of Economic and Social Affairs 19 not compromise their physical safety and is cognizant of cultural mores), can also significantly contribute to furthering women\u2019s human rights. 6.2 Children In international law, children\u2019s rights are given particular priority and importance. The Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) (CRC) highlights the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of children. This convention, in addition to the convention concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour (ILO No. 182)\u201420009, the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflicts\u2014200010 and the Optional Protocol II on sexual exploitation, the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography 200011 were introduced to reinforce the inherent human rights of children and their need for special protection. For the purposes of the CRC, a child means every human being below the age of eighteen years unless under the relevant national law, majority (adulthood) is attained earlier. The Convention on the Rights of the Child states; That the rights of children should be respected and protected irrespective of the child\u2019s or his or her parent\u2019s or legal guardian\u2019s race, colour, sex, language,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "474d0e3f-8794-4e23-966a-af26e9fc0bef": {"__data__": {"id_": "474d0e3f-8794-4e23-966a-af26e9fc0bef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-rights-based-approach-journalism-training-manual-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Human Rights-Based Approach to Journalism: Training Manual Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-rights-based-approach-journalism-training-manual-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a4c0e1cd12f95fcfef46cf1525ce66cbb0bb36219b4eb50166b7615db27f6a10"}, "3": {"node_id": "43d6d0e0-ea1d-447f-a3ca-750c049d1f9a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-rights-based-approach-journalism-training-manual-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "79b9c666216babe7a6e898a2e721653ae382d07fdf1b098a947ddf4e21d975c3"}}, "hash": "9a44db6a00a8854875ffc6bf76a9d5453efe8a4612b63784f175fad6e9a600ba", "text": "religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, property, disability, birth or other status (Article 2).

In addition the CRC notes that children should be free from: economic exploitation, hazardous work and work that interferes with their education (article 32), Drugs (Article 33), sexual exploitation (Article 34), trafficking (Article 35) and torture (Article 37), These conventions highlight the particular vulnerability of children and the need, when reporting on relevant social issues, to use data that specifically examines the situation and its impacts on children. Further investigation should also be undertaken to specifically examine the impact of social issues and concerns on the rights of the most vulnerable children, including those with disabilities, those from ethnic and religious minorities, refugee children and those living in poverty. Finally, the CRC highlights that when reporting on children\u2019s issues, the right of children to be heard is critical however, most importantly the best interest of the child must always be taken into consideration. This could include; their right to have a guardian present, their right to be protected from harm (ensuring anonymity when dealing with potentially sensitive issues) and their right to freedom of expression free from intimidation and influence . 6.3 Disabled Persons The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CPD-OP)12 was adopted in 2006 and realized in 2008.

Journalists can play a role in giving voice to individuals with disabilities, and to increase media coverage and, above all, awareness of any unjust position that individuals with disabilities may face. 6.4 HIV HIV/AIDS is now a global pandemic (disease) impacting an estimated 33.2 million people including 330, 000 children worldwide. HIV/AIDS is more than a public health issue since it impacts on the enjoyment of rights of individuals that are affected. HIV/ AIDS can impact on the right to work, the right to go to school, the right to protection from abuse or violence, as well as the right not to suffer discrimination. A journalist addressing HIV/AIDS needs to promote awareness of the issue and advocate for the rights of those already affected. Increasing the public\u2019s knowledge about HIV/AIDS and providing information on issues such as contraction, symptoms, preventative measures as well as support services can contribute to behavioural change. Further, exploring the issues facing those that are affected and giving them a voice can influence policy and help reduce the social stigma they may experience. Tackling discrimination is fundamental to rights-based approaches to HIV/ AIDS. The stigma attached to HIV/AIDS can stifle public discussion resulting in poor education and knowledge of the issue. This causes the virus, and panic, to spread faster. Large numbers of deaths caused by HIV/ AIDS have heavily reduced labour, skills and knowledge, hence balanced and sensitive reporting on HIV has the potential to mobilize strong political and community support for a multisectorial approach to addressing the issue. 6.5 Education Education is a fundamental human right, and goes hand-in-hand with many other human rights, especially the right to full human development. According to international human rights law, governments are obliged to \u201ctake all appropriate legislative, administrative, and other measures\u201d to respect, protect, and fulfil an individual\u2019s right to education.13 13 International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights, Article 4 22 The right to education is also declared in the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDG), which includes the goal of providing universal primary education, globally, by the year 2015.14 The right to education is addressed in Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which not only states that education must be free, but that it should also promote understanding, help maintain peace, and strengthen human rights. Article 26: (1) Education shall be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages. Elementary education shall be compulsory. Technical and professional education shall be made generally available and higher education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit. (2) Education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. It shall promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations, racial or religious groups, and shall further the activities of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace. (3) Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children. Reporting on rights and education requires not only an examination of issues relating to attendance and access to education but also an examination of all the factors that determine a child\u2019s ability to learn such as health, nutritional status, wellbeing, safety and protection from abuse and violence, since a quality education is dependent on these factors. Reporting on human rights issues in education requires an understanding of; the quality of educational infrastructure, the quality of the curriculum (does it promote human rights and personal development?), the access children have to the school (are children safe at school? Are schools physically accessible to all the children in the areas that they service? Are the books and the equipment children need affordable? Are children of different ethnicities made welcome? Are children without the relevant language skills provided for?) Regarding the quality of teaching (are teachers all appropriately qualified?) Are teachers responsible for too many children per class and are teachers aware of human rights issues?). Data on school attendance, school drop outs and truancy disaggregated by sex, socio-economic and refugee status and ethnicity can help identify whether the rights of all children to a quality education are being met. Furthermore, children\u2019s health, their sense of wellbeing, and their feeling of safety and protection from abuse and violence are other issues that directly relate to the right to education and that need to be reported.

The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that \u201ceveryone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself [oneself] and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services.\u201d17 According to article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the state parties \u201c\u2026recognize the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.18 A rights-based approach to health implies that governments are obliged to protect and respect the right to health by being proactive and setting standards for health care provision. As a journalist identifying how often and how severely certain population groups suffer illness may reveal inequitable health care provision. Using data that is disaggregated by such variables as ethnicity, sex and age can help to highlight disparities in health resulting from social disadvantage and can help raise awareness about basic health care issues and provide a valuable tool to advocate for human rights. 6.7 The Environment The Asia-Pacific region has witnessed growing environmental problems associated with urbanization, industrialization, and poverty. The costs of environmental degradation include reduced output in production-based sectors, an irreversible loss in bio-diversity, and mounting health costs and mortality due to lack of clean water and increased pollution. Sustainable development therefore, requires a long- term strategy that addresses issues such as pollution and wasteful use of natural resources. There is no doubt that it is the poor that are disproportionately affected by the consequences of unsustainable development. Soil degradation, fresh-water scarcity, pollutants, inefficient use of land, and insufficient access to technological resources all contribute to decreasing the quality of life of those who can most ill afford the brunt of environmental mismanagement. It is also the poor who most often live on marginal lands, making those eco-systems even more fragile and resource depleted. Moreover, it should be recognized that mismanagement of natural resources and the environment not only affect the poor of the current generation but those in the next generation as well. Reporting on human rights and the environment requires investigation of environmental issues and their impact on sustainability and equity. Reporting should adhere to the principles that emerged out of the Rio Conference, ensuring that the participation and voice of those most affected are heard, that inter-generational equity issues are explored (for example, if destructive farming practices are occurring now what will this mean for the ability of future generations to farm the land?). A report focusing on the right to food, for example, would not only explore issues such as access to food and any discrimination in access to food, but would also examine whether the right to a safe and clean environment was not being violated in the process. Environmental degradation inevitably leads not only to lack of clean water and unsanitary living conditions that adversely affect the poor, but it also negatively impacts upon agricultural productivity which more often than not results in lack of sustainable livelihoods and food insecurity for the poor. From a human rights perspective reporting on the environment would also demand an examination of the impact of these issues on sustainable livelihoods. Laws, as well as economic incentives are required to protect a country\u2019s natural resource base from its illegal tapping and over use. National legislation, and national action groups, that advocate and protect a country\u2019s natural resource base, and 24 therefore ensure its sustainable use and management, are at the centre of a rights approach to the environment and the source of valuable information. 7. Human Human Rights-Based Approach (HRBA) 7.1 What is a Human Rights-Based Approach The human rights-based approach aims to ensure that projects and programmes are based on international human rights standards, that they empower those that are involved and have a strong focus on the most disadvantaged.16 The approach examines all aspects of a particular human rights issue, examining local, state and national factors, government policies and the legal", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01b9f348-6d24-4a46-b44e-d45418758bed": {"__data__": {"id_": "01b9f348-6d24-4a46-b44e-d45418758bed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-rights-based-approach-journalism-training-manual-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Human Rights-Based Approach to Journalism: Training Manual Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-rights-based-approach-journalism-training-manual-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e65533372664cbac2daa7c93ea4e62c5c063234655dba35e24f1e85e943b3687"}}, "hash": "e65533372664cbac2daa7c93ea4e62c5c063234655dba35e24f1e85e943b3687", "text": "environment to ensure that there is a holistic understanding of why a right isn\u2019t being realized. 7.2 Why Reporting on Human Rights Subjects is Important Including reports on human rights in overall news media is very important in ensuring that the public receives well-rounded and comprehensive coverage of what is occurring around them. Human rights are more than just legal issues as they directly impact on the progress and development of a country. This type of growth is essential for the national development of many countries, including Viet Nam. Increasing the awareness and knowledge of human rights also increases the public\u2019s sense of security. If they know that violations will not be ignored, and that they can rely on their local paper to report accurately and without bias on what is going on then they will be more confident in their news media sources. By expanding media coverage to include reports of human rights subjects, the public will be better informed about their rights and the rights of others, increasing their confidence and raising overall awareness. 7.3 Principles of a Rights-Based Approach The human rights-based approach is founded on certain human rights principles. These principles include; participation, accountability, non-discrimination, empowerment, and linkages to human rights standards. These principles need to be considered in a human rights-based approach so that all relevant communities and individuals involved will be able identify and articulate their rights, to actively participate in realizing their rights while also respecting others\u2019 rights to do so as well. The following is a brief description of the principles that need to be considered when a human rights based approach to journalism is undertaken. How to practically use these principles to guide your investigations and reports and the questions that will need to be considered will follow. \u2022 Linkages to human rights standards: The human rights based 16 \u2018Human RIghts in Development,\u2019 http://www.unhchr.ch/development/approaches.html \u00a9 1996-2002 Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights - Geneva, Switzerland, taken on 01/06/2008. 25 approach is linked to international human rights law and standards, which outline the minimum standards required to respect, protect and fulfil human rights. International human rights conventions, treaties, declarations and reports are the guidelines that define what basic human rights are and whether a country is meeting those rights. When reporting on social issues, journalists should refer to the human rights conventions that have been signed by their government and the UN reports on whether the country is meeting these rights in order to get a good understanding of some of the key rights issues in the country. \u2022 Participation: A human rights based approach entails a high degree of participation from all affected parties, individuals, men and women, communities, civil societies, indigenous populations, and others. Participation must be active, free, and meaningful. It is stated in the UN Declaration on the Right to Development, that participation must be \u201cactive, free and meaningful\u201d so that mere formal or \u201cceremonial\u201d contacts with beneficiaries are not sufficient. The participation of the most disadvantaged and marginalized communities should always be a priority. \u2022 Accountability: A human rights based approach identifies the \u201crights holders\u201d, as well as \u201cduty bearers\u201d(those who are responsible for protecting, respecting and fulfilling these rights), to highlight who has responsibility/accountability for ensuring rights holders\u2019 rights are realized. This principle assists in focusing on increasing the capacity of duty-bearers, including governments, individuals, local organizations and authorities, private companies, aid donors and international institutions, to meet their obligations. As noted in human rights law, duty-bearers have an obligation to progressively realize social, cultural, and economic rights. \u2022 Non-discrimination: The human rights requirement for non- discrimination demands that particular focus be given to the status of vulnerable groups, of which to be determined locally, such as minorities, indigenous peoples, impoverished groups, within the context of a rights- based approach. In order to successful abide by this principle there is a high need of disaggregated data by race, religion, sex, ethnicity, language, and other associated areas of concern in human rights.17 In carrying out these principles a journalist must include safeguards to protect against threats to the rights and well-being of these vulnerable and marginalized groups, while guarding against reinforcing any existing power imbalances. Who is interviewed, where they are interviewed, how they are interviewed and what information is reported on, should all prevent any power imbalances. \u2022 Empowerment: A human rights-based approach requires that interventions contribute to the enhancement of the capacities of rights-holders to claim and exercise their rights. Rights holders must be placed at the centre of the process.

The human rights-based approach provides a framework that emphasizes the obligation of States and duty- bearers to respect, protect and fulfil rights. When reporting, duty holders include not only government and other responsible parties but also journalists themselves. 8. Human Rights-Based Approach to Journalism 8.1 Tools for Reporting on Human Rights Subjects When reporting human rights subjects, make sure to keep the following ideas in mind: Linkages to Human Rights \u2022 Your audience will often be unaware about the idea of human rights and what it means so you need to explain the concept in a clear manner. \u2022 Always report human rights stories with the concept of \u201cHuman Rights\u201d at the forefront of the story\u2014people must learn about their rights and the rights of others from you. Non Discrimination \u2022 When adopting a human rights based approach to journalism always consider disadvantaged groups and how they may be impacted by the issue that you are reporting on. \u2022 When you are sourcing data and facts about an issue where possible, use disaggregated data. This would include data disaggregated by gender, ethnicity, socio-economic status, age, disability etc.. \u2022 When interviewing using ahuman rights based approach always be aware of possible power inequalities. Questions to ask yourself are: (1) What is the power relationship between myself and the person I am interviewing. Are they likely to be intimidated by me? Are they just giving me the answers that they think I want to hear? How can I make them feel comfortable? (2) If you are interviewing more than one person at a time be aware of the power dynamics between the people you are interviewing. Is anyone likely to feel uncomfortable stating their opinions in front of someone else? Consider the people you are interviewing. Are they all the same ethnicity? The same gender? The same socioeconomic status? If you 27 are uncertain at all and you need to interview more than one person at a time, or need to do the interview in front of others, try and ensure that those being interviewed are of the same gender, ethnicity, age group, socioeconomic status, etc.. Accountability Journalists \u2022\ufffd When reporting on human rights issues make sure that you have collected hard, indisputable facts prior to reporting. \u2022\ufffd When you first approach the person you are hoping to interview make sure that you are clear as to where you are from, exactly what you are going to ask about and what you are going to report on. Also be clear as to how you are going to report on the issue and how you want to reference the information that they may give. Ask them how they would prefer to be quoted, or whether they want to be directly quoted. \u2022\ufffd Always be sensitive to the cultural, political and social context and subject matter. For example when interviewing women on women\u2019s issues, try, where possible to have a woman journalist undertaking interviews. When interviewing those of specific ethnic background, again, where possible make sure that the journalist involved is of that cultural background and make sure that you are sensitive of the relevant cultural approach to communication. \u2022 When interviewing always consider the safety and security of the person you are interviewing. If they are likely to be threatened or subjected to any violence as a result of the interview, ensure that you interview them in a safe place and that their identities remain anonymous when you are reporting about the issue. If you believe that they are unaware of certain risks associated with providing you with this information you must tell them up front. Protecting your interviewees is not only about journalist integrity but is also a human rights issue. Government \u2022 Where relevant, if a government is not meeting its commitments under the conventions that it has signed then note this in your report or article. It is important that journalists play a role in keeping government accountable for their obligations to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of their people.

A human rights-based approach encourages participation and empowerment. 28 These groups could provide information not only on the situation but also provide interesting solutions to some of the issues that they face. Empowerment \u2022 Where it is does not pose a security threat to those involved, ensure that those interviewed are comfortable to come to you with further information. Where relevant also provide them with information on how to contact journalists that are sensitive to their human rights issues, so that if an issue should arise they are able to go directly to a journalist who will be to support them to make the public aware of the issue. 9. Creating a Training Programme for Human Rights in Viet Nam By Professor T. Duffy 9.1 DRAFT CURRICULUM: HUMAN RIGHTS TRAINING FOR JOURNALISTS i. Introduction & Rationale The proposed training envisages the development of audience-specific programmes for: (1) Journalists currently undertaking their basic training for the profession; and (2) Various targeted \u201cin-service\u201d or life-long learning offerings which would enhance the awareness of and capacity to deal with human rights issues among experienced and currently serving media professionals in Viet Nam. The precise \u201croll out\u201d and nature of these trainings will be developed in close consultation with relevant institutions and individuals. Whether in respect of foci (1) or (2) the core objective will be to equip journalists with the basic elements of human rights knowledge, reporting and others skills, as well as human rights awareness relevant to their job. This suggested draft curriculum includes coverage of elementary content/issues in human rights. This will include the study of key UN conventions and other instruments, including audience-specific resolutions (such as the ECOSOC resolutions on Communications concerning Human Rights). 29 ii. Subject Matter & Epistemological Goals The subject matter will provide an historical perspective to provide journalists with a genuine sense of the development of human rights law, and also provide insights into particular themes (such as women\u2019s rights, children\u2019s rights, the rights of prisoners etc.). Content will be developed relevant to particular training sessions. The training will include lectures, training demonstrations and simulations, seminar and work- shop exercises and discussions, presentations by students, and consideration as to the creation of a specific UNESCO communications \u201ctool-kit\u201d for media training which would also be available on-line. As part of their participation in human rights training for journalists, students may be encouraged to assemble their personal professional logbook documenting their professional development in reporting on human rights issues. It is widely believed that the training curricula for communications professionals and journalists has (unfortunately) devoted sparse attention to human rights. This is an observation which applies quite generally, and is by no means unique to Viet Nam. The international community, through the UN system and through international NGO\u2019s such as Amnesty International (and in respect of communications, we would especially mention the role of the International Federation of Journalists), have developed and promoted measures for protecting human rights whose implementation largely depends on wide dissemination through the mass media and other avenues of communication. Such work must be conducted with appropriate cultural sensitivity and with the fullest co-operation and input from local partner organizations. The generic purpose of the proposed training is to enhance such dissemination and to raise awareness of and to equip journalists in Viet Nam to appropriately handle human rights issues. iii. Specific Objectives \u2022 To empower student and practising journalists to investigate and report on human rights issues; \u2022 By the completion of such training, participants should better understand the concept of human rights and the historical background and legal basis of human rights; \u2022 They should be better able to appropriately identify human rights issues in their own country; \u2022 They should acquire the personal and technical skills to investigate and cover human rights issues for their media; \u2022 They should acquire an appropriate sensitivity to issues of \u201chuman concern\u201d and how these might be handled in Viet Nam; \u2022 They may develop \u201csubject specific\u201d special knowledge in chosen areas of human rights (e.g. women\u2019s rights, children\u2019s rights, the rights of those with HIV/AIDS etc.) iv. Training Methodologies Lectures, work-shop and field-work training (including participation in reporting simulations), group discussions, field-visits and drafting sample reports on human rights issues. 30 v.

The fi rst, and for many years the dominant one, holds that ESR are not really \u2018rights\u2019 in the full sense of the term, but are essentially aspirations. Ideally, governments should take them into account, but it should be understood that no great urgency can attach to their realization. Their fulfi lment will always be dependent upon the \u2018availability of resources\u2019, as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights puts it, and the inescapable reality is that those resources will always be in scarce supply, thus making it impossible for any government to make more than halting and uneven progress towards the realization of economic and social rights for its citizens. This familiar narrative is refl ected in the practice of the vast majority of governments, despite their regular protestations that they hold economic and social rights to be of the highest importance. The second narrative is one that is put forward by enthusiastic proponents of economic and social rights and draws strength from the clear commitments contained in a range of international treaties, such as the Covenant and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It posits that these rights can be considered in virtually all respects to be the equivalent of the more traditional civil and political rights, whose importance, at least in theory, is generally uncontested by governments and others. It can also be assumed that resources are or should be available. The challenge therefore is to ensure constitutional recognition, to adopt legislation, and to empower the courts to enforce economic and social rights in the same way that they treat other human rights.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d6b499cd-839e-412f-8c19-67ea772e5657": {"__data__": {"id_": "d6b499cd-839e-412f-8c19-67ea772e5657", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c7e07dbc66eca26e5ebf848a2382605919033bb080d070735a57082a1f31d41a"}, "2": {"node_id": "82e7776f-2319-4051-9280-8565f1ab054e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8e1627cf72c9cafff15297fe722ff9fe1f4f2793ec54ae0250ed0e1ec1c3b1de"}}, "hash": "0fb8c95d5aeca78e6b2d88d5f34ddfbb9cc0018a78c35a2b4ed07badc7734936", "text": "In essence, the expectation is that the legislators and the lawyers, acting hand in hand, can make the world a welcoming and hospitable place for economic and social rights.

And those in turn depend on the structures of a society and the attitudes and strategies adopted by those competing for access to existing or potential resources. A society can choose to \u2018afford\u2019 to guarantee a decent minimum existence to even the poorest of its citizens if the political will is there. The political system is always about trade-offs; the problem is just that the interests of the poor are almost always traded off in favour of those of the elites. Poverty, as the authors put it so bluntly, \u2018is created by societies and governments. It is about exclusion, physical and economic insecurity, fear of the future, a constant sense of vulnerability.\u2019 Understanding that reality also serves to highlight the essential interrelationship of civil and political rights with economic and social rights. Too often, proponents of the latter prescribe strategies and visions which separate out the two sets of rights, as though one could ever be achieved without the other. The point is not only that there are few, if any, compelling, watertight distinctions between the two types of rights, but that even those whose overwhelming concern is with economic and social rights will need to give careful consideration to the civil and political rights conditions which will be conducive to the achievement of their objectives. This emerges very clearly in the emphasis attached in this book to the need for meaningful public participation in the shaping of societal goals, and in the design and implementation of the means by which those goals can be brought to fruition. The authors speak with particular authority, insight, and persuasiveness when dealing with the challenges involved in giving constitutional signifi cance to economic and social rights and to the principles underlying the MDGs. I doubt that any constitutional lawyer has been involved in the drafting of as many constitutions in diverse countries around the world as has Yash Ghai over a period of many years. Certainly none are as subtle and nuanced in their analysis of the issues that should be taken into account. Where others see a single model frozen in time, he sees a document which will and should change over time and which needs to refl ect the true values and priorities of the peoples in whose name the constitution is to be adopted. Where others see the struggle for a constitution to be located essentially in the drafting and adoption processes, he wisely observes that the \u2018fortunes of a constitution are shaped by many factors: personalities and elites, political parties and other organizations, social structures, economic changes, traditions of constitutionalism.\u2019 In his vision, it is the people who are the ultimate guardians of the constitution. A dazzling set of constitutional provisions, a highly empowered judiciary, and sophisticated institutional arrangements are likely to amount to all FOREWORD xiii too little in the absence of social awareness and mobilization. Seen in this light, there is every reason why a commitment to the fulfi lment of economic and social rights should be included in constitutions and the book offers a deeply informed and clear-sighted analysis of how this might be done. A great deal of literature in recent years has addressed the issue of justiciability, or the role that judges can play in giving effect to economic and social rights provisions, whether constitutional or legislative in nature. Again, the authors eschew the unrealistic extremes which claim either that judges should have no role in such decision-making or that they should be comprehensively involved. Instead, while recognizing that the principal responsibility falls on \u2018politicians and administrations, and the sanctions will be primarily political\u2019, they nonetheless point to important, but carefully defi ned, roles that courts can and generally should play. Perhaps the greatest strength of this book is that it explains in a readily comprehensible and unpretentious way the framework and assumptions of human rights law and policy and the ways in which they can be used to promote the realization of economic and social rights in general, and the Millennium Development Goals in particular. But the reader should also be aware that this straightforward and compelling presentation is based on a deep and sophisticated understanding, born of many years of practical engagement by the authors at every level in the enterprise of making a reality of all human rights across a wide range of developing societies. If read and acted upon by ordinary citizens, activists, and policy- makers, the prescriptions contained in this book can go a long way to bring about the deep transformation of the societies in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "98eaa250-1896-4f53-ae54-8b6f9cbe38c9": {"__data__": {"id_": "98eaa250-1896-4f53-ae54-8b6f9cbe38c9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ea013386b81815f191cecd40ed99790f6bb7f50bc82185b937d083225d42d73d"}, "3": {"node_id": "ca7410e8-84b5-4d9c-bdf9-52aba991a72e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "33dee25e9d1a48089c150f595890cc8f3f67314d53dc4f7d0953bbeae7635450"}}, "hash": "c932a3ae722ab1b205288435edf5a9d97eecab4daa83169f1afc7be02c9641c6", "text": "which we live and thus to make a reality of the fi ne sentiments so often proclaimed in the name of human rights but so determinedly neglected in reality. Philip Alston John Norton Pomeroy Professor of Law New York University Preface The UNDP Asia Pacifi c Regional Centre (APRC) in Bangkok in collaboration with the UN Millennium Campaign presented a challenge: they wanted someone to write a small book that looked at how achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) might be enhanced through reliance on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ESCR), and specifi cally through the incorporation of those rights into constitutions. The authors\u2019 academic backgrounds had, rather than convincing them that ESCR might achieve MDGs \u2014or MDGs achieve ESCR\u2014instilled in them some degree of scepticism. Surely MDGs were not really based on rights, they over- simplifi ed the situation by focussing on specifi c goals and time frames, and ignoring the context of poverty, they were too \u2018top\u2013down\u2019. At best MDGs and rights were, in the words of the title of a famous article by Philip Alston \u2018Ships that pass in the night\u2019. Nonetheless, the challenge was irresistible. Having taught human rights, especially at the University of Hong Kong, including ESCR, and being involved at the time with the Constitution Advisory Support Unit in UNDP Kathmandu, advising on the constitution-making process in Nepal, we were also aware of the appeal that the idea of the MDGs has (indeed we walked to our offi ces every day past MDG posters). We believed passionately that a constitution, especially in developing countries, ought to address issues of poverty and marginalization. So we set aside our scepticism. This book is not an academic book, but was written having in mind primarily people who might be involved in constitution-making or constitution-operation. It does not raise or confront the issues of the theoretical relationships between the MDGs and the ESCR; we worked within the premise set for us by UNDP. But we hope that the book also contains ideas and material of interest to students studying human rights, especially those who have an interest in \u2018National Protection of Human Rights\u2019 \u2014to use the title of a course in which we both taught in Hong Kong, and that refl ects what we believe is a fundamental aspect of human rights. xvi PREFACE We are grateful to UNDP and UN Millennium Campaign for the stimulus, and specifi cally to Nicholas Rossellini, Deputy Regional Director, Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacifi c, UNDP, Minar Pimple, Regional Director, the UN Millennium Campaign Asia and the Pacifi c Regional Offi ce, and Pauline Tamesis, Democratic Governance Practice Leader, UNDP APRC for their valuable support of the project. Special appreciation should be given to R. Sudarshan and Ruangkhao Ryce Chanchai for patiently shepherding the project. We are grateful also to the students in those Hong Kong classes (drawn from many countries), to the people with whom we have worked on constitution-making, especially in Nepal, and in Yash Ghai\u2019s case, especially in Kenya. Finally we are indebted to Philip Alston, whose distinguished career has included chairing the UN Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, and being Special Adviser to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on the MDGs, for kindly agreeing to commit some of his time, so heavily committed in other ways, to write the Foreword. Nairobi, Yash Ghai and Jill Cottrell November 2010 PART I Human Rights and Human Development In this part of the book, we look at the basic building blocks of our topic: the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the notion of rights, especially socio-economic rights, and constitutions. Some people may want to skim this part (as elementary) and concentrate more on Part II where the focus is on how one makes a constitution to achieve rights (and, thereby, the MDGs). 1. POVERTY: A REFLECTION The MDGs are essentially about people who are caught up in poverty and have few means to extricate themselves from its tentacles. Therefore, it is important to understand the nature of poverty and its relationship to human rights. In this way, we build a link between MDGs and human rights, and then to the fulfi lment of human rights within an individual nation, especially through its constitutional framework which is the main focus of this book BOX NO.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ca7410e8-84b5-4d9c-bdf9-52aba991a72e": {"__data__": {"id_": "ca7410e8-84b5-4d9c-bdf9-52aba991a72e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ea013386b81815f191cecd40ed99790f6bb7f50bc82185b937d083225d42d73d"}, "2": {"node_id": "98eaa250-1896-4f53-ae54-8b6f9cbe38c9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c932a3ae722ab1b205288435edf5a9d97eecab4daa83169f1afc7be02c9641c6"}}, "hash": "33dee25e9d1a48089c150f595890cc8f3f67314d53dc4f7d0953bbeae7635450", "text": "1.1 FROM THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION \u2018We will spare no effort to free our fellow men, women and children from the abject and dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty, to which more than a billion of them are currently subjected.

Poverty is created by societies and governments. It is about exclusion, physical and economic insecurity, fear of the future, and a constant sense of vulnerability. This 2 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS perspective on poverty is sustained by the concept of human rights which, with its overriding theme of human dignity, alerts us to the multiple dimensions of the human person. Indeed, to secure an insight into the nature of poverty we should examine how it negates the realization or enjoyment of human rights. The essential purpose of human rights and a life of dignity, is rendered impossible by extreme poverty. It is obvious that poor people enjoy disproportionately small measures of economic rights like education, health, and shelter. Moreover, they are equally unable to exercise civil and political rights, which require not only an understanding of the dynamics of society and access to public institutions, but, also, confi dence in them. They are, for the most part, unable to use the legal process to vindicate their human and legal rights. Poverty may compel people into the violation of the rights of others, particularly of their own children and women. Millions of families, throughout the third BOX NO. 1.2 POVERTY AND RIGHTS \u2018Poverty must be viewed not just as a question of low income, but as a human condition characterized by the sustained deprivation of the capabilities, choices, and power necessary for the enjoyment of fundamental civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights.\u2019\u2014Mary Robinson \u2018Poverty means not just insuffi cient income and material goods, but also a lack of resources, opportunities, and security which undermines dignity and exacerbates the poor\u2019s vulnerability. Poverty is also about power: who wields it, and who does not, in public life and in the family. Getting to the heart of complex webs of power relations in the political, economic and social spheres is key to understanding and grappling more effectively with entrenched patterns of discrimination, inequality and exclusion that condemn individuals, communities and peoples to generations of poverty.\u2019\u2014Louise Arbour \u2018Basic human rights\u2014the right to a decent standard of living, to food and essential healthcare, to opportunities for education or decent work, or to freedom from discrimination\u2014are precisely what the world\u2019s poorest need most.\u2019\u2014Kofi Annan \u2018We commit ourselves to the goal of eradicating poverty in the world, through decisive national actions and international cooperation, as an ethical, social, political and economic imperative of humankind.\u2019\u2014Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development, 1995 HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT 3 world, perceive child labour as essential to their survival and, increasingly, prostitution seems inescapable. Bonded labour is a direct result of poverty and its exploitation by the well off. Studies have shown that men, unable to support their families, can draw away, burdening the women with additional responsibilities. Poverty creates or reinforces divisions within the family in which the male members get priority over scarce family resources. The daily struggles of the poor constantly humiliate them and register for them their helplessness in the face of the State and economy. Poverty is about the lack of qualities that facilitate a good life, defi ned in terms of access to the conditions that support a reasonable physical existence and enable individuals and communities to realize their spiritual and cultural potential\u2014opportunities for refl ection, artistic creativity, development of and discourse on morality, and contribution to and participation in the political, social, and economic life of the community. Poverty is a mockery of the concept of the \u2018autonomous individual\u2019 which lies at the heart of the dominant tradition of human rights. Existence in hovels without the basic amenities of life, allows no time or ability for self-refl ection which is essential for identity, for self-realization, or for making moral judgments, and undermines self confi dence. Dependence, arising from extreme poverty, generates habits of subservience and docility, reinforcing a hierarchy in social and economic relations that denies, as do other aspects of poverty, the underlying premise of equality and dignity of all persons.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ab9a1d24-4718-4e48-aa40-8182bf69a0ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "ab9a1d24-4718-4e48-aa40-8182bf69a0ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7de31a0c56985a73878cf7b31a2d2d3f941d4ffd0f1632d2553c2df6977f6fa4"}, "2": {"node_id": "ccbe6ce5-5d6f-40ef-b893-cb3b60d48703", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3472141f88995137cb0657cd8d638bec7785e8699bcf9b9a9f525dfd03112e2e"}}, "hash": "336786b81724a13e4d5982126f80e6bbc8d8f73e2769c141d8dac2bf2875aea4", "text": "It was in the belief that poverty could be eradicated that the Heads of States and Governments committed the UN and its member states to the Millennium Declaration. 2.

The Millennium Declaration is a sort of global New Year\u2019s Resolution, moved by a vision of a world in which the founding principles and Charter of the United Nations would become a reality. The Declaration was adopted by leaders of 189 member countries, including the heads of states or governments. 4 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS The vision includes: respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms \u2022 the rule of law and good governance \u2022 making the right to development a reality for everyone \u2022 more generous development assistance \u2022 sustainable development \u2022 special regard for the neediest countries and people and for certain \u2022 principles to guide international relations, which included: \u00ba Freedom \u2014including dignity, freedom from hunger, and the fear of violence, oppression or injustice, which were best assured by democratic and participatory governance based on the will of the people \u00ba Equality for individuals and nations, and especially with equal rights and opportunities for women and men Solidarity, meaning that costs and burdens of meeting the \u00ba challenges must be fairly distributed in accordance with equity and social justice \u00ba Tolerance involving mutual respect among people, regardless of diversity of belief, culture, and language, cherishing of differences \u2018as a precious asset of humanity, and promotion of a culture of peace and dialogue among all civilizations\u2019 \u00ba Respect for nature Shared responsibility among all nations of the world for \u00ba managing worldwide economic and social development, as well as threats to international peace and security. The document was adopted without a vote. This meant that the Declaration won the full endorsement of the international community. However, it also refl ected that it was not viewed as a legally binding document. 2.1 MDGS AND TARGETS Out of the Declaration, with its ringing words about human rights and justice, was carved a series of more specifi c goals. These, and not the full Declaration, are what the MDGs mean. They were trimmed and slightly reshaped and took the following form: 1. Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger 2. Achieve universal primary education 3. Promote gender equality and empower women 4. Reduce child mortality HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT 5 5. Improve maternal health 6. Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases 7. Ensure environmental sustainability 8. Develop a global partnership for development. If a large number of countries, with different interests and philosophies, are to agree to anything, it will usually have to be rather vague and non- controversial. No country could admit to disagreeing with any of these goals. In fact, all these goals interact with each other. For example, all of Goals 2\u20138 could be considered ways to achieve Goal 1. Goals 2, 4, and 5 will help achieve Goal 3. Goal 2 will help achieve Goals 4 and 5. We can represent this diagrammatically, using goals 1\u20137: If the goals had been left like that, nothing more would have been achieved than by the thousands of resolutions entered into over the decades since the making of the UN Charter in 1945 and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) in 1948. Astutely, it was realized that something more was needed to engage the specifi c commitment of countries, and the imagination of their peoples. That something more, it was decided, was a set of specifi c targets by fi xed dates so that it was possible to know whether objectives had been achieved, or by how much the world had fallen short. FIGURE 1.1 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MDGS Environmental sustainability End poverty and hunger Universal primary education Empower Women Child mortality Maternal health Combat disease 6 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS The targets have both kept the MDGs alive and have been the cause of the greatest criticism. For many targets the year 2015 was taken\u2014so that, taking 1990 as a baseline, twenty-fi ve years were given for the achievement of the targets. Here are the specifi c targets set against the goals: 1. Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger Halve, between 1990 and 2015, the \u2022 proportion of people whose income is less than one dollar a day Achieve full and productive employment \u2022 and decent work for all, including women and young people Halve, between 1990 and 2015, the \u2022 proportion of people who suffer from hunger 2. Achieve universal primary education Ensure that, by 2015, children everywhere, \u2022 boys and girls alike, will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling 3.

However, except for Goal 8, the targets are reasonably clear and it would be reasonably possible to decide whether they had been achieved. It was not intended that the targets should be the end\u2014if by 2015 half the people living without drinkable water and decent sanitation could have been taken out of that group, a lot of knowledge would have been gained about how to do it, and completing the process would, perhaps, be easier. The document you are reading is not intended to analyse these goals critically but to serve a more immediately practical purpose, namely to be of use to the citizens of countries struggling to achieve the goals, and to organized civil society and offi cials and public bodies in those countries, especially those that are drafting new constitutions or revising old ones. It should be useful, even to those in countries that already have protection of the rights most relevant to the MDGs in their laws or constitutions. 2.1.1 Global or National Targets These goals and targets are set in terms of improvement of the conditions of the world\u2019s population. That is an appropriate target for the UN and for donor countries. Nevertheless, for the countries where most of the deprived people live, the question is how were their targets to be set? These targets were not designed to be one-size fi ts all.1 Countries were allowed to modify the targets for good reasons, and, \u2018No stigma should be associated with setting national targets that are less ambitious than the global MDGs'. Some developing countries had already achieved some of the goals\u2014for example, universal primary education. Some countries have revised targets because of their special needs, such as countries with particularly serious HIV epidemics, which have laid even more emphasis on targets under Goal 6. Cambodia added a new goal, related to mine clearance, because of the problems remaining after various wars that had left the country scattered with mines that constantly maim people, especially children. 2.1.2 Indicators A target is something one aims at. An indicator is a measure used to show whether one\u2019s arrow is heading for the target. The MDG targets are limited, indeed you could say they are themselves benchmarks of progress towards the goals. To take one example, if the proportion of people living on less than one dollar a day is halved, this is an indicator that progress is being made in tackling poverty. However, it is not the same as eliminating poverty.

These are supposed to be relevant and robust measures of progress, to be clear and straightforward to interpret, provide a basis for international comparison, constructed from well-established data sources, be quantifi able, and be consistent to enable measurement over time.2 They generally unpack the targets. For example, to measure progress towards Goal 2 of universal primary education, already having the target of \u2018ensuring that by 2015, children everywhere, boys and girls alike, will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling\u2019, there are more specifi c indicators of whether the progress is \u2018on target\u2019: Net enrolment ratio in primary education \u2022 Proportion of pupils starting grade 1 who reach grade 5 \u2022 Literacy rate of 15\u201324-year-olds \u2022 Each of these can be measured quite precisely in any country, assuming that fi gures are available. If only the fi rst had been measured, we would not be sure that children were fi nishing school. If only the second was measured, we would not know how many children, who ought to be starting school, actually did so. Finally, the third measure helps judge whether children learn something useful at school. The World Bank has laid down guidelines for measuring these various social phenomena. Similar disaggregated measures exist for other targets. The information may be compiled by many different bodies, including agencies within the countries as well as international bodies. So much importance is given to these ways of measuring progress that it is possible to consult various sources of information including an Online Atlas of MDGs.3 However, we can fi nd more indicators as well. For example, staying with primary education, we fi nd a map showing percentage of spending on primary education per student in relation to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per head, which may be as little as 10 per cent, or as much as 20 per cent or more. The highest is Mali at 30 per cent, and the lowest Ecuador and Republic of Congo (Brazzaville) at 3 per cent though information is missing for many countries. 2.1.3 Support for the MDGs Achieving even the limited targets set out for the MDGs requires a huge investment, from the countries most closely concerned, from other countries in the global partnership, and from various international organizations that are also involved. Not just fi nancial investment, but 10 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS investment in terms of planning, assistance, and monitoring. Even though the time scale is not long, it was decided not to wait until 2015 and then ask, \u2018Have we got there?\u2019 The idea was to coordinate and target support, and to watch constantly whether countries, and the world as a whole, were heading towards achievement of the goals. Various organizations have their own mechanisms for supporting and monitoring the MDGs.4 A group of task forces prepared reports on how to achieve specifi c goals. Looking at education, as an example, there was a task force report on achieving primary education which offers a rigorous set of interventions that countries can choose from to help provide universal access to high-quality education by focussing on hard-to-reach groups of people, educating girls and women to break the cycle of low education, and strengthening educational opportunities for adolescents.5 The United Nations (UN) support responsibility has been taken over by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).6 Other UN agencies involved include UNEP, FAO7, WHO, and UNICEF (which produces a report card on Maternal Mortality).8 Overall, a huge international effort is focussed on the achievements of the MDGs. One \u2018half-way\u2019 report wrote of it as \u2018the greatest multilateral non-military campaign ever, and the most-ambitious concerted effort in history to address world poverty and underdevelopment\u2019.9 3. RIGHTS \u2018I have a right\u2019 or \u2018we have a right\u2019 is a very special claim. It implies that the thing to which there is a right has priority over others\u2019 entitlements, or perhaps even a nation\u2019s interest. However, the question is what are rights, especially human rights and where do they come from? There are at least three levels where human rights are protected: the international, the regional, and the national. They have become increasingly intertwined.

The United Nations Charter had already committed its member states to respecting human rights, giving prominence to \u2018fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT 11 the human person\u2019. The UDHR sets out the human rights that members must respect and protect (see Box 1.3). However, its signifi cance goes beyond listing rights, and includes the rationale of human rights and their implications for the relationship between a state and its citizens, as well as relations between states. It is clear that the UN intended to bring about a new world order in which the framework of rights would constitute the dominant element. The Declaration establishes the fundamental principles, based on a common understanding of rights and freedoms, for that world order. It provides directions for the future development of norms and institutions, in connection with human rights for the UN and member states, which have greatly infl uenced the international system of human rights. The context for the UDHR was the World War II and the terrible atrocities committed by the Nazis in Germany on Jews and other minorities, denying their humanity, \u2018barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind\u2019. An awareness had emerged that violation of rights is not only unjust to persons or communities who are oppressed, but also produces confl icts within, and between states and societies.

Whereas \u2026 advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people. Article I All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. Article 21 1. Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives. 3. The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government. Article 25 1. Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family. 12 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS people suffered great economic hardships and the state was unable to provide suffi cient assistance. 3.1.1 Basis of Rights Rights are important for stability, for if they are not protected people will resort to rebellion against tyranny and oppression. In an increasingly interdependent world, the relations among states must also be based on respect for human rights\u2014and for this a common understanding of rights needs to be established. The reasons for a compact on human rights were, therefore, pragmatic. Nevertheless, a moral element was introduced in the form of the concept of human dignity. Human dignity encapsulates various ideas distinguishing the human person from other creatures, linking, for believers, the human person to God, or emphasizing the essence of the human person who seeks acknowledgement and self-respect, and is indirectly related to community and human solidarity. It supplied a theoretical basis for the human rights movement. Every society has a concept of human or individual dignity, so that it has a sort of universal endorsement, and promotes universal acceptance and inter-cultural dialogue. Inspired, no doubt, by the prominence given to human dignity in the UDHR, many other instruments, national as well as international, refer to human dignity. Dignity can be used to help interpret a specifi c human right. It may sometimes be used to limit the restrictions that can be placed on human rights. It can sometimes be used as a way to bring a rule of international norm into national law, occasionally with adjustment to local circumstances. Human dignity may even, though rarely, be used to develop a new right.10 An important way in which the concept has been used is to highlight the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all persons. There are many declarations by international and national tribunals that poverty denies those trapped in it any prospect of dignity. This truth is recognized in the Millennium Declaration in its fi rst value, freedom, as follows: \u2018Men and women have the right to live their lives and raise their children in dignity, free from hunger and from the fear of violence, oppression or injustice.\u2019 The UDHR implies that without rights there can be no \u2018existence worthy of human dignity\u2019.

These rights are inherent in all human beings and cannot be taken away by anyone. However, the Declaration does not see the human person pursuing individual rights, selfi shly and in isolation from society. It emphasizes the equality of all HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT 13 persons, of men and women, that can hardly be achieved other than through social programmes. In its view, rights express human solidarity (the UDHR describes all persons as members of the human family), which the Declaration reinforces by committing all peoples and states to respect for a common scheme of human rights and freedoms. It emphasizes the social character of the individual by reminding us, \u2018Everyone has duties to the community in which alone the free and full development of his personality is possible.\u2019 By these formulations the UDHR avoids sectarian explanations and justifi cations of human rights, whether based on religious or secular ideas. By placing the human person\u2019s aspirations, potential, and capacities at the core of human rights, the UDHR aims to provide a basis on which all can come together to acknowledge the importance of rights and pledge to defend them. The Declaration was drafted by an international committee and endorsed by the General Assembly\u2014by representatives of governments. Nevertheless, it is important to remember that rights are not bestowed by governments, but are the product of the struggles of peoples and communities against unjust regimes. It is the poor and the downtrodden who have been at the forefront of struggles, for it is they who are most in need of protection of their rights. The rich and the powerful can generally take care of their interests in other ways, by their control or infl uence over those who exercise state power\u2014and, indeed, by violating the rights of others. This is as true in the present stage of globalization as it was in earlier periods of history. The primary function of human rights at fi rst was to protect those well placed in society against unfair and arbitrary acts of the government, often of autocratic monarchs. Later, the primary function of human rights became the protection of those marginalized in society, and the need for protection extended beyond the policies and acts of the government. The Declaration proclaims the civil, political, and cultural rights of the people for freedom from fear, and social and economic rights for the freedom from want. It sees no confl ict in these rights, rather they are regarded as mutually supportive\u2014the Declaration promises the promotion of \u2018social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom.\u2019 Civil and political rights, economic and social rights are equally binding and enforceable. Obligations and duties that arise from human rights are to bind all states and every individual and every organ of society is to advocate for and protect human rights. The Declaration recognizes different interests and provides a framework for their balancing; community interests balanced 14 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS with individual, social and economic rights with civil and political rights, based on the framework of human dignity, the full development of individuals\u2019 personality, and democratic principles. Unfortunately, ideological and material confl icts between the western capitalist and communist states, dominant international forces in the period immediately after the UN was established, obscured the unity of rights and led to the denigration of economic and social rights. Now, the MDGs, although not cast in the language of rights, have pointed to the importance of a life of dignity with adequate material resources. The Millennium Declaration has drawn attention to the social and economic rights by having Heads of States and Governments commit themselves to, \u2018To respect fully and uphold the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\u2019 (Para 25 of the Millennium Declaration). 3.1.2 COMMITMENT TO RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS The UN saw the signifi cance of the UDHR as going beyond rhetoric. This is obvious from its concern with implementation and remedies. The preamble notes the pledge of member states to respect and protect human rights and states that human rights must be protected by the rule of law. It requires effective remedies by the competent national tribunals for acts violating the fundamental rights of a person. Even more radically, it grants to every one \u2018a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration can be fully realized.\u2019 This means no less than that all values and institutions of a state11 and the global system of international", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5dd2a4db-613a-490d-9ceb-d5f001e0bedf": {"__data__": {"id_": "5dd2a4db-613a-490d-9ceb-d5f001e0bedf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f0658f5f0ac4b7cddc5da0f9844a440bed4ce817ccc5931d732dbd89c06a952b"}, "3": {"node_id": "305441b8-8d4e-4819-a4fe-60ee78f56b1c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "848e50292292b59eee02c57454b0f53997ce5fb9a77a866b0c67ccf1a27a7bad"}}, "hash": "b754b9b8170ec6d7d1c772ef2e0ea5d94ae592078b8831b394cd4867e44bf4c4", "text": "relations, including the economic order, must be human rights friendly, giving primacy to the imperatives of human rights and freedom, including social justice. 3.2 INTERNATIONAL, REGIONAL, AND NATIONAL SYSTEMS OF HUMAN RIGHTS The UDHR provides, as we have seen, a holistic conception of rights, of the diversity of entitlements which speak of different human needs and aspirations, of the obligations and mechanisms that make rights effective, and of international responsibility and cooperation for the promotion and protection of human rights. Although the intention was to provide the agenda for future programmes at the national and the international levels, the UDHR has achieved the status of a resolution that is binding on and in all states, regardless of whether they voted for it or not. It was followed by a number of international conventions and institutions to advance its objectives and procedures. There is a considerable widening of the range of entitlements of citizens and others, transforming people from supplicants HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT 15 to citizens. The broadening of human rights has focussed attention on the state, not merely as protector and facilitator but also as provider. The logic of social, economic, and cultural rights is a positive obligation of the state, necessitating an active role to ensure basic needs of people and, thus, their dignity. With globalization and the shift of economic and even political power to large corporations and international fi nancial institutions, their obligations to respect and observe human rights have received increasing attention. 3.2.1 The International System Human Rights Norms Although the UDHR is, in a sense, binding on all members states, that binding quality has no real teeth. This is why the UN decided to develop binding treaties on rights, including the two Covenants in 1966. Over the years, as a range of new treaties have been developed, dealing with the rights of specifi c sections of society. Many of these include socio-economic rights. By no means have all of these states accepted all the various human rights treaties. Table 1.1 shows how many states are parties to various treaties. TABLE 1.1: MAJOR HUMAN RIGHTS TREATIES Treaties and Conventions on Rights No. of Countries International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) (1966) 156 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966) (ICESCR) 159 Convention on the Rights of the Child (1984) (CRC) 193 Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (1979) (CEDAW) 185 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (1965) (CERD) 173 Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability (2006) (CRPD) (138 countries had signed but some had not yet ratifi ed) 44 These are the best known and include the main ones with socio- economic rights. Others include the Genocide Convention (1948) and the Convention against Torture (1984). Other notable developments are 16 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS instruments for the protection of the indigenous peoples (the International Labour Organization [ILO] conventions and the Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples) and Minorities (the Declaration of the Rights of Minorities), which provide rights both for individuals belonging to these communities and the collective rights of the communities. The covenants and conventions, unlike Declarations, are legally binding on member states which have ratifi ed them. In this way states have assumed responsibility for a large number of rights of different kinds. However, states sometimes limit their commitment to these instruments. For example, the CRC, the most ratifi ed of human rights treaties, has also been accepted only with certain reservations by some seventy countries. Many of these are Islamic countries reserving the right to apply Islamic law, even if not compatible with the Convention. Several say they may not always be able to separate child from adult prisoners. Canada says that provisions about regulating adoption may not be compatible to indigenous people\u2019s childcare practices. India undertook to implement the provision on minimum age for employment only progressively. Kiribati said the rights of the child to express views, hold opinions, assemble, associate with others, and privacy should be exercised only with respect for parental authority. Singapore reserved the right to free primary education only for the children of its citizens.

It is possible for a member state to bring a complaint before the committee for violation of treaty obligations by another member state\u2014but this hardly ever occurs. Under some treaties, an individual can bring a complaint before the committee against a government for treaty violation. The committee\u2019s decision is not strictly binding, but a state is expected to comply with it\u2014though compliance rates vary. Considerable use is made of this procedure, which has enabled the committee to interpret treaty provisions, to clarify, and sometimes expand the scope of the right. Committee may also issue general comments on particular rights, contributing to the general understanding of the right. International HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT 17 and national courts are making increasing use of such interpretations and decisions as precedents. Another initiative by the UN to develop the content of rights and ensure their observance is the system of Special Representatives of the Secretary General of the Council on Human Rights to conduct periodic reviews of the observance of rights, either in a specifi c state or in respect of a specifi ed right, and to make recommendations for improvement or offer specifi c assistance. They submit their reports to the Council on Human Rights, although the council cannot do much about the report or recommendations. The Council on Human Rights has the general responsibility to promote human rights, including the audit of the record of member states through a peer review process. The change to this body from the former Commission on Human Rights was intended to provide a more effective body committed to human rights, although it is too early to assess its impact. It is served by the Offi ce of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, which also assists the treaty bodies and special representatives and rapporteurs, and manages a few country offi ces to monitor the human rights situation and to provide assistance to countries such as Cambodia, Nepal, and the South Pacifi c states. The UN bodies are very important. The work of the various treaty bodies and the special rapporteurs has been crucial in developing the ideas set out in the various human rights treaties in a rather broad way. A country that is thinking of ratifying a human rights treaty, or including new human rights provisions in its constitution or law, will fi nd a great deal of help from the work of these bodies in understanding what the implications are. However, the entire mechanism is seriously under- funded. There is not enough time to consider the record of individual countries. The preparation of regular reports is a considerable burden, even on states with effi cient bureaucracies. Developing countries often fall seriously into arrears. Now, the treaty bodies will consider a country\u2019s record on the basis of other information as well as on submissions by national Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and others. However, this defeats one of the objectives of the system, which is to prompt an internal refl ection on a country\u2019s own record. Within many countries, reporting to the treaty bodies and their comments is a non-event. Little effort is made to publicize this at the national level and the media either does not understand or ignores the system.12 A major weakness is the lack of effective machinery for dealing with redressals for violation of rights in a routine sort of way. Apart from the 18 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS individual complaints mechanisms\u2014recently adopted for the ICESCR, but not yet in force,13\u2014some special rapporteurs on specifi c rights will take up individual cases or issues, raising them with the government concerned, though they have no power to require any response.14 An increasingly important aspect of the international role in protecting rights is giving guidance to individual countries or to countries, generally, about how to bring their obligations home, in the form of laws, policies, and practices. The making of national laws is often called the domestication of international law. Various UN bodies, international NGOs (INGOs), and academic bodies collect examples of ways in which international laws have been brought into national law.

There is also a somewhat inactive Arab system, in which the operative treaty came into effect only in 2008. The main elements of regional systems are a human rights treaty (sometimes more than one) and one or more regional bodies with varying functions, such as education, monitoring, receiving and studying reports from states, receiving complaints from groups of individuals, adjudicating, sometimes awarding compensation. Table 1.2 compares the main features of the four systems that exist. These various supra-national systems of human rights protection do not work as rivals but generally in complementary ways. For example, the African Commission makes considerable use of the work of the UN committees, including that on the elaboration of rights. Indeed, its Charter directs it to draw inspiration from international instruments and to use international precedent.

The decisions of its Court of Human Rights are quite widely cited in national courts, even outside Europe. 3.2.3 National Systems of Human Rights Protection In one sense, national protection is the most critical. Despite the development of international and regional systems, the primary responsibility for human rights remains that of the State and it is at the national level that policies and decisions are made which have the greatest importance for the enjoyment of rights. Therefore, the constitution and laws, and local enforcement methods will be the main focus for the citizen of a particular nation seeking recognition of human rights, and it is on the actions, or inactions, of the national governments that the main criticisms by international or regional bodies will concentrate. A national system of human rights protection will be far more complex than any international or regional mechanism. It will involve not only institutions and rules that are designed for human rights protection, but a whole range of bodies, laws, and practices. In Part II we look briefl y at the constitution as a whole, in terms of its protection of rights. Here, it is enough to note that in a particular country human rights and their protection may depend on: The constitution and other major laws (in some countries there \u2022 are organic laws that have a status between the constitution and ordinary laws) Bodies for accountability including parliament, the ombudsmen, \u2022 human right commissions, police complaints bodies, anti- corruption bodies, and so on The institutions of democracy, such as the electoral system, political \u2022 parties, and local government Bodies for law enforcement, including the Attorney General, the \u2022 police, prosecutors, and the courts \u2022 Administrative policies and practices\u2014the way in which the laws and the institutions actually operate The political culture\u2014traditions, attitudes, and practices in public \u2022 life 24 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS The media\u2014how they work, who owns them, how they are \u2022 regulated, and what are their traditions and cultures Business and commercial activity, and the world of work\u2014who \u2022 controls what, how far the economy is controlled locally or by international forces, how far the state has a direct stake in the economy, how far the state controls the economy and regulates the forces that affect incomes and resources Civil society\u2014that part of society that stands between the individual \u2022 and public institutions, that is not offi cial but is not purely private or family; associations, religious groups, and so on; and what part it plays by virtue of law, tradition, or conviction in the life of the nation, and in supporting the role of the members of society in that national life The education system\u2014which can play an important role both in \u2022 teaching people about their own rights and in developing respect for the rights of others The international community\u2014the UN, INGOs, international aid \u2022 agencies, and so on. More narrowly, a national system of human rights protection may be involved in some of the following: Formulation and adoption of human rights norms: mostly through \u2022 the constitution and other laws. Rights have traditionally been set out in the constitution. In fact, one of the fi rst modern constitutions, that of Virginia, consisted almost entirely of human rights. In New Zealand and the UK, where there is no written constitution, human rights have been adopted through ordinary laws, the Bill of Rights Act and the Human Rights Act \u2022 An important aspect of that national adoption of human rights is how far those rights are derived from international or regional treaties. Historically, rights were a national affair but now it is common to look to international and regional instruments, though not necessarily to their precise words (see pp. 90 and 104) Constitutions and major human rights laws are not the end of the \u2022 law-making aspect of human rights protection. It is Parliament\u2019s responsibility to give effect or, more precise, effect to human rights; to protect, promote, and fulfi l; to enact legislation for this purpose and to desist from making laws that violate human rights; to set up mechanisms for the enforcement of rights, particularly the jurisdiction of courts as well as non-judicial bodies; to hold HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT 25 government accountable; to determine the scope of rights by providing reasons and procedures for limitation It is also the role of the executive authority to protect and implement \u2022 human rights in accordance with the constitution and laws (as it is its duty to implement other aspects of the constitution and laws).

It is often said that human rights should form the framework for the development and the carrying out of policy (see pp. 50\u20133) The judiciary has as one of its basic functions the protection of \u2022 human rights. This is not its only function. It resolves disputes about commercial matters and many issues that may have no obvious human rights dimension. However, the way it carries out those functions, it must have regard to human rights. There will usually be other bodies specifi cally created to promote \u2022 and protect human rights. These may include human rights commissions, ombudsmen, specialized bodies such as gender commissions, minorities\u2019 commissions, equal opportunities commissions, environment and land commissions, special tribunals, and so on. The Special Role of Courts The courts are so important that it is worth saying a little more about their role. They protect and implement the constitution and laws (including human rights provisions). In most systems, they have the power, in certain circumstances at least, to decide whether existing (or perhaps proposed) laws and policies are compatible with the constitution (including human rights). Mostly, they do this because some party has brought a case arguing that a law or policy is unconstitutional, or the issue has arisen incidentally in a case. For example, even in a divorce case, where a decision must be made about which parent is to have custody of a child, it may happen that the child (or a parent) insists that under the constitution or under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the best interests of the child, not the wishes of the parents alone, are to be paramount. In some countries, a law may go before a court (usually the highest or the constitutional court) even before it is fi nally passed, or brought into force, to determine whether it is constitutional. Sometimes the power to bring such a case is restricted, perhaps to the president of the country. 26 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS A declaration by a court that a law passed by a democratically elected parliament is unconstitutional is a rather dramatic act! In fact, it is relatively rare (and in some systems is not possible). More often the courts will fi nd that they can interpret the law in a way that is compatible with human rights. In South Africa the constitution and in the UK the Human Rights Act, direct the courts to interpret the laws in a way that is compatible with human rights, if possible. In some countries, the law is partly the creation of the judges. A judge-made law is something mainly associated with England and countries that have English law, but this is a complex subject. In making, or developing, that law, must the judges be guided by human rights? In South Africa, the constitution says that they must [section 8(3)]. In Canada, the courts have said that the Charter of Rights applies to the common law, but this is true only where the case involves the State, not in cases between citizens.21 Less dramatically, but more commonly, the courts will be faced with cases about administrative actions, rather than law-making. In some countries it may be not just the actions of the state organs that are judged by human rights standards, but even those of ordinary citizens. Again, the South African constitution says that the Bill of Rights applies horizontally\u2014that is, not just the State but private persons and bodies can be obliged to respect human rights. We can also think of the courts as performing an educational function. Through their decisions, the state, its organs, and citizens learn about human rights. The courts are the site of a sort of conversation about rights. Usually, the judiciary responds to complaints by others, unlike the executive and the legislature that can act on their own initiative. The courts are also dependent on the arguments raised by lawyers for the parties, though, the courts can put points to the lawyers and, thus, elicit certain arguments. To enforce criminal law, they are dependent almost always on the police, both to investigate violations and to protect the people. If no one chooses to bring a particular violation to court, there is nothing the courts can do. In many countries, there is a serious problem of impunity or deliberate failure to enforce the law, especially against the already rich, powerful, and well connected. Sometimes, the courts can assert themselves a bit.

Competence and integrity are as essential as independence, but are perhaps harder to ensure. Much depends on the ethics of the judiciary, and of the legal profession. In some countries, faith in the judiciary survives when faith in the government and parliament has gone. However, in some countries, unfortunately, the judiciary has alienated the people and lost their trust by corruption, lack of independence from the government and powerful interests, by incompetence, or by all of these. The lack of confi dence and trust in the judiciary was vividly demonstrated in Kenya following the improper declaration of Kibaki as the president by the electoral commission. The opposition protested against the declaration but refused to go to court when challenged by Kibaki on the basis that the BOX NO. 1.4 PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATION (PIL): INDIA Indian PIL is a mixture of the substantive and the procedural, animated by the spirit of the Constitution. The key procedural features of PIL have been: the ability of organizations or groups to bring cases on behalf of others who \u2022 are unable because of disadvantage to do so informal means of beginning cases, even by letter or postcard, and \u2022 sometimes the courts have themselves initiating a case on the basis of newspaper reports proactive ways of fi nding out the facts, including the courts appointing \u2022 or ordering the appointment of committees of experts to produce reports, sometimes over a period of years requiring public bodies to report back on their own performance in \u2022 response to court orders wider range of remedies than the courts would traditionally have allowed. \u2022 Individuals, and more often NGOs, have brought before the courts, especially the Supreme Court, cases involving workers in conditions amounting to bonded labour, pavement dwellers, the starving, the mentally ill, those denied emergency medical treatment, and pollution, among others. The constitutional basis in terms of substance has generally been Article 21 (right to life), often expanded by reference to the Directive Principles. In a case that has been before the Supreme Court, since 2001, it held that there was the right to food, and it has over the years issued a large number of orders on all sorts of food-related topics and to various state bodies. The early directives were to carry out existing commitments. The Court\u2019s orders have (Contd) 28 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS related to food distribution in emergencies, school meals for children, and the position of pregnant women, for example. It also appointed commissioners on the Right to Food, who presented their 8th report in 2008\u2014on the right to food for various marginalized groups such as single women (including widows), the poorest Dalits, primitive tribal groups, urban homeless, and slum-dwellers. The environmental cases have been a bit more mixed. Some have benefi ted all sections of society and this, probably, includes the famous Delhi bus case in which the Supreme Court ordered the replacement of all diesel buses with compressed natural gas buses. However, orders to remove polluting businesses outside the city centre, to stop all activity in a forest, including by tribals, and the demolition of slum dwellings have been pro-middle class rather than pro- poor decisions and, thus, strayed from the original conception of PIL. From an approach that involved directing the state to carry out its own existing commitments, the courts have moved towards directing the state to make law, or itself laying down elaborate sets of rules. These have included criteria for foreign adoption of babies, and guidelines for dealing with emergency cases in hospital. The issues under PIL are far removed from the sort of cases that would normally be heard by the courts. They often involve the interests of various groups. There is a risk that, as is usual, the interests of the already articulate and well-represented are best presented to the courts. They are the sorts of issues that, if being decided by a government or legislature, would involve masses of material, public submissions, committees of inquiry, and detailed legislative", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eb5b2e94-c8fa-4235-9579-0e67dc7ce666": {"__data__": {"id_": "eb5b2e94-c8fa-4235-9579-0e67dc7ce666", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "537c8941dcfc076c2c8a8a4bbefe51c5355106089b929e8cda3a0f95650ec3d7"}}, "hash": "537c8941dcfc076c2c8a8a4bbefe51c5355106089b929e8cda3a0f95650ec3d7", "text": "debates. Even the most complicated of Supreme Court inquiry procedures will not rival what ought to be the level of sophistication of executive/ legislative inquiry (though such inquiries are not always so sophisticated in the governmental processes of developing polities). What happens when the highest court itself makes the legislative decisions? Here is where the separation of powers issue becomes particularly acute. There are also serious problems about implementation. The right to food cases, especially on school meals, has been successful partly because of backup from civil society campaigns. The extent and direction of judicial activism has depended in part on the personality of individual judges and on other factors in the national and international environment\u2014though this can be true of ordinary litigation, too. The verdict on Indian PIL, therefore, remains mixed. Justice Bhagwati once observed: We must always remember that social action litigation is a necessary and valuable ally in the cause of the poor, but it cannot be a substitute for the organisation of the poor, development of community self-reliance, and establishment of effective organisational structures through which the poor can combat exploitation and injustice, protect and defend their interests, and secure their rights and entitlements. Box 1.4 (contd) HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT 29 judiciary would undoubtedly rule in favour of Kibaki (the chief justice having sworn in the president in a private ceremony minutes after the declaration by the commission). The majority of Kenyans empathized with the opposition and, subsequently, Kenya paid a terrible price, in life, property, and in terms of inter-ethnic harmony, for the corruption and collapse of the judiciary. Going to the law is expensive and often the most disadvantaged groups are the least likely to know about their rights, or to have the means to pursue them through the courts. In many countries, however, a tradition has developed of Public Interest Litigation. In fact, this means many different things. The basic idea, however, is that cases can be taken to the courts that affect not just one or a few individuals but many people, and that the case may be pursued by individuals or groups that are not even personally directly affected. India was a pioneer in this sort of development; in fact the Supreme Court itself stimulated it (see Box 1.4). Later in this book, there will be some examples of PIL and quite a number of them are from India. Some of what the courts have done has been controversial but the courts in other countries have been less innovative. Methods and Obstacles at the National Level How a national system of human rights protection is actually used and how far it is effective will depend less on the constitution, international treaties, and national institutions than it does on the behaviour of citizens. We return to this in Part II. Here we simply note that citizen action may include: action at the international level\u2014using the treaty bodies , \u2022 including the procedures that may exist for individual complaints, shadow reporting, lobbying other international agencies, donors, and the like using the international machinery at the national level\u2014publicizing \u2022 the comments and recommendations of treaty bodies action purely at the national level\u2014lobbying for laws to be passed, \u2022 policies to be made, laws to be respected and implemented, which will require networking, negotiating, political action, and perhaps even legal action; publishing annual reports on the state of human rights. What are the possible obstacles to the achievement of rights? The powerful, very often, have no interest in reform or in the welfare of 30 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS the marginalized. Superfi cial political differences conceal the ultimate unity of interest between politicians and the wealthy in society. Political differences may centre around personal or ethnic interests; class interests are more powerful even than these, and class solidarity extends beyond politicians to the economic elite, and even to the courts and the professions. Exploitation of poverty, short-term grievances, and despair of the poor, divide the proletariat and marginalized groups, obscure the realities, weaken their resistance to oppression, and their will to struggle. If politics is ethnicized, the people lose sight of their real interests, convinced that the problem is people of a different ethnic group.

They may even become active protectors of violators of rights as the courts, commissions of inquiry, and prosecuting authorities are used to sanitize violations and exonerate the guilty. As a result, the rights of the marginalized are not enforced and respected, and violators benefi t from institutionalized impunity. The poor lack knowledge of their rights, lack confi dence in their own abilities and in the system, lack access to the legal system, and lack the ability to make effective use of the political process. The Role of Civil Society At all three levels (international, regional, and national), the importance of civil society is enormous. It offers the individual and the community a way to work together that does not depend on the support of vested interests, whether class or political. Civil society has become, in its many forms, the key actor in the realization of human rights by advancing proposals, auditing the performance of the public and, often, private sectors, enforcement (that is, through the use of public interest litigation), and other such actions. This is not to ignore the fact that civil society has its weaknesses. It can be co-opted, or even created, by the very powerful groups it purports to oversee. It must be funded, and in poor countries much of that funding is likely to come from overseas, from sources that may not understand the dynamics of the country where they are operating and that have their own purposes in providing funding. Furthermore, civil society groups, precisely because of that funding, may be viewed by some HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT 31 as fair game. If people are foolish enough to give us money, why should we not make the most of this chance? Many NGOs justify their existence on the need to promote rights. It is the regime of rights which has enabled NGOs to perform their promotional and investigative role, which has generally proved more effective than internal state mechanisms, for accountability. It can be said, fairly, that human rights regime has sustained civil society in its confrontation with the state. Rights are a way to mobilize and empower the disadvantaged. In many parts of the world, this is their principal function. The language of rights makes people conscious both of their oppression and the possibility of change. Rights have been extraordinarily effective as a basis of networking, in and across states. They have demonstrated the possibility of international solidarity, particularly for women and the indigenous peoples. One of the most important functions is developing a consensus on rights and interests to be protected. This is often done by interest groups\u2014women, minorities, migrants, corporations, etc. In recent years, NGOs have played an important role in lobbying for the recognition of particular interests\u2014many norms on indigenous peoples, minorities, protection against torture, and the like, owe their origin to the efforts of NGOs, both national and international. Later, these ideas may be picked up and ultimately put into international conventions, resolutions, or declarations. 3.3 WHAT RIGHTS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT We saw that the UDHR viewed all rights as similar; freedom from want is not different in kind from freedom from fear. It is regrettable that soon after it was adopted, because of international tensions and ideological differences, controversy crept into international discourse and when detailed treaties were negotiated, to make the UDHR rights legally enforceable, it was impossible to agree on one treaty. The result was that two treaties came about: the ICCPR, and the ICESCR, both signed in 1966. Civil and political rights (as set out in the fi rst treaty) include: the right to life \u2022 rights against torture, and inhuman and degrading treatment \u2022 slavery and forced labour \u2022 personal liberty and security \u2022 proper treatment for people arrested, charged with crimes, or \u2022 detained 32 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS freedom of movement \u2022 fair trials \u2022 freedom from improper interference with personal privacy or \u2022 reputation freedom of thought, conscience, or religion \u2022 freedom of peaceful assembly \u2022 freedom of association \u2022 equal rights to marry and form a family, to choose whom to marry, \u2022 and to equality within marriage equality generally, and the absence of discrimination from the \u2022 law and practices of the state (it mentions grounds such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status) rights of children to be protected \u2022 rights to take part in public affairs and to vote and to serve the \u2022", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8244e2ee-b4a5-4d55-a82e-345f2a11775a": {"__data__": {"id_": "8244e2ee-b4a5-4d55-a82e-345f2a11775a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5c195696518532d51b35da69a3bf928e1dac0fbd5c9fd5c337814e26403fcc86"}}, "hash": "5c195696518532d51b35da69a3bf928e1dac0fbd5c9fd5c337814e26403fcc86", "text": "public rights of minorities to enjoy their own culture, to profess and \u2022 practise their own religion, or to use their own language.

Because the focus of this book is the MDGs, rights, and constitutions, we shall not explore in detail the question of cultural rights (though, we shall occasionally refer to cultural issues). Henceforth we shall use the HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT 33 expression socio-economic rights. However, it is important to appreciate that the recognition of the culture, or a community, or people, may be very important for their self-confi dence, and for their ability to play a full part in society and, thus, to achieve development. Some of the international measures in connection with culture are not perhaps thought of as human rights issues. The Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions is an international convention produced and adopted under the auspices of United Nations Educational, Scientifi c and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 2005.22 Article 7 reads: ARTICLE 7 1. Parties shall endeavour to create in their territory an environment which encourages individuals and social groups: (a) to create, produce, disseminate, distribute and have access to their own cultural expressions, paying due attention to the special circumstances and needs of women as well as various social groups, including persons belonging to minorities and indigenous peoples; (b) to have access to diverse cultural expressions from within their territory as well as from other countries of the world. Though, this convention was conceived of as being centrally concerned with the protection and promotion of human creativity, its relationship to human rights is clear, even if it does not use the language of rights other than in its Preamble: Celebrating the importance of cultural diversity for the full realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other universally recognized instruments. The 1966 covenants do not cover the full range of rights now recognized by international law. We mentioned some of the other treaties earlier. Many of these spell out in relation to particular groups the rights in the 1996 covenants and also they sometimes add to those rights. We cannot look in detail at how the sectoral human rights treaties differ from the UDHR and the two covenants. Nevertheless, we can illustrate it by taking one or two examples from the CRC (the treaty signed by the largest number of countries), concentrating on socio-economic rights. Some of the changes show the impact of developments in thinking about rights over the years. Some refl ect the specifi c needs of the group in question. In the CRC there are some other rights that have no clear counterpart in the ICESCR, such as about adoption (Article 21) or protection from sexual exploitation (Article 24).

Table 1.3 contd 40 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS constitutional provisions, we shall consider how far a national constitution can and ought to make provisions about the rights of particular groups (see pp. 94\u20136). Some new rights are not specifi c to particular groups, but refl ect changing priorities and consciousness. A striking example of this is the idea of environmental rights. One might say that the environment was recognized in the ICESCR in the ideas of health, and environmental and industrial hygiene. However, a broadly accepted conception of the environment, as embracing more than drains and absence of pollution as a matter of international concern, really dates from the early 1970s. The Stockholm Declaration on the Human Environment of 1972 speaks of Man having the fundamental right to freedom in an environment that permits a life of dignity and well-being. This comes close to recognizing a right to a healthy environment. Interestingly, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development twenty years later speaks of an entitlement (perhaps a weaker word than \u2018right\u2019) to a healthy and productive life in harmony with nature. The idea of a right to a healthy or decent environment was picked up by various national constitutions, one of the earliest being the Philippines in 1987 (see more at pp. 135\u20137). An important aspect of the environment is that it is not something that only an individual enjoys, but will inevitably be something that affects a community, a region, or the planet as a whole (\u2018Man\u2019, as the Stockholm Declaration puts it). Rights, as enjoyed by a community, have featured in other international instruments. The ICCPR does mention that persons belonging to ethnic, religious, or linguistic minorities \u2018shall not be denied the right, in community with the other members of their group, to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practise their own religion, or to use their own language.\u2019 However, the right is that of the persons, and rarely would an individual exercise the right alone. More recently, rights of communities as such have been recognized. This is particularly so for indigenous peoples. In the 2007 UN General Assembly Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, a distinction is repeatedly drawn between the rights of peoples and the rights of individuals. For example article 14 reads: BOX NO. 1.5 FROM THE DECLARATION ON THE RIGHTS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES 1. Indigenous peoples have the right to establish and control their educational systems and institutions providing education in their own languages, in a manner appropriate to their cultural methods of teaching and learning. 2. Indigenous individuals, particularly children, have the right to all levels and forms of education of the State without discrimination. (ARTICLE 14) HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT 41 Some rights really apply only to a group as a whole\u2014either because this is the way they are expressed, as with Article 14(1) of the declaration or because of their nature. Nevertheless, other rights may be exercised by individuals because they are part of a group and may not be claimed as rights of the group, as such. Group rights have been controversial\u2014many people believing that rights can only belong to individuals and not to groups. 3.3.1 Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights: Myths and Prejudices Talking to lawyers about socio-economic rights can often be a discouraging business. You might hear them say things like: \u2018Socio-economic rights are only aspirations.

As a result of such attitudes, you may fi nd lawyers arguing that when it comes to constitution-making, it is not necessary to have a lot of public participation. Why not? Because the people, especially in poorer countries, will say that what they really care about is food and water, education for their children, medical services, roads (especially so they can have markets for their goods), and being able to work and earn for themselves and their families. In other words, what many people really want to see in a constitution are precisely the things that the lawyers think have no place there! It is our purpose here, without overstating the case or ignoring diffi culties, to suggest that the constitution can usefully include these rights and that they will support the achievement of development, including of MDGs or similar objectives. Response to Objections Socio-economic rights are fi rst of all not as new as some people think. As long ago as the nineteenth century, it was suggested that states had a responsibility to protect their citizens\u2019 health, though those countries that negotiated over the spread of infectious diseases would not have accepted the idea of health as a citizens\u2019 right. Perhaps, many lawyers\u2019 ideas of what should be in a constitution are shaped by their knowledge of the 42 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS US constitution, but very soon after that was adopted, the French adopted their own constitution of 1793, which said, The constitution guarantees to all Frenchmen equality, liberty, security, property, the public debt, free exercise of religion, general instruction, public assistance, absolute liberty of the press, the right of petition, the right to hold popular assemblies, and the enjoyment of all the rights of man. The Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen, of 1893, also included that no type of labour, culture, or commerce could be forbidden, and \u2018Public relief is a sacred debt. Society owes maintenance to unfortunate citizens, either procuring work for them or in providing the means of existence for those who are unable to labour\u2019 (Article 17), and \u2018Education is needed by all. Society ought to favour, with all its power, the advancement of the public reason and to put education at the door of every citizen\u2019. Who says that the right to education is a new idea? By the middle of the twentieth century, aware of the serious consequences of the Great Depression, leaders such as the President of the United States, Franklin Roosevelt, were insisting on the need to protect the rights of people from want, as well as their rights to express their views and their beliefs. However, it was the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that really put socio-economic rights in focus, containing the rights in both lists above, and also a statement that Everyone, as a member of society, \u2026 is entitled to realization, through national effort and international co-operation, and in accordance with the organization and resources of each State, of the economic, social and cultural rights indispensable for his dignity and the free development of his personality. In 1948, an iron curtain was descending over Europe, and the rest of the world was held captive by Europe\u2019s ideological divide, while the unity of rights that we fi nd in the Universal Declaration was lost and the conviction developed that socio-economic rights were for communists. So the argument here is that to reject socio-economic rights on the basis of history or ideology is to misunderstand the past, and limit the possible ways to contribute to the development of the human person imagined by the founders of the UN and by earlier constitution-makers. Some of the other objections that may be raised to what we could call constitutionalizing socio-economic rights still merit serious discussion. This discussion is to be found in later chapters of this book, but let us briefl y examine some standard objections against socio-economic rights. HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT 43 Socio-economic \u2018rights\u2019 don\u2019t belong in a constitution. As we shall show, many countries have included these rights, and in some countries at least they have been used in a valuable way, politically and legally (see pp. 116\u201343). Socio-economic rights are only aspirations. They are not legally binding. For countries that have adopted the various international agreements that include socio- economic rights, they are legally binding obligations in international", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a71a5191-c29a-4d39-aafa-f4b187f382b6": {"__data__": {"id_": "a71a5191-c29a-4d39-aafa-f4b187f382b6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e806f0a81d9d4562d6590896ea508c1d47ea04b183deed6a2b71e10d6244de51"}}, "hash": "e806f0a81d9d4562d6590896ea508c1d47ea04b183deed6a2b71e10d6244de51", "text": "law (see pp. 14\u20136) and it is the main purpose of this book to show how they can be made legally binding within an individual country\u2019s legal system (see pp. 114\u201343). Socio-economic rights may be all right for international law, but inside a country it is politics that matter. We shall discuss how rights can be relevant to politics (see Part III). In later chapters on constitutions and enforcement of constitutional rights, we shall show how these rights can be a matter for law. You can\u2019t have rights unless someone has a duty and it is not clear who has the duty. The question of the duty holder can be clarifi ed, as in the ICESCR and in many constitutions, although it is important to remember that rights have political as well as narrowly legal force (see pp. 97\u2013100). There is no way that courts are suitable to deal with socio-economic rights. It is true that there are many decisions that courts are not competent to make but will need to be made in order to satisfy rights. While it may not be for the courts to decide how rights are satisfi ed, they are often capable of deciding that authorities have not done enough to satisfy the needs of their citizens (as we show in Part II). It\u2019s nonsense to suggest that governments have a duty to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and make everyone healthy. This is true\u2014and no-one is suggesting that any government has a duty to ensure that no-one is hungry, everyone has adequate clothing, and that no-one is sick. However, people expect governments to have policies to support its citizens\u2019 ability to feed and clothe themselves, to have some sort of safety net for the most vulnerable. Protecting civil and political rights just requires the state to restrain itself. Protecting socio-economic rights requires the state to make policies and spend money, and is best left to the electorate when they choose their leaders. The invalidity of this sort of supposed distinction between civil and political and socio-economic rights is discussed at pp. 46\u20138. More positively, there are various reasons why socio-economic rights have won increasing acceptance. Practical experience, research, intellectual ideas, human determination, and global politics have all played their part. Throughout history, ideas and scope of rights have been modifi ed and adjusted to changing realities and ideologies. They are, one might say, a conversation with and about the critical issues of the time. Liberal- individual rights arose against the dominance of the state at the time markets were expanding. Social rights were advanced and found ready justifi cation in socialist systems. Now, the pressing issues of the day relate to the elimination of poverty and the dignity of all persons. 44 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS There has been a tremendous amount of research on the nature of poverty and there is greater realization of its complex and multi-layered nature. The work of thinkers like Amartya Sen has focussed on rights or entitlements, and socio-economic rights are seen as the necessary implications of this line of thought. A person starves either because he does not have the ability to command enough food, or because he does not use this ability to avoid starvation. The entitlement approach concentrates on the former [and] concentrates on those means of commanding food that are legitimized by the legal system. Amartya Sen, An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation It is impossible to ignore globalization, which, though it may have led to economic growth in some countries, has also caused growing disparities of income and opportunities and the lack of opportunities for millions of people. Some see socio-economic rights as a counterbalance to globalization. Paradoxically, perhaps and also in response to the negative effects of globalization, global movements have focussed on the needs of the poor and have highlighted alternative development paradigms. So, we have the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Right to Development. The former was a precursor of the Millennium Development project, and stressed that in meeting the needs for social development\u2014the material and spiritual needs of individuals, their families, and the communities in which they live\u2014a commitment to human rights was essential and central. The latter has been described as bringing together civil and political, economic, social, and cultural rights, revisiting the UDHR one might say. The end of the Cold War was also signifi cant. No longer was it possible to dismiss socio-economic rights as an obsession of the Soviet bloc. As the countries of Eastern Europe, most of them decisively rejecting their Soviet or Soviet-dominated immediate past, made", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0bc379ae-78a9-4816-83d4-908d29372eff": {"__data__": {"id_": "0bc379ae-78a9-4816-83d4-908d29372eff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cbc87f27faa4391eacab907766a6e00fee345f84462a95bc343ce66e204ecae0"}, "3": {"node_id": "d9521ec2-ae59-4062-8dfb-39ef9fb10ac9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "02a4f24474b51bf4bc341d7240ff62a174a72f5f7b352e031ebcd4daca89d722"}}, "hash": "b26296e9ad0ad2ce4393a033cd6c47953460fc30e81e6a1aef5f425cd6a628e5", "text": "or amended their constitutions, many of them insisted on retaining socio-economic rights (about which, often, their American advisers were unhappy). Though they wanted to move to political freedom, they did not want to entirely abandon a commitment to ensuring that the basic minimum of human needs of citizens was satisfi ed. This approach, for example, is refl ected in the jurisprudence of the Hungarian Constitutional Court, which held that these socio-economic rights are vested rights. Still on the international level, the various sectoral human rights treaties protecting the rights of women, children, indigenous peoples, immigrants, and the disabled, draw attention to their exclusion and HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT 45 vulnerability and prescribe special measures to end exclusion and inequality, and also elaborate how rights in the other treaties apply to the specifi c groups. In this way, they have breathed life into the economic, social, and cultural rights. Those treaties have been achieved as a result of lobbying by minorities of different kinds and, sometimes on their behalf, by international organizations and international and local NGOs. In various countries and on the international level, experience of and refl ection on the core values of human rights, dignity, and equality have brought the realization that passive rights, meaning that the state must not discriminate or act against the dignity of its citizens, are simply inadequate. More is needed. The idea of \u2018substantial equality\u2019 or \u2018true equality\u2019 often requires the state to engage in affi rmative action, and this very often necessitates new economic and social policies (rooted in economic redistribution). In other words, the state must do something to ensure that education, health, access to resources, and so on, without which formal equality is of little value. The last few decades have been characterized by constitution-making in almost every part of the world and, popular participation has been a theme of many of these exercises. This, a marked departure from the process of making most past constitutions, has been supported by international law and a belief that the right to take part in the conduct of public affairs under the ICCPR includes a right to participate in making one\u2019s country\u2019s constitution. Whenever a constitution is made, especially, but not only, in developing countries with signifi cant participation of the people, provisions on social and gender justice, and economic, social, and cultural rights almost inevitably feature prominently. Where to Find Socio-Economic Rights The UDHR remains an important source for socio-economic rights. Apart from the ICESCR, we have already noted that most of the human rights treaties applicable to specifi c sections of society contain quite elaborate socio-economic rights. Some of regional human rights instruments also include socio-economic rights. The European Convention has the fewest specifi cally socio-economic rights, though some other rights, such as privacy, have been used to support essentially socio-economic rights as has Article 3 which says \u2018everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life\u2026\u2019 (see p. 131). Socio-economic rights are provided in the European Social Charter. The member states of the Organization of American states, in the American Convention on Human Rights committed themselves to the progressive realization of socio-economic rights listed 46 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS in the Organization\u2019s Charter, including rights to education, removal of illiteracy, and fair conditions of work. The African Charter is the fullest; it includes Article 17 on the right to education, Article 16 on the right to enjoy the best attainable state of physical and mental health, Article 15 on the right to work under equitable and satisfactory conditions, and Article 22 on peoples\u2019 right to economic, social, and cultural development, with due regard to their freedom and identity. It says, \u2018States have the duty, individually or collectively, to ensure the exercise of the right to development\u2019 (Article 22), and Article 24 guarantees a right to general satisfactory environment favourable to their development. It has been pointed out that the African Charter does not separate civil and political rights, and socio-economic rights, but has a truly indivisible and interdependent normative framework, addressing all rights equally in the same coherent text.23 In Part II, we look at national constitutions with socio-economic rights.

We shall take some ideas from these bodies when talking about specifi c rights in constitutions. Other organizations have also produced guides to implementing socio- economic rights at the national level or on monitoring implementation, such as the Habitat International Coalition/Housing and Lands Rights Network, and Toolkit on Monitoring the Right to Housing.25 An important aspect of some of these monitoring tools is the use of indicators. One such toolkit describes indicators as signals that make it possible to determine the extent to which a particular obligation or standard has been, or is being, attained. They are tools that can be used to indicate the present situation. They can show trends, serve as signs, reveal symptoms, and mark progress towards targets.26 Several of the international agreements also have a mechanism under which people can take individual complaints, rather like a complaint one might take to a national court. In 2008, a procedure for complaints about violations of the ICESCR was adopted. This means that individuals and HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT 47 groups of people can complain to the relevant UN committee, provided that they have made use of any procedures in their own country fi rst and received no remedy. However, some of the other documents that include socio-economic rights also have procedures for individual complaints, such as CEDAW. All Rights Must be Considered Together In this book no hard line is drawn between various types of rights, for the following reasons. It is not possible to draw any clear line between different sorts \u2022 of rights. Is a right to property a civil, or an economic, or even a cultural right, cultural because for many peoples their land and their cultures are intimately connected? The underlying basis for all rights is respect for human dignity. Why \u2022 should we draw any distinction between a person whose dignity is attacked because he or she is a prisoner under an unjust law, or is subject to torture, and one whose dignity is violated by terrible working conditions or starvation? \u2022 Any drawing of distinctions between rights tends to create a hierarchy of rights\u2014some are more important than others. In fact, in the nature of things, that is likely to lead to greater emphasis on rights that are more important to the already advantaged sectors of society. This book is particularly focussed on the connection between \u2022 poverty and rights, and the MDGs as a way of attacking poverty. Poverty, it has been said, is the greatest violation of rights, it undermines all rights, and dealing with it needs all the rights. It is a serious over-simplifi cation to suggest that civil and political \u2022 rights are cost-free and socio-economic rights are expensive. Or, that civil and political rights just require the governments to restrain themselves, while socio-economic rights require them to take positive actions. Common violations of civil rights involve denying freedom of speech and association, failing to give fair trials to people accused of political crimes, including using torture to get confessions. Governments that are under pressure will not simply stop committing these violations. To allow free comment and criticism will need new policies and practices. Having a justice system that treats people fairly requires retraining, new facilities, and expense. Governments that are in systematic violation of these rights are actually being asked to make radical changes, towards 48 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS democracy and towards fundamentally different ways of governing. Not easy or cost-free Over the years, careful analysis of socio-economic rights has clarifi ed \u2022 the obligations of states, and others, and shown that respecting those rights involves governmental restraint just as respecting civil and political rights is said to involve (see p. 48). In most countries it will indeed be political action that brings about \u2022 change and protects socio-economic rights. Political action is not possible without freedom of speech, association, and assembly, or where rights to vote cannot be exercised. In other words, the most civil and political of rights are fundamental to socio-economic rights. However, on the other hand, people who are hungry, or otherwise demoralized and suppressed by economic conditions, are not going to be able to exercise their political rights freely, and still less to benefi t from their cultural rights. Education and literacy (which are classifi ed as social rights) are necessary for the freedom of expression (which is classifi ed as a civil right) in order to read and communicate. Similarly, a clean environment is necessary for health and the right to life, more generally, bringing together all", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4c54180b-75a8-418b-9956-b6ccef2c5cd6": {"__data__": {"id_": "4c54180b-75a8-418b-9956-b6ccef2c5cd6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0ab18ec5088f895e5c75c17016d57d2f5b5a32c5d32cd6b454f43a9a1cf1d848"}}, "hash": "0ab18ec5088f895e5c75c17016d57d2f5b5a32c5d32cd6b454f43a9a1cf1d848", "text": "categories of rights. Freedom of expression and association are essential to protect campaigners on the environment from government harassment. \u2022 Although there are two covenants, one apparently dealing with civil and political rights, and the other with economic, social, and cultural rights, they are identical in their provisions on two fundamentals of rights. These are the right to self-determination. \u2018By virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social, and cultural development\u2019 (Article 1 of each covenant), and the need for equality and non- discrimination (Article 2). The right to self-determination here means that everyone, including all groups within society, must be able to be involved in deciding issues that affect them. In fact, most of the violations of economic and social rights, as well as cultural rights, can be analysed as involving inequality\u2014either general inequality, within a particular society, or inequality in government policies, particularly relevant to the economy and society, or inequalities on the international scale. Obligations under Socio-Economic Rights The Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights (ESCR) obliges a government to \u2018take steps,\u2026 to the maximum of its available resources, HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT 49 with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights \u2026 by all appropriate means\u2019 (Article 2), not to achieve miracles. The nature of the obligation has been analysed in some detail by the Committee on the Covenant and by various Special Rapporteurs. Firstly, the state must achieve, at the very least, minimum levels of each of the rights\u2019 and to give priority to achieving this minimum level. Beyond that, the duty is to \u2018respect, protect, promote and fulfi l\u2019 the rights. In fact, this way of analysing the duty of the state fi ts perfectly well with its duty with respect to civil and political rights, too, and our examples here involve both. The Constitution of South Africa says \u2018The state must respect, protect, promote and fulfi l the rights in the Bill of Rights\u2019, not just the socio-economic rights. The state, therefore, has an obligation to ensure that other people respect the rights as well as doing so itself. What is possible in a particular country at a particular time? A right of access to a lawyer may be vital to a person in danger of being condemned to death or life imprisonment. In many countries, it will not be possible to provide a lawyer at public expense to any person accused of less serious crimes as there are simply not enough lawyers in some countries. \u2018Respect\u2019 would mean that the state must not confi scate printing machines, or television cameras, or detain journalists, as this would deny the freedom of information as well as the freedom of expression. It must not prevent trade unionists from carrying on industrial action like staging a strike or negotiating for better conditions of work. It must not prevent members of minorities from voting or forming political parties. A government that seized farmers\u2019 land without providing for compensation or resettlement, so that the farmers lose their livelihood, would probably be failing to respect the right to an adequate standard of living of the farmers, the right to work, and also, perhaps, the right to food of other people who depend on the farmers. \u2018Protect\u2019 means that the state must take concrete steps to ensure, by appropriate measures that non-state actors do not prevent an individual or group from exercising their rights. The state must end discriminatory hiring or admissions policies, or prohibition of the use of one\u2019s mother tongue in private or in educational institutions, or attacks on the institutions, or practices of a community\u2019s religion by racial or religious bigots. It must try to stop international fi shing boats destroying the livelihood of local fi shermen, or require private schools to observe standards so that they meet the right to education. \u2018Promote\u2019 and \u2018fulfi l\u2019 are often treated together. They both involve positive actions by the state. These may involve education and 50 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS encouragement, taxation systems that stimulate fulfi lment, for example. They may involve the state taking positive steps to create the conditions, for, or provide concrete measures to facilitate the enjoyment of, a right; for example, it must ensure the right to housing by making available suffi cient land for building or the supply of water, and ensure health by ensuring the supply of affordable medicines. Sometimes, the state must go further, for example, by providing feeding programmes in case of droughts.

International mechanisms would suggest that the food must be adequate in quantity and in nutritional value, accessible and available, and also culturally acceptable.

The idea of \u2018education\u2019, to which there is a right, has been refi ned and developed: the right is to accessible education, that is appropriate in content and quality. The right to health does not mean a right to be healthy, but it would include a right to health care that is reasonably accessible, geographically and fi nancially, and of reasonable quality, as well as culturally and, in other ways, acceptable.27 The international covenants do not require the impossible: states are required to achieve fulfi lment of rights progressively. However, they are supposed to do so to the maximum of their available resources. The committee on ESCR has emphasized that lack of resources does not mean that a state may postpone beginning the process of realization of rights. The obligation is immediate, though the progress may be dictated partly by resources. It is well known that countries with comparable resources often have widely differing levels of achievement in terms of human development. This realization inspired the development of the Human Development Index, used in the UNDP\u2019s regular Human Development Reports. Countries that do poorly are violating their human rights obligations, probably because they have their priorities oriented away from human rights and towards other concerns such as national defence, national prestige, or even personal benefi t of the rulers. HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT 51 4. HUMAN RIGHTS FRAMEWORK AND APPROACH TO DEVELOPMENT The framers of the UDHR aimed to establish a new world order dominated by the framework of rights. In current debates, there is considerable advocacy of the rights-based approach to development. What do these concepts mean and how far have the UDHR and subsequent treaties established the conditions for their realization? (See Box 1.6.) BOX NO. 1.6 DECLARATION ON THE RIGHT TO DEVELOPMENT28 ARTICLE 2 1. The human person is the central subject of development and should be the active participant and benefi ciary of the right to development. 2. All human beings have a responsibility for development, individually and collectively, taking into account the need for full respect for their human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as their duties to the community, which alone can ensure the free and complete fulfi lment of the human being, and they should therefore promote and protect an appropriate political, social and economic order for development. 3. States have the right and the duty to formulate appropriate national development policies that aim at the constant improvement of the well- being of the entire population and of all individuals, on the basis of their active, free, and meaningful participation in development and in the fair distribution of the benefi ts resulting therefrom. The fundamental principle of the UDHR , as mentioned above, is that of a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms are fully realized. This means that, at both the national and international levels, every attempt should be made to promote and secure the protection of all the human rights and freedoms, of individuals and communities, and that no laws or policies should be adopted which violate or undermine rights and freedoms. Relations between states (including trade and other economic agreements) must also respect this imperative. All policies, laws, and administrative acts must pass the test of human rights. This emphasis on rights is based on two assumptions. First, that the protection and promotion of rights will advance the welfare of the people and increase their capacity for self-fulfi lment and contribute to the general prosperity of all and prevent discriminations and oppression. As we have seen, poverty is now increasingly defi ned in terms of the 52 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS violations of rights\u2014for example, the rights to food, health, education, self-expression and participation, and other means for physical, social, and cultural existence. The second assumption is that there is wide global agreement on human rights norms, and their implications.

They constitute the parameters within which state laws and policies must be made. Human rights thus defi ne, fundamentally, the relations between citizens and the state, and in this way restrict the powers of the state. State powers are also restricted vis-\u00e0- vis other states and the international community. Through the UDHR and other treaties, a state undertakes international obligations to respect the human rights of its own citizens and other residents. It has the obligation to protect. The international human rights system, discussed earlier, is designed to ensure that these undertakings are honoured\u2014sometimes, when necessary, through armed intervention in the affairs of the defaulting state. This is one instance of rights as empowering the people vis-\u00e0-vis the state. International obligations are also of a more positive nature, to co-operate with other states to assist them to achieve their human rights obligations in respect of their own citizens. The co-operation takes the form of technical and fi nancial assistance, and sometimes in more dramatic ways by providing the security framework for a peaceful and orderly life. On the norms themselves, the UDHR now regarded as part of international law has been followed by a number of international human rights treaties enunciating new or clarifying old rights and freedoms. However, human rights have also become a contested terrain, of the understanding of a good and meaningful life and welfare, of the importance of identity and its different bases, as fresh claims are advanced in the language of rights. So, with the expansion of rights have also come confl icts, partly based on cultural differences as well as material gain, which are refl ected in the notions of rights. Increasingly, human rights- based policies must deal with the balancing of individual and group rights, market or welfare oriented rights (that is, private property versus commons, patents versus accessibility to science and knowledge, human security versus human freedom), and the scope of the public sphere free from cultural constraints or prescriptions. Realistically, trade-offs may be inevitable, although some advocates of the rights-based approach rule out trade-offs. The question is whether there is enough guidance in human HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT 53 rights norms that can help states and other policy makers to negotiate appropriate balances. There can be no mechanistic way to do this. That, indeed, is the challenge for rights-based approaches. The diffi culties posed above may be resolved or mitigated by another critical dimension of rights-based approach\u2014the procedural approach (in addition to the results or outcome approach). Certain values of participation and procedure must be respected in arriving at decisions and their implementation. The fi rst of these is inclusion, so that all persons are treated equally. Inclusion is secured through participation, on which there is considerable emphasis in human rights norms, in the political life of the country, and also in access to economic and social opportunities. The processes of decision-making must be transparent and there must be accountability of the holders of powers as to the exercise of their powers\u2014to be judged in the considerable part by the substance and procedures of human rights norms. This element of procedure entails the empowerment, particularly of the marginalized communities and the poor, in general. The expectation is that through these processes a consensus of some sort will be reached and decisions made in this way will enjoy legitimacy. As we discuss in Part II, these processes are particularly important when fundamental decisions are made about the values, structures, and procedures of the State\u2014often, in the form of the constitution. BOX NO. 1.7 WHAT IS A HUMAN RIGHTS-BASED APPROACH? A human rights-based approach constitutes for UNDP a holistic framework methodology with the potential to enrich operational strategies in key focus areas. It adds a missing element to present activities by enhancing the enabling environment for equitable development, and by empowering people to take their own decisions. It brings in legal tools and institutions\u2014laws, the judiciary, and the rule of law principle\u2014as a means to secure freedoms and human development. It is further based on the recognition that real success in tackling poverty and vulnerability requires giving the poor and vulnerable both a stake, a voice and real protection in the societies where they live. A human rights- based approach is not only about expanding people\u2019s choices and capabilities but above all about the empowerment of people to decide what this process of expansion should look like.

On the fi rst, the important point is that a right gives its holder an entitlement to certain benefi ts, or treatment, or freedoms, which the duty holder has to ensure. The UDHR envisaged that rights and freedoms would be binding on non-state as well as state institutions and although some states rejected this broad reach of rights, increasingly, and globally, non-state institutions are being held responsible for violations of human rights. The rights-duty based relationship has several implications. There must be mechanisms to resolve disputes about the existence of the right in the person claiming it and to enforce rights when they are unlawfully denied. Ultimately, these matters are for the courts to resolve, but there can be other methods like administrative bodies, human rights commissions, ombudsperson, police complaints authority, and so on. In regional human rights systems, the fi nal word may be with an international court. The duty holder must be accountable for the proper discharge of his/her obligations, perhaps through parliament, or internationally by treaty bodies, or judicial tribunals (see the next section). When the duties do not fall directly on the state, it has the obligation to ensure that a non-state body which does have the duty actually performs it. The second component focuses on the obligations of the State (or other duty holder) and how they must be discharged. This will be clear from the text of the document that imposes the duty, or from clarifi cation by courts or other appropriate authorities, for it may be that the rights and freedoms are granted subject to permissible qualifi cations or restrictions. The State has the obligations to ensure law and order in which the rule of law functions, and civil and political rights are protected against its own offi cials and members of the public. It has to provide independent courts to protect citizens against discrimination or other acts of oppression by duty holders, which in many cases would include state offi cials. Many obligations also arise under social and economic rights. Although many of these are to be implemented progressively and in view of available resources some require immediate action, such as the provision of primary education or emergency medical treatment (this topic is explored later in detail see specifi c rights on p. 118 onwards). HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT 55 5. MDGs AND RIGHTS: THE RELATIONSHIP The MDGs offer an opportunity to realize basic human rights more broadly UNFPA Human Rights are and should be instruments for the empowerment of the MDG agenda Jeffrey Sachs Human rights and MDGs are \u2026 two interdependent and mutually reinforcing frameworks UNDP At the level of academic debate and of individual organizations these differences will continue, and the issues refl ected are of considerable importance. However, this particular publication is not the place to explore them in detail, or the considerable literature that argues that the two concepts are incompatible, or need not be incompatible, or points out that most people writing about human rights ignore MDGs, and those writing about MDGs ignore human rights.30 5.1 MUTUAL BENEFIT Already, many national and international organizations are working to support fulfi lment of both the MDGs and of rights, especially socio- economic rights. They use similar tools to assess progress towards the fulfi lment of both. Nevertheless, some organizations see themselves as working only towards MDGs, or see themselves as human rights organizations. That is, of course, entirely their right. Here we intend simply to suggest ways in which taking account of both, with their common agenda of the elimination of poverty, may be valuable. 5.1.1 MDG Analysis May Benefi t Rights Work A great deal of work has gone into the development of targets and indicators for the achievement of the MDGs. This information and these approaches can be used by governments and organizations approaching development from a human rights perspective. Organizations may fi nd that some fi nancial and other support is more forthcoming if they emphasize MDGs rather than rights. The right to development is unacceptable in some quarters, even though it is endorsed by the Millennium Declaration. It is also suggested that sometimes a human rights approach encourages a short-term focus on violations, rather than on the long term. \u2018Human rights analysts fi nd it diffi cult to factor in progress that 56", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "41d91d26-f6a1-4a33-9199-424c96da7c8c": {"__data__": {"id_": "41d91d26-f6a1-4a33-9199-424c96da7c8c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "187867902a6d338665a998028f331e41ef69db2a7578355dd8f5664404f47ece"}, "3": {"node_id": "28b16558-281c-41c8-9b35-80572e753ab1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8a803ee10b2f7a289f75a9bdef4c177013a644bf733126fa2a516f5d8c98448a"}}, "hash": "8d9bce1f098d284131a096a040100e59dfb2dbf31520bbeaed0e128afc8fd591", "text": "THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS is deferred, or uneven but positive, or to balance benefi ts of reform (for some) in relation to risks and threats (for others) over time\u2019 says Robert Archer.31 This is less true of those who focus on socio-economic rights and progressive realization. 5.1.2 Rights: Support Achievement of MDGs In the context of constitution-making and implementation, this is the more obvious linkage. We can summarize the possible benefi ts in the following ways: a rights analysis can counter a possible tendency of MDG analysis \u2022 to focus on fi gures and overlook the basic truths that motivate both sets of goals, particularly the emphasis on human dignity and the worth of every person a rights analysis will draw attention especially to the needs of \u2022 the most vulnerable sections of society, even if not identifi ed (as children are) in the MDGs a rights analysis will, or should, encourage a rounded approach\u2014 \u2022 rather than isolating particular markers of disadvantage 5.1.3 Drawing Connections A number of recent studies have been making the connections between MDGs and rights. Rather than repeat this work, we use in Table 1.3 (see p. 58) MDG/ESCR connections made by others (for the further link to a constitution see sections on specifi c rights, pp. 116\u201343). Here we omit MDG 8, on the international partnership, because it is less relevant to the drafting of a national constitution (see pp. 115\u201316). It is interesting to see that not everyone will link the same rights to a particular Millennium Goal. 6. CONSTITUTIONS AND CONSTITUTIONALISM The constitution, as fundamental law, provides the framework for the structures and powers of the State. As the constitution is the supreme law of the country, laws, policies, and administrative acts must be compatible with it. Most constitutions now provide for the invalidity of law and administrative acts which are so incompatible. Normally, a constitution determines the structure of the state according to fundamental principles of the purposes of state power. These are dependent on the history, ideology, and circumstances of the country in question. At one level these purposes are very general; and at another quite specifi c.

The role of constitutions is to ensure the smooth operation of the political system by channelling the expression of politics through prescribed institutions in accordance with clearly understood and valued procedures, as well as facilitating the resolution of differences and disputes that inevitably arise in a society. For this purpose, the state must be vested with considerable powers of government, to protect the rights of citizens, maintain law and order with the assistance of police, if necessary, and defend the country against foreign invasion. It must provide the machinery for justice, including a body of laws and courts to enforce them. For these purposes, it must have the power to tax the people and to incur expenditure on their behalf, in order to run the machinery of government. As society and economy have become increasingly complex and as relations with foreign powers and international agencies have become critical for any country, the state must have signifi cant powers of regulation and the ability to operate at the international level. The state has incurred numerous international obligations under treaties and conventions, and there must be authority to discharge them.

A key feature of constitutionalism is the division and separation of state powers. Powers can be divided horizontally as well as vertically\u2014for 62 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS example, at the national level, executive, legislative, and judicial powers can be vested in separate bodies. Nevertheless even within the executive, there can be division of powers between the president and the prime minister. The public service can be granted considerable operational autonomy and independent institutions can be set for particularly sensitive tasks like elections, control of corruption, or promotion of human rights. For the vertical division of power, the clearest example is federalism, but lesser forms of devolution or decentralization of powers are found in many constitutions and political systems. The vertical division of powers, when well structured, serves many important functions, including administrative responsiveness and effi ciency, the enhancement of democracy, and greater accountability. The whole scheme of the constitution depends on the acceptance of the principles and procedures of the rule of law, a value recognized in the Millennium Declaration. The rule of law springs from, and is critical for sustaining constitutionalism in general, and, more specifi cally for governance, in which the rulers too have to follow the law and be accountable to the people for proper custody of legality. The extent to which this proposition takes root is a measure of the success of constitutionalism\u2014and the discipline on, and accountability of, governments. Turning to the functions of constitutions, the sharpest distinction that could be drawn, until recently, was between market-oriented democracies and communist states. The former regarded the constitution as a relatively neutral framework for access to institutions of the state and the exercise of state power, with elections as the crucial element in this. Communists regarded the state as the vehicle for the centralization of power and its exercise by the communist party. The former tended to exaggerate the neutrality of the state in their system, and the latter, the democratic element in theirs. However, the division of powers and the political and legal institutions for their exercise, refl ecting the ruling ideologies, were quite different. It is possible to draw another type of contrast between well-settled societies and developing societies. With some simplifi cation, we may say that the growth of the state in the former societies has been gradual and organic, responding to changes in society and economy, and, consequently, there is a fi t between state and society. This is achieved largely through the dominance of particular social classes or forces in society and the gradual homogenization of culture. Stability as well as the modes of change are based on civil society rather than the state. Therefore, the role HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT 63 of the constitution is limited and secondary, and largely of a procedural kind (to do with access to and structuring of state power, as in market- oriented democracies). In the second category, developing societies, the state is much more distanced from society, having had, in most cases, its origins in colonial rule. Furthermore, the constitution often does not have effective links to either society or even the state. There is often no dominant social class or force in society that can impose its rule over others, or bring coherence to the society or state. People may be divided by caste, tribes, religion, or language, and may have come together as a result of coercion by an outside power, now departed. Thus, there may be no organic unity in society\u2014generally regarded as the prerequisite of a functioning and stable state. The absence of national sentiment creates considerable diffi culties in creating a state to which is owed the primary allegiance. Instead, the primary loyalty is to a smaller group, marked by ethnic identity. This problem is compounded by scarcity of resources and intense competition for them, putting state neutrality under great pressure. In this situation, the role of the constitution is signifi cantly different from that in more established societies. The constitution can come to be seen as a major symbol of the state, and the creator of a sense of nationalism and national belonging. Many recent constitutions are designed to create stability through unity, even if that unity is generated by the recognition of ethnic and other differences.

Differences within and between societies should be neither feared nor repressed, but cherished as a precious asset of humanity. A culture of peace and dialogue among all civilizations should be actively promoted. The constitution then becomes the means to hold various social forces in balance\u2014and, thus, is also subject to the vagaries of changing social forces. In the more enlightened constitution for this purpose, considerable emphasis may be placed on social justice and inclusion as the only guarantee of peace and stability in a multi-ethnic society. The constitution may try to acknowledge or incorporate values that are inherently just and moral, or have the potential to unite the people, and project for the people a vision of the purpose and identity of the state. To some extent, therefore, the function of the constitution becomes the narrowing of differences 64 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS between state and society\u2014and between them and itself. We discuss later some diffi culties in achieving this objective. It will be clear from the above discussion that constitutions can play\u2014or aspire to play\u2014very different roles and functions in different contexts. For the purpose of this book, we look upon the constitution as an instrument to eradicate poverty, as a charter of social justice, and a basis of national unity, without which it may be hard to develop social solidarity which is so essential for MDGs. In the next part, we discuss the implications of incorporating human rights and MDGs in a constitution, broadly of this type. We shall argue in the concluding Part (see pp. 171\u20132) that it is not suffi cient to have a good bill of rights; rather the entire constitution should refl ect human rights values and procedures\u2014be human rights friendly. We know that a common problem in many countries is poor governance. When governments are corrupt, incompetent, or unaccountable to their citizens, national economies falter. When income inequality is very high, rich people often control the political system and simply neglect poor people, forestalling broad-based development. The prevalence of corruption erodes public ethics, illegally, diverts, resources away from material development and welfare of the people, produces ineffi ciency and lack of commitment\u2014and, generally, obstructs human rights. The rights-based approach to society and development, thus, requires an audit of the whole constitution from the perspectives of the protection and promotion of rights. Such an approach does not endear itself to everyone. An earlier section in this part touched on the arguments against the justiciability (or even recognition) of economic and social rights. Similar arguments are made more broadly against a constitution which defi nes for the state (and society) a wide social agenda based on human rights and justice. In the next part, we discuss and try to refute these arguments and show how a constitution can promote MDGs and human rights. NOTES 1.

PART II Constitutional Strategy We do not operate under a constitution in which the avowed purpose of the drafters was to place limitations on government control. Our constitution aims at establishing freedom and equality in a grossly disparate society Justice Kriegler of the Constitutional Court of South Africa in Du Plessis v. De Klerk (1996)1 How does a constitution work? Can a constitution really be a vehicle for development, including the achievement of the MDGs? Moreover, what is the place of socio-economic rights in this? These are the questions that this Part of the book deals with\u2014frankly and without glossing over possible diffi culties, but based on the genuine conviction that a constitution is an important part of the national life, at least in many countries, and that it can make a positive contribution to achieving a better life for the people of a country. This part does not deal only with economic, social, and cultural rights, even though these may appear at fi rst sight to be most relevant to achieving human development. The argument is that the constitution may either be supportive of rights or be an obstacle to rights. A constitution might have a superb bill of rights, but be a failure when it comes to achieving the goals of human development and respect for rights. A good bill of rights, working with other aspects of the constitution, can offer real hope for the people. Another important message of this Part is that a constitution may be technically well drafted, with appropriate and skilfully expressed provisions about rights and supportive institutions provided for in the document, and even reach out in emotional terms to the people, but remain no more than something just on paper. It may be, in constitutional terms, a beautiful creation, but it may be dead in terms of its actual impact on reality. For a constitution to come to life\u2014to leap off 70 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS the paper on which it is printed into the minds and hearts of the people and into the everyday reality of their lives\u2014it needs to be observed, to be used, and to be enforced. On the one hand, it means that there must be institutions and procedures to ensure that it is usable and that these institutions and procedures can be provided by the constitution itself. On the other hand, people, the citizens, affected by denial of their rights and for whom the constitution is designed, must be motivated and able to make use of it. 1. CONSTITUTIONALIZING MDGS We believe that there is considerable value in incorporating the MDGs in a nation\u2019s constitution. This is not to say that they can be reproduced in a national constitution in the form in which they were extracted from the Millennium Declaration, while the specifi c targets are not suitable for enshrining in a constitution. However, if we take a broader view looking at the Declaration, the principles which it embodies are suitable for a constitution, and indeed are found in many. The MDGs were prepared by the staff of international organizations and endorsed by heads of states or governments after inter-state negotiations. People across the globe, in whose name the goals were proclaimed, had little role in their preparation or adoption. While the goals speak of the concerns of millions of people, an act of incorporation of the goals into the national constitution (at least if done in the participatory way that we discuss at pp. 73\u20137) would be an act of national endorsement of, and commitment to the goals and their achievement. If the process of entrenching the MDGs is appropriate, as we discuss ahead, it would establish national ownership of the goals and strengthen the resolve of the people and the government to pursue them until all the objectives are achieved. The process will provide further opportunity to determine suitable institutional and procedural reforms in view of local circumstances. The constitutionalization of MDGs should facilitate greater awareness of the MDGs among parliamentarians, and enable them and other state and non-state actors to play their proper role in promoting and supervising their implementation. National methods of accountability may well result from this. The MDGs would need to be integrated and harmonized with socio-economic and political rights and will, in turn, have an impact on the interpretation of other provisions of the constitution. In this way, they and the constitution, generally, will be strengthened.

To establish a proper legal, social, and political status for them, it is advisable that they be incorporated into a law, preferably the constitution. There will be objections to this. An important part of the appeal of the MDGs has been the idea that we can make poverty history, and in our lifetime. The hope was that all that was needed was one big push. Some would object that putting the MDGs into a national constitution is to constitutionalize poverty and to assume that \u2018the poor ye have always with you\u2019 (Gospel according to St. Matthew Chap. 26) when the whole thrust of the MDGs was to deny this inevitability. Some people will object that a constitution is something that ought to last 200 years or more (like the US Constitution) and should, therefore, be timeless. Nevertheless, here it is important to make various distinctions. Firstly, it is not the targets but the goals, we argue, that can and should be constitutionalized and it is not the precise words, but the underlying spirit of the goals and even more so of the Millennium Declaration, that may most appropriately have constitutional embodiment. Even if the goals were realized in a particular society, continued vigilance would be needed to maintain that progress. Many countries have experienced increased inequality with, at least, increased relative poverty. Disease will not disappear from the earth. Constitutions should not be changed at whim, but the supposed perpetuity of the constitution should not be made an article of faith. We argue later (see pp. 72\u20137) that a constitution should respond to the needs of the particular country and refl ect what the citizens believe is important. There are prices to be paid for this, one of which is length and some unwieldiness, and another of which is the likelihood that a constitution will be changed, or even replaced. Another objection with some validity is that a constitution is a national document\u2014the national document\u2014but the MDGs were a commitment not of individual nations in regard to their own citizens, but of the whole community of nations. Would not enshrining the MDGs in the constitutions of poor nations let the rich nations off the hook? There is some truth in this because a constitution is a sort of modern social contract, between citizens and between citizens and the state, about how the people of that state will live together. However, a country might decide to refl ect in its national constitution an obligation on the part of government to work with the whole community of nations for the achievement of the spirit of the MDGs or the Declaration, or at least as 72 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS an obligation under the UDHR in the constructive spirit of globalization. Some countries might fi nd this objectionable of course. Secondly, rich countries also make and amend their constitutions. Is there any reason why an MDG spirit should not be refl ected in the constitutions of all countries? We explore this constitutionalization of Goal 8 a little further at pp. 114\u201316. Most importantly, we would argue that what happens within poor nations will ultimately be at least as important as what the rich nations do. The importance of the constitutionalization of MDGs and socio- economic rights arises from the fact that the primary responsibility for their promotion lies with national governments and societies\u2014despite the considerable development of international norms and institutions. The international community can do relatively little to stop violations of rights which take place within national jurisdiction\u2014unless they are of genocidal proportions and, even then not often, as Darfur well illustrates. Even in well established regional systems, where the regional courts make the fi nal determination of violations and remedies, implementation depends on national institutions. The future of human rights, therefore, depends substantially, even fundamentally, on protection and promotion at the national level. A constitution which seeks to incorporate these and other social rights or national policies, is likely to be opposed by various groups. Not all of the opposition comes from persons or groups who are opposed to social justice or the eradication of poverty. Others, without being necessarily attached to conservative values, may fi nd professional or ideological reasons why a constitution should not contain state obligations to look after the material interests of citizens in general, or a special category. A principal argument against constitutionalization of MDGs is that the constitution should be value neutral, and that its sole function is to provide rules for the formation of government and the mode of decision-making", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6fdfd8b0-9cf1-4fe7-9887-5a8d595abe33": {"__data__": {"id_": "6fdfd8b0-9cf1-4fe7-9887-5a8d595abe33", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6fc72f47d58dfc0389b81bebd2092f5df175344899a928db507833b398a1320a"}}, "hash": "6fc72f47d58dfc0389b81bebd2092f5df175344899a928db507833b398a1320a", "text": "in the legislature and other state organs. The fact is that no constitution is neutral, even if it does not explicitly contain any values. A constitution which is restricted to rules on formation of, and decision-making within, the government is not neutral, but is directed towards the maintenance of the economic and social status quo. It is also often argued that the sole purpose of the constitution is to limit and restrain the exercise of political power. This is also often an ideological position which is directed towards conservatism, so that those who are already dominant in society enjoy maximum freedom, with the state responsible only for maintaining law and order. CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 73 Some say that only provisions which are both clear and legally binding should be included in the constitution. Values cannot normally be stated with clarity and it is diffi cult for the courts to interpret the implications of values for state action, which weakens the constitution. The underlying assumption here is that a constitution is primarily, even solely, a legal document but in this book we show that a constitution is also a political and social document. In truth, most constitutional provisions have a degree of ambiguity and the courts are asked all the time to interpret values or abstract terms, even if they are not labelled \u2018principles\u2019 or \u2018values\u2019. A further objection would be that constitutions with values and aspirations are hard, if not impossible, to implement. This failure diminishes the legitimacy of the constitution and can give rise to the dangerous idea that the constitution need not be taken seriously or that some of its provisions can be ignored. It is bound to disappoint those who have high expectations of the constitution. The fi rst assumption of this position is that achievement of social goals is impossible. As we argue here, it is often impossible for the simple reason that little attempt is made to implement them. The criticism should be levelled at the government for want of effort, not at the constitution. The second assumption is that constitutions without values are, or can be fully implemented, but, as we have suggested, no constitution is really without values and in truth no constitution is fully implemented. These criticisms are based on the preference for a particular kind of constitution, with minimalist scope. To expand on the question of different functions of constitutions in different societies, a point made in Part I: in many developing, formerly colonial, states there are major problems of nation-building. Primary identities are attached to religious or ethnic communities, or certain pre-colonial historical traditions. Many fi nd it hard to envisage citizenship as the basic unit of society and, so, there is little solidarity as a nation. Consequently, there is little sympathy for the poor and oppressed of other communities. Nation-building based on common citizenship is essential for many purposes, particularly a commitment to a wider sense of social justice. The modern state itself is a relatively new concept in many of these societies, where there is little familiarity with the modalities and morals of State power, or the true signifi cance of democracy for the organization of the State and society. Consequently, it is necessary to spell these out in a constitution, to guide the exercise of power and establish new institutions of accountability, since society is unable on its own to do this effectively. 74 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS The full range of human rights, as a primary component of meaningful democracy, must be fully refl ected in the constitution and the design of political organizations. Implementing the policies and interventions required to meet the Millennium Development Goals requires the commitment of political leaders. However it also requires sustained political pressure, broad popular support and mechanisms for delivering services effectively. An open democratic state that guarantees civil and political freedoms is essential for such popular mobilization and participatory civic engagement, so that poor people can pressure their leaders to deliver on their commitments to the Goals. The 2003 Human Development Report, p. 133 Furthermore, in most developing countries, there are large pockets of extreme poverty. To say that only a state with limited power is compatible with the constitution is to condemn the poor to perpetual poverty. The notion of the limited state is usually to imply that the state should have a restricted role in relation to the market. It is patent that the market, which is often the cause of poverty, cannot pull the poorest out of their condition.

Without this role, the very future of the state and society is imperilled. As we have argued, MDGs and socio-economic rights are the principal instruments for this purpose. Later, we suggest how a constitution can give effect to human rights, both through a bill of rights and the structure and orientation of the state\u2014 in other words, how to make the entire constitution rights-friendly. There are several ways of doing this, as we suggest below. Many of them are probably already in some way or another refl ected in the constitution, but some specifi c way of acknowledging the philosophy, goals, and procedures of the Millennium Declaration would strengthen the general approach and provisions for human rights-based development. 2. REVIEWING OR MAKING A CONSTITUTION This section discusses how the process of making or reviewing a constitution can promote public contribution to its agenda, gain legitimacy among the people, respond to imperatives of justice, and ensure greater knowledge of the constitution and prospects of its implementation. Constitution-making or review is a marvellous opportunity to engage the people in discourses on constitutions, human rights, democracy, and social justice. The people can be quite focussed on the process, as much CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 75 publicity is given in the media to issues of reform. The process can be used to promote knowledge as well as the practice of democracy. The process of drafting and adopting a constitution is the centrepiece of constitution-building. This is so, of course, because of the nature and orientation of the document that the process produces. The design of the process, that is the institutions for the making of decisions and the method of making decisions, has an impact on a number of factors such as what interests are articulated and what are excluded, how the views of participants are aggregated, and the match between the text of the constitution and social realities. However, the process is important in other respects as well, which have a bearing on how the constitution is actually rooted in the society. Participation, an important human rights value, is now regarded as central to the constitution-making processes. The UN Human Rights Committee has emphasized that self-determination is a fundamental right on which depend other rights; its realization is an essential condition for the effective guarantee and observance of individual human rights and for the promotion and strengthening of those rights (in General Comment 12/1984). It is closely connected to constitutional and political processes which in practice allow the exercise of this right. In keeping with this approach, the Committee has linked self-determination to particularly two articles of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Articles 25\u2014a general right\u2014and 27\u2014for the protection of minorities (see Box 2.1). BOX NO. 2.1 ICCPR ARTICLES 25 AND 27 Article 25 Every citizen shall have the right and the opportunity, without any of the distinctions mentioned in article 2 [prohibiting discrimination] and without unreasonable restrictions: (a) to take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives; Article 27 In those States in which ethnic, religious, or linguistic minorities exist, persons belonging to such minorities shall not be denied the right, in community with the other members of their group, to enjoy their own culture, to profess, and practise their own religion, or to use their own language. The Human Rights Committee has explained that Article 25 lies at the core of democratic government based on the consent of the people and 76 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS in conformity with the principles of the Covenant.2 The conduct of public affairs is a broad concept which relates to the exercise of state power, in particular the exercise of legislative, executive, and administrative powers. It covers all aspects of public administration, and the formulation and implementation of policy at the international, national, regional, and local levels. The allocation of powers and the means by which individual citizens exercise the right to participate in the conduct of public affairs should be established by the constitution and other laws. Participation in public affairs includes lobbying, and for this and other reasons the freedom of expression and of the media must be secured. Equal access to public service must be ensured, if necessary through affi rmative action. The comment sets out at length the institutional and procedural aspects of free and fair elections. It sketches a broad framework, dependent on the exercise of many rights and freedoms, for the right to participate in public affairs.

For example, in a complaint from an indigenous community in Canada (the Mi\u2019kmaq) that they had been excluded in a series of constitutional conferences, the Human Rights Committee held that constitution-making is indeed the conduct of public affairs.3 It is now believed that participation is essential to the legitimacy of the constitution and the ability of the people to understand and mobilize its provisions. The process may promote a sense of common belonging and destiny critical for national unity. A well designed process can in itself be an education in and preparation for the deliberative and participatory politics that the constitution may call for. People have the opportunity, and the incentive, to lobby for their rights and other provisions which would promote their welfare. They can bring to the knowledge of constitution- makers the circumstances in which they live and hardships they suffer. Elites involved in constitution-making seldom realize the misery of the majority of their country people. By participation in the process, they can become aware of the contents of the constitution, the ways in which it protects their interests, and how they can use its provisions to safeguard their rights. Although participation is undoubtedly important, there are problems with it which have not been properly explored\u2014possible manipulation of the people by interest groups, ethnicization of opinion, spontaneity (failure in thinking of complex issues through, properly), populism, CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 77 diminishing the role of experts, misrepresentation by decision-makers of people\u2019s views, and making consensus-building harder. Importantly, there may be resistance from the establishment to the radical agenda that can often emerge from a genuinely participatory process (see Box 2.2). There is an idealist version of constitution-making, which places great importance on public participation (for reasons mentioned above). There is another strand of literature on constitution-making, within the tradition of writing on deliberative democracy, a process of thoughtful, constructive discourse on public affairs. Some writers on the latter would see a confl ict between deliberative democracy and true popular participation.

It provided civic education to the public on constitutional issues (carrying out this task itself and also with the help of civil society organizations already involved in this work). It established constitutional forums (of locally elected leaders) in each of the 210 electoral constituencies to promote discussions on reform and to facilitate consultations with the residents of the constituency. It also appointed a coordinator for, and set up a small library in, each of the 74 districts. The public conducted their own debates and many organizations (some with the assistance of the CKRC) held meetings to prepare their submissions to the CKRC. The CKRC succeeded in generating a nationwide debate on critical issues, and, for several months, constitutional issues dominated the media. The public response was overwhelming. At least one meeting, generally lasting two full days, was held in each constituency to receive views. Over 37,000 submissions were received, both from institutions, groups, and individuals, ranging from lengthy (and sometimes learned) presentations to a few sentences. All oral submissions were recorded, in writing and on audio and video tape. Interpreters, of spoken and sign language, were available and summaries of the views were sent back (Contd) CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 79 to the locality to check for accuracy. The views were carefully reviewed and analysed, qualitatively and statistically. The draft prepared by the CKRC on the basis of the submissions was submitted for public consultation and then to the National Constitutional Conference (NCC) which comprised all members of Parliament, three delegates elected from each district, forty-two representatives of political parties, and 125 representatives of religious, women\u2019s and youth groups, the disabled, trade unions, and NGOs, 629 people in all. It was the most representative body ever assembled in Kenya. Its function was to debate, if necessary, to amend, and adopt the draft constitution presented by the CKRC. Finally, there was the National Assembly (NA) which was to enact changes to the constitution by formal amendments. The NA was to be assisted in the discharge of its functions in relation to the review by a Parliamentary Select Committee on the Constitution. The NCC was to adopt the provisions of the draft constitution by the votes of two-thirds of all its members, failing consensus. If on any point such a vote was not forthcoming, the provision in question had to be referred to the people in a referendum, and the results of the referendum were to be incorporated in the draft adopted by the NCC, before sending it to the NA. The NA could either approve or reject the draft, but could not modify it. The 2004 draft still has a considerable hold over the popular imagination, arguably partly because of the strongly participatory process by which it was prepared. 3. A CONSTITUTION TO WHICH THE PEOPLE CAN RELATE A constitution is a technical, legal document but it depends as much for its success on the people as on the lawyers, the courts, and the institutions of government. To be a success in this sense, a law is not necessarily drafted in a way that is accessible to the people\u2014one that they will understand and respond to. A constitution, more than most other laws, can reach out and engage the people. Perhaps, the constitution is the law that ordinary people are most aware of. While they may be conscious of laws about marriage and crimes, they will rarely think of such laws as being for them, rather than things to be avoided. If people think of the constitution as being for the people, it is perhaps more likely to receive the support of the people and to be looked at by them as a tool for justice and a shield against injustice. The assertion that something is unconstitutional can be powerful, even in countries that do not have written constitutions.

How it is used is something that can only develop over time. A new constitution has no track record. How it comes into being is likely to depend on the circumstances that led to its being drafted, and the process by which it was prepared. Here, we are concerned with how it is written. There may be some provisions which are really designed as the outreach provisions\u2014to appeal to the heart as much as to the mind and the legal technician. Even the hard technical law of the constitution can be written in a way that is not as impenetrable as laws usually are, though, often unnecessarily so. The outreach provisions are the poetry of the constitution. We may fi nd this in the Preamble. In some countries most laws do not have preambles, but most constitutions do. A preamble, the introduction to the constitution, is not something to be interpreted, unpacked, and dissected like the other provisions. It sets a scene, it may explain the need for the constitution and its objectives. It may be used by courts to help understand the constitution, in a general way, but its main purpose is to engage the commitment of the people. For this reason, it may invoke past memories and struggles or glories. It may refl ect a commitment to a belief in a deity, even in a country that is largely secular in its public life. It may be drafted in a style that is quite remote from the rest of the document, or any other legal document.

We fi nd that in the Nisga\u2019a constitution there are provisions that set out the general principles of the community as they are relevant to the constitution. This is something that appears also, though in a less pronounced form, in the constitution of South Africa. An effort was made to do something similar in the draft constitution adopted by the 82 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS National Constitutional Conference in Kenya in 2004. The Papua New Guinea constitution was drafted in a way that went beyond the traditions of lawyers\u2019 drafting. It has been described as a manual for government. It essentially explains how the government works, especially valuable for a country that had very little experience of modern government when it became independent. A deliberate decision was made by the constitution making bodies that the fi nal constitution of South Africa should be drafted using plain language. That language is also gender neutral, it never speaks of he or she; every time there is mention of the possibility of a person holding an offi ce or performing a role under the constitution, it is made clear that this may be done by a woman or a man. As far as possible, unnecessary words are avoided and obscurities removed. The result is not poetry, but clarity. The National Assembly must elect a woman or a man from among its members to be the President. Constitution of South Africa 4. EFFECTIVE CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS 4.1 DRAFTING THE BILL OF RIGHTS No constitution can be adopted today which does not have a Bill of Rights. However, there are many issues in the drafting of the Bill which often do not receive adequate attention. Some kinds of rights may be excluded for ideological reasons. This section highlights critical decisions that need to be made in the drafting of the Bill of Rights, indicating options that are likely to extend the scope of rights and to make them effective in practice. Where special considerations apply to socio-economic rights, these are highlighted. 4.1.1 What Legal Effect Should Rights Have Rights can be recognized in the constitution in at least four ways, although not mutually exclusive. Preamble Most preambles now refer in some form to human rights: either to recognize past violations of rights or to emphasize the commitment of the state to protect rights. The Indian preamble proclaims that the state has been constituted CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 83 \u2026to secure to all its citizens: JUSTICE, social, economic, and political; LIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith, and worship; EQUALITY of status and of opportunity; and to promote among them all FRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual.6 There is here no mention of rights, though they must underlie Justice, Liberty, and Equality. Other constitutions may be more explicit on rights, like South Africa: \u2018Heal the divisions of the past and establish a society based on democratic values, social justice and fundamental human rights.\u2019 The Constitution of Eritrea has a paragraph that links rights and development in a way that is in tune with the theme of this book: Convinced that the recognition, protection and securing of the rights and freedoms of citizens, human dignity, equality will guarantee a balanced development; lay down the groundwork for satisfying the material and spiritual needs of citizens; usher in a democratic order that is responsive to the needs and interests of citizens, guarantees their participation and brings about economic development, social progress and harmony\u2026 In most legal systems, the provisions of the preamble are not directly binding, although they may be referred to for help in interpreting the constitution. 4.1.2 Fundamental Principles and Objectives of the State: National Values and Goals The Declaration of Fundamental Principles has been a feature of constitutions in the civil law tradition, but is now becoming common practice in other countries. Portugal\u2019s constitution (1974) defi nes Portugal as \u2018based upon the dignity of the human person and the will of the people and is committed to building a free and just society united in its common purposes.\u2019 Its values are stated as democracy \u2018that is based upon the rule of law, the sovereignty of the people, the pluralism of democratic expression and democratic political organisations.\u2019 Some constitutions have more development-oriented principles and goals. A striking example is Papua New Guinea (a constitution adopted in 1975) which calls, among other things for: \u2026improvement in the level of nutrition and the standard of public health to enable", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5291fd4-9084-452a-b3d3-af842c6a0bab": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5291fd4-9084-452a-b3d3-af842c6a0bab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "37c315149c373fd46be75d78f21c0d8d5e58ef75de12e262b4ba6e57e0655f2e"}}, "hash": "37c315149c373fd46be75d78f21c0d8d5e58ef75de12e262b4ba6e57e0655f2e", "text": "our people to attain self fulfi lment and wise use to be made of our natural resources and the environment in and on the land or seabed, in the sea, under the land, and in the air, in the interests of our development and in trust for future generations. 84 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS Such statements of goals and principles help establish a national identity and a vision of the country, as a general guide to legislation and policies by the state and society. Nevertheless, they are not directly binding and it is unlikely that a policy which runs counter to them could be decided unlawful by a court. 4.1.3 Directive Principles of State Policy In some constitutions (for example, Ireland, India, Namibia, Uganda, Ghana, Nigeria, Bangladesh, and Papua New Guinea), certain rights, mostly socio-economic rights, are given a lower status than other rights. They are drafted in the form of \u2018Directive Principles of State Policy\u2019 or Directive Principles of Social Policy, as they are known in the Irish Constitution (1937), which pioneered this concept. India is best known for its Directive Principles and the examples are drawn from its constitution. They include, at a high level of generality: the promotion of the welfare of the people by securing and protecting as effectively as it may a social order in which justice, social, economic, and political, shall inform all institutions of the national life and more specifi cally: minimization of inequalities in income \u2022 that the citizens, men and women equally, have the right to an \u2022 adequate means of livelihood equal pay for both men and women \u2022 that children are given opportunities and facilities to develop in \u2022 a healthy manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity, and that childhood and youth are protected against exploitation and against moral and material abandonment\u2019, and effective provisions for securing the right to work, to education, and \u2022 to public assistance in case of unemployment, old age, sickness, and disablement and in other cases of undeserved want. The Indian constitution says that directive principles are not enforceable by any court (often described as being non-justiciable) but they are nevertheless fundamental in the governance of the country, and the state is under a duty to apply these principles in making laws. The Ghanaian constitution goes further when it says that directive principles shall guide all citizens, Parliament, the President, the Judiciary, the Council of State, the Cabinet, political parties, and other bodies and persons in applying or interpreting this Constitution or any other law and in taking and CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 85 implementing any policy decisions, for the establishment of a just and free society. There are a number of reasons why countries make this choice. Sometimes the decision to cast these rights in the form of Directive Principles is based on the consideration that the resources to implement them may be limited and that their allocation is best left to the political process, refl ected in the decisions of the legislature. This reason may have nothing to do with the ability or the legitimacy of the courts to decide these issues. Equally, the tasks in the interpretation or implementation of socio- economic rights may be considered beyond the skills and competence of the judiciary. Or, there may be no confi dence in the class or ideological impartiality of the judiciary. Or, this status may be a compromise between those who want a strong, and others, who want a weak, protection of socio-economic rights.7 The intention to keep the courts out has not always been successful. The Irish courts found a way to take account of Directive Principles by adopting the position that the constitution had not intended to provide an exhaustive list of enforceable rights and using the Directive Principles as the basis for new rights. In other countries, Directive Principles have been used in interpreting the constitution (as expressly authorized in Ghana). Increasingly, courts are giving effect to them in different ways, as justifying qualifi cations on rights, such as the right to equality, which has been read to justify affi rmative action when a directive principle requires the state to redress the historic or contemporary injustices infl icted on a section of the community. In another instance, the courts used the directive principle on living wages and decent conditions of work to uphold the reasonableness of minimum legislation. The right to life has been interpreted with the help of directive principles to include the right to basic needs and a clean environment.8 Courts have used the directive principles as the basis for giving directions to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da97c0c0-33a2-4e90-a86c-6349dea831c9": {"__data__": {"id_": "da97c0c0-33a2-4e90-a86c-6349dea831c9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "257b7c270c6beeafdbd8119b4798f9d501e46bfbbb8804fcc3e9f37787ee2397"}}, "hash": "257b7c270c6beeafdbd8119b4798f9d501e46bfbbb8804fcc3e9f37787ee2397", "text": "governments, legislatures, and administrators to promote social justice. Somewhere between the directive principles and national policies is an example from Canada\u2019s Charter of Rights and Freedoms, relating to the federal structure and relations between the national and provincial governments, by using the language \u2018being committed to\u2019 certain values. Article 36 (1) Without altering the legislative authority of Parliament or of the provincial legislatures, or the rights of any of them with respect to the exercise of their 86 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS legislative authority, Parliament and the legislatures, together with the government of Canada and the provincial governments, are committed to (a) promoting equal opportunities for the well-being of Canadians; (b) furthering economic development to reduce disparity in opportunities; and (c) providing essential public services of reasonable quality to all Canadians. (2) Parliament and the government of Canada are committed to the principle of making equalization payments to ensure that provincial governments have suffi cient revenues to provide reasonably comparable levels of public services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation. For those who wish to see the strongest possible protection of human rights in a national constitution, we would advise against an optimistic assumption that a broad portmanteau right, like the right to life, or preambles, or directive principles will actually protect socio-economic rights, at least in any predictable and comprehensive manner. These expansions of other rights do not comprehensively cover the socio- economic rights. Moreover, there is no guarantee at all that a court will take such a creative approach. In many countries the right to life is used to refer only to issues like the death penalty and abortion, and the clause that says Directive Principles cannot be used as the basis of a claim in court, is taken very literally. 4.2 GETTING SOCIO-ECONOMIC RIGHTS INTO CONSTITUTIONS Even some people who are sympathetic to socio-economic rights fi nd it hard to see how these rights can be drafted so as to have legal effect. For some countries the solution, as they see it, has been to include socio- economic rights as directive principles. However, this distinction between rights and directive principles is not really as clear as one might think and the distinction, as we are using it here, only emerged with the Irish Constitution of 1937. Subsequently, the range of socio-economic rights recognized has expanded. The Mexican Constitution of 1917 recognized some rights to education and some in connection with work. Primary education was to be compulsory and state education to be free, and there was a vision for the purposes of education. Though every person \u2018shall enjoy the guarantees\u2019 it is not clear that a person could rely on provisions as the basis of a legal claim. Most of the very detailed provisions about work were in the form of guidelines for legislation and there is a commitment to land reform. The attitude towards socio-economic rights, generally in Mexico, is said to be that they are not formally binding, but are more in the nature of political goals. In other words more like directive principles. CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 87 The constitution of the Weimar Republic of Germany of 1919 was a remarkably wide-ranging document. Prepared in the context of the German defeat in the World War I, the Russian revolution of 1917, and the existence of far right parties foreshadowing the country\u2019s future under Hitler, the constitution includes not only civil rights but also social rights. One strand of the intense political and philosophical debate about the constitution wanted it to refl ect the entire German worldview, especially distinctive from either Bolshevism (in the East) or capitalism (in the West). The National Assembly committee that drafted the social rights was headed by a Roman Catholic. A close reading of the Constitution shows that many of these rights are framed in terms of state responsibility rather than of citizens\u2019 rights (The education of the youth has to be provided by public institutions) or even citizens\u2019 duties (Schooling is obligatory). Some are essentially directive principles (The interests of the self-employed in agriculture, industry, and trade are to be promoted in legislation and administration). At least, some commentators on the constitution took the view that only more traditional rights were binding on the state at the instance of the citizen. The Spanish Constitution of 1931 was another constitution sometimes described as including socio-economic rights. Nevertheless, again it tends to lack a real rights-quality. For example, under Work: \u2018The Republic will legislate in the direction of providing to all economically needy Spaniards access to all levels of education so that they do not fi nd themselves restricted", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e229311e-8bec-4a63-81f6-6192a66d3c40": {"__data__": {"id_": "e229311e-8bec-4a63-81f6-6192a66d3c40", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "07b3a14185497c0d8d861db255f60951448d79e2611ee29013ba791153c0c785"}}, "hash": "07b3a14185497c0d8d861db255f60951448d79e2611ee29013ba791153c0c785", "text": "other than by aptitude or calling.\u2019 Socialist constitutions, including that of the USSR in 1936, also tended to be aspirational rather than rights-providing. So, for example, a statement that \u2018Citizens of the USSR have the right to education\u2019 is immediately expanded by a list of the ways in which the right is ensured, which is essentially a manifesto for educational development. The drafters of the Irish Constitution of 1937 were apparently inspired by the Spanish Constitution of 1931, marrying Roman Catholic concerns for social justice with some legal conservatism. It was the fi rst to specify clearly the implications of directive principles and, indeed, the fi rst to identify a class of provisions clearly distinct from rights. Ireland defi ned the status of Social Principles in the following way: The principles of social policy set forth in this Article are intended for the general guidance of the Oireachtas [the legislature]. The application of those principles in the making of laws shall be the care of the Oireachtas exclusively, and shall not be cognisable by any Court under any provisions of this Constitution. 88 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS Ireland was followed by India in 1950. In the Indian Constituent Assembly, some thought that only rights that the courts could enforce should be in the constitution, and even that non-justiciable rights would create an unwarranted impression of progress and freedom. Other views were either that such rights, if included, should be enforceable, while others thought they should be excluded from the constitution or included as Directive Principles only, the position fi nally adopted. However, because of concerns that these principles would not be taken seriously, it was decided to include a strong statement about the duty of the State to observe them (Article 37). Many other constitutions have adopted the Directive Principles approach especially for socio-economic policies. The adoption of the ICESCR and the passing of the South African constitution have changed the debate somewhat. In fact, even in South Africa it was not clear that socio-economic rights would be included. The ANC Freedom Charter, 1955, emphasized civil and political rights, but its later draft Bill of Rights did include socio-economic rights. However, some commentators, even ANC sympathisers, felt that constitutionalizing socio-economic rights would raise false hopes. It would give the judges a role in deciding public expenditure that they felt was inappropriate, would involve them in policy decisions, and in prescribing courses of action. But others were convinced that these rights were essential to deal with the economic and social impacts of the apartheid regime as well as the political ones.9 The Constitutional Assembly in which the ANC had a large majority, decided to adopt a series of rights closely modelled on the ICESCR. The process for adopting the 1996 constitution required that the Constitutional Court endorse it as complying with thirty-four principles in the interim constitution. The court did endorse the inclusion of these rights, rejecting any rigid distinction between them and civil and political rights. The inclusion of socio-economic rights had been challenged on the ground that they violated the separation of powers, since they would effectively involve judges in law making and allocation of resources.10 BOX NO. 2.6 THE SOUTH AFRICAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT IN THE CERTIFICATION JUDGMENT \u2026many of the civil and political rights entrenched in the [Bill of Rights] will give rise to similar budgetary implications without compromising their justifi ability. The fact that socio-economic rights will almost inevitably give rise to such implications does not seem to us to be a bar to their justifi ability. At the very minimum, socio-economic rights can be negatively protected from improper invasion. CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 89 The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, in a society with a history of deep divisions and reliance on identity politics as well as of discrimination against one section of the community on religious grounds, referred to the relevant peace agreement which mentions rights \u2018to refl ect the principles of mutual respect for the identity and ethos of both communities and parity of esteem.\u2019 It proposed an obligation, not just a permission, to take \u2018affi rmative action measures to improve the lives of discriminated against groups.\u2019 Of particular interest are proposed rights such as education, language rights in education, a right to access services essential to health, life, or security, as well as the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. There would be a provision that \u2018No-one shall be allowed to fall into destitution.\u2019 and to \u2018adequate accommodation appropriate to their needs.\u2019 Not only persons actually affected would be able to go to court, but anyone", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "66b8a047-de9a-4916-b9f5-8d30f99beb56": {"__data__": {"id_": "66b8a047-de9a-4916-b9f5-8d30f99beb56", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1500e5b6733e7447a9ef221ee1bb7d264d1764fbec69ee3f2615ffae22c959d2"}}, "hash": "1500e5b6733e7447a9ef221ee1bb7d264d1764fbec69ee3f2615ffae22c959d2", "text": "with suffi cient interest, to be defi ned as having regard to the need to ensure access to justice.11 A UK parliamentary committee, considering a Bill of Rights, commented that opinion on including economic and social rights is currently polarized, and that the division of opinion often follows party political lines. It proposed an approach for the UK based on the South African progressive realization approach, but without any right of individuals to go to court to enforce their own rights. This is mainly because of the reluctance to give the courts any role in deciding government expenditure. They proposed that initially the rights mentioned should be restricted to health, education, housing, and an adequate standard of living, and to a healthy and sustainable environment.12 The tradition of including socio-economic rights in the constitutions of various Latin American countries goes back to early in the twentieth century. In some recent constituent assemblies, such as Ecuador and Bolivia, these have been pushed successfully, especially by the indigenous groups, sometimes assisted by foreign NGOs. In Ecuador, in 1997\u20138 the indigenous people\u2019s movement was successful in getting socio-economic rights into the constitution as well as various collective rights by strategies that involved both participation in the offi cial Constituent Assembly and various other methods of campaigning, and putting pressure on the assembly and government.13 However, the Directive Principles have not been entirely superseded by justiciable rights. The various recent Latin American constitutions such as Ecuador 1998 and 2009, and Bolivia 2009 have provisions that it seems could only operate in this way. Similarly, the Constituent Assembly of Nepal 90 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS (elected in 2008) has established various committees including one on Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles. With these preliminaries, we turn to the discussion of how to incorporate the MDGs, especially through socio-economic rights, in the constitution. 4.2.1 Enforceable Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms Not every commitment to rights found in a constitution\u2019s Bill of Rights is fully enforceable, either because of some vagueness of language or because of provisions that make enforceability depend on new laws. However, a deliberate decision to put a provision into the Bill of Rights usually indicates, at least in modern constitutions, a notion of some sort of legal force. So there is a special quality to rights in a Bill of Rights. We have already explained what it means to have a right. In a state, the scope of rights is as defi ned in the constitution or another law. Human rights are binding on the state and sometimes also the private sector (see below) and enforceable in the courts. Ideally, rights should be binding and enforceable without need for further legislation. Nonetheless, many times rights are formulated \u2018as provided for in law\u2019, which transfers the authority to the state which can make the rights more or less binding depending on the laws it passes, or even negate them altogether by passing no legislation, and deprives them of the character of rights inherent in the human being. There is a particular tendency to use such phrases in the case of socio-economic rights, partly because of the tendency to assume that such rights necessarily involve positive action and expenditure of money (but see pp. 46\u20137). There is a great deal of this in the Nepal Interim Constitution, which says: \u2018Every citizen shall have the right to basic health services free of cost from the State as provided for in the law\u2019 (Article 16). There is a similar provision in the Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms in Quebec in Canada: \u2018Every person has a right, to the extent and according to the standards provided for by law, to free public education.\u2019 This will probably have the effect that if there is no law there is no right. In most countries the courts will not order the passing of a law. There is a dilemma. How can the court order Parliament to pass a law? What happens if they do not do it? There may be a genuine need for new laws and standards before a right can be effective. Is there any way to deal with these provisions in the constitution in a way that ensures that even if this is so, it is not used as an excuse for total inaction, deliberately or by oversight? We discuss this in section 4.2.7 (at p. 131). CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 91 Some constitutions have other provisions that undermine rights. For example, they may say that existing laws are not affected by rights, or that parliament can freely make a law to undermine the rights.

Philip Alston, former chair of the UN Committee on ESCR, has described a Bill of Rights as \u2018a combination of law, symbolism and aspiration.\u201914 Not every right need be expressed in the same terms. Just as some element may be immediate (such as free primary education) and others need progressive realization, so it might be unrealistic and unworkable to include every element as giving rise to an enforceable right. That is a matter for individual countries, taking into account of styles of drafting. Of these different ways of recognizing rights, the most legally effective is as human rights. With the agenda of MDGs in mind, socio-economic rights should, as far as possible, be expressed in the form of justiciable rights, as has been done in South Africa. In this way, they will not be seen as inferior to civil and political rights and state agencies, including courts, will have to harmonize all kinds of rights in an integrated scheme of entitlements. A basic commitment to a regime of rights through the preamble or statements of national values and principles is a useful supplement, by highlighting the importance of human rights and enabling interpretations of other legal concepts and provisions in the context of human rights. These preamble statements or state principles are also a good place to indicate the objectives of human rights, such as human dignity and democracy. However, some desirable objectives may be hard to turn into rights and so the directive principles or values would be the best place for them. Something like elimination of poverty or conservation of resources is not something that can be made a right of any person or even a group. 4.2.2 Identifying the Types of Rights to Include in the Constitution In Part I, we have indicated the different types of rights. Traditionally, most rights have been rights of individuals, on the basis of equality and non-discrimination. This is the approach of the UDHR. The restriction of rights to individuals is based on liberalism where the freedom of the individual (as a citizen) is paramount. Liberalism itself perhaps assumes that the citizens of a state belong to the same nation, that is, they speak the same language and profess the same religion, and are, thus, strongly bonded. Today, due to confl icts and other reasons, we have become aware of social, ethnic, and cultural diversities across, as well as within 92 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS states, and the need to accommodate them (a point which is stressed in the Millennium Declaration). In addition, the power of corporations over the lives and destinies of the people has increased enormously, ever since 1948, and the imposition of human rights obligations on them is a means to accountability in the exercise of this power. There is increasing awareness of gender discrimination and the vulnerabilities of different groups\u2014children, indigenous peoples, elderly, disabled, migrants, and ethnic minorities. Since the UDHR, efforts have been made to redress discrimination against and the vulnerabilities of these groups by conferring on them special rights through several international conventions and declarations, especially in recent years. There is still a strong bias in favour of individual rights in national constitutions. However, there is the beginning of inclusion of special rights, particularly based on international instruments. A good starting point for identifi cation of rights is the obligations accepted by the country when becoming a party to human rights treaties. Some countries have chosen to give special status to only a few rights. For example, Nepal, in its Interim Constitution, gives more protection to the right to education than to most other rights which still appear in the directive principles. However, if a country is bound in international law to observe a full range of rights and the issues that they refl ect are important, is there any reason for being selective in this way? It may be that a particular country has endorsed certain rights only with reservations (see pp. 15\u201316). Existing obligations can be a starting point, but should not be the ending point. After the constitution is drafted, the country may enter into new human rights treaties; the right to environment is a relatively new right, for example. International thinking may expand existing rights; the ICESCR mentions food, but that is now widely accepted to include a right to water, on which the Committee on ESC Rights has produced a General Comment. There are various ways in which a constitution can deal with the emerging rights issue.

In other countries that does not happen until a national law is passed to implement them. This is a matter of national legal tradition, but it would be possible for the constitution in any country to say explicitly that new rights accepted by the state would automatically become a binding part of national law. There are some problems about this idea: the language of a treaty may not necessarily be CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 93 the most suitable for a national constitution or law. There is also a risk that this will not be understood when human rights treaties are made, especially as in many countries parliament understands little about new human rights treaties and there may be little public debate. So, there is no real understanding of the implications of becoming a party to treaties. The problem to some extent could be taken care of in the part of the constitution dealing with adoption of treaties, for example, by a provision requiring ratifi cation (fi nal adoption) of treaties to be made by the legislature after a debate. At least there could be a constitutional requirement, once a treaty has been ratifi ed, of a parliamentary debate on what will be required to implement it. International law is not the only source of rights, and the needs of the particular country may necessitate recognition of rights that are not signifi cant in other countries. The South African Constitution says that the Bill of Rights does not deny the existence of any other rights, whether from law or custom, provided they do not confl ict with the constitution. 4.2.3 Defi ning the Scope of Rights Although certain rights are usually drafted in similar language, often using the words of the UDHR or other international treaties, there is no fi xed and required way to formulate any rights. Comparison between different national constitutions would reveal widely differing wording for some rights. This is particularly so in the case of socio-economic rights, and also in the rights of certain, especially vulnerable, groups. Nevertheless, different words can have signifi cantly different implications. Drafters and civil society groups, who hope to see their particular concerns incorporated in a constitution, should pay careful attention to the words used. In the following paragraphs we consider the components of a right. Among the issues that must be looked at are whether a right is actually created for the public, generally, or the group, particularly, in need, rather than an aspiration or a duty on someone else and if so, what is the extent of the right. Simply because something appears in a chapter of a constitution called Bill of Rights, it is not conclusive. What is it that people have a right to? Many rights are traditionally framed in terms only of results. People have a right to life, a right to equality, a right to freedom of speech. There has been an assumption that all this is required to achieve the right is for the State not to interfere. Some long recognized rights are sometimes spelled out in detail and sometimes expressed in broad terms. For example, a right to a fair trial might be simply expressed in those words. Sometimes it might be spelled out in 94 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS detail: including rights to a lawyer, to an interpreter, to notice of charges, even a right to a transcript of the trial. Even if this approach is adopted, it is wise to include the phrase \u2018fair trial\u2019 to ensure that other possible unfairness is covered. It also invites reference to international standards, whereas a technique of listing details of the obligations may suggest that the constitution is a complete programme for implementation.15 Such an impression could be avoided by making it clear that the detailed obligations are only examples, and the duties include those that are specifi ed. Modern understanding of rights, even of some of the longer recognized ones, like right to life, now emphasizes not just the negative obligations of the state, its duty of restraint, but also its more positive duties. The UN\u2019s elaboration of the duty to protect implies that states must take positive measures. The constitution of South Africa refl ects this when it says, \u2018The state must respect, protect, promote and fulfi l the rights in the Bill of Rights,\u2019 using language developed in connection with economic, social, and cultural rights. It is not necessarily appropriate to spell out in detail what those positive obligations are. The same cautions apply as in the previous paragraph. 4.2.4 Specifying What Constitutes Violations of Rights It might", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5d064a65-39f0-433a-9bdc-73c344a240a0": {"__data__": {"id_": "5d064a65-39f0-433a-9bdc-73c344a240a0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "56e73ab7e98968862d834144fbc84e3c26da44dbe7d79a98df1094153546e5d0"}}, "hash": "56e73ab7e98968862d834144fbc84e3c26da44dbe7d79a98df1094153546e5d0", "text": "seem easy to recognize violation of rights, but this is not always so. Particularly important is the question of indirect discrimination: whether a law or a practice that on the face of it is not discriminatory, but is discriminatory in effect, is a violation. A commonly cited example is a height requirement, perhaps for employment. It may be set at a level that excludes far more women than men. It does not say women are not to be recruited, but that is the result. If there is a real need for tall people this may not be unfair, but otherwise such discrimination should not be allowed. Similarly, educational qualifi cations for particular positions may have been crafted with certain sorts of applicants in mind. They may exclude non-traditional applicants and, thus, prevent them from gaining employment. The requirements are discriminatory; if the qualifi cations are really necessary for the work, then that is not unfair. However, very often no thought goes into whether qualifi cations should be revised to bring in new types of applicants and do away with discrimination. Rights are usually rights to results: people should not be unfairly excluded or discriminated against at all; there is no need to inquire whether there was an intention to discriminate. A well drafted Bill of Rights will make this clear. The South African Constitution uses the words \u2018directly or indirectly\u2019. CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 95 The situation is often different for socio-economic rights, where the obligation of the state is often to achieve a right progressively. The obligation is not necessarily to produce certain results, though it is to work towards those results (sometimes described as an obligation of conduct). Nonetheless, in an individual case a person may be able to show that though there were efforts, they were not enough (see section on specifi c rights, especially the Grootboom case on the right to housing16). If individuals or groups are able to bring legal actions for violations of these rights, they must show not only inadequate efforts but also that they themselves have not achieved or been granted something to which they were entitled (in other words an absence of result). A constitution will not spell out these things in detail, but a court wrestling with whether there is a violation of a socio-economic right may fi nd guidance in the decisions of foreign courts and international bodies. The Importance of Equality A good deal can often be achieved in terms of socio-economic rights by using more established constitutional provisions. Many of the grievances in society stem from resentment at unequal treatment. Equality is a key feature of virtually any modern Bill of Rights, whether or not it mentions rights to education, housing, and the like. In Belarus, the constitution guarantees a right to housing. However, when a complaint was made to the Constitutional Court about the law on the privatization of housing, the response of the court was not to attack the law on the basis of the right to housing (indeed, it seemed to accept the claim that the law was a way of fulfi lling the right to housing in the constitution). It also said that the law violated the equality clause of the constitution because it made unjustifi ed distinctions between the rights it gave in certain different housing situations.17 A consequence of declaring this clause unconstitutional was hopefully to enhance the housing rights of the groups previously discriminated against; but the particular decision did not depend on the constitutional right to housing. Staying in the area of housing, the UN Committee on Racial Discrimination (the treaty monitoring body for the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination) said that the cancellation of a programme for housing for members of the Roma community in a town in Slovakia should be reversed because it was racially discriminatory, and responded to racist complaints from minorities in the town.18 96 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS 4.2.5 Specifying Who Should be the Benefi ciaries of Human Rights Some constitutions make a distinction between the rights of citizens and non-citizens. Such a distinction is unfortunate, for all persons have human rights\u2014regardless of whether they are citizens or not\u2014which the law must recognize. No distinction is made in international human rights treaties between citizens and others resident in a country\u2014except for political rights. Article 25 of the ICCPR restricts political rights of citizens, that is, the right to vote and stand for elections, access to the public service, and to take part in the conduct of public affairs.

In 1985, the UN General Assembly adopted a Declaration on the Human Rights of Individuals who are not Nationals of the Country in which they Live, which seeks to give them most of the civil rights, including rights of workers\u2014though, not political rights as defi ned in Article 25 of the ICCPR, or socio-economic rights. A particularly diffi cult situation is faced by those persons who do not have any citizenship\u2014numerous communities in the world fall in this category. Not only can they not exercise political rights anywhere, but even other rights may be denied to them. Stateless communities are usually also marginalized communities because of the discrimination against them. Normally, a state would intervene on behalf of its citizen whose rights have been violated\u2014a stateless person cannot count on this type of assistance. This is why Article 7 of the CRC gives every child the right to a nationality and the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness was passed in 1961, requiring states in certain circumstances, like the birth of a child in their country who would otherwise be stateless, to confer nationality on the child. Possibly, this principle that rights are for all might be modifi ed to some extent for socio-economic rights. Casual visitors would not be entitled to housing. However, they ought perhaps not to be denied emergency healthcare, as the result might be death. Refugees would have more entitlements than holiday makers as would long-term residents, regardless of whether they are citizens. In South Africa, citizens have the right to choose their work freely, but most of the other rights apply to everyone. We have already noted in Part I that a number of treaties confer rights on particular communities which are distinct from and additional to those given to all persons. Of particular signifi cance are rights of minorities and CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 97 indigenous peoples,19 to aspects of their culture, like personal laws or land rights. Some constitutions do recognize special rights. Sometimes, these are to recognize cultural differences, differences which are of particular signifi cance to the community in question. In principle, there is no objection to this, so long as the differences do not operate to disadvantage others (except in cases of affi rmative action, referred to above) and there is valid justifi cation for them, as often there is. There is sometimes a problem of defi ning the community and membership in it, if a person has only one parent belonging to the community, or if the community insists on self-identifi cation. This problem is seldom dealt with in the constitution and it is left to administrators or judges to decide on diffi cult problems of membership. Other special rights could best be described as targeted rights, which essentially guarantee and underline, for specifi c groups with particular diffi culties, the rights generally recognized as those of members of society. The Kenyan 2004 draft had provisions about persons with disability and the elderly. For example, on persons with disability, it said there was a right to access to education, to institutions, and facilities for persons with disabilities that are as integrated into society as a whole as is compatible with the interests of those persons. The constitution of Portugal also has an article on the rights of persons with disability. Women and children are groups for whom rights are now often specifi ed; the South African constitution has an article devoted to the rights of children, for example. Such rights are usually modelled on human rights treaties. Other sections of society have a claim to be thought of as having special needs. These include the elderly, though there is not yet a global treaty devoted to their rights; however, they are mentioned in a Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights, in the European Social Charter, and the African Charter on Human and People\u2019s Rights. Another group is prisoners. Again there is no treaty on the rights of prisoners. However, there are international standards on the treatment of prisoners and in many countries there have been court cases about the rights of prisoners to adequate food and to decent conditions and the right to vote.

Or, there may be the fear that having special rights for different groups may undermine the notion of universal human rights. There may be fear that this form 98 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS of recognition, especially of ethnic minorities, may threaten national unity. Others may complain that the recognition of these separate rights increases the length of the constitution and makes it confusing for the ordinary citizen. We consider that there is considerable merit in including special provisions for the above mentioned groups which aim at overcoming past injustices or present disadvantages, or recognizing their particular identity and, thus, dignity. Attempts to impose uniformity on diverse communities pose a greater threat to national unity than recognizing the special circumstances of groups. Inclusion and social justice are better achieved by such recognition than by assuming a homogeneity that in practice discriminates against minorities. In multi-ethnic states, there are many competing interests (economic, political, or cultural), which must be reconciled\u2014the framework of human rights must be and can be used to balance them. The inclusion of such special rights in a constitution would encourage the members of the community in question to insist on their rights and also help them feel accepted in society. The rights would also guide unimaginative or inexperienced lawyers, and courts, especially those unaccustomed to applying international norms. There is one possible risk about greater detail and special rights, that some provision will refl ect a particular philosophy at a particular time. If constitutions had had provisions on indigenous peoples when the ILO Convention of 1957 was the leading instrument, they might have emphasized integration into society. Now the philosophy of international instruments refl ects choice and the preservation of culture\u2014if that is what the people concerned wish. A provision on choice of language in education might be at odds with research that shows that children learn best in the early stages in their mother tongue, perhaps a right to education in one\u2019s mother tongue might be appropriate. Constitution makers need to consider the appropriate balance between a right to choose the language of instruction, a choice that would be exercised by parents or guardians, and educational effectiveness, which will affect the child. So far, we have discussed human beings as benefi ciaries of human rights. Many rights can, of course, be exercised only by individuals, such as rights about the family, and most socio-economic rights. Today, a great many economic and social activities are carried out by corporations or associations, and they could perhaps benefi t from rights like the freedom of expression, and the right to property, or rights of association, or rights to engage in economic activity. Should they be allowed to do so? Sometimes CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 99 this seems justifi ed. In the case of a newspaper/media company, if it could not rely on freedom of expression, it would be at the mercy of the government, and easily closed down, or strangled by unreasonable conditions being placed on its operation. With the rapid growth of globalization in recent decades, corporations are wielding increasing power and to give them the benefi t of all human rights may make it more diffi cult to hold them accountable or to control their activities (as when companies have demanded the benefi t of the right against self-incrimination).20 A question here is to what extent should the freedom of expression exist: should it apply to what is called commercial speech (including advertising)? It is not surprising that different countries have taken different positions on this issue. If the Bill of Rights is silent on the question (as most are) then it would be for judges to decide\u2014and judges can differ on the answer, not only as between countries but also within the same country.21 It is, therefore, advisable for the constitution to address this point. The answer to whether non-human bodies have rights need not be \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019, but qualifi ed. The type of speech or other protected right may be, as in the European Convention system, relevant to deciding whether laws limiting it are justifi ed. There laws restricting commercial speech are more readily accepted as valid, for example, than political speech. Here, again, the South African solution is instructive.

This essentially leaves it ultimately to the judiciary to strike the right balance between the legitimate interests of juristic persons and protection of rights of others. 4.2.6 Identifying the Duty Holders The most obvious duty bearers are the state and its institutions. Human rights developed to defi ne the relationship between the state and citizens, and to restrict the powers of the state in relation to citizens. The state as the primary duty holder is expressed in several constitutions. The Indian Constitution says, \u2018The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part [Fundamental Rights] and any law made in contravention of this clause shall, to the extent of contravention, be void\u2019\u2014Article 13 (2). Elsewhere in that constitution, it is clear that the State may not discriminate in the application of law, so executive action or policies are also subject to obligations that fl ow from human rights. \u2018State\u2019 100 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS is broadly defi ned to include the executive and legislative authorities of the Union and States, especially as defi ned by the Supreme Court, and includes state corporations and statutory authorities, or even bodies receiving state support. The test is whether the body is an instrumentality or agency of government. However, this concept has not been without controversy or diffi culty for the courts.22 In Hong Kong, the courts held that a public university was not a public authority and, therefore, was not subject to human rights obligations\u2014a very questionable decision. Nonetheless, drafters of a constitution might feel that the courts are the best bodies to decide how far the obligations to respect human rights extend. In other words, they would be prepared to leave some vagueness. Nevertheless, such an approach also creates problems for bodies like human rights commissions, when interpreting a mandate to investigate violations of human rights. The South African constitution is more comprehensive: \u2018The Bill of Rights applies to all law, and binds the legislature, the executive, the judiciary and all organs of the state\u2019\u2014section 8(1). One effect of this is that rights apply in relation not only to state enacted law but also common law. Constitutions with similar provisions include that of Fiji Islands Constitution. How far are clearly non-state persons and bodies bound by the human rights of others. Are they duty holders? Until recently, most Bills of Right explicitly provided, or it was assumed, that only the state had duties. Bills of Rights applied only vertically (between the State and citizen) not horizontally (between citizens). Some courts have taken a different view, even where the Bill of Rights is silent. Where the constitution is silent, there is no legal difference between companies and individuals. Nonetheless, there is more concern about corporations, because they have the greater capacity to abuse rights. Sometimes the State owns various corporations, often known as parastatals, including nationalized industries. As wholly owned arms of the state, it is not so diffi cult to hold that they must observe human rights, though careful drafting could make this crystal clear. Indian courts have often held that bodies performing functions on behalf of the State are in fact State for purposes of the constitution, including human rights. As one Indian judge said, otherwise the State would be able to \u2018play truant with human rights\u2019 by using corporations.23 What about legal private corporations? The UN has been devoting a good deal of attention to the question of the responsibility of business for human rights.24 Whether corporations can be said to have legal obligations CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 101 to respect and protect human rights has been the subject of much academic debate. There is a particular focus on the role of transnational companies (generally fi rst world companies operating in third world countries). In 2008, the Human Rights Council said that they have a responsibility to respect human rights, using the language of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Human Rights and Transnational Corporations and Other Business Enterprises.25 In addition to compliance with national laws, the baseline responsibility of companies is to respect human rights. Failure to meet this responsibility can subject companies to the courts of public opinion\u2014comprising employees, communities, consumers, civil society, as well as investors\u2014and occasionally to charges in actual courts. John Ruggie, Special Representative of the Secretary General The liability of companies is particularly important when previously public functions are transferred to private corporations, that is, privatization.

Reading a right to access to water as meaning that the state must protect such access may enable the courts to decide that the state is in violation. Nevertheless, if the fault is with the company rather than with the state, it may be necessary or desirable to hold the company liable. If the constitution is silent on whether companies are bound by rights, the courts may still be able to develop the law in a way that is shaped by human rights, at least if the judiciary itself is bound by the Bill of Rights (which is not expressly provided in many constitutions). For example, a court could decline to enforce any transaction between private parties that involves the infringement of rights.26 However, the Canadian courts have held that they are not bound by the human rights in this way and in some countries the courts have less scope for law making. How about companies conducting purely private operations? The constitution of Papua New Guinea, drafted in 1975, has an interesting provision: Section 41: \u2026any act that is done under a valid law but in the particular case\u2014 (a) is harsh or oppressive; or (b) is not warranted by, or is disproportionate to, the requirements of the particular circumstances or of the particular case; or 102 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS (c) is otherwise not, in the particular circumstances, reasonably justifi able in a democratic society having a proper regard for the rights and dignity of mankind, is an unlawful act. This appears in the human rights chapter. It is not clear what the implications of its being an unlawful act are. The provision has been applied, including between an employer and employee in 2008.27 But, the constitution goes further and says that human rights generally apply \u2018as between individuals as well as between governmental bodies and individuals\u2019, unless the constitution indicates otherwise. This is not the only example in the Pacifi c island states of horizontally applicable human rights provisions.28 The South African constitution is explicit: \u2018A provision of the Bill of Rights binds a \u2026 juristic person if, and to the extent that, it is applicable, taking into account the nature of the right and the nature of any duty imposed by the right\u2019. Nevertheless, it is not always clear what this might mean. Most often it would be used as a guide for deciding whether a body was acting lawfully in some other area of the law (for example, whether a contract was reasonable), and the South African courts are specifi cally directed to develop the common law, that is, judge made law, in accordance with the human rights provisions. So, in deciding the reasonableness of the behaviour of a company, rights could be taken into account. Individuals carrying out specifi c public functions may be covered, as in The Fiji Islands: \u2018This Chapter binds \u2026(b) all persons performing the functions of any public offi ce.\u2019 The position of purely private individuals is not fundamentally different from that of private business (though courts may be more inclined to try to fi nd companies liable, either because of their greater capacity to cause harm or because of they are, in some cases, carrying out functions on behalf of the state). Again, the Papua New Guinea and South African constitutions are explicit that they are liable. In fact, courts that accept an obligation to take human rights principles into account, as they apply and develop the law, may also be able to apply them to the obligations of individuals. Some constitutions make only a few very specifi c rights applicable horizontally. For example, in The Fiji Islands, \u2018Every person has the right of access, without discrimination on a prohibited ground, to shops, hotels, lodging houses, public restaurants, places of public entertainment, public transport services, taxis, and public places.\u2019 Most of these are under private control, so clearly exclusion would normally be an act of a private person. CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 103 Many constitutions recognize the responsibility of individuals among others, but tend to say that this is an area where the state must make laws, thus, making the rights contingent on that law. We can see this in the recent constitutions of Nepal.

We, next, discuss this issue further. 4.2.7 Rights That Require Law One might describe this as \u2018giving with one hand and taking away with the other\u2019: the rights law or constitution says that there is a right, but immediately adds \u2018according to law\u2019 or as provided by law. A determined citizen and courts can maintain that this does not totally negate the right. Nonetheless, it often proves very hard to make any real use of the right if no law is passed. In Nepal a right to information was included in the 1990 constitution but no law, which was required, was passed for seventeen years. Such a provision should be used only if strictly necessary. Where there is some detail in the constitution itself or in international jurisprudence, it may not be necessary. A new constitution could have a transitional provision giving the legislature a period of, say, two years to make any new law. After that, the courts could be free to apply the right, with it still being open to the legislature to pass laws to defi ne the right more clearly. 4.2.8 Drafting Styles and Drafting Precision In preparing a constitution, it is important to take into account national traditions of drafting and interpretation. Broad sweeping statements of principle are more common\u2014at least for provisions intended to have legally enforceable effect\u2014in the laws of countries in the civil law tradition (which include Eastern Europe and Latin America). While countries of the common law tradition may permit some vagueness and even some emotion in preambles, and now in directive principles in some countries, legally enforceable provisions are usually drafted with careful attention to the words used and thinking in advance about how judges (raised in the same tradition) will interpret the words. Advocacy for provisions should take these factors into account without, however, being too constrained by tradition or hampered by legal conservatism. In fact, even in countries with more detailed drafting traditions there is room, and need, for choices about how much detail should be put in 104 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS human rights provisions. A discussion of a new Bill of Rights for South Africa suggested that rights should be expressed in broad terms rather than in great detail, for the following reasons: to be more accessible to the ordinary citizen \u2022 to discourage detailed litigation about the real meaning of the words \u2022 used, and encourage cases concerned with whether government action is justifi able to minimize the risk of inadvertently cutting down rights (which \u2022 can happen with more detail) to allow for evolutionary interpretation and constitutional \u2022 growth.29 In the event the Bill of Rights adopted by the Constitutional Assembly is framed in rather more detailed terms than these scholars had suggested. To some extent this may be attributable to legal caution, and to some extent to the participatory process through which the fi nal constitution was prepared. Experience shows that ordinary people want to see their own concerns refl ected and are not likely to be convinced by lawyers\u2019 assertions that these are embraced by broad formulations. Drafting a Bill of Rights is not like drafting a tax law yet there is a need to consider every word, just as in a tax law. To take a simple example: women and men should receive equal pay. In the past this idea was expressed sometimes as same pay for the same work. Then it was realized that very often socially prescribed or supported roles meant that women and men did rather different work, so it as not enough to say all engineers must be paid the same if very few women were engineers, while very few men were nurses. The phrase equal pay for equal work became more popular, but many laws and some constitutions now say that there must be equal pay for work of equal value. Even this requires elaboration\u2014equal value does not mean whether someone will pay the same, but the value in terms of the qualifi cation and required experience, the demands of the work, and the conditions in which it is carried out. The concept is sometimes described as comparable work, or pay equity.30 4.2.9 Socio-Economic Rights: How Should They Be Framed Some constitutions talk rather generally, such as saying, \u2018Everyone has the right to health\u2019. Others go into considerable detail. The details may be more important for some rights than others. It is common to be quite detailed about rights to work and in work.

In fact, they refi ned and, perhaps, limited the full scope of these rights by referring to access to housing and health care. Indeed, they do not provide a right to health as such, although the International Covenant mentions the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. No constitution can spell out all the details. There is far more guidance to be obtained from foreign courts, and from treaty bodies and special rapporteurs\u2019 reports than could ever be encapsulated in a single Bill of Rights. There are two aspects of detail: i. When one says a right to something, what is it a right to? ii. What must be done to achieve that right? There has been a good deal of elaboration of the former aspect, often referring to issues like availability of a right, accessibility\u2014meaning physical, fi nancial, and in other ways\u2014appropriate, and acceptable, which includes cultural or religious acceptability. Reference to such ideas as applied to socio-economic rights, generally, or a group of rights could be made in a constitution, provided they are not used to limit the extent of a right. Some constitutions, especially in Latin America, go into great detail about what the government must do to achieve the rights. Sometimes, these go so far as to incorporate a particular political philosophy. Many people would think that this is anti-democratic because it would prevent the electorate\u2019s choice in future being fully carried out. The balance is not easy. A commitment to rights is itself a philosophy but it is one that now has universal acceptance, at least in theory. The drafting challenge is to include the core of the rights without crippling legitimate political choice in future. The challenge is as much for the courts as the drafters. For example, courts have been able to say to governments, \u2018you may privatize nationalized industries, but you must not do so in a way that leads to violation of rights\u2019. The drafters of the South African Constitution decided against detailed prescriptions of how to achieve rights, though they did prescribe affi rmative action for the removal of historic injustices. They turned to the ICESCR for language using the following expressions: progressive realization \u2022 reasonable legislative and other measures \u2022 within its available resources and to the developments of the rights \u2022 by the international mechanisms for this point: respect, protect, and fulfi l rights. \u2022 106 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS Not only does this give some guidance to what the responsibilities are, but not how to achieve them. It also automatically brings in international interpretations. However, the drafters were careful. They did not permit progressive realization for every right\u2014as rights to free primary education, emergency health care, and from arbitrary evictions are not something to be worked towards, but are an immediate need. Would it be appropriate to use the very language of international instruments in the constitution? Some countries have done this (Hong Kong, with the entire ICCPR, the UK with the ECHR). Some of those instruments are drafted concisely in a way that might be useful in a national constitution but others are too detailed. Treaties are always a result of a process of bargaining and, as a result, may be rambling and sometimes over-inclusive, sometimes under-inclusive. Rephrasing rights in a way that fi ts into the particular country\u2019s legislative style, brings out the important points clearly, and is concise and likely to make for a Bill of Rights that is workable in the particular context. The Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal has held that when drafting ordinary laws giving effect to the Bill of Rights, which is itself drafted in the language of the ICCPR, the language used in the law must comprehensible to those with primary responsibility for ensuring respect for the right. Rather unusually, a statute copied the ICCPR phrase public order (ordre public) when setting out the grounds on which the police might lawfully restrict peaceful assembly. The Court held that this was so vague that it did not satisfy the requirement of the Bill of Rights and ICCPR that any restriction must be provided by law. A vague law is no law.31 Belts and Braces Drafting Popular participation in constitution-making tends to increase the wordiness of drafting.

Rights may also need to be qualifi ed or even suspended in cases of serious emergencies which put at risk the life of the nation or of its communities (an issue which is discussed later at pp. 114\u201315). At the same time there is always the risk that the government would put unnecessary restrictions on rights in order to enforce unpopular policies or to control the people, for example, by severe restrictions on the media. It is, therefore, necessary to strike a balance between the abuse of rights by the rights holder and the limitation of rights by the government. There are three ways in which rights have been limited. The fi rst is seen in the US, where the constitution does not impose limitations so that the responsibility for defi ning permissible limitations has fallen on the judiciary.32 Unless the judiciary is both competent and independent, there is the danger that it would tend to favour the government, particularly in cases with a political fl avour. It is also unfair to throw this heavy burden on the judiciary without some guidelines. Though, we tend to expect the judiciary to be the voice of reason and stability when popular passions, including those of politicians, may lead to overriding of rights, they are not always so. In various countries the judges have gone too far in permitting restrictions of rights, especially in times of national stress such as wartime.33 There is also insuffi cient guidance to the legislature as to the permissible restrictions on rights when it makes laws. And there is not suffi cient predictability for citizens. Today, it would be rare for a constitution not to seek to give guidance on permissible restrictions. The second way to limit rights has been to specify the permissible grounds for limiting each right, which was the common approach until recently. This has the advantage that the restrictions could be tied to the 108 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS particular right. For example, it may be more acceptable to have more or different limits on the freedom of expression than on the right to life. One problem is that in this way the Bill of Rights may have more words dealing with restrictions than with rights! This is something you fi nd in the Constitution of Nepal; for example, both the 1990 and the Interim Constitutions have long exceptions provisions in relation to major civil rights. This gives the impression that rights are of little importance or limited relevance and it may detract from the primacy of rights. It can also make it hard for a non-lawyer to read and understand the Bill of Rights. There is the danger that a judge, who wants to rule in favour of the government and the restriction, may fi nd it easy to latch on one of the qualifying factors. A second problem is that it may be diffi cult to anticipate all the possible reasons for legitimately limiting rights. Either one has a long list, or one says \u2018other legitimate reasons\u2019, in which case having the specifi c list of reasons for limiting a right seems to make less sense.34 The third approach to restricting rights was used in the Canadian Charter of Rights", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0fe320f2-e951-4773-8026-0eedca7ed300": {"__data__": {"id_": "0fe320f2-e951-4773-8026-0eedca7ed300", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "77ef275637d52254ac1e17a06f646fd38c216e4276149a4b947868dd7e7c2149"}}, "hash": "77ef275637d52254ac1e17a06f646fd38c216e4276149a4b947868dd7e7c2149", "text": "and Freedoms. This involves having a general provision on restrictions, ideally as the fi rst Article in the Bill of Rights, so that the reader is immediately aware of the possible qualifi cations on rights. Article 1 of the Canadian Charter reads: The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justifi ed in a free and democratic society. The Canadian Supreme Court requires that when a party argues that a limitation in question is unlawful, that party has to prove that there has indeed been a limitation. Then it is up to the government to prove that the limitation is within the terms of Article 1. It will be clear from that Article that the restrictions must have been made by law and not merely by an administrative act. Then it is necessary to prove that the limitation is for a purpose which can be demonstrably justifi ed in a free and democratic society, which presumably places value on human rights and political freedoms. However, the rule established by the courts is that even if the purpose is justifi ed, the limitation must be proportional to the objective, so that a person\u2019s right is not unduly limited. The Israel Basic Law on Human Dignity and Liberty of 1992 says, \u2018There shall be no violation of rights under this Basic Law except by a law befi tting the values of the State of Israel, enacted for a proper purpose, and to an extent no greater than is required.\u2019 CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 109 South Africa followed this strategy, incorporating elements of the approach of the Canadian courts and emphasizing more clearly the importance of human rights. The South African provision (Article 36) reads: 1. The rights in the Bill of Rights may be limited only in terms of law of general application to the extent that the limitation is reasonable and justifi able in an open and democratic society based on human dignity, equality and freedom, taking into account all relevant factors, including: (a) the nature of the right; (b) the importance of the limitation; (c) the nature and extent of the limitation; (d) the relation between the limitation and its purpose; and (e) less restrictive means to achieve the purpose. 2. Except as provided in sub-sec. (1) or in any other provision of the Constitution, no law may limit any right entrenched in the Bill of Rights. The Papua New Guinea constitution has an interesting provision designed to keep conceptions of what is justifi able in a democratic society up to date. This is to be \u2018determined in the light of the circumstances obtaining at the time when the decision on the question is made\u2019. In the Namibian constitution, the scope of limitation is specifi ed together with each right, but there is also a general clause controlling all limitations. It says that the limitation shall be of general application, that is applying to all persons in a similar situation, and adds that it \u2018shall not negate the essential content\u2019 of the right (Article 22). This is perhaps not an easy expression but is intended, no doubt, to suggest that though a right may be limited it may not be destroyed. Some constitutions combine the listed exceptions approach with the reasonable limitations approach, in other words, as well as listing an exception, they say that any law must impose reasonable restrictions (as in the Indian and Nepalese constitutions, or they say that the laws must also be \u2018reasonable and justifi able in a free and democratic society\u2019, to take the example of the recently abrogated Fiji Islands constitution). On balance, the Canadian/South African approach seems to be better. It emphasizes the overriding importance of human rights, gives judges the task of balancing the importance of a person\u2019s right with the public interest, and requires proportionality in the limitation. The last point is particularly valuable for there are judgments of courts in numerous countries where a court, having found a possible ground for limitation, has gone on to uphold the limitation without focusing on the relationship between the extent of limitation and the necessity of the limitation. 110 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS It is possible, within the approach of a general limitation clause, to specify that some rights cannot be limited at all (for example, the right to be free from torture) or, equally, to specify that a particular right may be limited to a greater extent than under the general formula. Some limitations are too wide.

This can make serious inroads into the human rights, especially in a country that is making a new constitution, precisely because of confl icts that have arisen from past human rights abuses. Who can limit human rights? Some constitutions say that only legislation may limit human rights. This means that the common law, judge made law relevant only in some countries, cannot impose any limit, however reasonable. In Papua New Guinea only a law satisfying certain conditions can impose limits on human rights. It must say expressly that it is made for the purpose of limiting rights, specify what right or freedom that it regulates or restricts, and be passed by a majority of all members of the legislature (Article 38 of the Constitution). A fi nal point: limitations that may be possible in ordinary circum- stances are different from what are often called possible derogations that may take place in case of an emergency or other special situations (see pp. 144\u20135). Application of These Ideas to Socio-Economic Rights Achievement of certain socio-economic rights may be put forward as a justifi cation for limiting civil and political rights. Governments may justify interference with property rights in the interests of providing public facilities for education or health. They may argue that dealing with economic problems of a country requires clamping down on freedom of expression or association. On the whole, this type of argument is unconvincing\u2014it is the attitude that was partly responsible for the division of rights into civil and political rights (CPR) and economic, social, and cultural rights in 1966. So far as the issue of property rights is concerned, it is usual for a constitution to indicate that property can be acquired for public purposes. Usually it will also be said that compensation must be paid. However, the South African Constitution says that compensation can take into account not just market factors but even the purpose of the expropriation. How about limiting socio-economic rights? This has been an issue when programmes of structural adjustment or other programmes involving cuts in public spending or privatization are undertaken or even CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 111 forced on states. Certainly, there is a risk that these programmes can lead to a violation of the progressive realization provisions of the Covenant. It has been suggested by the Committee on ESCR that a state could use its obligations under the ICESCR to resist some such pressures. 4.2.11 Protecting the Rights How can the rights be protected from being undermined by government and others? Linking the National to the International Mechanisms As described in Part I, a state which is a party to an international human rights treaty is required to make periodic reports to the treaty body on the implementation of rights under the treaty. It also has, at the least, a moral obligation to follow the recommendations of the treaty body. Unfortunately, many countries do not submit their reports on time, do not publish the reports locally, and often disregard the recommendations of the treaty body. There is very little publicity at the national level about the requirement of reporting or on the recommendations. One way to strengthen the international system and at the same time strengthen rights domestically is to link the constitution to the international system. The Bill of Rights could require that: the government must submit the report to treaty bodies on time \u2022 in preparing the report, it must hold consultations with civil society \u2022 and other relevant organizations it must publish a draft of the report in the country for a reasonable \u2022 time, before it is to be submitted to the treaty body, for public discussion it must take account of comments on the draft \u2022 civil society organizations should be facilitated to attend hearings \u2022 by the treaty body or at least to submit their comments, or an alternative report to it the government must publicize the comments and recommenda- \u2022 tions of the treaty bodies and must report to the legislature how it intends to respond to the recommendations.35 There could similarly be a brief provision requiring that any other UN report, such as of Special Rapporteurs, should be laid before the legislature and debated. Another way in which the Bill of Rights could be linked to the international system is by requiring the government and the courts, when 112 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS considering a human rights issues, to pay regard to the interpretations and decisions of the international courts and treaty", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "515a0bf1-06a4-4193-a976-b103c4ec5565": {"__data__": {"id_": "515a0bf1-06a4-4193-a976-b103c4ec5565", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "19d0dfd790b994ab19269344905ef6c0f97679df6c8e7c251f3373906eb47009"}}, "hash": "19d0dfd790b994ab19269344905ef6c0f97679df6c8e7c251f3373906eb47009", "text": "bodies relevant to that issue (on courts see following paragraphs). What Role, If Any, should Courts have in Protecting the Rights? This takes us to a crucial issue: what is to be the role of the courts? To some extent this must be left to the courts themselves though reluctant courts might need encouragement and over-enthusiastic courts some restraining. A decision to put socio-economic rights in the Bill of Rights already suggests a role for the courts. This may involve the courts deciding that the acts of, or even the laws made by, the government are unconstitutional. In some countries, it is unacceptable or, at least highly unusual, to allow the courts to declare laws made by parliament unconstitutional on any ground. Most countries have moved more towards giving the courts a role in this. The UK still fi nds this a problem, and the Human Rights Act, 2000, only allows the courts to declare that a law is contrary to the Act, not to give any directions. The government (a Minister) may amend the law in question by an order, which must be laid before parliament and needs its positive approval. A recent parliamentary Select Committee proposed that the courts be allowed to use the socio-economic rights to interpret laws and they should also be able to decide that measures taken by the government to fulfi l these rights are unreasonable. This matches many of the decisions in India and South Africa where the courts have decided that measures are unreasonable.36 However, the Indian courts have sometimes gone a good deal further and directed governments to do certain things. Often, when courts are given the power to decide whether something is reasonable or not, it is left to the courts to decide how to approach this question. However, the Select Committee suggests criteria for the courts to take into account, including the availability of resources and whether the measures adopted by the government are capable of facilitating the realization of the relevant rights. They say that the courts would have no jurisdiction to enquire into whether public money could be better spent. This is not a draft law; a proper law or constitution would almost certainly allow the courts to use other criteria also. In some countries, guidance is given to the courts about their task of interpreting the human rights provisions and the law, generally, from a human rights perspective. In Canada, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms \u2018shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the preservation and enhancement of the multicultural heritage of Canadians\u2019 (Article 27). CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 113 This relates to a very specifi c issue. The South African Constitution says, more generally: the courts must promote the values that underlie an open and democratic society based on human dignity, equality, and freedom when interpreting the Bill of Rights. It may be helpful to urge the courts to refer to international law and to cases in other countries to understand the rights more fully. The Constitution of South Africa does this when it adds, \u2018the court must consider international law; and may consider foreign law\u201937 as does the Constitution of the Fiji Islands: \u2018\u2026must, if relevant, have regard to public international law applicable to the protection of the rights set out in this Chapter\u2019. In many countries reference to international law is common in courts and it is becoming more common, but in some countries this sort of constitutional encouragement could be very useful. Looking back at the UK Select Committee proposals, it is clear what remedies would be available, if any, to persons affected by a breach. No individual would be able to enforce the rights. In South Africa the courts have not rejected the idea of claims by individuals; one of the earlier right to health cases involved a single person. In fact, the court declined to make any order because this would involve the courts in deciding priorities on individuals, which the Select Committee in the UK also feels would be inappropriate for a court. Should the courts be able to order any sort of compensation for those whose rights have been violated? In some countries courts have given compensation, notably in India. In a sense this is creating a new civil wrong of violation of a socio-economic right and involves a complex range of issues that cannot be explored here. Just as a note: the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms does include a right to compensation for breach of rights, and some of these are socio-economic rights.

In some countries, it is normal to give such a dramatic power only to the highest court, or a special constitutional court. In some eyes this may have disadvantages: fi rstly, it means that any claim that a law is unconstitutional must be taken to the highest, more remote, and most expensive court in the land. Secondly, it means that there can be no appeal from the decision of the court, whereas, in most systems there will be at least one appeal from any court decision. The second objection may be partly answered if the one court in question is really high-powered having several judges, and those being the most experienced and independent. 114 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS In some countries, it is possible for a court, usually a special constitutional court, to be invited, in a case brought for the purpose, to declare that a law not yet passed or not yet in force is unconstitutional. In Cambodia there is a body called the Constitutional Council comprising \u2018dignitaries with a higher-education degree in law, administration, diplomacy, or economics\u2019. The Constitution says that \u2018The King, the Prime Minister, the President of the Assembly, or one-tenth of the assembly members\u2019 may forward a Bill to the Council which must decide within 30 days if it is constitutional. After a law is promulgated, the King, the Prime Minister, the President of the Assembly, one-tenth of the assembly members or the courts, may ask the Constitutional Council to examine the constitutionality of that law. Ordinary citizens, however, would have to appeal against the laws through their representatives or the President of the Assembly, not directly to the Council which has made access to it diffi cult. There are some problems with these provisions. Firstly, to send a Bill to the Council, before the national assembly has even debated it, is to detract from the democratic role of the legislature. In some countries, even the second procedure would be thought inappropriate as the courts would not be permitted to decide on an issue like unconstitutionality in the absence of a concrete problem. The very existence of a special body outside the court structure, such as the Cambodian Constitutional Council, would not be acceptable in some systems. It must also be said that the Cambodian body has proved weak and ineffective\u2014showing that even powerful sounding provisions may be useless. The Supreme Court of India has developed a whole series of modifi cations of traditional court procedural rules designed to enable Public Interest Litigation for the genuinely disadvantaged (see Box on p. 27). It is usually under these procedures that the courts, especially the Supreme Court, have decided many of the cases referred to in this book. A few other countries have followed this lead, especially in South Asia, though not perhaps with the same exuberance as in India. A few constitutions have articles that refer to constitutional remedies in a way that brings in some of the Indian innovations or their spirit. Thus, the 1990 Constitution of Nepal said \u2018Any Nepali citizen may fi le a petition in the Supreme Court to have any law or any part thereof declared void on the ground of inconsistency with this Constitution because it imposes an unreasonable restriction on the enjoyment of the fundamental rights conferred by this Constitution or on any other ground. There is no CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 115 requirement that the citizen be personally affected.\u2019 The Constitution of South Africa provides that the persons who may approach a court for the enforcement of rights are: (a) anyone acting in their own interest; (b) anyone acting on behalf of another person who cannot act in their own name; (c) anyone acting as a member of, or in the interest of, a group or class of persons; (d) anyone acting in the public interest; and (e) an association acting in the interest of its members. Specifying Other Bodies to Protect Human Rights The main responsibility for fulfi lling these rights, even more so than in the case of civil and political rights, must rest on politicians and administrations, and the sanctions are primarily political. However, it is possible to give legal responsibilities to others. For example, a few constitutions say that the government must report on its performance on socio-economic rights. An example is Ghana where, The President shall report to Parliament at least once a year all the steps taken to ensure the realization of the policy", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c5ef7767-4fc8-4791-9184-c68d289be984": {"__data__": {"id_": "c5ef7767-4fc8-4791-9184-c68d289be984", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e2b24144e058e5a23edcf4f6c69f76deabed35cf2efbeb8520047754c508263e"}}, "hash": "e2b24144e058e5a23edcf4f6c69f76deabed35cf2efbeb8520047754c508263e", "text": "objectives contained in this Chapter and, in particular, the realization of basic human rights, a healthy economy, the right to work, the right to good health care and the right to education. In Ghana most of these rights are in Directive Principles and the President\u2019s duty is no doubt partly there because of the absence of any responsibility enforceable through the courts. Nevertheless, this need not be the case because this sort of responsibility could co-exist with enforceable duties. In South Africa, the Human Rights Commission is given a particular responsibility to report on economic, social, and cultural rights, and government departments must report annually to the Commission on their own performance. The Commission issues a voluminous report (no longer annual) and it has devised various means to investigate and interrogate government departments. It is an onerous duty for the Commission and undoubtedly involves a good deal of overlap with other government departments\u2019 responsibilities. The committee sees its role as enhancing the understanding of the rights and encouraging better performance. It makes recommendations, which are often necessarily rather general. The value of the reports, perhaps, lies in the information and analysis and not in the recommendations. 116 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS Should the constitution give any indication of how rights should be monitored, as opposed to saying who should monitor them? The 2004 Kenyan draft proposed: Parliament and the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice shall establish standards for the achievement of the rights. It would not be appropriate to have too much detail in a constitution on how to monitor, but the principle of careful monitoring could be required. This coupled with a provision requiring perhaps that the Statistical or Census Offi ce be independent (to try to avoid political tampering), and a right to information,38 could provide useful tools for civil society and others concerned to see the realization of rights. Education may play an important part in protecting rights. This is a function that the constitution could give to a body like the human rights commission. Finally, it is the experience of all countries that organized civil society is important in protecting rights. A constitution may give special recognition to civil society. The rights of association, assembly, and free speech are extremely important in protecting civil society from government efforts to suppress criticism. Without these civil and political rights, economic, social, and cultural rights cannot be protected. We say a little more about civil society in Part III. Protection against Amendment or Suspension A constitution may be made; it may also be changed. It is always quite hard to change the constitution (often, it requires two-thirds of all members of the national parliament to do so). One important decision to be made is whether it has to be specially hard, or even impossible, to change to the constitution to remove or reduce human rights protection. In the Constitution of Portugal, \u2018The rights, freedoms, and safeguards of the citizens\u2019 cannot be amended.\u2019 The Constitution of South Africa does not have any special protection of human rights, but there are elaborate provisions for publicity and for ensuring public input and reasoned debate on any constitutional amendment. It is common for constitutions to allow some suspension of human rights provisions in a situation of grave emergency. In such situations, government may have to move very quickly and there may be threats to the nation that justify steps that in ordinary situations would not be permitted. However, the drafters of the constitution must be careful to ensure that these special powers are only available when really justifi ed, CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 117 and that, specially, any reduction of human rights protection is strictly necessary. Attention must be paid to: When can a state of emergency be declared? \u2022 Who can declare it and by whom does it have to be approved \u2022 (particularly is this subject to democratic control)? How long can it last? \u2022 What special powers are or may be granted, and to whom? \u2022 Which of the human rights provisions may be affected during an \u2022 emergency? The Constitution of South Africa is specially careful on the last point. It says that: (4) Any legislation enacted in consequence of a declaration of a state of emergency may derogate from the Bill of Rights only to the extent that (a) the derogation is strictly required by the emergency; and (b) the legislation\u2014 (i) is consistent with the Republic\u2019s obligations under international law applicable to states of emergency; (iii) is published in the national Government Gazette as soon as reasonably possible after being enacted.

Does this have any relevance for constitutions? A partnership is at the heart of the Millennium Declaration, but constitutions are usually concerned with institutions, powers, rights, and duties within an individual state. It cannot give, for example, a citizen of a state a right against another state. The state has a duty, as we have already discussed, not just to protect, but also to protect and promote the rights of its citizens. Arguably, even without any special mention of the possibilities of international aid or involvement, a state that fails to tap those possibilities could be held to be in breach of its obligations. So a citizen, with a right to sue the government for failure to protect or promote, might be able to include as evidence of such failure that fact that the state rejected the possibilities of the partnership. Many constitutions include Directive Principles of State Policy (see p. 82). While we argue here against relying to heavily on these to protect 118 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS rights, they might perhaps have a place as guiding the government\u2019s foreign policy in relation to the MDGs. While we would argue that a constitution should not pre-empt the political process, a Directive Principle on the following lines might be worth considering: The State must use the opportunities offered by foreign assistance and investment for the benefi t of the people, especially to fulfi l basic needs, so far as compatible with national sovereignty and control of resources. This would not be legally binding, though courts might feel they are able to use it in interpreting the duty to fulfi l rights to food and other aspects of livelihood. This suggestion is intended only to stimulate debate, as we are fully aware of the arguments about the irrelevance, or even damaging nature, of foreign aid, and the dependence it can create. What about the developed countries? It would not be appropriate for citizens to be given a right that their governments should play their part in the Millennium enterprise. Nevertheless, there is no reason why aspirational statements of such countries\u2019 constitutions should not refer to international responsibilities. The constitution of Ireland says: \u2018Ireland affi rms its devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation amongst nations founded on international justice and morality.\u2019 A constitution might equally say that \u2018[the country] affi rms its commitment to fulfi lling its obligations under international law, and offi cially endorsed programmes of the United Nations, including in relation to the contribution of the country to the achievement of a fairer world through aid and international cooperation.\u2019 This would not create a legally binding obligation under national law but it could have political value, specially at any time when the government was tempted to cut back on foreign assistance. 5. SPECIFIC RIGHTS 5.1 EDUCATION MDG 2: Achieve universal primary education MDG 3: Promote gender equality and empower women A right to education has been included in many constitutions going back to the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizens (which the Constitution of 1793 said was to be upheld by the State). Education is needed by all. Society ought to favour with all its power the advance- ment of the public reason and to put education at the door of every citizen. CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 119 The French Constitution of 1791 had also said: Public instruction for all citizens, free of charge in those branches of education which are indispensable to all men, shall be constituted and organized, \u2026 We fi nd here the main ideas that have been included in more recent constitutions: a general right to education, \u2022 a particular right to free education at the most basic level, and \u2022 the purposes of education. \u2022 More modern constitutions often say something about setting standards for education which is important, especially when the constitution provides, as many do, for the freedom to set up educational institutions: something that is important to many religious and minority groups. Constitutions with a vision of the purposes of education have included Mexico in 1917: Article 3. The education imparted by the Federal State shall be designed to develop harmoniously all the faculties of the human being and shall foster in him at the same time a love of country", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c3e550d0-9dc2-46a1-8453-4c69dd3647e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "c3e550d0-9dc2-46a1-8453-4c69dd3647e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "911e8c7f4dffba8d0c592dba2ec4a14fd61ba7312028d6a58f469ef7e65ea070"}}, "hash": "911e8c7f4dffba8d0c592dba2ec4a14fd61ba7312028d6a58f469ef7e65ea070", "text": "and a consciousness of international solidarity, in independence and justice. That constitution (as changed up to 1946) included provisions about the education being democratic, national, and contributing to human relationships. Especially since the UDHR and the various international human rights treaties, national constitutions have tended to refl ect the main features of those documents: free and compulsory primary education \u2022 progressive introduction of education for all at higher levels, \u2022 secondary, vocational, and tertiary fundamental education for those who have missed out on the \u2022 formal system gradual introduction of free education at various levels \u2022 freedom of establishment of schools \u2022 compliance with national standards if these are set \u2022 education supporting human rights, the United Nations, \u2022 Internationalism and Peace, and the development of the human personality the need for discipline in schools to respect the child\u2019s dignity (CRC) \u2022 Not all countries have been equally happy with all these ideas! 120 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS Need for Clear Drafting As emphasized earlier, it is important to have constitutional provisions that are clear and can be used. To be clear in wording, it is important to be clear in what you want to achieve. The Right to Education project interestingly compares the constitutions of Albania and Bangladesh, showing how much vaguer the former is: ALBANIA \u2018Everyone has the right to education. Mandatory school education is determined by law.\u2019 It is unclear from this extract whether the constitution makes education mandatory or if further legislation is required. \u2018Mandatory education and general high school education in public schools are free.\u2019 The only thing that is certain is that everyone should attend high school and it should be free. However, it is not clear who should provide the education. It is certainly arguable that the State should provide it, but the law does not say anything to obligate them to do so. This is a real weakness as it suggests that no one could easily be held accountable for the failure to provide education. BANGLADESH \u2018The State shall adopt effective [key word] measures for the purpose of: establishing a uniform, mass-oriented and universal system of education and extending free and compulsory education to all children to such a stage as may be determined by law.\u2019 This extract clearly identifi es the State as the body responsible for providing uniform education for all. The only limitation is the phrase \u2018as may be determined by law\u2019. However, this refers only to the extent (years) of free education, but does not give the option as to whether or not to provide free education. The Bangladeshi extract confers far greater responsibility on the government than the Albanian one. It should be noted that both include the vital aspect that the right to education should be made available for all children.39 Points that might be considered: \u2022 Age for primary education: many constitutions do not say how long primary education should be for Language: research shows that children tend to learn better in \u2022 early years in their own language. This may be a particular issue in countries with ethnic minorities (where it may be hard to provide mother tongue education for all) Minorities: apart from language, minorities might wish to have \u2022 aspects of their culture included Punishment and violence in schools: reports in Kenya suggested \u2022 that some street boys had run away because of violent punishments CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 121 in school; girls in Nepal were reluctant to go to school because they feared physical abuse. The Convention on the Rights of the Child says that punishment in school should respect the child\u2019s dignity. Possibly a constitution might mention this, and the need for schools like other aspects of society, to be free from abuse, physical or otherwise Fees: though primary education is supposed to be free, in many \u2022 countries all sorts of fees are charged that make it quite expensive.40 These are usually clearly in violations of constitutional provisions about free education, but should the constitution say more? Education for disadvantaged groups or children, for instance, \u2022 Dalits in India or Nepal. In some countries members of certain groups are marginalized in society and even in schools. Dalits, or untouchables, can be seated at the back of the class, children living with HIV, or albinos or persons with disabilities may also be segregated formally or in practice, and children of migrant workers or children with disabilities may suffer discrimination. In theory, equality should deal with most of these issues and a lawyer might take the view that special mention is unnecessary, but groups with particular problems in a", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "37506cbb-15ea-4109-ac27-13b84277b502": {"__data__": {"id_": "37506cbb-15ea-4109-ac27-13b84277b502", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e802a46f79f7f0e939b786213832a94c40858a8f0e241c552657037b18d1fb78"}, "3": {"node_id": "4e17dfbb-b6a9-47de-8496-74b0bf43d18c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bfacf3291a2eabec6ed6ec67a3af0812b2e8e922fa378aadfaba4c0ab6494ce0"}}, "hash": "578ec66de0286d8e4565a175f4b374fbbb89369bdd271eff819e44c972665a22", "text": "society may wish to see their concerns specifi cally accommodated, as all embracing provisions have not worked for them in the past.

Other things countries might want to include but some of which might be doubtful in terms of international law: The Constitution of Turkey, Article 24 says: No language other than Turkish shall be taught as a mother tongue to Turkish citizens at any institutions of training or education. This sort of provision, though intended to build a sense of nationhood, is not only unlikely to be good in pedagogical terms, but is in violation of the rights of minorities. It has been a particular issue in Eastern Europe, especially for the Roma. A prohibition on the use of other mother tongues is a clear violation of international human rights law. The Constitution of Mexico (1917\u201346) drafted at a time of a major split between the church and State, and said that: Freedom of religious beliefs being guaranteed by Article 24, the standard which shall guide such education shall be maintained entirely apart from any religious doctrine and, based on the results of scientifi c progress, shall strive against ignorance and its effects, servitudes, fanaticism, and prejudices. Such a prohibition on religious elements in education, and even that privately provided, is probably contrary to the ICESCR.

A recent study divided them into various types: 1. A statement of aspiration, stating a goal in relation to the health of its citizens. Many of these are principles of state policy, such as in Namibia (Article 95, \u2018\u2026 the government should take care of the health of the people\u2019, or the Sudan Interim Constitution, and Article 19, \u2018\u2026shall promote public health and provide basic medical services and facilities).\u2019 2.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e17dfbb-b6a9-47de-8496-74b0bf43d18c": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e17dfbb-b6a9-47de-8496-74b0bf43d18c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e802a46f79f7f0e939b786213832a94c40858a8f0e241c552657037b18d1fb78"}, "2": {"node_id": "37506cbb-15ea-4109-ac27-13b84277b502", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "578ec66de0286d8e4565a175f4b374fbbb89369bdd271eff819e44c972665a22"}}, "hash": "bfacf3291a2eabec6ed6ec67a3af0812b2e8e922fa378aadfaba4c0ab6494ce0", "text": "A statement of entitlement, stating a right to health or health care or public health services.

This refers to a statement about the duty of the government in connection with health, for example, in the constitution of Cambodia which says that \u2018The State shall establish infi rmaries in rural areas.\u2019 Some statements are less in terms of duty and more of fact (in the style of former socialist countries, or the constitution of China today; again Cambodia\u2019s constitution says \u2018The State gives full consideration to disease prevention and medical treatment.\u2019 4.

Some South American constitutions go into detail about how health care is to be organized. 124 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS 5. A referential statement, incorporating, by specifi c reference, any international or regional human rights treaties recognizing a human right to health or health care.41 For example, the constitution of Haiti refers to the UDHR in connection with the right to health. The major divide in these various provisions is whether they appear to provide an actual right for people. Guidelines, exhortations, principles, and even state responsibilities are not, or not necessarily, the same things. Even responsibilities are phrased with varying degrees of commitment. Ethiopia says, \u2018To the extent the country\u2019s resources permit, policies shall aim to provide all Ethiopians access to public health and education,\u2019 although it also says, \u2018The State has the obligation to allocate ever increasing resources to provide to the public health, education, and other social services.\u2019 Other important factors are whether they speak of a right to health, or to health care. Some deal with specifi c situations like a right to emergency healthcare, but not other types of health care. Some constitutions speak, usually in general terms, about responsibilities in connection with public health. Some speak of a healthy environment, occasionally, as a right, but often as a less precise duty or responsibility of the state. And several constitutions (for example, Ethopia) speak of issues related very specifi cally to maternal health, especially the possibility of maternity leave\u2014which is very relevant to both the mother\u2019s and child\u2019s health. What is included in the concept of health also varies. A few constitutions refer to reproductive health, notably South Africa, and the Interim Constitution of Nepal and Ethiopia: \u2018\u2026women have the right of access to family planning education, information and capacity.\u2019 It is often said that there is no right to be healthy; even under the ICESCR there is only a right to the best attainable standards of health. Some people can never be really healthy, for genetic reasons. Unusually, the constitution of Cambodia says that \u2018The health of the people shall be guaranteed\u2019 (Article 72). Some constitutions provide, as they do with other rights, that the right exists \u2018as provided by law\u2019, which, as we have already remarked, can greatly weaken the right. Thailand\u2019s 1997 constitution is an example, when it purports to give a right to the poor \u2018\u2026to receive free medical treatment from public health centres of the State,\u2019 or Slovenia which says, \u2018Everyone has the right to health care under conditions provided by law\u2019 and \u2018The rights to health care from public funds shall be provided by law.\u2019 CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 125 The constitution of Sudan refers to the issues of equality, \u2018equal access to public health care and basic medical services\u2019 (Article 46), which presumably does not mean that access for anyone is actually guaranteed. This great variety of provisions means that it is unhelpful to say that about one-third of countries protect the right to health. In fact, how those provisions will be interpreted by the courts and other institutions of the State also varies enormously. This depends, in part, upon national traditions of interpretation and, to some extent, on the creativity of particular courts and legal professions. Among the large number of cases that have gone before national courts on issues relating to the right to health, we can identify three from different countries. The fi rst was in India, in the Paschim Banga Khet Mazdoor Samity v. State of Bengal,42 when the court did not use an explicit right to health (for there is none).

The second case, Minister of Health v. Treatment Action Campaign,43 is from South Africa, which turned on the right of access to health care services. The state was providing Nevirapine, which prevented mother to child transmission of HIV very cheaply, only through a few centres designated for research. The court held that the government was constitutionally required to realize a programme providing progressively for the rights of pregnant women and their unborn children. It also held that the existing scheme was inadequate because it restricted Nevirapine to certain sites, and that the programme must include reasonable measures for counselling and testing. The third case is from Colombia, where the constitutional court has made a number of important decisions. It has drawn on the International 126 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS Covenant and on the work of the Special Rapporteur. It has insisted that there is a right to health and the State must progressively realize it, and that there is a core obligation that the State has already adopted and must be granted. The Constitution of Colombia has a number of provisions about health, but none clearly invites such a sweeping response from the courts. It does say, \u2018The law will determine the limits within which basic care for all the people will be free of charge and mandatory.

Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger This is the most basic of the MDGs. Apart from the general right, which is not spelled out, the ICESCR spells out the right to be free from hunger by saying that states must take the measures needed to improve methods of production, conservation, and distribution of food by making full use of the technical and scientifi c knowledge, by disseminating knowledge of the principles of nutrition, and by developing or reforming agrarian systems in such a way as to achieve the most effi cient development and utilization of natural resources. The right to food has been elaborated, especially by special rapporteurs, and the Committee on ICESCR. The Committee has suggested that the right means: CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 127 The availability of food in a quantity and quality suffi cient to satisfy the dietary needs of individuals, free from adverse substances, and acceptable within a given culture; The accessibility of such food in ways that are sustainable and that do not interfere with the enjoyment of other human rights. It has neatly been suggested that the food must be adequate, available, accessible (physically and fi nancially, and in other ways), and acceptable (culturally, for example). \u2018Adequate\u2019 will include not just quantity but also issues of safety and nutritional value. \u2018Available\u2019 includes the idea of sustainability (that it is not just there now, but will continue to be). This really is the idea of food security, for both the present and future generations. Another idea that has come into more recent discussion is that of food sovereignty. This is not a concept of international law; indeed it is to some extent an anti-globalization concept.

In 2003, the FAO studied all the constitutions of the world and discovered that many of them had some sort of protection for the right to food, though they said those protections could be described variously as high, medium, medium low, or low. About twenty-one constitutions had a high level of protection. The Constitution of South Africa has a provision clearly based on the ICESCR: 27. (1) Everyone has the right to have access to (b) suffi cient food and water; and (2) The state must take reasonable legislative and other measures, within its available resources, to achieve the progressive realisation of each of these rights. 28. (1) Every child has the right 128 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS (b) to family care or parental care, or to appropriate alternative care when removed from the family environment; (c) to basic nutrition 25. (2) Everyone who is detained, including every sentenced prisoner, has the right (e) to conditions of detention that are consistent with human dignity, including at least exercise and the provision, at state expense, of adequate accommodation, nutrition, reading material and medical treatment. In fact very few other countries have a clear right to food in any legal sense. Far more of the countries, even with high protection have provisions like those of Brazil: Article 227. Children and Teenagers (0) It is the duty of the family, of society, and of the State to ensure children and adolescents, with absolute priority, the right to life, health, food\u2026 or Uganda: XXII. Food security and nutrition. The State shall\u2014 (a) take appropriate steps to encourage people to grow and store adequate food; (b) establish national food reserves; and (c) encourage and promote proper nutrition through mass education and other appropriate means in order to build a healthy State. These are State focussed rather than right focussed provisions. The new Constitution of Ecuador (approved by referendum in 2008) provides that: Article 13. Individuals and groups have the right of secure and permanent access to safe, suffi cient and nutritious food; preferably produced at the local level and corresponding to the various identities and cultural traditions. The State of Ecuador will promote food sovereignty. The Constitution goes on to defi ne the last: Article 281. Food Sovereignty Food Sovereignty constitutes an objective and strategic obligation of the State to guarantee its individuals, communities, peoples and nationalities self suffi ciency in healthy food, culturally appropriate in a permanent form. You will see that the focus is on the State and its obligations. The Interim Constitution of Nepal, at the instance, it is understood, of the Maoists, provides: CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 129 Every citizen has the right to food sovereignty as provided for in the law and The State shall have the following responsibilities\u2026to pursue a policy of establishing the rights of all citizens to education, health, housing, employment and food sovereignty The fi rst is odd, as food sovereignty is not really a right of individuals. The second is not a right at all but a non-enforceable, in the legal sense, state responsibility. When drafting provisions like this, it is important that new, and ill-defi ned, ideas should not squeeze out those with clearer defi nition and for which guidance in interpretation is available at the international and, often, foreign level, such as the right to food. A starving Nepali might have to fall back, like his Indian counterpart, on the right to life (see below). There are other countries which have provisions that can be used, by creative lawyers and courts, to support the right to food. The Constitution of Switzerland says that: 12: Everyone who is in a situation of distress and who does not have adequate means for their support, has the right to be aided and assisted and to receive the indispensible means to lead an existence consistent with human dignity. The Swiss Federal Court held in a case, in 1996, that there is a right to basic necessities, and that though it could not say how the government should meet the need, it could set aside a law that would result in a failure to meet necessities for really needy people. The case involved refugees who could neither leave the country without papers nor work without a work permit. There are some important Indian cases, building on the right to life. Particularly, there is a case that has been before the Supreme Court since 2001. The Court held that there was the right to food and it has over the years issued a large number of orders on all sorts of food related topics, and to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "796cd8c9-b7db-4397-8c39-a3e2a17339c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "796cd8c9-b7db-4397-8c39-a3e2a17339c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d0f3c48f976f82fba948f2e2019fb4d5b1a671082d1e59af6a9339d3113ad1b4"}, "3": {"node_id": "7c8acf73-3302-4173-b171-ea8225a27891", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1f88bebcfb7c1f3724aa5d6654814dc545b525b163a8a3e9d18a820367cb5411"}}, "hash": "d05cd4f173d6c2e3a096926dcfb59c2d3b8ca87a602a22954a4579d1c7ec80b9", "text": "various state bodies.45 They relate to food distribution in emergencies, school meals for children and the position of pregnant women, for example.

Though, housing is mentioned only in this connection, it is clear that homelessness and living in squatter settlements is a common feature of poverty. Moreover, without a home, people cannot work, cannot feed themselves, will have unhealthy living conditions. The target here is limited: it does not deal with the homeless, for example. Indeed, improving the lives of slum-dwellers might have little to do with their actual housing. Many international instruments mention housing, though some use the expression shelter, which may sound very basic. The ICESCR gives little detail, but both the Committee in its General Comments and the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Housing have spelled out the right. The Committee suggests it means the right to live somewhere in security, peace, and dignity. In addition, it includes: Legal security of tenure \u2022 \u2022 Availability of services, materials, facilities and infrastructure\u2014 including safe drinking water, energy, sanitation, means of food storage, refuse disposal, site drainage, and emergency services \u2022 Affordability Habitability\u2014adequate space and protection from cold, damp, \u2022 heat, rain, wind or other threats to health, structural hazards, and disease vectors \u2022 Accessibility\u2014even for the disabled, the ill, the elderly, and victims of disasters Location\u2014so that there is access to employment, health care, \u2022 schools and so on Cultural adequacy. \u2022 CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 131 Another international instrument that deals with the right to housing is the European Social Charter, revised, Article 31 of which says: With a view to ensuring the effective exercise of the right to housing, the Parties undertake to take measures designed: i. to promote access to housing of an adequate standard; ii. to prevent and reduce homelessness with a view to its gradual elimination; iii. to make the price of housing accessible to those without adequate resources. In a case against France, the European Committee on Social Rights46 said that though a State cannot be obliged to produce particular results, the rights must take practical and effective, rather than purely theoretical, form. This means that a State must: (a) adopt the necessary legal, fi nancial, and operational means of ensuring steady progress towards achieving the goals laid down by the Charter (b) maintain meaningful statistics on needs, resources, and results (c) undertake regular reviews of the impact of the strategies adopted (d) establish a timetable and not defer indefi nitely the deadline for achieving the objectives of each stage (e) pay close attention to the impact of the policies adopted on each of the categories of persons concerned, particularly the most vulnerable. The Committee commented that the implementation of the Charter requires state parties not merely to take legal action, but also to make available the resources and introduce the operational procedures necessary to give full effect to the rights specifi ed therein. These statements apply not just to the right to housing, of course. National Constitutions In 2000, the Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions47 said that over 40 per cent of the world\u2019s constitutions had some sort of right to housing, from Argentina\u2019s 1853 Constitution to Poland\u2019s of 1997, though many of these have weak or vague rights, and some do not mention housing or shelter specifi cally.

(2) The state must take reasonable legislative and other measures, within its available resources, to achieve the progressive realisation of this right. (3) No one may be evicted from their home, or have their home demolished, without an order of court made after considering all the relevant circumstances. No legislation may permit arbitrary evictions. This provision uses the expression access to adequate housing. There have been many cases that have invoked this Article. The courts have said that respecting the right includes not evicting people so that they have no place to go, while the duty to protect could be used to justify laws that might otherwise be an unconstitutional interference with the right to property. The most famous case concerns the duty to fulfi l. About 900 adults and children had lived in appalling conditions. They decided to move out and occupied vacant private land across the road. The owner, supported by the local council, obtained a magistrate\u2019s court order for their eviction. Their homes were demolished. They were now truly homeless. They could not go back to where they had come from because other people had occupied that land. They had literally nowhere they could live.48 The Constitutional Court said: A court considering reasonableness will not enquire whether other more desirable or favourable measures could have been adopted, or whether public money could have been better spent. \u2026 To be reasonable, measures cannot leave out of account the degree and extent of the denial of the right they endeavour to realise. Those whose needs are the most urgent and whose ability to enjoy all rights therefore is most in peril, must not be ignored by the measures aimed at achieving realisation of the right\u2026 The court held that the measures taken by the state Government had not been enough.49 134 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS Sometimes, the courts can protect the right to housing even if it is not specifi cally mentioned.

The Indian courts have held that the right to life includes a right to housing.51 The Supreme Court said, Right to shelter, therefore, includes adequate living space, safe and decent structure, clean and decent surroundings, suffi cient light, pure air and water, electricity, sanitation and other civic amenities like roads etc. so as to have easy access to his daily avocation. The right to shelter, therefore, does not mean a mere right to a roof over one\u2019s head but right to all the infrastructure necessary to enable them to live and develop as human beings. Right to shelter when used as an essential requisite to the right to live should be deemed to have been guaranteed as a fundamental right. In 1990, the court directed a State Government to constitute a committee to monitor its scheme for allotment of the houses to the weaker sections.52 However, how effective this right has been generally, is a matter of some uncertainty. In fact, it is unwise to assume that a court will take an expanded view of a right that is silent on a particular point. The Constitutional Court in Hungary declined to hold that the right to social security included a general right to housing, though it might include a right to shelter in emergency.53 BOX NO. 2.10 SOURCES ON THE RIGHT TO HOUSING Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions http://www.cohre.org/ ESCR-Net http://www.escr-net.org/resources/resources_show.htm?doc_id= 401410 UN-HABITAT\u2019s Strategy for the Implementation of the MDG 7, Target 11 (2004) link from http://www.unhabitat.org/pmss/getPage.asp?page=downloads 5.5 WATER AND SANITATION MDG 7 Ensure environmental sustainability Halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. \u2018Water is life; sanitation is dignity\u2019 UN Habitat The ICESCR does not mention water or sanitation, but the ESCR Committee has made it clear that it considers that water is part of the CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 135 right to a decent standard of living.

The Autonomous Bougainville Government shall take all practical measures\u2026 (d) to promote water and sanitation management systems at all levels The Bougainville example, however, is not one that gives a clear right to the people, but sets out objectives and aspirations for the province to work towards. How would having a right to water affect the way in which government approaches water issues? Of course, there is no guarantee that the government will respond to such a right. In the case of South Africa, it is suggested that the National Water Act does try to do so. It has as objectives: meeting the basic human needs of present and future generations, promoting equitable access to water, promoting the effi cient, sustainable, and benefi cial use of water in the public interest, facilitating social and economic development, and protecting aquatic and associated ecosystems and their biological diversity. The Constitution is also refl ected in the idea of the public trust, where the government is the trustee of the national water resources for the benefi t of the people, and in the creation of a basic human needs reserve, which \u2019provides for the essential needs of individuals \u2026 and includes water for drinking, for food preparation and for personal hygiene and second of an ecological reserve.\u201956 In 2001, the government developed a Free Basic Water policy so that people were entitled to a minimum amount of free water, based on an assumption of 25 litres per person per day. In fact, this is not really enough for many poor and large households. A number of special issues have arisen in connection with water. One is the question of privatization of water supplies. Whereas, in many developing countries provision of water, at least in urban areas, used to be a matter for public enterprise, private business has often taken over the CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 137 supply of water. In some countries, this has meant that water has become more expensive, so poor people actually fi nd it harder to get access to drinking water. Even in South Africa, despite the constitutional right, there has been a move towards payment above the basic water minimum, including in some places pre-payment, which means there is automatically no more water if there is no payment, and in various places water supply has been privatized. Various court cases have dealt with this issue. In one case, a court decided that water could not be disconnected unless a fair procedure had been used.57 In another case, the court stated that giving no effective alternative to a pre-paid system, under which households did not in fact receive the minimum of water required, was unconstitutional and also ordered that the free allowance be 50 litres a day.58 BOX NO. 2.11 SOURCES ON WATER AND SANITATION Right to Water website (Water Aid and Rights and Humanity) http://www. righttowater.info/code/homepage.asp Independent Expert on the issue of human rights obligations related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation (Catarina de Albuquerque) appointed 2008 see UN Human Rights website on the mandate etc. http://www2.ohchr. org/english/issues/water/Iexpert/Ind_expert_DeAlbuquerque.htm World Health Organisation on Water Sanitation and Health http://www.who. int/water_sanitation_health/rightowater/en/ 5.6 ENVIRONMENTAL RIGHTS AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT MDG 7 Ensure environmental sustainability Integrate the principles of sustainable development into country policies and programmes; reverse the loss of environmental resources.

There is an international Framework Convention on Biological Diversity which does not create rights for people but imposes obligations on states to protect the biodiversity within their own territories, for the benefi t of mankind as a whole. MDG 7, and target 1 under it, focuses not just on the environment but on the concept of sustainable development. This is not the place to discuss this in detail. One infl uential defi nition is that it \u2018meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\u2019. The concept was spelled out in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development of 1993, which speaks of the need to have environmental protection as an integral part of development processes, eradication of poverty as a prerequisite for sustainable development, the necessity to eliminate unsustainable production methods, the need for public participation, and the precautionary principle, which means not waiting for scientifi c certainty before acting if there is the possibility of serious irreversible damage to the environment. There are a few modern constitutions that refer to sustainable development, for example, South Africa, the autonomous province of Bougainville in Papua New Guinea, and Eritrea. The new Constitution of Ecuador has a number of provisions including one on biodiversity: The State will exercise sovereignty over biodiversity, the administration and management of which will be realized with intergenerational responsibility. Most of these provisions are not rights creating but set out aspirations or principles for state action that may not be able to be used in a court context, though they would be important standards by which to measure the state\u2019s laws and policies in a political context. Turning recognition of environmental rights, we fi nd a variety of provisions. Since everyone has an environment, a constitution will not give a right to environment but to a clean, or healthy, or decent environment. The Philippines Constitution includes a State Policy: Section 16. The State shall protect and advance the right of the people to a balanced and healthful ecology in accord with the rhythm and harmony of nature. The Ecuador Constitution says: CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 139 Article 14. The right of the population to live in a healthy and ecologically balanced environment is recognised, which guarantees sustainability and good life [well being], sumak kawsay [an expression of the indigenous Kichwa people meaning good life, which is used at several points in the constitution]. It is not entirely clear what the signifi cance of the phrase is; the right is recognized as opposed to \u2018everyone has a right\u2019 to be found in some other contexts in that Constitution. A number of countries provide more direct rights. Spain says: Everyone has the right to enjoy an environment suitable for the development of the person as well as the duty to preserve it. (This linking of right and duty appears in several constitutions.) The Turkish Constitution provides Everyone has the right to live in a healthy, balanced environment. As so often, the Constitution of South Africa is clearer and more precisely drafted: 24. Everyone has the right: (a) to an environment that is not harmful to their health or well-being; and (b) to have the environment protected, for the benefi t of present and future generations, through reasonable legislative and other measures that - (i) prevent pollution and ecological degradation; (ii) promote conservation; and (iii) secure ecologically sustainable development and use of natural resources while promoting justifi able economic and social development. In a number of other countries, less clear provisions have been used to develop environmental rights out of the right to life or other provisions. India is the best known example but there have been cases in Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Bangladesh as well.

Its underlying vision is one of human self-reliance with the support of the State and the community for those things which people cannot do themselves. We can summarize what the Covenant says about these rights: The \u2026 right of everyone to the opportunity to gain his living by \u2022 work which he freely chooses or accepts The right to fair wages and equal remuneration for work of \u2022 equal value without distinction of any kind; a decent living for themselves and their families\u2019 safe and healthy working conditions; equal opportunity for everyone to be promoted, rest, leisure, and reasonable limitation of working hours and periodic holidays with pay, as well as remuneration for public holidays There are also rights to form trades unions (and employers\u2019 \u2022 organizations), and to strike. Finally: the right to social security, including social insurance. \u2022 Much of the elaboration of rights in connection with work has been carried out by the International Labour Organization, far older than the UN itself. The phrase \u2018decent and productive work\u2019 in the Millennium Declaration comes from the ILO and it has been described briefl y as: Decent work is about opportunities for women and men to obtain decent and productive employment in conditions of freedom, equity, security, and human dignity.59 Of course, a very wide range of factors determine whether a particular country has or can generate productive employment, and many of those factors are outside the control of individual countries. In its country programme for Nepal the ILO says: CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 141 It is the ILO\u2019s view that the generation of productive employment needs to be the primary focus of macro policy, extending from the triumvirate of monetary, fi scal, and exchange rate policies, to a range of other policy spheres that impact on employment\u2014sectoral policies, product market policies and commercial regulation, trade policy\u2014labour policy and social protection, among other spheres.60 Constitutions and work: The Constitution of Brazil is an interesting example because of the range of rights it gives in connection with work. Here is the main article, with an asterisk against those items that can be thought of as social security rights: Article 7. The Rights (0) The following are rights of city and rural workers, notwithstanding any others that seek to improve their social condition: I. employment protected against arbitrary dismissal or against dismissal without cause, according to a supplemental law which shall establish *severance payment, among other rights;

CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 143 There are also full provisions on rights in connection with labour organization and the right to strike. It would be diffi cult, and perhaps undesirable, to achieve agreement on such a detailed range of rights in many countries. Other countries have considerably less in the way of detail. The South African Constitution includes: Assembly, demonstration, picket, and petition 17. Everyone has the right, peacefully and unarmed, to assemble, to demonstrate, to picket and to present petitions. Freedom of trade, occupation, and profession 22. Every citizen has the right to choose their trade, occupation or profession freely. The practice of a trade, occupation or profession may be regulated by law. Labour relations 23. (1) Everyone has the right to fair labour practices. (2) Every worker has the right\u2014 (a) to form and join a trade union; (b) to participate in the activities and programmes of a trade union; and (c) to strike. (3) Every employer has the right\u2014 (a) to form and join an employers\u2019 organisation; and (b) to participate in the activities and programmes of an employers\u2019 organisation. (4) Every trade union and every employers\u2019 organisation has the right\u2014 (a) to determine its own administration, programmes and activities; (b) to organise; and (c) to form and join a federation. (5) Every trade union, employers\u2019 organisation and employer has the right to engage in collective bargaining. National legislation may be enacted to regulate collective bargaining. To the extent that the legislation may limit a right in this Chapter, the limitation must comply with section 36(1). (6) National legislation may recognise union security arrangements contained in collective agreements. To the extent that the legislation may limit a right in this Chapter, the limitation must comply with section 36(1). Social security: This is a rather broad expression. The Committee on ESCR (see p. 108) has recently produced a General Comment on this right.61 It says that: The right to social security encompasses the right to access and maintain benefi ts, whether in cash or in kind, without discrimination in order to secure protection, inter alia, from (a) lack of work-related income caused by sickness, disability, maternity, employment injury, unemployment, old age, or death of a family 144 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS member; (b) unaffordable access to health care; (c) insuffi cient family support, particularly for children and adult dependants.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b7faf01-bc49-422e-93ba-8a6d6549ed63": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b7faf01-bc49-422e-93ba-8a6d6549ed63", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0f173ec31075a27127c4e1fbaed6aeb94ed94be362d8094bf3b9752e163736e8"}, "2": {"node_id": "d121f45a-0067-492b-af21-19727973e512", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f3b519dffa7e54bbfa82fe8ad2de494684df36953665cc568e6963aae6de105a"}}, "hash": "23f74bdab05c21117f784b69e20d267cc74ea35603503f93fae6bc5f8a0f8ecc", "text": "The relevance of this idea for the elimination of poverty is obvious.

Nevertheless, for many poor countries with many unemployed people or people working only in the informal sector or in subsistence agriculture, privately organized social security may be diffi cult to achieve. However, it has been suggested that a country, in order to meet its obligations under the Covenant, should have a plan of action to realize the right, including clear goals, and strategies, benchmarks, time frame, and monitoring systems.62 The same publication suggests that the core obligation should be to provide for the most disadvantaged and vulnerable groups. Who these are will depend on the particular country.63 5.8 CONSTITUTIONS AND SOCIAL SECURITY Many constitutions say little or nothing about social security. We have seen that the Constitution of Brazil says quite a lot but the South African Constitution only says: 27. (1) Everyone has the right to have access to. (c) social security, including, if they are unable to support themselves and their dependants, appropriate social assistance. (2) The state must take reasonable legislative and other measures, within its available resources, to achieve the progressive realisation of each of these rights. The Constitution of Finland says: Section 19 The right to social security (1) Those who cannot obtain the means necessary for a life of dignity have the right to receive indispensable subsistence and care. (2) Everyone shall be guaranteed by an Act the right to basic subsistence in the event of unemployment, illness, and disability and during old age as well as at the birth of a child or the loss of a provider. CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 145 In some countries, especially in Eastern Europe, courts have dealt with cases about the right to social security. The Constitutional Court of Latvia held that laws that did not ensure that employers actually paid social insurance premiums for their employees violated the constitution (and the Covenant).64 The Supreme Court of Venezuela ordered the National Assembly to pass a law fi lling a gap in the social security law, which had left no protection for workers suspended or dismissed (and pending the new law, the court declared that an existing scheme remained in force).65 The Hungarian Constitutional Court has decided several cases,66 and has said that, in general, it is for parliament to decide how to fulfi l its obligations, but it must not reduce social support below the minimum indicated by the constitution which says: Article 70/E Citizens\u2026 are entitled to the support required to live in old age, in case of sickness, disability, or being widowed or orphaned, and in case of unemployment through no fault of their own.

Some human rights activists have attacked this, fearing that the state will abuse the provision for duties and even criminalize non- fulfi lment of duties. They say that duties are hard to specify in a way they could be made enforceable. We consider that there is merit in specifying duties. They are implicit in our understanding of good citizens and responsible members of a community. In many countries for which the MDGs are most relevant, there is so much discrimination and oppression in civil society, much more than through the mechanisms of the state, that they cannot be eliminated except through a sense of responsibility and solidarity. We 146 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS know that poverty and the misery of millions are the result of the greed of some others, particularly capitalists and politicians.

We believe that it is desirable to remind people of and educate children with a sense of responsibility and solidarity. We propose that corporations and other associations, since they are benefi ciaries of rights and their activities have a major impact on the lives of most people, should also be charged with duties and responsibilities, as applicable. The 2003 Rwanda constitution incorporates duties, among which is: Every citizen has the duty to relate to other persons without discrimination and to maintain relations conducive to safeguarding, promoting and reinforcing mutual respect, solidarity and tolerance (Art. 47). One of the best formulations of responsibilities that we know comes from the 1975 (independence) constitution of Papua New Guinea (see Box 2.14). 6. THE INVISIBLE, MDGS, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS The MDGs and their targets deal, on the whole, with total populations (except to the extent that they speak of women, or children, or young persons). Experience shows that poverty does not affect all groups within countries to the same extent or in the same way. In fact, the measures needed to bring people out of poverty will not necessarily be the same for all groups in a country. Statistical targets can obscure this and work to the disadvantage of smaller marginalized groups. Bringing the most deprived groups out of poverty is often more diffi cult, for the same reasons that they are the most deprived\u2014physical remoteness, cultural reasons, as well as poor relationships with majority communities, attitude of majority communities, and so on. These are the groups for which equality provisions are not enough. Positive efforts may be needed to achieve real equality. The experience of minority communities has often been that, in the eyes of the majority, equality means being the same. In other words, the distinctiveness of minorities is not recognized, even when the minorities wish to retain that distinctiveness, but, \u2018To be the same is not to be equal. To be equal is to be treated as equal based on relevant differences.\u201967 Women, though not a minority, are among the groups for whom rights, equality, and development may not be achieved simply by putting them in the constitution and even in government policies. For them, the issue 148 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS is not recognition of cultural distinctiveness. In fact, it may be recognition of different needs or meeting similar needs in appropriate ways. Indigenous peoples in many countries fi nd that they are either ignored or treated as being in need of assimilation into the majority community, a process that they feel will rob them of their identity, their traditional knowledge, and even of their existence. Other minorities face problems that may resemble those of indigenous peoples. Indeed in many countries there is resistance to the whole language of \u2018indigenous peoples\u2019 because it seems to introduce a hierarchy of worth into countries where most or many groups are deprived.

Ethnic minorities face similar problems of identity and inclusion as those of indigenous groups. In some countries, deprivation has nothing to do with indigeneity but to do with other traditions such as caste. South Asia is particularly affected by this, and the Dalits or Harijans (once known as untouchables) still suffer deprivation and exclusion, associated with attitudes on the part of the dominant groups that are, if anything, even more demeaning than the attitudes often displayed by majority groups towards indigenous communities. Because we recognize that global standards may not be enough to meet the needs of such groups within society, and precisely because we are aware of the invisibility which groups, even women who are often a technical majority, often experience when government policies are being developed. In this short section we suggest some ways in which constitutions may try to redress this imbalance. 6.1 WHAT SOCIETIES LOSE BY TURNING A BLIND EYE It is too easy to assume that the benefi ts of paying attention to the invisible are in one direction only in other words that this is for the benefi t of the excluded groups only. Nonetheless, a society that excludes substantial sections of its population is actually depriving itself of valuable resources. If most women cannot play a full part in society, if there is a substantial section of society which is kept in ignorance and passivity, or perhaps even in resentment and rebellion, because of its ethnicity, or origin, or remoteness, if the 10 per cent of the population, on an average, who suffer from some sort of disability are viewed as burdens rather than burden sharers, society as a whole as much as the excluded, suffers from this. We can see this in Nepal where 35 per cent of the population has monopolized senior public positions, educational opportunity, and CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 149 status on the basis of caste and ethnicity, and even within that 35 per cent most women have been equally excluded, depriving the nation as a whole of valuable human resources. Society deprives itself not only of human resources, but also of knowledge. This is particularly so in the case of indigenous communities: because of their close relationship with land and its resources, they often know more than scientists about appropriate farming techniques and the medicinal potential of plants. 6.2 WOMEN Some of the goals, and the targets for the achievement of the MDGs, specifi cally relate to women. However, our concern here is the particular position of women, generally, in the achievement of the MDGs. 6.2.1 Is the Situation of Women Different? It is universally the case that women\u2019s experience of poverty is rather different from men\u2019s and that the strategies needed to tackle poverty are also probably different. It is also true that development projects very often fail to involve women despite talk of mainstreaming gender. We can take, as an example, a study of the MDGs in Cambodia and what would be needed to achieve them for women.68 That study found, for example: Girls are more likely to work than boys and, thus, be deprived of \u2022 education Women hold 22 per cent of public sector jobs \u2022 Traditional attitudes, which still prevail to a considerable extent, put \u2022 women in an inferior position; even primary school curriculums still teach that women should be quiet, shy, and submissive More women than men worked in the informal sectors and \u2022 inadequate support to small and medium size enterprise development affected them badly Though women have a major role in agricultural production, \u2022 agricultural extension services targeted men far more than women Despite laws protecting women\u2019s land rights, cultural and other \u2022 factors often meant that these rights are not really enforced Completion rates in educational institutions are higher for boys \u2022 and the disparity increases with higher levels of education Women were increasingly at risk from HIV, yet only 1 per cent of \u2022 married women used condoms 150 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS Only 7 per cent of judges were women \u2022 More women are involved in decision making at village rather than \u2022 higher levels. To take one more specifi c example: women experience water (and associated sanitation) issues very differently from men. In many societies, girls rather than boys are expected to collect water, for family use. The consequences can be lack of schooling for girls, poor health (from carrying heavy loads), lives dominated by water collection. Sanitation also raises a whole lot", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b79420f-accb-47a1-9cc6-9cbec425bafe": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b79420f-accb-47a1-9cc6-9cbec425bafe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3b83073908dad2a3f12510f39e858da73046b80145721871b4e07ced246927f8"}}, "hash": "3b83073908dad2a3f12510f39e858da73046b80145721871b4e07ced246927f8", "text": "of other issues. Where there are no latrines women may have to defecate where they are exposed to physical harassment. They may have to delay bodily functions until after dark. Yet, programmes for water and sanitation (like many other programmes) may fail to involve women in decision-making, so these aspects are neglected in development projects.69 None of these observations will surprise people with experience in development issues. Many countries have similar experiences, though the details will vary. The percentage of literacy among women will vary, traditions of working outside the home vary, water problems are not identical everywhere, and so on. 6.2.2 Constitutions and Women Many constitutions say nothing about the specifi c experience of women, but just emphasize that all are equal, and that discrimination on the basis of sex is impermissible (some older constitutions do not even say this). Are there other useful provisions that can be included in a constitution that could be used to enhance the chances of anti-poverty programmes addressing the specifi c concerns of women? First to come to mind will no doubt be the Bill of Rights. Secondly, provisions about participation will also be important. Indeed, rights to participation can also be in the Bill of Rights. In the context of water, it has been suggested, \u2018Strategies setting out to make water managers and planners gender aware is a necessary but not suffi cient measure. More important is to ensure that the water reform process takes women\u2019s rights to participate and own property on an equal basis with men on board.\u201970 The provisions about the working of government, about participation, and about accountability are also relevant, and \u2018accountability to whom?\u2019 is an important issue for women as for other members of society. Provisions to empower women, emphasized in the MDGs, are important for the achievement of all rights. Research has shown that sometimes gender mainstreaming, touted as being the way to ensure that women\u2019s issues are CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 151 not marginalized, can actually lead to the disempowering of women and lessening their active involvement.71 Here are some provisions that might increase the effectiveness of constitutional protection and rights for women: permitting affi rmative action for women, as well as other \u2022 disadvantaged groups (so that programmes, especially for women, cannot be attacked as being against the equality provisions) make it a duty of the state to have special programmes for the \u2022 advancement of women (such a provision was included in the draft constitution for Kenya in 2004: the State must \u2018provide reasonable facilities and opportunities to enhance the welfare of women to enable them to realise their full potential and advancement\u2019; and the Constitution of the Fiji Islands provides for affi rmative action for \u2018all groups or categories of persons who are disadvantaged\u2019 but not identifying women specifi cally) provisions to ensure that women hold a certain minimum number \u2022 of seats in the national or lower legislatures; such provisions exist in India (applying to local government bodies only), Rwanda, and Uganda (special seats in the national legislature) rights for women that draw particular attention to issues that affect \u2022 women rather than the general \u2018equality and non-discrimination\u2019 provisions only; the 2004 Kenyan draft Constitution says Women and men have the right to equal treatment including the right to equal opportunities in political, economic, cultural, and social activities; women\u2019s rights to property have been mentioned in some constitutions, for example the Interim Constitution of Nepal 2007\u2019 provisions for equal rights within the family, because it is within \u2022 the family that obstacles to women\u2019s full participation in society often lie72 carefully drafted rights, including ensuring that indirect \u2022 discrimination is included (see p. 92) provisions designed to ensure that women\u2019s issues (and those \u2022 of other groups) are understood by decision makers. The 2004 draft for Kenya said, \u2018All public offi cers and State organs, and their employees have the responsibility to equip themselves to understand and deal with the needs of special groups within society including women, \u2026\u2019 provisions designed to ensure that the public, including women, \u2022 participate in decision making that affects them, and not just 152 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS in the voting process at general elections. The South African Constitution says: 59 (1) The National Assembly must\u2014 (a) facilitate public involvement in the legislative and other processes of the Assembly and its committees. The Constitutional Court has held that certain legislation was passed unconstitutionally by virtue of failure of other legislative bodies (to which a similar provisions applies) to satisfy those provisions.73 Some inspiration for drafting might be derived from the Protocol to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "30ec63a8-404a-4b72-b0f4-1fc1a41d27e9": {"__data__": {"id_": "30ec63a8-404a-4b72-b0f4-1fc1a41d27e9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f0bbea6e39e23cb0f9d8b78e1985b0a248a72f6f5db5c7bf24a5f80131001f5"}}, "hash": "5f0bbea6e39e23cb0f9d8b78e1985b0a248a72f6f5db5c7bf24a5f80131001f5", "text": "the African Charter on Human and People\u2019s Rights: \u2018States Parties shall integrate a gender perspective in their policy decisions, legislation, development plans, programmes and activities and all spheres of life.\u201974 provisions designed to enhance democracy within political parties, \u2022 and to specifi cally encourage the adoption of women candidates (for winnable seats); public funding of parties, which is becoming increasingly common, can be used with incentives of this sort other provisions that enhance democratic control, accountability \u2022 of government, and public participation, generally provisions that make it clear that public policies must be prepared \u2022 with wide consultation, including with affected groups, and women could be specifi cally mentioned statements of policy that raise the visibility of women\u2019s issues, \u2022 including in the preamble and in the Directive Principles (but always bearing in mind that there is a risk that putting women\u2019s issues into such provisions, which have fewer legal teeth than rights, may lead to those issues being viewed as less important). Ensuring that women have an effective voice in decision-making is a very complex business, and the issues will be different in different societies, even in different contexts within one country. 6.3 INDIGENOUS PEOPLES AND OTHER MINORITIES Much research shows that indigenous minorities tend to be excluded from many activities of society and also tend to be poorer, less well-educated, less healthy, and have shorter life expectancies. These groups, and others concerned with their welfare, have complained that they are invisible in the MDGs. The human rights emphasis of the Millennium Declaration would not exclude them, but the goals and the specifi c targets, with the stress on dates and statistics, can leave smaller and more marginalized CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 153 groups behind. As has been said, \u2018Arguably, the Millennium Development Goals as they stand today could be achieved even while whole populations of indigenous peoples disappear.\u201975 Countries, in reporting on their MDG performance, often give inadequate attention to indigenous peoples and other minorities.76 The ILO has found that so-called Participatory Poverty Assessments often exclude indigenous peoples. In fact, development projects can be positively disadvantageous to indigenous groups; they may live in hilly regions, the sort of terrain where dams are built, to supply water and power to cities far away; they may live in scenic areas, where tourism projects emphasize natural beauty and even wildlife, but not the lives of the human beings who live there. There are recurring patterns in the violations of the human rights of indigenous peoples everywhere.77 Even where policies are intended to benefi t indigenous peoples, those making the decisions often do not understand the issues. The ILO comments: \u2018Although indigenous and tribal peoples\u2019 special situations and needs are sometimes refl ected in the analysis and assessment of the poverty and development challenges in a given country, these are rarely refl ected in policy prescriptions, programmes, and budgets.\u201978 From various initiatives79 we can draw the following ingredients of inclusion of indigenous peoples in MDG processes: Non-discrimination against and inclusion of indigenous peoples \u2022 Full and effective participation of indigenous peoples in decisions \u2022 that affect their lives Defi ning development policies to include a vision of equity for \u2022 indigenous peoples that respects their cultural and linguistic diversity Policies, programmes, and budgets targeted specifi cally at indigenous \u2022 peoples \u2022 Appropriate monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, with relevant targets and benchmarks, including disaggregation of national statistics so that the situation of indigenous groups can be properly understood Involving indigenous groups in preparation of reports \u2022 Undertaking research on key issues in relation to the achievement \u2022 of the MDGs by indigenous peoples.80 The recently adopted Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples81 has a number of articles about the right of indigenous peoples to self- determination, especially participation in decisions that affect them, and also their right to retain their distinctiveness. The rights include: 154 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS To freely pursue their economic, social, and cultural development (Article 3) To autonomy or self-government in matters relating to their internal and local affairs, including means of fi nancing that autonomy (Article 4) To maintain and strengthen their distinct political, legal, economic, social, and cultural institutions, while retaining their right to participate fully, if they so choose, in the political, economic, social, and cultural life of the State (Article 5) To participate in decision-making in matters which would affect their rights, through representatives chosen by themselves in accordance with their own procedures, as well as to maintain and develop their own indigenous decision- making institutions (Article 18) To be consulted about laws and administrative measures that may affect them, and that", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "180a6034-adbf-4651-b79e-551258929a05": {"__data__": {"id_": "180a6034-adbf-4651-b79e-551258929a05", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "09cf7e32efdadb2e36beb2e013e00b2d7ebddc312e310db2cfe321de76cb3697"}}, "hash": "09cf7e32efdadb2e36beb2e013e00b2d7ebddc312e310db2cfe321de76cb3697", "text": "their free, prior, and informed consent should be required before such laws and measures are adopted (Article 19) To be actively involved in developing and deciding on economic and social programmes affecting them and, as far as possible, to administer such programmes through their own institutions (Article 23). 6.3.1 Constitutions and Indigenous Peoples How might a constitution be relevant to the achievement of these rights and objectives, and to the achievement of the rights of indigenous peoples to health, housing, education, and so on, and the Millennium Goals? Bills of Rights that specifi cally recognize that the circumstances \u2022 of indigenous peoples might differ from those of other groups in society Specifi c recognition of the rights of indigenous peoples to \u2022 participation, consultation, inclusion, and non-discrimination Specifi c mention of intersectional issues, such as the particular \u2022 problems of women in indigenous society Electoral systems that promote wide participation. In New Zealand, \u2022 proportional representation has led to Maori MPs (Members of Parliament) being about the same proportion as their presence in the population; though it may be unwise for a constitution to specify an electoral system in detail, the Constitution of South Africa does require some element of proportionality in the system; or, where elections are based on geographical constituencies, boundaries could still be required by the constitution to be drawn in a way that maximizes the representation of various groups, including indigenous peoples Provisions about participation and consultation could also mention \u2022 the specifi c needs of various groups including indigenous peoples. CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 155 A number of South American constitutions make specifi c mention of indigenous peoples. For example: Venezuela: Article 119. The State recognizes the existence of indigenous peoples and communities, their social, political and economic organization, their cultures, practices and customs, languages and religions, as well as their habitat and original rights to the lands they ancestrally and traditionally occupy, and which are necessary to develop and guarantee their way of life. \u2026 Article 120 provides that state exploitation of the natural resources in indigenous habitats must not harm the cultural, social, and economic integrity of the habitats, and that there must be prior information and consultation82 with the indigenous communities concerned. Article 122. Indigenous peoples have the right to a full health system that takes into consideration their practices and cultures\u2026 Article 124. Collective intellectual property rights in the knowledge, technologies and innovations of indigenous peoples are guaranteed and protected. \u2026 Article 125. Indigenous peoples have the right to participate in politics. The State shall guarantee indigenous representation in the National Assembly and the deliberating organs of federal and local entities with an indigenous population, in accordance with law.83 Bolivia (2008): Article 26 II The right to participation includes: \u2026. 4 Election, designation and direct nomination of the representatives of the nations and farming peoples of indigenous origin, in keeping with their own norms and procedures. Article 30 I. The whole group of people who share cultural identity, language, historical tradition, institutions, territoriality and worldview, whose existence predates the Spanish colonial invasion constitute the nation and peasant people of indigenous origin. II. Within the framework of the unity of the State and in accordance with this Constitution, nations and farming peoples of indigenous origin enjoy the following rights: 1. To exist freely 2. To their cultural identity, religious beliefs, spirituality, practices and customs, and to their own world vision. 156 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS \u2026 9. To have their wisdom and traditional knowledge, their traditional medicine, their languages, their rituals and their symbols and clothing valued, respected and promoted. 10. To live in a healthy environment, with proper utilization and management of the ecosystems. 11. In the intellectual property of their collective wisdom, science and knowledge, as well as their valuation [meaning being valued], use, promotion and development. 12. To an intracultural, intercultural and pluri-lingual education in the whole of the education system. 13. To a universal and free health system which respects their world vision and traditional practices. 14. To the exercise of political, judicial and economic systems in according with their world vision. 15. To be consulted through appropriate procedures and in particular through their institutions, whenever consideration is being given to legislative or administrative measures which may affect them. In this context, the right to mandatory prior consultation by the state, in good faith and in concert, with respect to the exploitation of non-renewable natural resources in the territory they inhabit is respected and guaranteed. 16.

The proportional participation of the nations and peasant peoples of indigenous origin in the election of members of parliament is guaranteed. II. Law will determine special constituencies for indigenous peasants where population density, district boundaries and geographical continuity will not be considered essential criteria. 6.3.2 Other Minorities Other minorities may suffer similar disadvantages to those of indigenous peoples, such as general discrimination, being ignored in planning and policy-making, not being consulted, lack of comprehension of their language, culture, or needs. Nevertheless, it is likely that the precise nature of disadvantage will differ between groups and between countries. Minorities may differ in their way of life (pastoral or hunter/gatherer, as opposed to mainly settled communities, for example), in their language, in their religion, or in their caste, or in their ethnicity. So it is not possible CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 157 to anticipate all the issues that might merit mention in a constitution. From the perspective of socio-economic rights and achievement of development goals, however, a number of issues are likely to be relevant, and they overlap to some extent with the comments made earlier on indigenous peoples, and also with the comments in relation to women. Relevant points would include: Clear anti-discrimination provisions (if necessary spelling out types \u2022 of discrimination known to occur in the particular society\u2014as the Constitution of Nepal mentions \u2018caste\u2019 Linguistic rights\u2014including giving particular status, locally or \u2022 nationally, to languages spoken by minorities (in South Africa there are 11 offi cial languages, though each government in the country uses only a few) Rights to practise culture and religion \u2022 Strong participation rights \u2022 Electoral systems (see the comments under Indigenous Peoples \u2022 above) Effective local government, or decentralized government that \u2022 brings decision-making closer to the people) Accountability provisions \u2022 6.3.3 Persons with Disability In most countries persons with disabilities tend to be among the poorest. They may be invisible in the most literal sense, as in some societies disabled people are hidden away. Certainly, persons with disability seem to have been invisible to the drafters of the MDGs.84 Since raising their standard of living may be more expensive and diffi cult, there is a serious risk that they will be last in the queue when it comes to achieving statistical targets. However, the former Chairman of the World Bank, James Wolfensohn, said, \u2018Unless disabled people are brought into the development mainstream, it will be impossible to cut poverty in half by 2015 or to give every girl and boy the chance to achieve a primary education by the same date.\u201985 Some estimates suggest that in many societies about 10 per cent of the population may suffer from some disability (though offi cial statistics rarely acknowledge this), and that taking into account the families and carers of persons with disability, as many as 25 per cent of the population may be affected by disability.86 Various studies have pointed out the connections between disability and poverty and, therefore, how ignoring disability can make the achievement of the MDGs harder. For example:87 158 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS MDG 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger \u2022 Hunger and malnutrition and disability and poverty are inextricably intertwined. MDG 2: Achieve universal primary education \u2022 Cannot be achieved without including disabled children, but the majority of disabled children are out of school \u2022 In Malawi, 35% of disabled children had never been to school compared to 18% for other children. MDG 3: Promote gender equality and empower women \u2022 Disabled women are recognized to be multiply disadvantaged, experiencing exclusion on account of their gender and their disability \u2022 Disabled women and disabled girls are particularly vulnerable to abuse \u2022 Research in India suggests that women are more likely to carry on working than men with similar impairments, less likely to seek medical help and less likely to receive treatment and services than disabled men MDG 4: Reduce child mortality \u2022 Mortality for disabled children can be as high as 80% even in countries where under-fi ve mortality is below 20% MDG 5: Improve maternal health \u2022 As 20 million women per year suffer disability and long-term complications as a result of pregnancy and childbirth \u2022 Abnormal prenatal or perinatal events are a major cause of disability in children.

MDG 7: Ensure environmental sustainability \u2022 Poor environmental quality is a signifi cant cause of ill health and disability.

In \u2026 decision-making processes concerning issues relating to persons with disabilities, States Parties shall closely consult with and actively involve persons with disabilities, including children with disabilities, through their representative organizations. Article 5(4). Specifi c measures which are necessary to accelerate or achieve de facto equality of persons with disabilities shall not be considered discrimination\u2026 Article 8. 1. States Parties undertake to adopt immediate, effective and appropriate measures: CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 159 (a) To raise awareness throughout society, including at the family level, regarding persons with disabilities, and to foster respect for the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities; (b) To combat stereotypes, prejudices and harmful practices relating to persons with disabilities, including those based on sex and age, in all areas of life; (c) To promote awareness of the capabilities and contributions of persons with disabilities. Article 19. States Parties to this Convention recognize the equal right of all persons with disabilities to live in the community, with choices equal to others, and shall take effective and appropriate measures to facilitate full enjoyment by persons with disabilities of this right and their full inclusion and participation in the community\u2026. Article 25. States Parties recognize that persons with disabilities have the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health without discrimination on the basis of disability. States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure access for persons with disabilities to health services that are gender sensitive, including health-related rehabilitation. Article 29. States Parties shall guarantee to persons with disabilities political rights and the opportunity to enjoy them on an equal basis with others, and shall undertake to: (a) Ensure that persons with disabilities can effectively and fully participate in political and public life on an equal basis with others, directly or through freely chosen representatives, including the right and opportunity for persons with disabilities to vote and be elected. \u2026 These rights are spelled out in some detail, as are other rights, in order to make it clear that persons with disability are as entitled as anyone else to full participation in society and to the enjoyment of all the same rights. As the Preamble says: Recognizing the valued existing and potential contributions made by persons with disabilities to the overall well-being and diversity of their communities, and that the promotion of the full enjoyment by persons with disabilities of their human rights and fundamental freedoms and of full participation by persons with disabilities will result in their enhanced sense of belonging and in signifi cant advances in the human, social and economic development of society and the eradication of poverty. 6.3.4 Constitutions and Persons with Disability A constitution cannot go into this level of detail, but to give full rights to persons with disability it could: 160 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS defi ne \u2018disability\u2019 in a way that covers all circumstances that may \u2022 impair some people\u2019s participation in society, including, for example, being HIV positive (which may lead to discrimination, even when the person in question is not suffering any related ill-health) or a condition like albinism (which in East Africa can lead to discrimination or even to murder so that body parts can be used) give visibility to the issues and to the rights by being explicit that \u2022 persons with disability do have all the rights as that of others in society highlight some of the more important steps that government \u2022 might take, including the use of Braille or sign language (the Constitution of South Africa says that a Language Board must promote and create conditions for the development and use of \u2026sign language) provide for affi rmative action for persons with disability (at least as \u2022 being non-discriminatory) Other ways in which a constitution might strengthen the role and protection of persons with disability include: recognize the role of civil society organizations, especially in \u2022 consultation and participation in policy-making protect the statistical service from political interference (and a \u2022 temptation to minimize fi gures of person with disability). Examples:88 The South African constitution includes disability as one of the grounds on which laws and policies may not discriminate, as does that of Eritrea.

(1) Persons with disabilities are entitled to enjoy all the rights and freedoms set out in the Bill of Rights, and to be full participants in society. (2) Persons with disabilities have a right to\u2014 (a) respect and human dignity including to be treated, addressed and referred to, in offi cial or private contexts, in a manner and in words that are not demeaning or derogatory; CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY 161 (b) access to education, to institutions and facilities for persons with disabilities that are as integrated into society as a whole as is compatible with the interests of those persons; (c) access to all places, to public transport, and to information and communications; (d) use of sign language, Braille, and other appropriate means of communication; (e) participate in decision-making at all levels; (f) equal rights to inherit, have access to and to manage property; (g) access to materials and devices to overcome constraints arising from those disabilities; and (h) treatment and opportunities in all spheres of life that are both fair and equal to those of other members of society. (3) The State shall take legislative and other measures to ensure that persons with disabilities enjoy all the rights referred to in clause (2). (4) Legislation and policy measures provided for in clause (3) shall make special provision for women with disabilities. The Constitution of Brazil (Article 7) prohibits any discrimination with respect to salary and hiring criteria for handicapped workers. The Constitution of Finland says: \u2018The rights of persons using sign language and of persons in need of interpretation or translation aid owing to disability shall be guaranteed by an Act.\u2019 The Constitution of Estonia says: \u2018\u2026persons with disabilities shall be under the special care of the state and local governments.\u2019 Arguably this provision does not confer rights. It is on the face of it a rather paternalistic provision which denies persons with disability their autonomy. NOTES 1. 1996 (5) BCLR 658 at Para 147. 2.
