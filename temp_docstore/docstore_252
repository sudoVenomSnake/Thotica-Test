se cities are now battling with congestion and pollution, while rising real estate prices and a lack of access to affordable social housing have become a source of instability in urban areas. Source: China Daily, 09/27/2012 Urban Governance Urban governance is inextricably linked to the welfare of the city\u2019s population and underpins the performance of all investments in infrastructure and service delivery. Participation and civic engagement are critical for good governance, which must also include the full and meaningful participation of women to be sustainable and equitable. Participatory governance begins at the local level. The goal for countries that have adopted participatory approaches is to achieve higher quality of service delivery and more inclusive governance. As is the case in Viet Nam128 and a number of other countries in the region, citizen participation is most often encouraged at the lowest administrative levels, where people are closest to the institutions that affect them. Direct democracy and decentralization, at their best, give both women and men a better chance to participate, help protect the rights of minorities and increase efficiency and transparency of service delivery.

There is a critical need to mobilize partnerships to support strengthening both governance structures and capacity in secondary cities where this capacity is often the weakest, as well as on the urban periphery, outside of the city\u2019s administrative boundary, where the governance structures and authority are most often either unclear or totally absent. Box 7: Multi-\u00ad\u2010city HIV Initiative for men who have sex with men and transgender persons HIV infection rates among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender people in the Asia Pacific region is now at crisis levels. Widespread \u201csocial taboos and discrimination\u201d among the general population and health care providers has resulted in limited access to effective HIV prevention, treatment and care services. For example, newly reported HIV cases among men who have sex with men in the Philippines more than quadrupled between 2006 and 2009, and now account for approximately 70% of all new HIV cases. In the Asia region, men who have sex with men are nineteen times more likely to be living with HIV than the general population. To support government and community based organizations effectively respond to this critical health and development issue, in 2010, UNDP and USAID partnered with the Hong Kong Department of Health, UNAIDS, WHO, and the Asia Pacific Coalition on Male Sexual Health (APCOM) to implement the Men Who Have Sex With Men and Transgender People Multi-\u00ad\u2010City HIV Initiative in six cities in Southeast Asia and China including Bangkok, Chengdu, Ho Chi Minh City, Jakarta, Manila and Yangon. As a result of this multi-\u00ad\u2010 partner, regional initiative, Cambodia, China, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam are being supported to develop progressive national strategies and drafted city-\u00ad\u2010level operational plans to more effectively coordinate HIV responses among men who have sex with men and transgender persons. This process has included UNDP and WHO initiating a regional programme in 2012 to increase access to essential city-\u00ad\u2010based health services by addressing the high levels of reported levels of stigma and discrimination among health care practitioners providing STI/HIV services for men who have sex with men and transgender people. To date, over 200 local health care practitioners in China, Indonesia, the Philippines and Timor Leste have been trained. Source: Baral, S, Sifakis, F. Cleghorn F and Beyrer C. 2007.

As cities expand, the necessary land for public streets, public infrastructure networks, and public open spaces must be planned for and secured in advance of development. 129 Improving land administration and management is therefore key to keeping land and housing affordable, as well as to helping cities get out in front of their growth, allowing them to make at least minimum provision for their expansion while managing densities (see Box 8). Without this, as is painfully obvious in many cities across the region, speculation, manipulation and corruption run rampant, distorting land markets, inflating costs, constraining infrastructure improvements and creating huge barriers to economic productivity. Unblocking urban land markets and clarifying property rights also has a potential huge impact on equity, particularly for women and the urban poor. This most often requires securing legal protection from forced evictions and legislation to ensure that women have equal access to land tenure and titling rights. 129 This is \u201cThe Public Works Proposition\u201d from Shlomo Angel\u2019s Planet of Cities, which provides a practical agenda for managing urban growth (2012), Lincoln Institute of Land Policy. 57 Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific Box 8: Improving Urban Land Administration and Management in Hanoi130 Hanoi has been able to grow without the formation of large slums because the government set prudent rules for land markets and infrastructure. It allowed the densification of former village areas on the urban periphery. It pushed for modernizing road networks just outside the city, yet it mostly avoided demolishing old houses. These roads have opened new land for formal developers while improving connections between existing village areas and the city. The village areas were allowed to grow and were integrated into the urban economy. Quality Job Growth and Business Creation Businesses and entrepreneurs in both the formal and informal sectors create jobs and that happens mainly in cities.131 The ability of civic leaders in both the public and private sectors to align their efforts around the goal of quality job growth can drive both the quality and sustainability of economic growth. Local economic development and job creation efforts should be at the centre of the city\u2019s dialogue with the local business community, and local finance and educational institutions. Local business leaders, educators and entrepreneurs in both the formal and informal sectors are the city\u2019s natural allies in this process. For reasons that are obvious, they often care passionately about their city and its future competitiveness and will commit to improving its quality of life. Job creation is a local process, and as cities across the region are demonstrating, those that create a culture that responds to innovation attract capital and talent, generating quality jobs. This dialogue with local business leaders should focus on reducing unnecessary regulations and barriers to entry for informal sector enterprises, as well as helping the local authority prioritize infrastructure investments that can reduce costs and increase business efficiency. Good infrastructure can attract investments and employment opportunities as can industrial parks and export processing zones, but the most important element of job creation is civic leadership and public-\u00ad\u2010private partnerships that are focused on this goal. This obviously must also include addressing the need to improve working conditions and productivity in the informal sector and micro business development opportunities. Cities should provide space for the informal sector enterprises as well as encourage training for the kinds of skills that are in greatest demand. As they comprise a significant share of informal workers, efforts geared towards women\u2019s SME development, including access to technical and vocational training, should be prioritized and perceived as a prerequisite for inclusive growth. Cities should also encourage the entrepreneurial energy of informal sector enterprises with incentives and by adjusting local regulations to lower the costs and increase the benefits of formalizing their enterprises. City Inclusion Strategies City Inclusion Strategies are conceived to directly address poverty, inequity and vulnerability in cities with a set of well-\u00ad\u2010integrated actions developed in partnership between the city and its residents, particularly the urban poor.132 Based on citywide surveying and mapping, undertaken with those communities that do not yet benefit from basic infrastructure and social services, the city is able to focus its policies and resources on those areas that are most in need, as well as to develop monitoring indicators based on a priority criteria.

STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION Cities, particularly Asia\u2019s cities, are at the forefront of innovation. Many cities in the region are engaged in organized networks and forge partnerships that sustain innovations as well as competition. In virtually every country in the region there are mayors and other civic leaders who are local champions for more inclusive urban growth. UNDP\u2019s country urban strategies need to be anchored at the local level working closely with and learning from these local champions and political advocates. While it is important to leverage the vertical role of UNDP to help develop supportive national policies, embracing change by working directly with cities, drawing on the experience and expertise of mayors and other local leaders and helping to inspire their innovation should be the cornerstone of implementation. This also implies developing a flexible capacity to respond to local innovations and investing in strengthening local knowledge-\u00ad\u2010based partners and their networks to support capacity building, replication and monitoring. Implementation pathways are suggested in the partnership section of this strategy but these will vary in countries across the region. Developing national urban and local government strategies at the country level will help build consensus on how best to respond to the specific challenges and opportunities of urbanization. What is critical is that UNDP mainstream sustaining economic growth by promoting the growth of cities that are more inclusive, resilient and sustainable in its policy dialogue with government and its development agency partners. Where there is a local constituency this should be reflected as a priority in the UNDAF, and where the constituency is less clear UNDP should become an effective advocate in facilitating the urban policy dialogue and reforms at the national and sub-\u00ad\u2010national level. Of equal importance UNDP should fully deploy its crosscutting programming capacity to align resources and engage partners across sectors targeting the strategic outcomes outlined in this strategy. UNDP can play an important role in terms of kick-\u00ad\u2010starting analytical work with secondary cities and on the urban periphery and getting stakeholders together, helping prepare strategies for more inclusive urbanization and building strong city-\u00ad\u2010wide alliances with the shared objective of making cities more inclusive. While economic growth and governance in many secondary cities is extremely weak, interventions at this stage can mitigate against many of the problems now experienced by the larger metros. Strategy performance, evaluation and financing should be determined by UNDP at the country level and will be dependent on the individual country strategies. While the strategy focuses on implementation through strengthened partnerships operating through the four focus areas, taking a city perspective to enhance development effectiveness across sectors is a big step for UNDP. It adds complexity and will require leadership at the country level, and in some cases seed funding for policy and programming support from the centre. While there is no doubt that UNDP is able to leverage considerable resources to implement this urban strategy, a high priority will be to mobilize research and professional capacity to guide and inform implementation at the outset. Success with this strategy will depend on the ability at the country level to establish clear priorities, which are consistent with available staff and financial resources. 59 Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific ATTACHEMENT 1: ASIA PACIFIC URBAN DATA BY COUNTRY GNI Motor per capita Vehicles Cellular PPP (per 1,000", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da3acf84-663b-40c7-a73e-07b9a0350421": {"__data__": {"id_": "da3acf84-663b-40c7-a73e-07b9a0350421", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategy-paper-sustainable-and-inclusive-urbanization-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strategy Paper: Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategy-paper-sustainable-and-inclusive-urbanization-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1ccd7f3adc908549e40bfcdf5ea7541c3f085370d75cb2e4cca986d508263e4a"}, "3": {"node_id": "05145d7d-5a34-4615-a232-ef88069a3536", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategy-paper-sustainable-and-inclusive-urbanization-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "22dfc888db0534729dcfbc3e0f079965da43118ef09dc0b16b54b281de8f2889"}}, "hash": "76de79427267998e7db86afb548abd14b93094f911078a68af9b62ef09138666", "text": "Water Sanitation Subscriptions ('000) ('000) ('000) (%) (%) (%) ('000) ('000) (%) (%) $ people) (%) (%) (per 100 pop.)

financial/economic crisis erupted. This crisis affected Asia-Pacific developing countries through two main channels- financial and economic. The volatility of global prices, especially those for food and fuel, has also played a role, affecting both commodity exporters and importers in the region in different ways. The looming threat of climate change and the recent experience of increased natural disasters also pose a huge threat to the Asia-Pacific region. There was already evidence that some Asia-Pacific countries were lagging behind in the MDGs time schedule, even in the period of strong GDP growth. With the deceleration of growth, progress on MDGs is likely to be further derailed. In the last three months, however, there have been some signs of economic recovery in many countries including the larger Asian economies. Unfortunately, food and fuel prices have also started to rise along with this. Against this backdrop, in March 2009, UNDP Asia Pacific Regional Centre, Colombo Office (UNDP/RCC) launched a Regional Initiative on the Global Financial and Economic Crisis in collaboration with UNDP/ RBAP, UNDP/BDP and UNDP-Country offices (COs) in Asia-Pacific. The objectives of the initiative include but are not limited to (1) identifying and understanding the impacts of the global financial and economic crisis in the region; (2) assessing the impacts of the global crisis on individual countries; (3) identifying specific country measures that can be undertaken immediately to stabilize the situation, and protect vulnerable and poor, and long-term measures to achieve a rapid pro-poor growth in a sustainable manner; and (4) organizing", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a9fa8694-e79b-44ce-bec4-7f61396ea6c2": {"__data__": {"id_": "a9fa8694-e79b-44ce-bec4-7f61396ea6c2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Global Financial Crisis and the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "10372fd7308a2385abd52e348c0e889e417fc28c5dffab55c4f1b09403a97e77"}, "3": {"node_id": "7272007d-9a11-40b7-ac84-673100ebce04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bdf6cb97f8260b831a5bdddff6c63b19ec949774d51ecfe8bd34ee11d2c98a2f"}}, "hash": "8b5408878724eb1678361b839dd72c8d7684d948300d5e4ecf3b3d4a8a22f535", "text": "regional/sub- regional/national policy forums to share cross-country experiences and identifying needs for technical and policy advisory support. In this context, as a first step, UNDP Asia Pacific Regional Centre, in partnerships with UNDP Country Offices, UNDP-HQ (RBAP and BDP) and other UN agencies such as UNICEF undertook a series of policy\u2013oriented country case studies (Bangladesh; China; Cambodia; India; Indonesia; Lao PDR; Philippines; Malaysia; Maldives; Mongolia; Nepal; Thailand; Sri Lanka and Vietnam) in Asia and the Pacific with the aim of understanding the impact of (and policy responses to) the global financial and economic crisis. The objective of this publication is to bring together the main findings of the above mentioned country case studies and other relevant studies conducted by various international organizations and research institutions in a coherent manner and to serve as an important advocacy and dissemination tool. This synthesis study, which summarizes the impacts of the crisis and policy responses to the crisis over the past one year, has shown that initially Asia-Pacific was affected severely from the crisis. Trade and financial flows collapsed in almost all countries. Output contracted more severely in many Asian economies than even those nations at the epicentre of the crisis. But starting from the mid-2009, the region is recovering fast. Since the rest of global economy is expected to recover slowly, unlike the Asian crisis in late 1990s, this time Asia cannot rely on an export-led recovery. In this regard, by drawing from a diverse range of settings within the region, the study offers compelling insights into the importance of making growth more Preface inclusive and balanced as well as reasons for a new development paradigm needed for both recovery from the crisis and making the 21st Century as the Asian Century. The key findings and policy recommendations of the study serve as a useful source of information and ideas to policymakers in prioritizing and mitigating measures to address the impact of the crisis, and a stimulus for discussion, innovation and regional cooperation as countries strive to achieve the MDGs and build a brighter future for all. In recent years, UNDP in Asia-Pacific has been increasingly working upstream towards fostering advocacy, policy advice and dialogue. It is hoped that this publication will provide new impetus to debate on how Asia-Pacific countries can further integrate MDGs and equity concerns into their national policy making and development strategies and develop practical options for promoting growth with equity. It is hoped that the independence of views and the professional competence of the authors ensure that the conclusions and recommendations will have the greatest possible audience and that the country case studies will be read with great interest.

When the global financial crisis broke in mid 2008, there were at least two differing perceptions on its likely impact on developing Asia. On the one hand, there were arguments that developing Asia, particularly China and some other leading economies, were now effectively \u201cdecoupled\u201d from economic growth in the developed countries, and could even emerge as alternative growth poles of the global economy to take up the slack left by the recession in the United States and Europe. On the other hand, it was argued that, as the most \u201cglobalised\u201d region of the world through both trade and investment, and given the high dependence of its own growth on exports, developing Asia was likely to be directly affected by the downturn and the adverse impact would be quite extensive. In the event, one year after the collapse of Lehman Brothers led to the implosion of financial markets across the world, it appears that both perceptions were at least partially correct. The global crisis has indeed affected developing Asia adversely, and some countries have been especially badly hit. However, unlike many other regions of the world, on the whole, in developing Asia the crisis did not cause an overall decline in GDP but a deceleration of growth, and the subsequent \u201crecovery\u201d is also currently seen to be faster and more pronounced in this region. Asia is cyclically tied to the developed world but its long term growth rates are nevertheless much higher and can become de-linked from the growth of the developed world with appropriate policies. In any case, there is strong evidence that Asia is converging rapidly. Financial crises are not new to the region: a decade earlier, some countries suffered what is now known as the Asian crisis of 1997-98, with capital flight and dramatic asset deflation resulting from an initial decline in export growth and shifting investor expectations. Almost all Asian developing countries adopted the export- led growth model. This approach worked well as the global economy grew, and wages costs stayed low because of the vast pool of surplus agricultural labour which migrated to the new factories established with large inflows of FDI. As a result Asia\u2019s most dynamic economies remained internationally competitive, their domestic consumption remained low and they were able to capture a growing share of world markets. Before 1997-98, both savings and investment rates were high in the export- oriented economies of the region; after the crisis, however, savings rates remained high but investment rates tended to fall because of the combination of reductions in public and private investment rates. This led to the peculiar situation of \u201cexcess\u201d domestic savings even in relatively low or middle income", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bbc21bee-5128-4249-a292-6ee9646c15d7": {"__data__": {"id_": "bbc21bee-5128-4249-a292-6ee9646c15d7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Global Financial Crisis and the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "403131c1db4d9548b58ff72c8a79e47f71d8d06e73a2b9b369e2d50b987019b4"}}, "hash": "403131c1db4d9548b58ff72c8a79e47f71d8d06e73a2b9b369e2d50b987019b4", "text": "countries in Asia, and to the holding of international reserves that were then sought to be placed in safe assets abroad. As a result, globally the previous boom was associated with the South (especially developing Asia) subsidising the North: through cheaper exports of goods and services, through net capital flows from developing countries to the US in particular, and through flows Introduction 1 CHAPTER 1 of cheap labour in the form of short- term migration, which in Asia took the form of intra-regional migration from less developed to more developed or oil exporting countries. In this boom, domestic demand tended to be profit- led, based on high and growing profit shares in the economy and significant increases in the income and consumption of newly globalised middle classes, which led to bullish investment in certain non- tradable sectors like financial assets and real estate as well as in luxury goods and services. Therefore, while Asian growth was in general based on exporting to the developed world and running large current account surpluses, these were mostly generated by maintaining high savings rates but lower investment rates compared to levels witnessed before the Asian crisis. Growing trade linkages within Asia emerged because of the creation of investment-driven export platforms catering to developed country markets, with a high degree of interdependence of production processes. This helped smaller Asian countries benefit by supplying raw materials and intermediate products to leading Asian economies who were in turn exporting to developed country markets. However, in most countries, because wages stayed low and agriculture was often neglected, rapid economic growth was associated with high and growing inequality, so that the high growth did reduce poverty but not by as much, had growth been more equal. Insufficient policy attention to rural areas and agriculture meant that an agrarian crisis emerged in many countries. Farming became increasingly fraught with risk, subject to growing volatility and declining financial viability, while non-farm work did not increase rapidly enough to absorb the labour force even in the fastest growing economies of the region. Meanwhile, competitive pressures and conditions of excess labour supply meant that wage shares of national income tended to remain low or decline, while employment tended to become more fragile and insecure despite the boom. Weak social protection and inadequate public spending on basic services meant that any shocks (whether in the form of natural disasters or economic crisis) were likely to cause more people to fall into poverty. This is why in many parts of developing Asia, the positive impact of what was seen as a successful growth model leading to the \u201cspectacular rise\u201d of the region in the global economy did not translate into better human development conditions and actual improvements in people\u2019s lives to the extent that could be expected. This is not to deny the very significant drop in poverty that occurred in some countries (most notably China and to a lesser extent in other Asian countries), but simply to note that the growth would have had an even bigger impact on poverty reduction if it had not been associated with rapidly increasing inequality. In this context, the current global crisis has impacted directly across the Asian region through its impact on exports to developed markets, which declined sharply and created ripple effects in reductions in intra-Asian trade. At the same time, sharp reversals in capital flows, which could not be explained by changes in economic \u201cfundamentals\u201d within Asia, caused declines in asset values and created instability in financial markets. However, it is also true that the substantial clean-up of the banking sector and corporate balance sheets that had occurred in the wake of the Asian crisis, as well as a more cautious and calibrated approach to banking and financial sector reform in several countries, prevented extremely adverse financial effects and has allowed the region as a whole to recover faster from this crisis. Employment declined sharply in export-oriented sectors, creating negative multiplier effects across other sectors. The effects on social sectors and on human development conditions in general have been marked. The unfolding of the process in developing Asia in general and within particular countries is described in more detail in the chapters that follow. In most countries, because wages stayed low and agriculture was often neglected, rapid economic growth was associated with high and growing inequality. 2 Going forward, what is clear is that it is not really possible simply to rewind back to the world that existed before the crisis. Quite clearly, unsustainable global macroeconomic imbalances must be resolved.

This means that developing countries in general, and particularly those in developing Asia that continue to rely on the US and the EU as their primary export markets, must seek to redirect their exports to other countries and most of all to redirect their economies towards more domestic demand. Whether this will be possible of course still remains an open question. Since so much of the trade of developing Asia was directed, either directly or indirectly, to the United States and the European Union, the collapse of imports in these countries, and particularly in the US, has had direct and extreme effects. These negative effects may well persist for several years, and competitive efforts to retain or increase export market shares on the part of developing countries are therefore likely to be counterproductive. However, it also creates new opportunities for diversion of trade to other markets and towards home markets in the countries of developing Asia, most of which still have to fulfil their development potential. The emergence of new production networks and linkages in developing Asia, particularly because of the recent rapid expansion of China and India, assumes particular significance given the volatility of trade and investment flows from the developed world. Greater trade integration within developing Asia may become an important avenue for future economic expansion of the region. But while more focus on intra-Asian linkages may serve to redirect both trade and investment within the region in positive ways, overall developing Asia cannot seek to re-export its way to growth to the same extent as after the 1997-8 crisis in the near future. This in turn requires a shift towards domestic demand led growth particularly in the countries with economies large enough to sustain this shift. Such a shift can occur through public expenditure to provide more basic goods and services, more resources directed to rural areas as well as better social protection, in addition to directly redistributive strategies. Whether this is possible in a sustained way remains a big question mark on the strength of the recovery that has just started. The global financial crisis has brought about international recognition of the dangers posed by volatile finance and the need to regulate finance in specific forms, including in commodities markets, in derivatives and in various new financial instruments and innovations that hide risk. While there have been some moves to regulate finance in the developed financial centres of the world, such moves are still halting, patchy and inadequate to address the fundamental problems that remain in the financial system, including skewed incentive systems and tendencies to periodic crises. Meanwhile, however, there is particular need for developing countries to be aware of the dangers of financial deregulation, to develop capital account management techniques that take into account the new international reality and to design domestic strategies for financial deepening and inclusion that are not prone to the same tendencies of volatility and fragility. In particular, the impact of financial speculation in causing very rapid and extreme movements in the prices of certain essential commodities such as food and fuel must be noted, because developing countries are forced to deal with the effects of these movements on real economic variables and living conditions. Climate change and ecological degradation introduce an additional dimension to this process. The set of issues around climate change (the impact, the need for adaptation and mitigation, and the complex set of international distributional issues focussed on the The emergence of new production networks and linkages in developing Asia, particularly because of the recent rapid expansion of China and India, assumes particular significance given the volatility of trade and investment flows from the developed world. 3 need to reduce carbon emissions globally) are likely to become significant external constraints upon economic expansion in Asian developing countries if negotiations on this matter are not handled with care. Obviously, in most of the region, the development project is far from complete and will require an increase in aggregate emissions rather than a reduction. At the same time, it is also necessary for Asian developing countries to acknowledge that they cannot and should not aim for exactly the same trajectory of economic growth that has been followed in the west, as this is neither globally feasible nor sustainable. Developing Asia has an advantage because it can start on a much less carbon-intensive production and consumption path from this point, which is based on more equitable and sustainable resource use. Therefore, an Asian low-carbon growth model is clearly called for, which involves less environmental destruction and avoids over-exploitation", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "22296e42-c97a-46b3-863b-bb589ab27a12": {"__data__": {"id_": "22296e42-c97a-46b3-863b-bb589ab27a12", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Global Financial Crisis and the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "73bd1b818d4e48ba9967d38a9e62f57b7742398a0859f93c6f6d10acb6edf60e"}}, "hash": "73bd1b818d4e48ba9967d38a9e62f57b7742398a0859f93c6f6d10acb6edf60e", "text": "of natural resources. This should by no means imply any denial of basic needs to all citizens, but rather a transformation of patterns of consumption and demand so as to be more equitable, less wasteful and more sustainable. Obviously, given the size and diversity of the region, one analysis and one prescription will not fit all the countries, and therefore it is necessary to distinguish across different categories of economies. Based on pre- crisis economic conditions, transmission mechanisms of the crisis and differing ability to respond to the crisis, one can identify five broad categories of national economies in Asia and the Pacific: \u2022 China, which stands alone by virtue of its size, significance and particular institutional features. The Chinese economy is still significantly different from other economies in the region because the government retains various levers to control macroeconomic processes (most of all control over the financial system and banking) which reduce its reliance on \u201ctraditional\u201d monetary and fiscal policies. At the same time, while its trade to GDP ratio as well as foreign investment to GDP ratio are very high and growing, this global integration is occurring within a largely state- controlled institutional context. The large current account surpluses of China have been accompanied by large (but generally controlled) foreign investment inflows, leading to accumulation of foreign exchange reserves on an unprecedented scale. This has made it extremely susceptible to changes in global (especially US) demand but also gives it much greater flexibility to respond to the crisis. China also plays a major role in trade flows in the region and a growing (and potentially much larger) role in investment flows. Despite its recent rise, it should be remembered that China still remains a developing country with high spatial and vertical income inequality. \u2022 East Asian newly industrialized countries (NICs) of South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore, in addition to the newly industrialized economies (NIEs)1 of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. These are among the more developed countries/economies of the region, with high per capita incomes, high degrees of trade and investment integration with the world and extremely high export dependence. They have been sharply affected by declining exports, but have considerable fiscal space for aggressive countercyclical policy as they have low current fiscal deficits and external current account surpluses. In these economies financial deregulation has been extensive, and there is now a high degree of financial integration as well as substantial foreign ownership of financial institutions operating within these countries. These countries 1.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdOfficially\ufffdboth\ufffdHong\ufffdKong\ufffdand\ufffdMacau\ufffdare\ufffddescribed\ufffdas\ufffdthe\ufffdSpecial\ufffdAdministrative\ufffdRegions\ufffdof\ufffdChina,\ufffdand\ufffdTaiwan\ufffdas\ufffda\ufffdProvince\ufffdof\ufffdChina. Given the size and diversity of the region, one analysis and one prescription will not fit all the countries. 4 tend to have more extensive social protection policies than elsewhere in the region. \u2022 India, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. These are emerging and relatively small economies in terms of share of global GDP, notwithstanding their large populations. They are also at lower stages of development with dominantly poor populations. Their recent export growth (even in the case of India, other than for India\u2019s service exports) is essentially part of a manufacturing nexus that is increasingly oriented towards China as the hub for ultimate export to developed markets. Several economies are also extremely dependent upon remittance inflows. These economies were all running current account deficits and somewhat larger fiscal deficits before the crisis broke, and were to greater or lesser degree dependent on foreign capital inflows for at least a part of their recent growth. With the exception of Vietnam, recent growth has also been unequal, and associated with agrarian difficulties and poor employment generation. Material conditions have been affected by the rise in food prices even before the onset of the financial crisis. These countries face the crisis with less available freedom in terms of policy space. Other than Indonesia which has a high degree of financial integration and associated fragility, financial liberalisation has been less extensive than in other countries. Pakistan and Sri Lanka are extreme cases within the group, as they have had to turn to the IMF for emergency external funding with associated restrictive conditions on policy. \u2022 Low-income countries such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, Bhutan, Lao PDR, Mongolia and Nepal.

These tend to be extremely vulnerable because of their undiversified economies, with high dependence upon tourism and capital inflows, especially in the form of foreign aid, as well as reliance upon food imports. The arguments outlined above are elaborated further in this study, which examines the effects of the global financial crisis on the economy and conditions of human development in Asia. While the analysis is of the recent past and of current conditions, the focus is on the future and on what can be done: the appropriate and desirable policy responses, the scope for public action in different developing countries that are already or newly constrained by foreign exchange gaps, the implications of different types of public action. In the next chapter, the overall context of global economic integration and the associated channels for the crisis to affect the region are briefly considered. The third chapter outlines the lessons from the previous Asian crisis of 1997-98, through an examination of the post-crisis experience of the five major \u201ccrisis-hit\u201d economies. The fourth chapter elaborates upon some of the main macroeconomic transmission mechanisms whereby the crisis is being played out. The fifth chapter focuses on the impact of rising and then 5 highly volatile international prices of food and fuel in affecting both macroeconomic circumstances and living conditions in developing Asia. In the sixth chapter, some of the initial evidence on the impact of the crisis on employment and other human development indicators in developing Asia in general and certain countries in particular, is presented. The final chapter discusses policy responses, particularly fiscal and monetary responses, to the crisis, and looks forward to consider the prognosis for the medium term, and provides some policy recommendations in different countries that can be considered not only to mitigate the effects of the current crisis, but to move to a more stable, sustainable and equitable growth trajectory that also delivers more inclusive human development. This chapter ends with a brief concluding statement. 6 Asia\u2019s integration into the world economy over the last decade has been remarkably rapid. For sustaining growth, Asia relies relatively more on exports than any other region in the world. On average, currently Asia\u2019s exports to western countries amount to more than one- fourth of GDP and this ratio is higher for developing countries than for developed countries in the region. While the region was earlier home to only a few mercantilist, export-oriented economies like Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, more recently every Asian economy has been looking for markets abroad. Some like China proved to be extremely successful in the export of manufactured goods, and others like India in services. However, integration into the world implies more than just exports. Going by the common measure of globalization2, Asia\u2019s two-way trade (exports plus imports), as a proportion of GDP, grew substantially in the last decade. The average level of South Asia\u2019s trade integration stagnated at about 22% during the 1980s, but then increased rapidly in the last decade to reach over 35% at present. In East Asia, the rate of integration increased modestly from 34% to 49% over the 1980s, and then accelerated in the 1990s to reach over 80%. Similarly, Asia\u2019s financial integration with the rest of the world and particularly with the US has increased dramatically over the last decade \u2013 even more so than trade integration. Developing Asia has been the largest recipient of private capital inflows, and also the largest exporter of capital among developing regions. The liberalisation of rules regarding the presence and operation of foreign firms, including financial firms like banks, insurance companies, hedge funds and private equity firms, has been associated with large increases in gross capital inflows in many economies of the region, which were often far in excess of the amounts needed to finance current account deficits. In fact, some countries with current account surpluses were also recipients of large capital inflows, the most striking example being China. At the same time, both private and public capital outflows became more evident, through activities of domestic companies, sovereign wealth funds and central banks parking their foreign exchange reserves in safe havens. More Asian money is now invested in the western countries than at any point in history. Emerging Asia held the equivalent of 28% of GDP in US Portfolio Securities (both debt and equities) in 2006 compared to 10% in 1994 (see Table", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fdc162e6-56be-45cc-9c2f-b5fd18b66002": {"__data__": {"id_": "fdc162e6-56be-45cc-9c2f-b5fd18b66002", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Global Financial Crisis and the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "840f6019da46a215afdf84b7ac16b6ccf7db3415d6e4b84d6635f8e57b526aa4"}, "3": {"node_id": "8d6fa338-497f-430d-9827-4089c2ac411b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3a85da67b859f1cbe2b147cb944c9ce3aed60b873bab24b1a762caf5eef859bf"}}, "hash": "e53a88679bc40681f62e48849bf80586e6857c817b4812e492106db555fffb13", "text": "5). In consequence, the ratio of total external transactions (gross current account flows plus gross capital flows) to GDP has increased sharply. For example, it more than doubled in India, from 46.8% in 1997-98 to 117.4% in 2007- 08 (Chhibber and Palanivel, 2009). The period 2003-07 witnessed an explosive growth of cross-border flows of portfolio capital, with a few developing countries attracting an increasing share.

These coincided with the emergence of \u201cpush\u201d factors, such as a drop in US interest rates and a slowdown in US industrial production. The Asian corporate sector\u2019s access to external funding has markedly increased in the last five years. This has been associated with increasing shares of investment in GDP in South Asia especially India, while in other parts of the region such as East and Southeast Asia investment rates were generally dwarfed by domestic savings rates. More open capital accounts have led to cross-border movements in both directions. In the Indian case, the macroeconomic outcomes have been complex: the investment ratio increased by 11 percentage points during 2003-08, while the savings rate rose by 9 percentage points. So foreign capital inflows were associated with higher investment, especially in the private sector, but the increase in investment was not as much as would have been expected. India received gross capital inflows amounting to over 9% of GDP in 2007/08 (although net capital flows were much smaller) as against a current account deficit in the balance of payments of just 1.5% of GDP, suggesting that growing financial integration and associated capital inflows did not lead directly to equivalent increases in investment but rather were \u201csaved\u201d in the form of accretions to foreign exchange reserves (Chhibber and Palanivel, 2009). Given strong trade and financial integration, it is natural that growth in Asian countries has been highly correlated with the US growth cycle over the last decade. The correlation is relatively strong for Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand. The average correlation of growth rates of 14 Asian economies with the US economy increased from 0.1% during 1990-96 to 0.4% during 2000-07. IMF (April 2008) estimated that a decline in the US growth of one percentage point would lead to a 0.6 percentage point drop in Asia\u2019s GDP. South-South trade has been playing a more significant role in the recent past3. More than half of the Asia\u2019s trade is directed towards developing countries, and especially to intra-regional Asian trade, which increased significantly in the past decade. Intra-regional exports now account for more than 51% of total Asian exports against 9.2% in 1990 and trade among emerging Asia now account for more than 40% of its total trade against 9.8% in 1990 (IMF, 2007), but it is dominantly in the form of intermediate and semi-processed goods, since most of it occurs within vertically integrated regional supply chains before shipment to western countries. In other words, although intra-regional trade is booming, reflecting the specialization of many of the region\u2019s economies as part of increasingly sophisticated production chains, the final demand for a large part of the region\u2019s exports still derived largely from western economies. While the story in some countries like India appears to be different, even for India the increase in manufacturing exports has been largely to other Asian countries, especially China, while the market for services exports is dominated by the US and EU.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8d6fa338-497f-430d-9827-4089c2ac411b": {"__data__": {"id_": "8d6fa338-497f-430d-9827-4089c2ac411b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Global Financial Crisis and the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "840f6019da46a215afdf84b7ac16b6ccf7db3415d6e4b84d6635f8e57b526aa4"}, "2": {"node_id": "fdc162e6-56be-45cc-9c2f-b5fd18b66002", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e53a88679bc40681f62e48849bf80586e6857c817b4812e492106db555fffb13"}}, "hash": "3a85da67b859f1cbe2b147cb944c9ce3aed60b873bab24b1a762caf5eef859bf", "text": "As long as the world economy was booming, global integration was generally seen as providing opportunities: new and growing markets for exports of both goods and services; more foreign direct investment to create new production facilities and allow countries to develop export platforms; accessing international finance through both external commercial 3.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdIn\ufffdaggregate\ufffdSouth\u2013South\ufffdtrade,\ufffdindustrial\ufffdproducts\ufffddominate\ufffdwith\ufffd73%\ufffdexports\ufffdmarket\ufffdshare.\ufffdThe\ufffdmost\ufffdtraded\ufffdsector\ufffdis\ufffdelectrical\ufffdmachinery\ufffdand\ufffdequipment\ufffd (including\ufffdelectronics),\ufffdwhose\ufffdshare\ufffdrose\ufffdfrom\ufffd18%\ufffdto\ufffd22%\ufffdin\ufffdthe\ufffdlast\ufffddecade.\ufffdSimilarly,\ufffdthe\ufffdshare\ufffdof\ufffdmineral\ufffdproducts\ufffd(including\ufffdfuels)\ufffdtrade\ufffdincreased\ufffdfrom\ufffd12%\ufffd to\ufffd22%.\ufffdOn\ufffdother\ufffdhand,\ufffdthe\ufffdshare\ufffdof\ufffdtextiles\ufffdand\ufffdclothing\ufffddecreased\ufffdsubstantially\ufffdfrom\ufffd13%\ufffdto\ufffd7%.\ufffdThe\ufffdshare\ufffdof\ufffdagricultural\ufffdproducts\ufffdin\ufffdSouth-South\ufffdtrade\ufffdalso\ufffd declined\ufffdfrom\ufffd10%\ufffdto\ufffd6%.\ufffd Intra-regional exports now account for more than 51% of total Asian exports against 9.2% in 1990 and trade among emerging Asia now account for more than 40% of its total trade against 9.8% in 1990. 10 borrowing and portfolio investments; allowing developing countries to benefit from the remittances and skill development that occur through the process of cross- border migration for work.

According to the WTO, world exports are expected to decline by as much as 12-15 % in the current year and remain low in 2010 as well. The US is unlikely to be the engine of world growth through its import demand for the next few years. Financial \u201cdeglobalisation\u201d was rapid in terms of the quick reversal of private foreign capital flows to developing countries, particularly commercial bank lending. While private portfolio capital flows to developing Asia have revived in recent months, they are still well below their levels in 2007 and are likely to remain volatile and unstable in the near future. International labour migration has surprisingly not been as much affected as one might have expected, largely because of the lags that operate in such migration and the lower impact of the crisis on women migrant workers who are dominantly in care and domestic service sectors. Remittance flows have remained quite firm despite all the predictions that they would decline. In fact this may well be the surprising aspect of the global financial crisis: capital flows are volatile but labour flows remain more stable. 11 3 CHAPTER While the current crisis is substantially different from earlier financial/economic crises, in as much as it originated in the United States and other developed industrial economies and has spread quite rapidly to involve all the regions of the world, it is not the first time that the region has been hit by financial and economic turmoil. The financial crisis of 1997-98 in East and Southeast Asia (which most severely affected the five countries of Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines) was the most recent reminder within the continent, of the dangers associated with a world dominated by fluid finance. It still serves as an instructive reminder of the ways in which certain factors can create greater financial fragility and vulnerability to crisis, as well as of how post-crisis responses can shape the subsequent growth and development trajectory. The crisis spawned a large variety of theories on its origins and extent. Of course there was the structural problem of the fallacy of composition in export markets, which made the region\u2019s excessive focus on exports as the engine of growth more difficult as competing developing country exporters (such as China) entered the scene. This was a more significant problem than the policy of maintaining fixed exchange rates, which has also been blamed for the crisis, since real exchange rates may have appreciated even more with large capital inflows if nominal rates were flexible. The existence of \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d and opaque financial systems have also been cited as causes of the crisis, although these were always more controversial as explanations and have been rendered much less convincing after the global outbreak of the crisis in 2008. It is now widely accepted that the most crucial proximate factor for the crisis was capital account liberalisation \u2013 in terms of allowing inflows of capital that enabled short-term borrowing for long- term projects and breaking the link between the ability to access foreign exchange and the need to earn it. The capital inflows into the region that increased as a result of the capital account liberalisation and investor bullishness about export growth caused appreciation of the real exchange rate (which would have happened irrespective of the exchange rate pegs that many economies in the region maintained with respect to the US dollar). This shifted incentives within the economy from tradables to non-tradables, and caused current account deficits to occur as exports effectively became more expensive and imports cheaper. As a result, the capital inflows were associated with current account deficits and deceleration of exports that laid the seed for the eventual reversal of investor confidence. The specific role of financial liberalisation was further underlined by the fact that other economies in the region that also experienced export slowdown in 1996 and 1997, but had not liberalised finance and the capital account to the same extent (such as Taiwan and Vietnam) did not experience the financial crisis. Mobile capital allowed for faster and more extreme appreciation of exchange rates and also more rapid reversals of capital flows in the crisis hit economies than in other less financially exposed economies of the region.

Even when crises are essentially financial in origin and in their unfolding, their effects unfortunately do not remain confined to the realm of finance. The ensuing liquidity crunch and wave of bankruptcies result in severe deflation, with attendant consequences for employment and the standard of living. The post-crisis adoption of pro-cyclical IMF stabilisation programmes can worsen the situation by adding public policy-driven downturn to a situation of asset deflation thereby exacerbating the collapse of output and employment. Thereafter, governments become so sensitive to the possibility of future crises that they adopt very restrictive macroeconomic policies and restrain public expenditure even in crucial social sectors. In the immediate post-crisis context, asset price deflation and devaluation pave the way for foreign capital inflows that finance a transfer of ownership of assets from domestic to foreign investors. Finally, when the post-crisis strategy is also associated with continued financial deregulation and lowered emphasis on credit for small borrowers, it can reduce financial inclusion even while it increases financial fragility (Ghosh and Chandrasekhar 2009). The initial adjustment to the crisis varied significantly across countries, with an acceleration of liberalization in some (South Korea and Thailand) to greater intervention in others (Malaysia). The immediate response tended to be significantly affected by the extent of IMF intervention; indeed, the IMF has been strongly criticised (Stiglitz 2004) for its role in the Asian crisis because it responded in ways that may have intensified the crisis. In situations of asset deflation and associated collapse in economic activity in the crisis-hit countries, it imposed further deflationary pressure by demanding tight monetary policy and high interest rates (in order to reduce the capital outflows) and reductions in public expenditure (to generate more fiscal surpluses or reduce fiscal deficits). As a result, Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea experienced exceptionally sharp reductions in economic activity, and the subsequent recovery was essentially facilitated by a combination of devaluation-induced export increases and some fiscal expansion, including what was enabled by the Miyazawa Initiative. By contrast, Malaysia, which did not go to the IMF and also imposed temporary capital controls in order to prevent further capital flight during its fiscal stimulus, also recovered relatively quickly. In the event, while exports recovered quickly, it is also likely that the financial bailouts to domestic companies and banks along with the fiscal stimulus responses that were initiated in 1998 against IMF advice and in the teeth of criticism from the US and some European governments, also played positive roles in generating the recovery. Over the subsequent decade, all these economies have recovered, albeit in different ways and to different degrees determined by the nature of the policy response in individual countries. But the recovery has not meant a return to \u201cmiracle\u201d status. Instead, it has been accompanied by significant acquisition, at deflated prices, of productive assets in these economies by foreign firms. It has involved a substantial restructuring of the financial sector. It has altered the nature of engagement of the world system by these economies. And it has involved a setback to achievements on the human development front. This is because the crisis did not lead to real changes in the export-led strategy of growth or to greater financial regulation that would have reduced financial fragility and enabled more inclusive growth. Export growth, which was seen as the key to the success of these five economies in the late eighties and the first half of the 1990s, is often cited as the best indication The subsequent experience showed that currency and financial crises have devastating effects on the real economy. 16 of the recovery. Pre-crisis export growth in the region was very high, between 10 and 20 % per year in US dollar terms. The deceleration of export growth in 1996 is widely recognised as one of the proximate causes of the crisis. The export recovery occurred within a couple of years: by 2000 all these five countries were showing sharp increases in rates of export growth of more than 10 %, and in Indonesia it was even more than 30 %. Subsequently, however, export growth has been very volatile in all five countries, with a dramatic collapse (associated with absolute declines in US dollar terms) in 2001. This was also the period when world trade values fell. The apparent synchronicity of export behaviour in these five countries, despite rather different domestic economic strategies, suggests that export performance from the late 1990s, and especially after 2000, has been strongly influenced by global developments.

But the most startling change was the broad macroeconomic shift in terms of a large divergence between savings and investment rates. The East and Southeast Asian region generally had very high savings rates \u2013 between 30 % and 45 % in these five countries. But the period subsequent to the financial crisis saw an increase in these already high rates, especially in the \u201ccrisis\u201d countries. However, investment rates (that is the share of investment in GDP) plummeted in all these countries, as the charts below indicate. Thus, in South Korea the savings rate increased from just below 40 % in the three years before the crisis, to more than 42 % in 2003-05. But the investment rate collapsed by almost half over the same period, from 42 % to 21 %. An almost identical pattern is evident for Malaysia, where investment rates halved from 42 % to 21 %, but domestic savings rates increased from an already high 41 % to more than 43 % between the same two years. In the Philippines, over the same years, the savings rate went up from 26 % to 30 %, but the investment rate fell from 24 % to only 16 %. In Indonesia, the savings rate remained unchanged at around 29 % but the investment rate fell from 31 % to 23 % (Chart 1). Only Thailand showed a different trajectory: while the investment rate fell sharply after the crisis, it has recovered to some extent in the early years of this decade, although it was still only 28 % in the 2003-05 compared to 41 % in the pre- crisis period. The savings rate also showed a different trend from the other countries: it actually declined somewhat from 35 % average for 1994-96 to 31 % in 2003- 05. This different pattern also resulted in slightly more buoyant employment generation in Thailand compared to the other crisis countries. However, even in Thailand, the pre-crisis period was generally characterised by investment rates that were higher than savings rates, whereas the post-crisis period has generally been one in which savings rates have been higher than investment rates. Therefore in all these five countries, the crisis years of 1997 and 1998 marked a clear break from the earlier trend, when typically domestic investment rates were higher than saving rates, and the balance was met by an inflow of foreign capital. The latter is in fact what one would expect in a developing country, since it is generally supposed that developing countries are characterised by a shortage of investible resources. Therefore economic openness, especially to foreign investment, is designed to allow foreign resources to add to domestic savings in order to generate a higher rate of investment than would be possible using only domestic resources. After the crisis, from 1998 onwards, these five economies actually became more \u201copen\u201d in policy terms, especially with respect to rules regarding foreign investment. Nevertheless, after 1998 all these five countries stopped being net recipients of foreign savings and instead showed the opposite tendency of net resource outflow, as domestic savings The East and Southeast Asian region generally had very high savings rates \u2013 between 30% and 45 % in these five countries. But the period subsequent to the financial crisis saw an increase in these already high rates, especially in the \u201ccrisis\u201d countries. 17 were higher than investment. This meant that there was a process of squeezing out savings from the population as a whole but not investing it within the economy to ensure future growth. Instead, these savings were effectively exported, either through capital outflows or by adding to the external reserves of the central banks, which were typically held in very safe assets abroad (such as US Treasury Bills). This occurred despite the continuing need for more investment within these countries, since the development project is still not complete in these countries and especially in Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines, where poverty and backwardness remain substantial.

Weak or inadequate financial intermediation and undeveloped financial institutions have been blamed for this outcome. But the evidence shows that as financial institutions became more sophisticated, and imitated the North Atlantic model, the divergence between domestic savings and investment actually grew. In any case, it is apparent that the problem in these countries was not the rise in savings so much as the collapse in investment. True, savings rates increased, affected also by crisis-induced shifts in income distribution that reduced workers\u2019 consumption and transferred more income to those in a better position to save. But the sharp collapse in investment rates came about because of other factors that then led to the emergence of this \u201csavings surplus\u201d. The growing savings surplus was partly \u2013 but only partly - the result of the decisions of private agents in these countries, and even these private decisions were strongly affected by official economic policies. For example, stringent monetary conditions, increasing real interest rates and an excess of very rigid and inflexible forms of prudential regulation caused bank credit to be less easily available for investment. A range of other post-crisis measures dampened private investment by directly and indirectly raising the costs of finance and reducing access to it. This obviously reduced investment by large corporate entities, and had even stronger detrimental effects upon small enterprises which found it more difficult to access credit. It is worth noting that the only economy that showed a different pattern in savings and investment \u2013 that of Thailand \u2013 is one where the government of Thaksin Shinawatra systematically made greater access to institutional credit by small enterprises and farmers a major plank of the post-crisis reconstruction strategy (Pasuk and Baker 2009). But monetary and financial policies are only one part of the story. A very large role in the reduction of aggregate investment was played by fiscal policies of governments in these countries, who increased their own savings and cut down on fiscal deficits or increased fiscal surpluses across the region. Even though the financial crisis in these countries was essentially brought on by private profligacy in a financially liberalised environment, the aftermath of the financial crises created an environment of excessive caution on the part of governments. The pressure was on governments to keep budget deficits under control by reducing their spending. As a result, governments in these countries did not spend as much as could be easily sustained by the economy, to ensure better conditions for the people or to encourage more sustainable growth and generate more employment. So the major cause for this apparent excess of capital, which was then exported to the US and other developed countries, was deflationary policies on the part of these governments, which suppressed domestic consumption and investment. One obvious reason for this was the fear of a repeat of the large and destabilising movements of speculative capital which were such a strong feature of the financial crisis of 1997-98. The idea was to guard against the possibility of such potentially damaging capital flight by building up substantial foreign exchange reserves, even when these may involve large fiscal losses. The other reason was that the economic strategy in these countries was still centred on the obsession with exports as the engine of growth, which combined with deflationary domestic policies that kept levels of aggregate domestic investment lower than savings. This caused an \u201cexcess supply\u201d of foreign exchange in the currency market, which would in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "291df9e0-fdd3-45a3-9878-8ad5014d8fd9": {"__data__": {"id_": "291df9e0-fdd3-45a3-9878-8ad5014d8fd9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Global Financial Crisis and the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e8a0fe25fcd81c8119d3c63ae0073bd3e504c49dd439a702bf9f0a7bf6f52e16"}}, "hash": "e8a0fe25fcd81c8119d3c63ae0073bd3e504c49dd439a702bf9f0a7bf6f52e16", "text": "turn involve an appreciation of currencies, thereby adversely affecting exports. In a world of liberalised trade where exchange rates cannot be easily controlled, this meant that currencies had to be kept A very large role in the reduction of aggregate investment was played by fiscal policies of governments in these countries, 19 at \u201ccompetitive\u201d levels through market based means. And this in turn meant that foreign currency inflows \u2013 whether through more exports or remittances or through capital flows \u2013 had to be counteracted by central bank market intervention to purchase foreign currency, to prevent undesired appreciation of the currency. The macroeconomic counterpart \u2013 and cause - of the rising foreign exchange reserves held by the central banks of all these countries was therefore the excess of domestic savings over investment, which was actually a huge potential wasted for these economies. Financial liberalisation effectively resulted in the choice of deflationary strategies by governments. This in turn contributed to the excess of domestic savings over investment, thereby threatening currency appreciation. This is what led to the accumulation of unutilised foreign exchange in the form of growing foreign exchange reserves that were invested in \u201csafe\u201d assets abroad such as US Treasury Bills. The role played by Chinese economic expansion in this process must also be acknowledged. This assumed even greater significance after the Asian crisis. While China became part of a diversified export platform in the region that drew in a number of other Asian developing countries, China\u2019s vast reservoir of unskilled labour effectively acted as a ceiling on real wages. As a result, real wages were held back in China and as well as in other Asian economies that were either competing with China for export market share or were part of the relocation in production process in collaboration with China. As wages were held back inequality rose, consumption did not increase commensurately with income, and savings increased significantly and rapidly. More than any other factor the large surplus pool of labour in China acted as a brake on real wages despite improvements in productivity, and increased profit shares of income across the region. Another key lesson was that social impacts can manifest very quickly after the onset of a crisis. This implies that countries need to be prepared for adverse impacts of economic and natural shocks. For example, even in the period of strong GDP growth, the Asian crisis quickly exposed the vulnerability of countries in the social and political fronts (poverty, unemployment and a loss of political stability). This is because most of these countries had deficient or even non- existent social safety nets, exacerbating the crisis\u2019 impact. As of 1997, social policies and programmes in Indonesia, Korea and Thailand provided very limited protection for workers. In Indonesia, old age and disability benefits were limited to firms with more than 10 employees. In Thailand, the pension system covered only 10 % of the labour force (Man and En, 2008). Recently some studies summarized key findings and lessons on the social impact of past crises in Asia, Latin America and other regions (World Bank, 2008; Skoufias, 2003, and Lustig, 2000). Within the space of a year after the initial signs of the Asian Crisis became evident, South Korea experienced a 4.3 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate translating into 1.5 million jobless individuals. The headcount poverty ratio jumped from 3 % in the last quarter of 1997 to 7.5 % in the third quarter of 1998 among households headed by workers in urban areas. In Indonesia 15 % of households reported job loss or employment problems during the financial crisis. In Thailand, the headcount index increased by 1.4 percentage points to 12.7 % of the active labour force between 1996 and 1998, implying that nearly 1 million people had been pushed below the poverty line as a result of the crisis. Similarly, in the wake of the peso crisis in Mexico, the poverty headcount rose from 23.3 % in 1994 to 28.6 % in 1996 and the unemployment rate increased from 3.7 % to 6.3 % over the same period. Available data indicates that in almost all previous economic crises, poverty rates have increased. It is also clear that in many countries (Indonesia, Korea, Argentina The role played by Chinese economic expansion in this process must also be acknowledged.

On the other hand, experiences on inequality seem to be mixed. In Asia, Brazil, and Uruguay, the crisis has not led worsening inequality. But in other countries, it was not the case. These experiences in Asia and Latin America indicate the potential impact of the global financial crisis of 2008 on living standards in the developing world. One of the key lessons is that an aggregate shock at the country level will have heterogeneous effects across households, depending on household demographics, education attainments and location. The largest proportionate income losses need not be amongst the poorest initially, since some of whom may be protected by the same factors that have kept them poor, namely geographic isolation and consequently poor linkages with national and global markets. Studies on the poverty impacts of Indonesia\u2019s severe economy-wide crisis of 1998 found sharp but geographically uneven increases in poverty (for example, see Ravallion and Lokshin 2007). The proportionate impact on the poverty rate tended to be greater in initially better off and less unequal districts of Indonesia. Another study (Friedman and Levinsohn 2002) of the welfare effects of the same crisis found that most households were impacted, but that it was the urban poor who fared the worst, since the ability of poor rural households to produce food mitigated the worst consequences of high inflation. A comparative study (Bresciani, et al. 2002) on the impact of the financial crisis on agricultural households in Indonesia and Thailand using household-level survey data revealed that although the natures of the shocks in the two countries were similar, the impact on farmers\u2019 income was quite different. In Thailand, poor farmers bore the brunt of the crisis, in part because of their greater reliance on the urban economy (through seasonal off-farm work), unlike poor farmers in Indonesia. Urban-rural links are much weaker in Indonesia, and for that reason poorer farmers there were more insulated from the ramifications of the crisis. Farmers in both countries, particularly those specializing in export crops, benefited from the currency devaluation.

Assessments of the effects of aggregate economic shocks have often presumed that these crises would have negative effects on education and health outcomes, but empirical findings reveal no such simple regularity (Tables 1a and 1b). Some recessions have led to reductions in school enrolment, as in Costa Rica in 1981-82, while others have led to increases, as in the United States during the Great Depression (Ferreira and Schady 2008). Similarly, negative covariate shocks in Zimbabwe associated with the 1982-84 drought led to persistent losses in height-for-age for young children, while infant mortality declined in the US during the Great Depression (Ferreira and Schady 2008). What explains this variation across countries? In predicting the direction of the short term impact of economic crises, economic shocks have income and substitution effects which, in the absence of policy interventions, determine whether schooling and health outcomes would improve or deteriorate. A contraction of GDP has a negative income effect which can lead to lower investments in education and health.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8828dc67-42d4-42d3-b267-be0989bebfc3": {"__data__": {"id_": "8828dc67-42d4-42d3-b267-be0989bebfc3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Global Financial Crisis and the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ade6589747abda1f064cfd66f56a2319ecfe24ba8685835d3737ad8977dd94f8"}, "2": {"node_id": "8db6ea91-5dff-4e57-8f8a-d058093e0d5c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4eda9821bd2d0647a9850abcbedb76920a0246705ac608aca7118e1e35ef1008"}}, "hash": "7aa56a067241c5dee600f0a4fde0a1674f5f974b0be1065fa3cdde7bd1bdb4b4", "text": "In the case of schooling, the substitution effect derives from a decline in child wages due to decreased labour demand during such a contraction.

Guatemala Chart 3 : Inequality and Crisis (Gini coefficientant) 22 In practice, recessions in developed countries are generally associated with better health and education outcomes. In the United States, economic downturns have generally decreased infant mortality. In the countries of the former Soviet Union, research has indicated that declining income was associated with dramatic increases in adult mortality, but there was no obvious change in child health. This pattern implies that the substitution effect dominates the income effect. However, in the poorest developing countries, both health and education outcomes deteriorate during economic crises, suggesting that the income effect dominates (World Bank, 2008). This pattern is consistent with evidence from Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Ethiopia, Malawi, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and (less clearly) Indonesia, as well as (for health) India. In middle-income countries, health outcomes deteriorate during crises (as found in Mexico, Peru, Nicaragua), while schooling is unaffected or improves (as found in Brazil, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Peru). For example, in Peru, a middle-income country with high levels of school enrolment, the deep economic crisis in the late 1980s could have decreased schooling outcomes because public expenditures and household incomes fell. However, these reductions seem to have been offset by the lower opportunity cost of attending school. Hence, although public education spending fell by almost 50 %, children were more likely to be enrolled and less likely to be working during the crisis than in other years (Schady, 2004). But time series household data show that the infant mortality increased by 2.5 percentage points during the crisis.(World Bank, 2008). In Indonesia the 1997 financial crisis decreased enrolment rates among children aged 8-13 years and increased enrolment rates among children aged 14-19 years, but these changes were small, just one percentage point of enrolment. A study of the relationship between log per-capita GDP and infant mortality using data on births and deaths from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) covering 59 countries conducted between 1986 and 2004 (Baird, Friedman, and Schady 2007) found that a 1-% contraction in per-capita GDP was associated with an increase in infant mortality of between 0.18 and 0.44 deaths per thousand children born. This finding means that there were about one million excess deaths during the period 1980-2004 in countries experiencing large economic contractions (World Bank, 2008). In the short run, households might try to smooth consumption by increasing their labour supply and drawing down their savings. But when work opportunities are scarce and families have little or no access to credit, they may have to reduce food intake or pull out children from school. What is evident is that while financial crises create sharp and painful economic shocks and may alter longer-term economic trajectories, this depends crucially upon the Table 1b: Impact of Past Crises on Child Health and Nutrition varies depending upon level of economic development Rich countries Positive impact - United States Middle-income countries Ambiguous impact Examples\ufffdof\ufffdpositive\ufffdimpact:\ufffdColumbia Examples\ufffdof\ufffdnegative\ufffdimpact:\ufffdPeru\ufffd,\ufffd\ufffdMexico,\ufffdRussia Poor countries Negative\ufffdimpact\ufffd-\ufffdNicaragua,\ufffdIndia,\ufffdCote\ufffdd\u2019Ivoire,\ufffdZimbabwe,\ufffdEthiopia,\ufffdTanzania,\ufffd Cameroon Source: Ferreira and Schady (2008, p.50). 23 Prior to the current financial crisis, the world economy was already affected by rapid oil price rises and a more general bull market of rising prices for primary commodities. nature of the policy response.

Third, the current crisis (like Asian crisis in the late 1990s) appears to be more deeply rooted in financial imbalances in the private sector than in the public sector financial problems that characterized the 1980s debt crisis and the Mexican 1994-95 crisis or the Turkish crisis of 2000. Fourth, unlike previous crises, the most distressed financial assets are opaque pools of several layers of securitized loans that may be difficult to unbundle and value. Fifth, the previous crises affected mainly countries with weak macro fundamentals. But the current crisis is affecting even countries with strong macro fundamentals (such as those with high growth and low inflation, substantial foreign exchange reserves, low fiscal and current account deficits, low public debt stock, robust corporate balance sheets and relatively healthy banking sector). While such countries would earlier have been considered to be relatively immune, they have also faced tremendous pressure on their currencies and equity markets as well as sudden turnaround in their growth prospects. Sixth, the recovery may not be straightforward, because developing countries will need a domestic demand- led recovery as they cannot rely on export- led recovery. Finally, prior to the current financial crisis, the world economy was already affected by rapid oil price rises and a more general bull market of rising prices for primary commodities. One early effect was a substantial increase in food prices that had a particular impact on poorer communities across the world. While prices came down in the midst of the financial crisis, they are on the increase once again, with associated implications. There have been repeated comparisons of the current crisis with the Great Depression in 1929, which also started in the US. Indeed, the current financial crisis shares some of the features of the Great Depression of 1929. Both are global crises \u2013not limited to a specific region or country. The epicentre of both crises was located in a developed economy \u2013in one of the largest economies and one most closely connected to the rest of the world economy \u2013 with grave consequences for the real economy, also at the global level. However, certain important differences, such as the greater financial integration of different developed and developing regions of the world economy and the differing policy responses, suggest that the past is at best an imperfect guide to the present. 24 4 CHAPTER This time the Asia-Pacific region is better prepared for financial and economic crises than it was a decade ago during Asian financial crisis, having improved current account balances and built up a protective shield of foreign exchange reserves. Notwithstanding this resilience, there have still been negative domestic impacts, in some cases quite severe. These have been unequally distributed, with certain sectors and segments of the population much worse affected than others. 4.1. The broad trends The recent synchronicity of growth rates across the different regions of the world has been so marked that it is unprecedented in the long history of booms and slumps in global capitalism. Every single developing region has been affected, and some developing regions / countries have experienced even worse economic impacts than the developed world/US economy in which the crisis started. However, unlike many other regions of the world, on the whole, in developing Asia, the crisis did not cause an overall decline in GDP but a deceleration of growth and the subsequent \u201crecovery\u201d is also currently seen to be faster and more pronounced in this region. Asia is cyclically tied to the developed world but its long term growth rates are nevertheless much higher and can become de-linked from the growth of the developed world with appropriate policies. In any case there is strong evidence that Asia is converging rapidly (Chart 4). The global financial crisis affected developing Asia mainly through two channels. The first and more immediate impact was through financial contagion and spill over effects on stock and currency markets.

Quartely Real GDP Growth (%) turned negative in 6 of 10 Asian Economies by Q4, 2008 developed economies had on growth and development prospects in Asia, through secondary transmission channels such as falling quantities and values of exports, deteriorating terms of trade, reduced remittances of migrant workers, reduced tourism receipts, slower growth or reversal of foreign investment, and reduced availability of ODA. These then operated through negative multiplier effects within countries to cause a downward spiral in the economy. World exports have been falling since late 2008, and are currently estimated to decline by anywhere between 11 % (IMF) and 15 % (WTO) in 2009. Capital flows initially showed very sharp reversals, not necessarily reflecting any economic \u201cfundamentals\u201d, but simply the impact of \u201cflight to safety\u201d of finance capital flowing back to the US and Europe. This was then reflected in the movement of external reserves held by developing Asia, as well as exchange rates. For much of the past decade, developing Asia added to its external reserves, not just China whose reserve build-up was based on export surpluses, but even countries like India, Indonesia, Vietnam and Bangladesh that relied on either capital inflows or remittances for the additional foreign exchange. This pattern changed from mid-2008, with foreign exchange reserves showing extreme volatility, falling from June 2008 to around April 2009, and once again rising since then in most countries. The quarterly data on GDP growth rates brings out the synchronised nature of the collapse in major Asian economies. Even in countries where growth remained positive throughout, the deceleration in growth rates was evident from early 2008, and by the last quarter of 2008 real output growth turned negative for at least six of 10 Asian economies for which data are available (Chart 5). Several case studies in this volume note how the growth slowdown had effectively started before the global crisis broke, because the particular growth strategies in some of these economies \u2013 whether reliant on export-led growth or on credit-financed domestic consumer booms \u2013 were running out of steam. However, the real downslide occurred after the crisis had clearly hit export markets. It should be noted that nonetheless, growth rates in some large exporters, such as China, remained relatively high. It may be noted that although GDP growth rates in South Asian countries have moderated, the declines have been much less severe than in South-East Asia or East Asia. In part, South Asia has been shielded by its relatively limited integration % 28 into the global economy. The story is also similar if one compares growth rates in Asian low-income countries with that of Asian emerging economies. It may also be noted though output remains well-below potential, in the emerging economies of South-Asia and East Asia, they have staged a V-shaped turnaround from a sharp decline in their economic activities. The three large developing economies namely China, India and Indonesia experienced smaller downturns and are now returning to their long-term high growth path. 4.2. Merchandise exports The developing economies of Asia were significantly hit by the slowdown in world exports. Global trade values decelerated from the middle of 2008 and started falling from late 2008. This reflected declines in both unit values and volumes, as competitive pressures forced exporting countries to bring down prices in an effort to retain or expand market share. As a result, trade values fell even faster then would be indicated by the volume index alone. Only very recently has this been associated with any recovery in export volumes in the aggregate \u2013 and in developing Asia the recent increase in export volumes from the floor of early 2009 has been strongly related to sharp declines in unit values of exports Chart 6)4. The monthly data on exports clearly brings out how exports slumped quite sharply in the aftermath of the financial crisis, turning negative across the region, especially in Southeast Asia (Chart 7). Imports also fell, usually following exports by a few months. The decline in imports reflected the decline in international oil prices and the moderation in domestic economic activity, as well as the growing import intensity of much of the export production. Recent data indicate a bottoming out in exports and imports, and some countries have seen a marked improvement in export performance in the last few months.

On the other hand, demand for medium- and high-end manufacturing products appears to have been affected severely; consequently exports in emerging economies have suffered. Despite the slump in exports, current account surpluses have remained quite high as proportion of GDP in both East Asia and Southeast Asia, although there are a few countries with moderately large current account deficits in these sub regions. By contrast, South Asia, which was already running current account deficits before the global crisis, saw these worsen during 2008 and the current year is also expected to generate deficit on this account (Chart 9). Since capital flows initially reversed as a consequence of the crisis, this reduced the space for domestic countercyclical measures in countries facing foreign exchange constraints. Imports have slumped quite sharply than exports; consequently the trade balance is actually increasing in Asia Chart 8 : Trade balance 30 This rapid effect of the slowdown in developed country markets on the exports from developing Asia is scarcely surprising, given the high degree of dependence upon these markets in most of the major exporting countries of the region (Table 2). However, it is also evident from Table 3, that recent trade patterns have reduced this dependence and created more sources of export demand within the region through intra-Asian trade. Table 3 shows that the share of China in the exports of all the three sub-regions of developing Asia increased very sharply between 2000 and 2007 while the share of the main developed countries (US, EU and Japan) fell. Also, trade within developing Asia among countries other than China has also increased. This has led to the view that export-led growth can continue to be the strategy for this region, but with a redirection of exports within the region and especially to China.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d1d8ebb1-367a-424f-bfdd-04c2606faecc": {"__data__": {"id_": "d1d8ebb1-367a-424f-bfdd-04c2606faecc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Global Financial Crisis and the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7ae318cecfc47b4d2d4717aa864edaff8fee754c80f7c5b3b48539322d348611"}, "2": {"node_id": "0fb8c46e-185a-4fee-b8e4-f0acf2c3cf48", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1092a93bc2d7724c7ba90155ad5a9384d8930213752578cb8900e1e3bf570835"}}, "hash": "6e6ae903f35c1ed0be19b4fc166ba113401a0d3fa81b1e927e284607f766222c", "text": "The optimistic view is that China can continue -4.0 -2.0 0.0 2.0 4.0 6.0 8.0 10.0 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010F Chart 9: Though exports have slumped quite sharply, Current account balances as % of GDP remain quite strong East Asia South Asia Southeast Asia Source: ADB Asian Development Outlook 2009 Exposure to the U.S. Exposure to the EU-15 Direct Total1 Direct Total1 1994 2006 1994 2006 1994 2006 1994 2006 China 5.6 9.6 7.6 12.0 3.9 7.7 6.0 12.0 India 1.7 2.4 2.0 3.1 2.6 3.1 3.3 4.5 Korea 4.9 5.1 6.1 8.7 2.7 5.0 3.9 8.2 Singapore 23.9 17.3 31.9 31.0 17.0 20.1 25.5 36.0 Indonesia 3.3 3.5 4.5 5.6 3.4 3.7 4.8 6.4 Malaysia 18.0 22.7 25.0 32.0 11.4 13.8 18.3 25.0 Philippines 8.8 8.0 9.8 12.0 3.7 7.1 5.0 13.0 Thailand 7.0 10.5 8.9 15.0 5.2 8.7 7.5 15.0 Vietnam 1.4 15.2 2.8 19.0 6.6 15.0 8.6 21.0 Emerging Asia2 9.2 10.8 12.0 16.0 6.8 9.7 9.8 16.0 Table 2: Asian Export Exposure to Developed Countries (as % of GDP) Sources: IMF Regional Economic Outlook April 2008 1.

This view has been supported by recent economic indicators from China, which have been so robust that they have inspired the argument that even if the Chinese economy is still too small to act as an engine of growth for the world, it can play that role for the Asian developing region. China, its argued, can also help other major commodity producers. For example Australia seems to have emerged from its recession quickly because of China. Certainly it appears that the fairly large fiscal stimulus of the Chinese government, along with other measures to ease interest rates and increase credit access, have worked in terms of increasing both domestic demand and economic activity in China. Thus, while exports have slumped in response to the global trend, domestic demand and retail sales have picked up. As a result, preliminary data for the second quarter of 2009 suggest that GDP is growing by nearly 9 % at an annualised rate, and industrial production in June was 10.7 % higher than it was in the same month of the previous year. However, there are several reasons to consider such a view to be excessively optimistic. To begin with, China\u2019s exports and imports have tended to move together, and this is largely because an increasing share of exports (more than 60 % in 2007) consists of processing exports, in a process which uses imported raw material and intermediates from other countries to transform into final goods for export. What is noteworthy is that while Chinese exports declined because of the slump in global trade, Chinese imports fell even faster. As a result, the trade balance is actually increasing, to reach the projected level of around $370 billion in 2009. So the impetus coming from Chinese demand for imports is currently declining faster than China\u2019s own exports. The other reason to be cautious regarding the potential of China to become an alternative growth engine for the region as a whole is because most of the trade, both imports and exports, that is occurring within developing Asia (including China) as a whole, is part of a vertically disintegrated production process that is producing final goods for export to developed countries.

To some extent that is explained by the rapid growth of foreign trade, which would naturally have required more transport services.

However, unlike China, which has a net deficit in commercial services, India has a surplus in this category. Service exports are vulnerable to the global crisis because of the significant reliance on the developed country markets. Where data are available (such as for Hong Kong and South Korea) they suggest that the United States and the European Union accounted for around 40 % of total services exports in 2007.

Nonetheless, thus far services exports that are not linked to merchandise trade have held up through the crisis.

The past decade witnessed a substantial increase in international tourism in developing Asia, including intra-Asian tourism that reflects the growing prosperity of Asian middle classes as well as some easing of restraints on cross-border travel within the region. However, the crisis acted swiftly and sharply to affect tourism in several Asian countries. Both tourist arrivals and tourism receipts (in US dollar terms) decelerated sharply in 2008 compared to 2007 for most countries, and even turned negative from very rapid earlier growth in the case of China. Initial evidence from the case studies suggests that the downward trend has continued into 2009. In addition to the economic effects of the crisis, concerns about the spread of the AH1N1 virus and security concerns in some countries in the region are also likely to affect tourist arrivals. Though the crisis acted swiftly to reduce tourism receipts in many countries of the region, overall the impact on tourism receipts seem to be modest compared to other trade and financial flows.

This is significant because the tourism sector accounts for more than 13 % of Cambodia\u2019s GDP. Some countries with a higher proportion of tourists from Asia-Pacific countries (such as Indonesia, where more than half came from the Asia Pacific region, with Japan, Australia, China, Malaysia and South 34 Korea among the top five markets) have been relatively less adversely affected by the downturn. However, in Vietnam the opposite tendency was evident: while all tourist arrivals reduced by 22 % in the first five months of 2009, tourists from China and South Korea decreased by 38 % and 22 % respectively, while the number from US fell by only 1.2 % and those from Canada actually increased by 4.2 %. 4.4 The impact of capital outflows and financial turbulence Unlike the Asian crisis of 1997-98, and unlike the evolution of the current crisis in many other parts of the world, the banking system in most of emerging Asia has thus far not been particularly badly affected. There are several reasons for this: the relatively limited exposure of Asian banks to sub-prime financial products in the US (with some exceptions such as in Malaysia and Singapore); the greater emphasis on supervision and regulation in the banking systems of the Asian crisis- affected economies; the fact that several countries (China, India, Vietnam) still have a significant part of the banking system under public ownership and control; and the relatively low leverage of corporates in Asia compared to other regions (with some exceptions of particular companies in certain countries). Capital adequacy ratios have been very healthy on average, and non-performing loans have formed a low and declining proportion of total loans. However, there is substantial variation across countries in this regard, with non- performing loan ratios being much higher in Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines. To some extent the very soundness of Asian banking systems reflects the conservatism that resulted from the experience of the Asian crisis, which in turn was likely to have been associated with insufficient extension of credit especially to small borrowers. In the event, despite prior caution, the global crisis did lead to a deceleration in credit growth and in some cases even a decline, as the banking reversals in the North created greater risk-aversion among bankers within the region. This tendency was more marked in those countries with a higher presence of transnational banks. To some extent, this was mitigated by the middle of 2009 by active government intervention designed to reduce interest rates and revive credit creation in most Asian countries. Even so, reduced bank lending, not only to construction and large industry, but in particular to small producers, who dominate in employment generation, is likely to remain a major impediment to comprehensive economic recovery in the regions without active mitigation efforts. Despite the greater domestic stability of banking and financial systems in developing Asia, the region was nonetheless affected, at least temporarily, by a sudden reversal of 35 Capital adequacy ratios ID PH SG HK TH MY JP KR IN NZ AU CN TH MY PH CN ID IN SG JP HK KR NZ AU AU KR TH JP IN MY PH SG CN ID HK Non-performing loan ratios Soundness of Asian banking systems1 Non-to-deposit ratios 25 20 15 10 5 0 10 8 6 4 2 0 150 125 100 75 50 25 0 Source: Bank of International Settlements (2009) capital inflows, with attendant effects on reserves, currency values and liquidity. The damaging effects of this continue to be felt in some countries, but in most countries of the region capital outflows had stopped and inflows turned positive by March 2009. This is at least partly due to the international perception of fundamentally better growth prospects in the Asian region compared to other segments of the world economy. As a result, stock markets which had earlier collapsed have rebounded, even if they have not reached levels achieved during the earlier peak, and currencies which depreciated sharply are now strengthening. It should be noted that financial liberalisation, by itself, does not offer any guarantee of capital inflows either in normal times or in times of irrational exuberance. Capital inflows do not necessarily rise sharply immediately after liberalisation, nor do all countries attract inflows once they liberalise. Thus, during the period of the global capital surge beginning in 2004, a few developing countries in Asia accounted for an overwhelming share of capital flows to emerging markets in the region. Table 6 shows that the 7 top emerging market recipients of capital inflows received between 85 and 95 % of the flows into emerging Asia.

Partly because of the crisis, such inflows have not been \u201cused\u201d, but instead largely been transformed into increasing reserves, which increased by $510 billion in emerging Asia between March and September 2009 (IMF Asian Regional Economic Outlook October 2009). Emerging markets in Asia were the recipients of a substantial amount of portfolio capital flows especially in 2007 and early 2008, when bullish sentiments about the region contrasted sharply with evidence of fragility in Northern equity markets. As a result, there were very sharp increases in stock market indices especially in some countries, such as China and India. Since such stock markets tend to be both narrow and shallow (since the shares of relatively few firms are traded in the stock exchange and of those listed firms the proportion of actively traded stocks is relatively small), the activities of foreign portfolio investors can have dramatic effects on the price indices.

Given this experience, this may be the time for many Asian countries to re- examine their capital account liberalisation policies and develop strategies to contain excessive volatility in both inflows and outflows. 4.5 Exchange rate changes The sharp depreciation of exchange rates across developing Asia (with the exception of China) was a singular feature of the crisis. This was not the result of conscious and competitive (beggar-thy-neighbour) devaluations that were associated with earlier global depressions. Nor was the extent of currency depreciation always justified by the extent of trade or current account deficits of the countries concerned. Rather, in most cases the movement of exchange rates was an involuntary process reflecting the movements of highly mobile capital. Nominal exchange rates in Asia on average depreciated by 12% in January 2009 compared to the peak of July-August 2007. Real exchange rates showed less movement, amounting to 5 % appreciation followed by almost equivalent depreciation.

They are much more likely to be affected by what could broadly be called \u201cpolitical economy\u201d factors, and perceptions of current and future power, that determine the capital flows that actually decide their values. At the trough of the crisis, countries in developing Asia faced a double shock because of depreciating exchange rates even as their export volumes collapse. The subsequent increase in nominal rates has reflected global investor perceptions of better growth prospects in this region compared to other parts of the global economy. Such movements in exchange rates do more than affect the macroeconomic indicators and the state of investor expectations. They also have direct and indirect effects upon conditions of human development, in particular by affecting the prices of essential commodities especially when they are largely or marginally imported. Indeed, this rapid decline in nominal \u2013 and often real \u2013 exchange rates has created inflationary pressures, particularly in food and energy markets, in several Asian developing countries despite the other tendencies making for real economic stagnation. The possibility of stagflation in some countries is therefore now more real in several vulnerable economies, especially those that face fiscal and balance of payments constraints on appropriate policy responses. 4.6 Remittances In addition to merchandise exports, one major source of foreign exchange for many Asian developing countries has been remittances sent by migrant workers back to their homes. Short term migration increased rapidly in the past two decades, and most of it has been within the Asian continent, reflecting the significance of labour-scarce oil-exporting countries within the region as well as the differential 39 Labour Sending Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Myanmar,\ufffdNepal,\ufffdPhilippines,\ufffdSri\ufffdLanka,\ufffdVietnam Labour Sending and Receiving India, Malaysia, Pakistan, Thailand Labour Receiving Brunei\ufffdDarussalam,\ufffdHong\ufffdKong\ufffdSAR,\ufffdJapan,\ufffdMiddle\ufffdEast, Republic\ufffdof\ufffdKorea,\ufffdSingapore,\ufffdTaiwan\ufffdChina Table 7: Migration Status of Asian Countries Source: Wickramasekara 2002 (with additions by Ghosh 2004) The ongoing global economic crisis has been widely predicted to change all that, as international migration and associated remittances generally perceived to be among the first casualties. levels of development that different Asian countries have reached. Table 7 provides an indication of the major flows of migrant labour within developing Asia. This has provided crucial foreign exchange and been a major contributor to balance of payments stability to many of the smaller economies in the region, and even for large countries like India and China has played a significant role in domestic consumption. The ongoing global economic crisis has been widely predicted (World Bank 2008, 2009; ILO 2008) to change all that, as international migration and associated remittances generally perceived to be among the first casualties. At one level this is obvious: it is only to be expected that when economic activity slows or contracts in destination countries, migrant workers are the first to be laid off and sent home.

To some extent this too can be expected, because even if the crisis leads to large- scale retrenchment of migrant workers who are forced to come home, they would obviously return with their accumulated savings. In such a case, there could even be a (temporary) spike in remittances rather than a continuous or sharp decline because of the crisis. Eventually, as the adverse conditions for overseas employment further aggravate, this would then lead to decline in remittance inflows. Intra-Asian migration may be affected by migration policies instituted by some governments in the wake of the crisis, such as moves by Republic of Korea, Malaysia and Thailand to restrict work permits for migrants. However, it is not so inevitable that there would eventually be a sharp decline in migration and remittances. One important aspect that is frequently ignored in the discussions on migration is the gender dimension. International migration for work is highly gendered, especially in Asia, with male migrants going in dominantly for employment in manufacturing and construction sectors, while women migrants are concentrated in the service sectors, such as the care economy broadly defined (including activities such as nursing and domestic work) and \u201centertainment The different nature of work also affects remittance flows. In the first place, female migrants are far more likely to send remittances home, and typically send a greater proportion of their earnings back. Also, male migrant workers find that incomes are much more linked to the business cycle 40 Source: CEIC database 0 50 100 150 200 250 Jan 2006=100 Philippines BNG Pak Phi in the host economy, so their employment and wages tend to vary with output behaviour. Thus job losses in the North during this crisis have been concentrated in construction, financial services and manufacturing, all dominated by male workers. By contrast, the care activities dominantly performed by women workers tend to be affected by other variables such as demographic tendencies, institutional arrangements, and the extent to which women work outside the home in the host country. So employment in such activities is often relatively invariant to the business cycle, or at least responds to a lesser extent. Therefore female migrants workers\u2019 incomes are more stable over the cycle and do not immediately rise or fall to the same extent. This in turn means that source countries that have a disproportionately higher share of women out-migrants (such as Philippines and Sri Lanka) would tend to experience less adverse impact in terms of downturn of remittances. Indeed, in the Philippines, most recent data indicate that remittance flows are still increasing slightly, at an annual rate of around 2 %. This does not mean that there will be no impact at all, but certainly the adverse effects will be less and will take longer to work through than if the migration had been dominated by male workers. There are other factors at work as well, which have meant that the negative effects of the crisis on patterns of migration have not been evident as immediately or sharply as expected. For example, one expectation was that the return migration would be dominated by the worst hit workers, who in turn were expected to be the undocumented, irregular or illegal migrants who are mostly in low-wage and low-skilled occupations, and do not qualify for any kind of official support such as welfare benefits or social security from the host country. But once again the evidence thus far belies this expectation. There are several reasons for this. Such migrants may be unwilling to return home to possibly even more fragile and insecure employment conditions in the home country. Many developing countries have been even worse hit by the financial crisis that originated in the US economy. So the push factors that operated to cause international migration in search of work are as strong as ever. The unwillingness to return in such a context may be even stronger where the undocumented migrants have already developed some local social networks that allow them to survive for a period while they look out for other employment. In the host country, 41 5. It is also true that as food and fuel prices fell there was some fiscal relief as the budgets for 2009 had assumed much higher food and fuel prices in some countries such as Bangladesh and in India. undocumented migrant workers may even be preferred by employers who see in them a cheaper source of labour than legal migrants or local workers.

This may be yet another reason why women migrants may be less badly affected, since women migrants dominate in the undocumented and illegal category. In any case, one of the basic pull factors still remains significant: the demographic transition in the North that is increasing the share of the older population that requires more care from younger workers, who must therefore come from abroad. So the current crisis may temporarily slow down the ongoing process of international migration for work, but it is unlikely to reverse it. 4.7 The impact on government fiscal positions Developing Asia was until recently considered to be relatively immune from the global crisis for several reasons: the significant role of China as a regional economic leader and potential growth pole; the cushion provided by the very large external reserves that had been built up over the past six years by Asian central banks; the fact that most Asian governments had been following prudent if not downright conservative fiscal strategies that have focussed on restricting government expenditure rather than raising taxes and consequently have generated very low fiscal deficits or fiscal surpluses. Despite all this, the crisis has nonetheless operated directly to worsen fiscal balances in most Asian countries, in ways that have been partly elaborated above (Table 8). Declining exports and the associated downturn (or deceleration) in economic activity reduced tax revenues. The need to bailout companies in distress, or provide tax and other incentives meant that government expenditure increased even in the absence of increases in direct public expenditure. Rising and then volatile prices of food and fuel caused public subsidies to rise in countries in which these prices are even partly controlled, because domestic prices typically did not go up as much as global prices and even the subsequent decline in such prices were such as to keep international prices higher than domestic prices5. These factors implied worsening fiscal balances even before any attempt could be made to increase government spending as part of a fiscal stimulus package to counter the crisis or enhancing social assistance measures to protect vulnerable groups. It is worth noting at this point that the concept of fiscal space, which is increasingly used as a guide to future fiscal stance, should not be seen as determined by the existing levels of fiscal deficits or public debt. This is because fiscal deficits will be inflationary only if (a) they involve an aggregate excess of expenditure over income, which in turn implies that the initial spending will not generate at least equivalent output through a multiplier process; and (b) the economy cannot afford to import to make up any supply shortfalls that could hinder the multiplier process, which in turn implies that the country cannot access foreign exchange either through capital inflows or drawing down of reserves. Only in situations in which both of these conditions are met can it be argued that the government does not have the fiscal space to provide a countercyclical stimulus. It is obvious that the existing level of the fiscal deficit tells us very little about either of these conditions, except insofar as large deficits and high initial public debt stock with rising interest payments at interest rates which exceed the economy\u2019s growth rate suggest that the limits to non- inflationary spending may be closer.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d0b9b373-831f-4efa-beee-3d0d70101c3d": {"__data__": {"id_": "d0b9b373-831f-4efa-beee-3d0d70101c3d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Global Financial Crisis and the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5b27975058adcdb62c85cbb4f5852b4e7b3cb71a75b651193cf9ff97dad0c495"}, "2": {"node_id": "24d85cd4-54be-4015-987e-49b2eb8d6bf1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7a2516c5184e904326de19b4120fe3bf535d2754b3bac015464d2754c834e362"}}, "hash": "694d8f1a7aa6ab535575b9dcbc58be870d959aa61b5202a4c96cb935937cd0ca", "text": "42 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009* 2010* South Asia Bangladesh -4.2 -4.4 -3.9 -3.1 -6.1 -6.4 -6.0 India -3.9 -4.1 -3.5 -2.7 -6.1 -7.8 -6.8 Pakistan -2.0 -3.2 -4.2 -4.5 -7.3 -4.3 -5.0 Sri Lanka -7.4 -7.0 -7.0 -6.9 -6.6 -8.6 -7.8 Southeast Asia Cambodia -4.1 -2.5 -2.7 -2.9 -2.9 -5.5 -5.2 Indonesia -1.1 -0.2 -1.0 -1.2 -1.9 -2.8 -1.8 Laos -3.4 -4.4 -3.8 -2.8 -2.8 -3.3 -3.1 Malaysia -4.1 -3.6 -3.3 -3.2 -4.8 -8.0 -8.3 Myanmar -1.9 -2.2 -2.6 -3.0 -3.5 -4.5 -4.8 Philippines -3.9 -2.7 -1.0 -0.2 -0.9 -3.1 -2.5 Singapore -1.1 -0.3 0.5 3.3 1.5 -4.1 -4.9 Thailand 0.0 0.3 1.2 -2.3 -1.1 -5.6 -3.5 Vietnam\ufffd -3.3 -4.1 -2.9 -7.0 -5.1 -9.0 -8.1 East Asia China -1.3 -1.2 -0.8 0.6 -0.4 -4.1 -3.2 Hong\ufffdKong\ufffd China 1.7 1.0 4.0 7.7 -0.3 -3.9 -3.7 South\ufffdKorea\ufffd 0.7 0.6 0.4 3.5 1.2 -5.0 -3.8 Taiwan China -2.4 -1.6 -0.7 -0.4 -1.3 -5.2 Pacific Papua New Guinea\ufffd 1.5 0.0 3.2 2.5 -2.3 -2.7 -1.2 Table 8: Most Asian countries now follow countercyclical fiscal policy Source: Economic Intelligence Unit; * Projected The evidence is clear that the crisis has involved growing fiscal deficits, or a change from surplus to deficit, in many Asian countries.

However, between 2002 and 2008, this decline was reversed with very substantial increases in price, especially in the world trade prices of oil and certain agricultural commodities. The period since January 2007 has been especially remarkable because of dramatic volatility: very sharp and rapid price hikes followed by almost equally sharp declines all in a relatively short period. Rising energy prices until Sep 2008 caused balance of payments difficulties and imported inflation in many developing countries, while the impact of the rise in food prices was even more dramatic, being associated with a global food crisis that became starkly evident by the middle of 2008. Although the decline in oil prices in the aftermath of financial crisis has provided some relief for the oil- importing countries of the region, the sharp exchange rate devaluations that were noted in the previous section have tended to negate some of this. However, the effect of these trends in global food prices has generally been far more adverse for most of developing Asia, because while there was relatively high pass-through of rising prices into domestic food prices for many countries, the subsequent decline in global prices has not been reflected in declining domestic prices of food. It should also be noted that food and fuel prices are still high compared to early 2007. Prices started to rise in recent months, as many countries, particularly Asian countries, are rebounding fast from the depths of the global crisis. Strong world-wide economic recovery could push up commodity prices once again (Chart 15). Source: IMF & FAO Chart 15: Food and Fuel Prices declined due to GFC, but increasing once again 47 In 2008-09 global production of the major food grains increased by 5.4 % compared to 2006- 07, whereas global utilisation increased by only 3.4 %. 5.1. Causes of global price volatility for food and fuel This food crisis is not something that can be treated as discrete and separate from the global financial crisis. On the contrary, it has been intimately connected with it, particularly through the impact of financial speculation on world trade prices of food. The excess liquidity in global markets because of the decision of the US Treasury not to try and dampen the financial bubble, as well as the financial deregulation that allowed greater financial investor activity in commodity futures markets, constitute a large part of the story that led first to high fuel prices and then very high food prices as the shift to crop based fuels in the face of rising fuel prices occurred. So the fuel, food, and ultimately the financial crisis are all interlinked. This is not to deny the undoubted role of other real economy factors in affecting the global food situation. While demand-supply imbalances have been touted as reasons, this is largely unjustified given that there has been hardly any change in the world demand for food in the past three years. In 2008-09 global production of the major food grains increased by 5.4 % compared to 2006-07, whereas global utilisation increased by only 3.4 %. End of season stocks actually increased by 8.7 % (FAO 2009).

The per capita annual consumption of cereals declined from 131 kg to 76 kg in urban China, and from 262 kg to 206 kg in rural China between 1990 and 2006. Similarly, the per capita annual consumption of cereals declined from 145 kg to 124 kg in urban India, and from 189 kg to 156 kg in rural India between 1988 and 2002. The reasons for this apparently paradoxical process have been hotly debated in both countries, and have ranged from changing dietary choices (Hanumantha Rao) to worsening income distribution and reduced access of the mass of population to affordable food (Utsa Patnaik 2006). In any case, China and India have had relatively little effect on international trade prices through their direct imports or exports. Both countries have been net exporters of cereals in the last decade. China has been a net importer of food grains in only one season - 2004-05. Similarly, India has been a net importer of cereals only once, in the 2006-07 season. Therefore the impact of China and India on world cereal prices would at best have been minimal and indirect. Similarly, although both China and India witnessed a significant increase in their imports of oilseed, meals and edible oils in the last decade, there is no evidence that there has been a sudden increase in the imports from this source to indicate that they have contributed to the recent price hike for oilseeds, meals or oils (FAO 2008). Supply factors have been \u2013 and are likely to continue to be \u2013 more significant. These include the short-run effects of diversion of both acreage and food crop output for biofuel production, as well as more medium term factors such as rising costs of inputs, falling productivity because of soil depletion, inadequate public investment in agricultural research and extension, and the impact of climate changes that have affected harvests in different ways. Two policy factors affecting global food supply require special note. The first is the biofuel factor: the impact of both oil prices and government policies in the US, Europe, Brazil and elsewhere that have promoted biofuels as an alternative to petroleum. This has led to significant shifts in acreage to the cultivation of crops that can produce biofuels, and diversion of such output to fuel production. For example, in 2007 the US diverted more than 30 % of its maize production, Brazil used half of its sugar cane production and the European Union 48 used the greater part of its vegetable oil seeds production as well as imported vegetable oils, to make biofuel. In addition to diverting corn output into non-food use, this has also reduced acreage for other crops and has naturally reduced the available land for producing food. The IMF estimated that the increased demand for biofuels accounted for 70 % of the increase in maize prices and 40 % of the increase in soybean prices (Lipsky 2008). Collins (2008) estimated that the increased demand for biofuels accounted for 60 % of the increase in maize prices for the period 2006-08. Rosegrant et al. (2008) calculated the increase demand bio fuel accounted for 30 % of the increase in real cereals prices, 39 % of the increase in real maize prices, 22% of the increase in real wheat prices and 21% of the real rice prices for the period 2000-07. These increases in nominal prices of these commodities are much higher. The USDA also attributed much of the increase in farm prices of maize and soybeans to biofuel production (Glauber 2008). Estimates differ widely due to differences in time periods, prices, and food items considered. Despite all the differences, these studies unambiguously reveal that increased demand for biofuel production is indeed a major driver of soaring global food prices. The irony is that biofuels do not even fulfil the promises of ensuring energy security or retarding the pace of global warming. Ethanol production is extremely energy-intensive, so it does not really lead to any energy saving. Even in the most \u2018efficient\u2019 producer of ethanol \u2013 Brazil - where sugar cane rather than corn is used to produce ethanol, it has been argued that the push for such production has led to large-scale deforestation of the Amazon, thereby further intensifying the problems of global warming. Indeed, recent scientific research suggests that the diversion of land to growing biofuel crops can produce an enormous \u2018CO2 debt\u2019 from the use of machinery and fertilisers, the release of carbon from the soil and the loss of CO2 sequestration by trees and other plants that have been", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "991d4ddc-6ef8-4f57-8f6f-887b46f6e99b": {"__data__": {"id_": "991d4ddc-6ef8-4f57-8f6f-887b46f6e99b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Global Financial Crisis and the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "63b818042af454eb6f23b7c201646182cd7db44189f67e3cdf8b31ae0eb5698c"}}, "hash": "63b818042af454eb6f23b7c201646182cd7db44189f67e3cdf8b31ae0eb5698c", "text": "cleared for cultivation (Beddington 2008). Yet, as long as government subsidies remain in the US and elsewhere, and world oil prices remain high, biofuel production is likely to continue to be encouraged despite the evident problems. And it will continue to have negative effects on global food production and availability. The second factor is the policy neglect of agriculture over the past two decades, the impact of which is finally being felt. The prolonged agrarian crisis in many parts of the developing world has been largely a policy-determined crisis. Inappropriate policies have several aspects, but they all result from the basic neo-liberal open market-oriented framework that has governed economic policy making in most countries over the past two decades. One major element has been the lack of public investment in agriculture and in agricultural research. This has been associated with low to poor yield increases, especially in tropical agriculture, and falling productivity of land. Greater trade openness and market orientation of farmers have led to shifts in acreage from traditional food crops that were typically better suited to the ecological conditions and the knowledge and resources of farmers, to cash crops that have increasingly relied on purchased inputs. But at the same time, both public provision of different inputs for cultivation and government regulation of private input provision have been progressively reduced, leaving farmers to the mercy of large seed and fertiliser companies, input dealers. As a result, prices for seeds, fertilisers and pesticides have increased quite sharply. There have also been attempts in most developing countries to reduce subsidies to farmers in the form of lower power and water prices, thus adding to cultivation costs. Costs of cultivation have been further increased in most developing countries by the growing difficulties that farmers have 49 in accessing institutional credit, because financial liberalisation has moved away from policies of directed credit and provided other more profitable (if less productive) opportunities for financial investment. So many farmers are forced to opt for much more expensive informal credit networks that have added to their costs. The lack of attention to relevant agricultural research and extension by public bodies has denied farmers access to necessary knowledge. It has also been associated with other problems such as the excessive use of ground water in cultivation; inadequate attention to preserving or regenerating land and soil quality; the over-use of chemical inputs that have long run implications for both safety and productivity. Similarly, the ecological implications of both pollution and climate change, including desertification and loss of cultivable land, are issues that have been highlighted by analysts but largely ignored by policy makers in most countries. Reversing these processes is possible, and of course essential. But it will take time, and also will require not only substantial public investment but also major changes in the orientation and understanding of policy makers. While these remain urgent issues that require global and national policy interventions, the intensity of the food crisis that hit many developing countries (including those in Asia) in 2008 was particularly on account of the dramatically high global prices of important food items, which adversely impacted upon national food security for food deficit countries, and their partial pass-through to national economies, which in turn affected the food security of vulnerable groups within countries. It is now quite widely acknowledged that financial speculation was the major factor behind the sharp price rise of many primary commodities, including agricultural items over the past year (UNCTAD 2009, IATP 2008, 2009, Wahl 2009, Ghosh 2009). Financial deregulation in the early part of the current decade gave a major boost to the entry of new financial players into the commodity exchanges. Unlike producers and consumers who use such markets for hedging purposes, financial firms and other speculators increasingly entered the market in order to profit from short-term changes in price. There was a consequent emergence of commodity index funds that were essentially \u2018index traders\u2019 who focus on returns from changes in the index of a commodity, by periodically rolling over commodity futures contracts prior to their maturity date and reinvesting the proceeds in new contracts. Such commodity funds dealt only in forward positions with no physical ownership of the commodities involved. This further aggravated the treatment of these markets as vehicles for a diversified portfolio of commodities (including not only food but also raw materials and energy) as an asset class, rather than as mechanisms for managing the risk of actual producers and consumers. As the global financial system became fragile with the continuing implosion of the US housing finance market, large investors, especially institutional investors such as hedge", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bfb3574b-07c2-4104-8358-367a502e8fa3": {"__data__": {"id_": "bfb3574b-07c2-4104-8358-367a502e8fa3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Global Financial Crisis and the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fd47ce18caea5e529aae8ec40b94219b934b1bf98a834db4128b76b2d9577413"}}, "hash": "fd47ce18caea5e529aae8ec40b94219b934b1bf98a834db4128b76b2d9577413", "text": "funds and pension funds and even banks, searched for other avenues of investment to find new sources of profit. Commodity speculation increasingly emerged as an important area for such financial investment. The United States became a major arena for such speculation, not only because of the size of its own crisis-ridden credit system, but because of the deregulation mentioned above that made it possible for more players to enter into commodity trading. 50 The rise in crude prices in recent years has been driven partly by the rapid growth in demand. Before 2003, the gaps were due not to a real supply shortfall but mainly to the OPEC cartel\u2019s control of production. This created a peculiar trajectory in international commodity markets. The declared purpose of forward trading and of futures markets is to allow for hedging against price fluctuations, whereby the selling of futures contracts would exceed the demand for them. This implies that futures prices would be lower than spot prices, or what is known as backwardation. However, throughout much of the period January 2007 to June 2008, the markets were actually in contango, in which futures prices were higher than spot prices. This cannot reflect the hedging function and must imply the involvement of speculators who are expecting to profit from rising prices. Indeed it has been argued that contango was so strong that the futures markets were essentially driving the spot prices up in this period. Then, by around June 2008, when the losses in the US housing and other markets soared, it became necessary for many funds to book their profits and move resources back to cover losses or provide liquidity for other activities. UNCTAD (2009: 25) notes the sharp decline of financial investment in commodity markets from mid 2008. This caused futures market prices to fall, and this transmitted to spot prices as well. The result was the excessive volatility displayed by important commodities over 2008. Such volatility had very adverse effects on both cultivators and consumers of food. This was not only because it sent out confusing, misleading and often completely wrong price signals to farmers that caused over sowing in some phases and under cultivation in others. In addition, it turns out that while the pass through of global prices was extremely high in several Asian developing countries in the phase of rising prices, the reverse tendency has not been evident in the subsequent phase as global trade prices have fallen. So both cultivators and food consumers appear to have lost in this phase of extreme price instability, with the only gainers from this process therefore being the financial intermediaries who were able to profit from rapidly changing prices. There are other mechanisms through which the financial crisis itself operates to increase food insecurity. These work through the constraints the current crisis is imposing on fiscal policies in balance of payments constrained developing countries and the effects of capital flows upon exchange rates, as well as through the adverse impact upon livelihoods and employment, which reduces the ability of vulnerable groups to purchase food. Similar tendencies are evident in the world oil market. Both structural factors and speculations have contributed to steep increases in crude oil prices. Important structural factors include growing demand, supply pressures and constraints, depleting reserves and turbulent geo- political situations. However, more recently speculative investment has played a key role in the oil futures market, similar to the role outlined above for essential food commodities. The rise in crude prices in recent years has been driven partly by the rapid growth in demand. Chart 16 shows oil consumption to be consistently higher than that of oil supply. Before 2003, the gaps were due not to a real supply shortfall but mainly to the OPEC cartel\u2019s control of production. But in recent years, growth in demand has strained physical supply boundaries, as the supply gap is more real and market-determined. Since 2006, the supply and demand gap has been further widening. In the past, fluctuations in oil supply and demand have been dampened by three main buffers: surplus production capacity among OPEC members, large oil inventories, and surplus refining capacity in consuming countries. All three buffers have, however, been shrinking. As a result, the world oil market has become more vulnerable to even slight changes in supply and demand. This has been exacerbated by shrinking oil stocks, as oil companies have been holding lower stocks of crude oil and gasoline in order to cut costs. Oil prices also have been affected by security and political issues, linked primarily to apparently unstable political and military configurations and possible terror", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9b095e9e-9aa3-42bc-b2fe-cecc71c8e609": {"__data__": {"id_": "9b095e9e-9aa3-42bc-b2fe-cecc71c8e609", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Global Financial Crisis and the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "92237a2fe3ebc2842968c74bcd29dde95d2edf5fe46cdb4dd3a3c78baec9dd54"}, "3": {"node_id": "8ce9b202-285b-4e1b-94bc-7a730795d15b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9a5e176240df9d196fd213a625791fc5391cc004ffef905dace4577b96a85243"}}, "hash": "42aaef415344a862a46283d7eced8eca45af1d7c2551e4865d21fc7f5cb1630b", "text": "attacks in the Middle East and West Asia. 51 World Oil Production 90000 85000 80000 75000 70000 65000 60000 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1990 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 World Oil Consumption Thousand Barrels per day Chart 16: The imbalance in the world oil consumption and supply increased since 2003 These oil supply-demand imbalances and uncertainties were exacerbated by a massive influx of speculative money into the market for crude oil futures. Speculators, reacting to vulnerabilities in supply and external shocks, have expanded their trading, often basing their judgments on media reports. In so doing, they have heightened the price volatility in the short-run. Speculative activity can push oil prices higher, since this unstable situation adds a larger \u2018risk premium.\u2019 While the decline in oil prices over June 2008 to March 2009 provided some relief, the situation is by no means resolved. Over the short term, futures prices may once again be subject to excessive hikes that bear no direct relation to current supply or demand fundamentals. However, these prices can themselves trigger further changes in supply or demand situation, leading to another round of wild fluctuations. This is particularly so since investor behaviour in oil futures markets and therefore oil price changes incorporate an element of \u2018geopolitical risk premium\u2019 in addition to purely economic assessments. 5.2 Effects through External Trade At the macro level, the impacts of higher food and oil prices on countries are likely to be diverse depending upon whether countries are net importing or net exporting countries, as well as the relative share of net food and oil exports (exports- imports) in total imports or total domestic consumption or total domestic production. It is important to note that this can vary over time as sudden changes in output and relative prices can alter the situation. Even so, it may be useful to identify which countries are net food exporters or net food importers. In Asia and the Pacific, 26 out of 35 countries are net food importers. Out of these, three are from East Asia, seven from South-West Asia, five from South East Asia and 11 are from the Pacific. Out of 26 net food importing countries, nine countries namely Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka, Fiji, Solomon Islands, Mongolia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Tonga, and Lao PDR have trade surplus in agricultural products. It is true that Source: UNDP(2007) 52 the negative effects of soaring food prices could be balanced out with positive effects of rising prices of agricultural raw materials. However, while prices of agricultural raw materials also experienced volatility in terms of big increases and then declines in the last two years, they did not increase as much as those for food items, and the subsequent fall tended to be steeper as well. Given market imperfections and the high degree of monopsony prevailing in most cash crop markets in developing Asia, it is unlikely that actual cultivators benefited greatly from the brief phase of extremely high international prices of most agricultural raw materials, including oilseeds and cotton. Only nine out of 26 net food importing countries in this region can be considered as vulnerable in the sense that their net food imports are more than 5 % of their total imports. These nine countries are Kiribati, North Korea, Micronesia, Cook Islands, Samoa, Bangladesh, Papua New Guinea, Nauru and Palau. Out of these, one country - Papua New Guinea - has huge trade surplus on agricultural trade. Fortunately, none of the countries in Asia and the Pacific can be considered to be highly vulnerable in terms of having net food imports more than 10 % of their total imports. Most of the food net importing countries are small island states or countries in conflict (Afghanistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka) or major non-food commodity exporting countries (Indonesia, Iran, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Mongolia) or industrial countries (South Korea and Singapore). Other than these, only a few countries such as Bangladesh, Bhutan, and North Korea turn out to be particularly vulnerable to global food price shocks. However, even so food prices have tended to increase quite sharply in a much wider range of countries in Asia and the Pacific, even in those that are not directly vulnerable through imports.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8ce9b202-285b-4e1b-94bc-7a730795d15b": {"__data__": {"id_": "8ce9b202-285b-4e1b-94bc-7a730795d15b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Global Financial Crisis and the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "92237a2fe3ebc2842968c74bcd29dde95d2edf5fe46cdb4dd3a3c78baec9dd54"}, "2": {"node_id": "9b095e9e-9aa3-42bc-b2fe-cecc71c8e609", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "42aaef415344a862a46283d7eced8eca45af1d7c2551e4865d21fc7f5cb1630b"}}, "hash": "9a5e176240df9d196fd213a625791fc5391cc004ffef905dace4577b96a85243", "text": "Food items (cereals, pulses, meat, dairy, vegetables and fruits) All Agricultural products Net Importer Net Exporter Net Importer Net Exporter East Asia North\ufffdKorea,\ufffdSouth\ufffd Korea,\ufffdMongolia China North\ufffdKorea,\ufffdSouth\ufffd Korea,\ufffdChina Mongolia South West Asia Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Iran India, Pakistan Bangladesh, Maldives, Nepal, Bhutan, Pakistan, Iran, India, Sri Lanka South East Asia Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Lao PDR, Cambodia Vietnam,\ufffdThailand,\ufffd Myanmar, Philippines", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "69261972-7729-4a02-aff9-15c6ec2e8b5b": {"__data__": {"id_": "69261972-7729-4a02-aff9-15c6ec2e8b5b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Global Financial Crisis and the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fbdfaff9c122f9e0bd68b9f30abf651706e98ac07e029acb27657c15abd45b5e"}, "3": {"node_id": "ab2a0f1d-bcc1-45f5-9405-819a3a37b52e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "29cba2a94163a8a0b1cb45ce20c48d6f15d5d47ab3c4a03f6aef4ebb9901f524"}}, "hash": "e2333ab372778059d026248a6b2dd16979d67bb11d2b0f75b413eb981665b3b2", "text": "Singapore, Cambodia, Philippines Malaysia,\ufffdVietnam,\ufffd Indonesia, Thailand, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Pacific Kiribati,\ufffdMicronesia,\ufffd Cook Islands, Samoa, PNG,\ufffdNauru,\ufffdPalau,\ufffd Fiji, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Marshall Islands Vanuatu,\ufffdTuvalu Kiribati,\ufffdMicronesia,\ufffd Cook Islands, Samoa, Palau, Nauru, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands Tonga,\ufffdPNG,\ufffdVanuatu,\ufffd Fiji, Solomon Islands No. of countries 26 9 20 15 Table 9: Many Asia -Pacific Countries are net food and agricultural importers in 2004-05 (two years average) Source: Francis NG & M. Ataman Akoy, \u201cWho Are the Net Food Importing Countries\u201d, Policy Research Working Paper 4457, World Bank, Jan 2008. 53 Only few countries namely Myanmar, Tuvalu and Thailand have reasonably high net food exports in terms of their total import bill. Nine countries in Asia and the Pacific have been net food exporters in recent years. These include Myanmar, Tuvalu, Thailand, Pakistan, Vietnam, India, China, Vanuatu and Philippines. Out of these only few countries namely Myanmar, Tuvalu and Thailand have reasonably high net food exports in terms of their total import bill. Half of the countries that have surplus in food trade are nevertheless net importers of agricultural products. These include Tuvalu, Pakistan, China and Philippines. This implies that only four countries in Asia and the Pacific have trade surplus both in food and all agricultural products. These are Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam and India. From a macro perspective, only these four countries could be expected to benefit at all from higher prices of food grains and agricultural raw materials. This classification of food exporting and importing countries is based on total food trade involving all items such as cereals, pulses, meat, dairy, vegetables and fruits, etc., taken together. But it is also illuminating to examine patterns of exports and imports in individual or major food grain categories, which can have particular effects on domestic consumption and food security.

Only six out of 35 countries are net exporters of oil and gas in the region. Similarly, for net food exporting countries, potential gains from changes in food prices may depend on the Export Orientation Ratio (EOR) defined as net exports (exports \u2013imports) as percentage of domestic production. In Asia and the Pacific, three countries, namely Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia have high export orientation ratio implying that over 10 % of their domestic production of food grains was exported over 2003-08. Pakistan has a moderate export orientation ratio, and India and China have low export orientation in terms of food grains. The largest net food grain exporting countries in terms of quantity of exports are Thailand, India, China, Pakistan, Vietnam and Cambodia. In 2007, soaring food prices and consequently rising food exports and imports (including vegetable oilseeds and oils) affected the trade balance of developing countries by about 0.5 % of GDP in 2007. The Southeast Asian countries maintained a food trade surplus of the order of 1.9 % of GDP, while the deficit in the food trade of the East Asian countries increased slightly from 0.4 % of GDP in 2000 to 0.5 % in 2007. South Asia witnessed a fluctuating net food trade situation: moving from a food trade deficit (0.2 % of GDP) region in 2000 to a food surplus region (0.1 % of GDP) in 2006. Again, in 2007, it moved back to being a food trade deficit region (0.1 % of GDP). Net food imports of West Asia fell from 1.7 % of GDP in 2000 to 1.1 % in 2007. Similarly, net food imports of the Pacific decreased from 1.9 % of GDP in 2000 to 1.5 % in 2007 (UNCTAD 2008). In Asia and the Pacific, most countries are net oil and gas importers. Only six out of 35 countries are net exporters of oil and gas in the region. They include Iran (with 4 % share of world exports and the sector contributing 20 % of GDP), Indonesia (world share 2.4 % and contribution to GDP 6.3 %), Malaysia (world share 1.2 % and contribution to GDP 7.4 %), Brunei Darussalam (0.6 % and 80 % respectively), Vietnam (0.6 % and 9.8 %) and Papua New Guinea (0.1 % and 13 %). Some countries in the region produce crude oil, including Iran, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei Darussalam, Thailand, Papua New Guinea (PNG), and Timor-Leste. Out of this, only some countries are net oil exporters, who can realise benefits from high crude oil prices. Countries such as Mongolia and PNG also benefited from the surge in gold and copper prices.

Many Asian countries were affected by the extraordinary world price movements, although they were able to dampen the domestic impact of the extremely sharp spike that cause global prices to increase by around three and half times in the 18 months between January 2007 and June 2008. China appears to have handled the matter somewhat better, with rice prices broadly stable over the entire period despite the high global volatility. It is tempting to explain this in terms of domestic food self sufficiency that allowed China to insulate its population from the effects of high world prices in this basic food item, but this need not be the only reason. By way of contrast, India (which is also a large economy with domestic rice production several times the total volume of world trade) experienced quite significant increases in price of rice. Furthermore, these did not decrease commensurately with the global price, to the point that retail rice prices were 60 % higher in January 2009 in India than their level two years earlier. In an economy in which more than 90 % of workers\u2019 incomes are not indexed, such a substantial increase obviously has a big impact upon food access. Given the large proportion -- around half -- of those who are calorie deficient among the Indian population, this is obviously a matter of great concern. Bangladesh and Sri Lanka also present contrasting cases. The results indicate that Sri Lankan consumers have shouldered more of the increase in world food prices than Bangladesh\u2019s.

Mongolia and South Korea - both are net food importers - the results show that South Korean consumers have been more shielded from the price rise than Mongolian consumers. How did some countries manage to escape the worst effects of this volatility and keep their own prices relatively stable? The answers obviously lie largely with how domestic policies have functioned, but more importantly, also with the space for effective domestic policies that is determined by both the external environment and the country\u2019s mode of global economic integration. The most direct link is through trade, with both food importers and food exporters affected. Countries in which a very large proportion of the basic food requirement is met through domestic supply (China and India) are therefore less likely to experience the volatility if they have in place adequate institutional arrangements to ensure domestic production and distribution. By contrast, food importers are obviously more vulnerable. It used to be thought that \u201clarge\u201d economies -- those with the capacity to affect global prices through their entry or exit into world trade -- should be more worried, but with the advent of financial players in the grain markets, it is no longer evident that this by itself would have a direct impact on price. Rather, the impact is more likely to be indirect, through the impact upon the expectations of the financial players. 58 7.

Even so, some importing countries have managed to cope better than others. There is a range of possible interventions that have been made (FAO 2008), ranging from the reduction or suspension of import tariffs and taxes, to the imposition of export restrictions, support for domestic production with agricultural inputs and credit, intervening heavily in food markets, introducing food assistance programs and increasing subsidies. The countries that have managed to do these more effectively are those that have also managed to restrain or stabilize food price increases to some extent. In addition, some countries have taken measures to contain domestic speculation in food markets, either through banning commodity futures markets in grain trade (India). The case of China is especially significant, because with its large population, any significant entry into global markets through additional import demand would naturally affect spot prices. Despite this, China has managed the food situation the most effectively among developing Asian countries, and this reflects not only its internal policies but two features that are particularly noteworthy: the greater strength and viability of its fiscal strategy, and its control over internal and external financial flows. These allowed for strategies to increase food supplies in the face of global market volatility, the continued spread of a public distribution system for essential food items and limits on domestic speculation in food prices. It is evident of course, that effective state intervention for food price stability and food security requires fiscal resources. This has become an important barrier to successful intervention to contain food price rises in many countries. Similarly, the exchange rate depreciations that were experienced by most other developing Asian countries in the period from June 2008 to April 2009 also played a role in keeping domestic food prices higher. Similarly, rising global crude oil prices also contributed to high fuel inflation in many countries in recent years. Between 2003 and 2008, as global prices of fuel increased very sharply, there were significant surges in domestic fuel price inflation in countries such as Afghanistan (216 %), Indonesia (180 %), Malaysia (177 %), Sri Lanka (170 %), Lao PDR (170 %), Philippines (162 %) and Vietnam (155 %). In several of these countries, fuel price inflation was higher than aggregate inflation and contributing to underlying inflationary pressures.7 On the other hand, relatively low pass-through ratios were observed for India, Bhutan, Pakistan, China and Fiji. The price shocks in turn affect the fiscal situation in several ways. On the expenditure side, there are fiscal costs when food and oil-importing countries do not adjust domestic prices of food and petroleum products in line with border prices. Costs also rise when domestic prices adjust to world food and oil prices, and governments then raise social benefit payments or other transfers to moderate the impact on consumers. On the revenue side, there could be revenue loss due to lowering and exemption of Value Added Taxes, import tariffs and other taxes to mitigate the impact of higher world and domestic prices for food and petroleum products. Increases in oil and food prices also affect exports, imports and trade balance in many ways. The trade balance is expected to improve in food and oil exporting countries through the terms of trade effect, and to worsen in commodity importing countries due loss of export competitiveness and an increasing import bill. In addition to the financial burden of higher food and energy import bills, potential constraints on imports of necessities like food and raw materials have also sparked energy and food security concerns among importing countries. 59 8.

At the micro level, the impact of higher food and oil prices on the households are likely to be very diverse, depending upon the reasons for the price change and on the structure of the economy (Ivanic and Martin 2008). The impact could also vary depending upon household incomes and expenditures patterns, products involved, and policy responses of governments (World Bank 2008). Households usually spend about 40-60 % of their incomes on food items and therefore rising food prices are expected to increase households\u2019 consumption expenditure significantly. On the other hand, the incomes of farm households may be increased by higher food prices. Overall the impact of price shocks depends on whether the gains to farming households outweigh the adverse impact on consuming households. The benefits of higher food prices to average farm households may be lower, due to the limited extent of their net sales of food items. Since the majority of households, including in rural areas, are net buyers of food, the increase in food prices generally affects household consumption adversely.8 To maintain a basic diet, poor households, especially in urban areas, are forced to increase their food expenditures at the expense of non-food expenditures such as medical care and education. The increase in fuel price also affects households adversely through raising the cost of agricultural production. In addition, diverting food for bio-fuel production aggravates supply and demand imbalances. As poor households often spend about three fourths of their incomes on food, fuel and transport, soaring food and oil prices jointly affect the poorest the most. This jeopardises progress towards attaining the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by risking gains made in reducing poverty and in increasing social cohesion. Hence, it is not surprising that increasing food and oil prices have triggered riots in many developing countries.

In Vietnam, several studies found that rising food prices had probably led to increased incidence of poverty and cutback on other essential expenditure such as on heath care. The analysis also shows that soaring cereals prices during 2006 - 08 reduced households\u2019 purchasing power substantially. On an average, estimates suggest that the purchasing power of poor households decreased by 24% in Asia and the Pacific, while that of rich households fell by only 4%. The decline of purchasing power varies from country to country. Real incomes of poor households in Mongolia declined by 51% because of food price changes, compared to 14% decline for poor households in India (Table 16). In order to mitigate the adverse impact on consumers, governments intervene in food and energy markets in a variety of ways. Some governments in the food and oil importing countries directly intervene to control the quantity of imports as well as their distribution and prices. Some other governments allow the private sector to import and distribute food and petroleum products freely, but set price ceilings and compensate private sector distributors to cover any losses.

These provide insufficient protection in case of unemployment and cover only a small fraction of the labour force in the formal sector, while a large proportion of workers are employed informally. Formal statutory social protection programmes such as old age and disability benefits, pension systems, etc. tend to be limited in their coverage and do not include the self-employed, the part-time employed, daily labourers in urban centres who come from rural areas, laid off workers in SMEs, agricultural labourers, domestic workers, migrant workers and those working in the informal sector. 6.1. Employment patterns The most obvious and direct impact of the crisis is obviously the effect on employment. In fact employment losses have tended to be more severe than GDP losses, largely because the worst affected productive sectors have been those that are export-oriented and more labour intensive. Further, it is likely that recovery in employment will be both delayed and less dynamic than the recovery in aggregate output. Since most developing Asian countries have large informal employment and higher rates of petty self-employment it is likely to be expected that the impact on employment would be reflected in greater disguised unemployment, more casual work and lower wage incomes rather than in increases in open unemployment. Since exports have been directly and immediately affected, and since manufacturing exports were among the major growth forces in large parts of developing Asia, it was expected that employment in manufacturing production would be immediately hit. However, the evidence on aggregate manufacturing employment in countries that do provide recent monthly data is still somewhat mixed. As Chart 17 indicates, the index of manufacturing employment has been volatile around a declining trend in Macau (China), Hong Kong (China) and the Philippines. But it has shown no clear trend in Thailand and Sri Lanka, and the index even increased just slightly in Indonesia and Taiwan. Since these are all economies whose exports have declined since the middle of 2008, it may be that the initial impact on export sales has yet to be translated into cutbacks in production and employment. Of course, these data rely on recorded employment in manufacturing, and it is likely that a significant amount of informal work in manufacturing is not recorded, so such data may be misleading. In any case, this aggregate information is somewhat contradicted by the evidence emerging from the country case studies, which suggests that the impact on employment is already quite apparent at different levels. Two types of effects on employment can be identified: those on workers who are directly affected by loss of employment, either through complete job loss or reduction in the number of working days or downward pressure 65 Source: ILO Laborsta database, accessed in July 2009. on wages; and those on workers who are indirectly affected by the adverse multiplier and linkage effects of the primary employment reduction. The workers who are directly affected include the workers in export industries (such as garment workers), construction workers, tourism industry workers, farmers of selected crops and internal and cross-border migrant workers. Those who are indirectly affected include self-employed workers and those working in small scale enterprises and in informal activities to supply goods and services within the domestic economy, including to the directly affected workers. The crisis has hit hardest those groups which were already having trouble finding and keeping jobs, such as youth and older workers. The low-skilled, and in particular low-skilled immigrants, were among the first to be laid off because they are concentrated in vulnerable sectors, such as construction or tourism, and often hold only temporary jobs. Open unemployment, and increasing underemployment initially affected the urban areas which were the major areas of factory employment for the rapidly growing export industries and the construction industry. Available evidence shows that employment growth has decelerated sharply in the last decade compared to 1980s. This is particularly so in East Asia. Consequently, the open unemployment rate has increased recently in many East Asian countries. This has happened against a relatively higher GDP growth in the 1990s. Consequently, the employment elasticity has declined in the last decade in Asia. When China data was excluded from Asia, then the decline in employment elasticity is very modest. Sub- regional estimates show that employment elasticity in South Asia has remained more", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fea859e4-07e7-41f1-8257-7fcae231ebfb": {"__data__": {"id_": "fea859e4-07e7-41f1-8257-7fcae231ebfb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Global Financial Crisis and the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "520a24cb60760f1be318267e8f47da62b55c145d5691d39362a99fcaf4c60b58"}}, "hash": "520a24cb60760f1be318267e8f47da62b55c145d5691d39362a99fcaf4c60b58", "text": "or less at same rate of 0.30, while it declined sharply from 0.55 to 0.15 in East Asia in the same period mainly due to declining elasticity in China. In Asia employment elasticity of GDP growth in general and manufacturing in particular has been low and falling, which in turn implies that growth rates of output would have to be very high for demand for labour to grow significantly. As Table 17 shows, employment elasticity in most Asian countries is generally low (below 0.4), which implies that a one percentage point in the GDP is associated with less than 0.4 percentage point increase in employment. 75 80 85 90 95 100 105 110 2006 2007 2008 2007Q4 2008Q1 2008Q2 2008Q3 2008Q4 2009Q1 Chart 17: Index of manufacturing employment Hong Kong, China Indonesia Korea, Rep Macau, China Philippines Sri Lanka Taiwan, China Thailand The crisis has hit hardest those groups which were already having trouble finding and keeping jobs, such as youth and older workers. 66 Agriculture is clearly no longer a refuge sector for those unable to find employment elsewhere \u2013 the data indicate low or even negative employment elasticity in this sector. The service sector, by contrast, seems to have emerged as the refuge sector in this region. With a few exceptions, employment elasticity in manufacturing has also declined. There are several reasons for such a decline, which has been noted in all the developing regions of the world. While tightening labour markets are evident in a few countries such as South Korea and Malaysia, most countries in the region are still characterised by excess labour reserves. The shift away from public sector based industrialisation, which tended to have more focus on employment creation, may also have played a role. Most significantly, economic openness tends to be associated with declining employment elasticity of output (or increases in labour productivity). This is because of the impact of trade liberalisation on the pattern of demand for goods and services within the country as well as on techniques of production. As tastes and preferences of the elites in developing countries are influenced by the \u201cdemonstration effect\u201d of lifestyles in the developed countries, new products and processes introduced in the latter very quickly find their way to the developing countries when their economies are open. Since in developed countries, technological progress is generally associated with increases in labour productivity, producers in developing countries find that the pressure of external competition (in both exporting and import-competing sectors) requires them to adopt such technologies. Further, competition in global markets creates pressures to reduce unit labour costs, and in high-exporting regions such as developing Asia, such pressures are particularly acute. As a result, many enterprises in the region tend to become more capital-intensive as they expand output, either because they have been investing in new or replacement labour- saving equipment, or because they have responded to competitive pressure either in the domestic or international markets by shedding labour. The impact of this is so strong that it more than counterbalances the impact of the global relocation of manufacturing production, which has been related to cheap labour in Asia. Thus even in China, aggregate manufacturing employment has not increased after 1997 despite manufacturing GDP growing rapidly.

But what is more surprising is the continuing increase of labour productivity when output is decelerating or falling. There has been a disproportionate response of employment in the current slump, with evidence of job losses in export industries that are greater than would be expected given the change in output. In Sri Lanka, the collapse of some export employment appears to have generated an employment shift away from industry back to agriculture. The most dynamic sub-sector within manufacturing had been garments, but the post-crisis scenario has witnessed the closure of around 50 factories including 35 garments firms. As a result, employment in industry decreased by 4.8 %. But this was more than compensated by the 8.4 % increase in agricultural employment, which may be related to the policy support provided to ensure continued agricultural growth in this period.

Even so, there has been net closure of 50 factories and the total number of full-time workers in the garment industry fell from 352,955 in September 2008 to 290,439 in April 2009, implying that 18 % of the total work force was laid off in the past eight months. Many more have been temporarily suspended or not provided with overtime work. In Bangladesh, workers in the garment industry who still retained their jobs reported that their earnings had fallen compared to the previous year, and were proving to be insufficient to meet minimum household expenditure including cost of children\u2019s education. Across developing Asia, the garments industry that has been particularly adversely affected by the global slump largely employs young female workers, often migrants from rural areas. Women are typically the first workers to be laid off \u2013 both because the industries in which they predominate (e.g. textiles and garments) are those most affected by the crisis and because women are less unionised and therefore easier to sack. Women workers dominate in export-oriented manufacturing production across most of Asia, especially Southeast Asia, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, with a ratio of two to five female workers for every male worker in sectors such as textiles, garments and electronics (Dejardin and Ownes 2009). Already female unemployment rates in South and Southeast Asia in 2008 were higher than male rates (6 % on average for females compared to 5.2 % for males, ILO 2009). It is well known from the experience of the Asian financial crisis a decade earlier that women workers are usually the first to be laid off, given the job segregation that puts them in the low paying and more \u201cflexible\u201d activities unlike the more diversified and relatively more secure occupations of male workers. For example, women were laid off at seven times the rate of men in South Korea (Seguino 2009). Initial evidence from several countries suggests that this is already happening in the current crisis. This has particular human development implications, since the loss in such employment affects not only household incomes but also gender relations. In Cambodia, Thailand and several other countries, the case studies found that many such women have not returned to their rural homes following layoff, but continue to stay in cities looking for different jobs or staying with spouses, partners or other social contacts. Some have turned to work in the entertainment industry, including as open or disguised sex workers who are thereby exposed to the risk of contracting the HIV infection. Other labour-intensive export industries that have been badly affected, such as leather, electronics and gems and jewellery, have reported closure of some units, labour retrenchment and declining real wages. In India, there are estimated to be more than 15 68 In Cambodia, it is estimated that 30 % of construction jobs have disappeared since January 2009. million women workers in the unorganised sector, and more than half of them are women involved in home-based work for different types of industry, dominantly on a piece-rate basis. These home- based workers are part of often complex production chains delivering goods for both external and domestic markets, which have been hit by falling orders and heightened competitive pressure. Very recent evidence from the case studies in Vietnam, Thailand and Sri Lanka suggests that as export-based industries such as garments face heightened competitive pressure, they pass this pressure on to home-based women workers by reducing the effective rates for \u2018piece-rate\u2019 work. Thus even nominal piece-rate wages have fallen in many such activities, even as prices of necessities such as food have continued to increase. Other quick surveys in India have found significant declines in both employment and real wages in such activities as diamond cutting and polishing, small scale engineering goods, automotive parts, and so on. A particular instance of dramatic declines in real incomes has been evident in the informal sector activity of waste sorting and collection. This is largely performed by economically and socially deprived groups, and the recent collapse of the recycling industry was associated in early 2009 with dramatic declines in piece rates to less than half their level of even a year before. The construction industry has generally been adversely affected across developing Asia. In Cambodia, it is estimated that 30 % of construction jobs have disappeared since January 2009. Similarly, workers in the informal sector and those employed on a casual or daily basis have found it more difficult to get paid work in almost all affected countries.

This was found to be associated not only with declining consumption of the household but also withdrawal of children from school and greater incidence of child labour. Such employment effects are associated also with the indirect multiplier effects of the crisis, which in many developing countries of the region have been associated not so much with increases in open unemployment rates (because of the absence of social safety nets such as unemployment benefits or insurance) but with greater disguised unemployment and falling remuneration. Thus, in areas where tourism is an important activity, in addition to those directly hit in the tourism industry, there have been secondary adverse effects on those providing related services. For example, in Siem Reap (near the famous Angkor Wat complex in Cambodia) in addition to hotels and restaurants, massage shops and beauty parlours, souvenir shops, local transport providers, fruit sellers and mobile food stalls, laundry services, and other local traders have all reported declining incomes in the past year. Similarly, in several areas where there has been significant closure of factories, such as Rajkot in the state of Gujarat, India, or in Dhaka Bangladesh or in Phnom Penh Cambodia, the various small businesses that catered to the needs of workers have been severely affected, and quick surveys have found that earnings of such related activities declined by about 30-60 % compared to the previous year. In the Tan Thuan-Export Processing Zone, near Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam, loss of employment in and closure of some exporting factories was found to be associated with significant losses in incomes and livelihood of service providers (such as room rentals, restaurants, barber shops, etc) who had earlier catered to the workers. One feature that has not been widely noted in most recent analyses of the effects of the crisis but is nevertheless a cause for concern and possible future tension is the apparently rapid increase in youth unemployment in many countries. While the attention has been focussed on post- crisis job loss and newly laid off workers, the crisis has also meant dramatically reduced opportunities for new entrants to the work force at almost all levels of skill. In China the lack of sufficient job 69 Trade liberalisation meant that farmers had to operate in a highly uncertain and volatile international environment. options for millions of new graduates has been acknowledged as a potent source of possible social unrest, and in India as well educated unemployment has shown an increase. But the even greater danger may come from less skilled young workers \u2013 both male and female \u2013 who may find it difficult to enter the work force at all. In addition to the social problems this can cause, this affects future growth prospects of the economy because of the social waste of such unemployment and the absence of on-the-job training for such young people. 6.2. The Crisis and Agriculture The current problems in farming have to be seen in the context of an agrarian crisis that has plagued many countries in the region for more than a decade. In several (but not all) countries in the region, public policies from the early 1990s onwards systematically reduced the protection afforded to farmers and exposed them to import competition and market volatility; allowed private profiteering in agricultural input supply and crop purchases without adequate regulation; reduced critical forms of public expenditure; tried to cut subsidies by increasing the prices of important inputs like fertiliser and water and electricity rates, ran down or destroyed important public institutions that have direct relevance for farming, including public extension services and marketing arrangements; and did not adequately generate other non-agricultural economic activities. At the same time various forms of public protection for cultivation were being reduced, trade liberalisation meant that farmers had to operate in a highly uncertain and volatile international environment. They were effectively competing against highly subsidised large producers in the developed countries, whose average level of subsidy amounted to many times the total domestic cost of production for many crops. In addition to increasing the risks of farming, volatile crop prices also generated misleading price signals. This caused large and often undesirable shifts in cropping patterns which ultimately rebounded on the farmers themselves. There was much greater use of a range of purchased inputs, including new varieties of seed and related inputs marketed by major multinational companies. Small cultivators, who took on debt (often from informal credit sources at very high rates of interest) in order to pay for these cash inputs,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6f570a2b-444d-49cd-81f5-5c79e302d47b": {"__data__": {"id_": "6f570a2b-444d-49cd-81f5-5c79e302d47b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Global Financial Crisis and the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "be114ed26f47e69f5c4f883439b35d486523440a7ae89449f9064ffdc1a0fbbd"}}, "hash": "be114ed26f47e69f5c4f883439b35d486523440a7ae89449f9064ffdc1a0fbbd", "text": "then found themselves in real difficulty if crops failed or output prices remained low. So the inevitable uncertainties associated with weather fluctuations were compounded by further problems of extremely volatile crop prices, which were no longer inversely related to harvest levels but followed an international pattern. Further, this dramatic volatility of output prices was associated with continuously rising prices of inputs. This was especially marked because of government attempts to reduce fertiliser subsidies, and progressive deregulation of supplies of inputs such as seeds and pesticides. For example, in Cambodia, a nationally representative survey of households found that labour cost increased by 47 % and agricultural production costs accelerated by 30 to 50 %, due partly to the tripling in the price of fertiliser and the 50 % increase in the price of diesel and gasoline (CDRI, 2008). Similar results have been reported in India, Indonesia, Philippines and Pakistan. Such exposure to global price volatility was associated with a growing reliance on private debt, because of the lack of extension of institutional credit. In most countries of the region, deregulated finance was less willing to provide agricultural credit, and there was therefore a significant slowdown in the growth of bank credit, particularly from commercial banks to rural areas, the impact of which fell disproportionately on poor and small borrowers. While global prices increased dramatically between late 2006 and mid 2008, many 70 cultivators in the region could not get the advantage of such hikes because farm gate prices did not change very much in most countries. Rather, the benefits of such price hikes were largely captured by large traders and speculators. The subsequent decline in global prices has however impacted upon farm gate prices especially for important cash crops, for which typically there are no price support mechanisms provided by governments. While the prices of major agricultural commodities declined quite sharply from their peak in June/July 2008, input prices continued to increase for most farmers. The oil price hikes of 2008 were translated into higher fertiliser and pesticide prices with a lag, and domestic increases in fuel prices also increased the cost of transportation of crops, use of machinery and other inputs. In several countries money wages in agriculture also increased because of food price increases (even though typically the increase was lower than that of the food price) leading to higher labour costs. Thus the very recent period has seen a growing problem of reduced financial viability of cultivation. All these difficulties are heightened in the case of women farmers, because in much of Asia (especially South Asia) lack of land titles and other recognition has tended to deprive them of benefits such as access to institutional credit, extension services, subsidised inputs, etc. They therefore tend to have higher costs of cultivation than their male counterparts, and less state protection. In turn they are also likely to be deprived of the benefits of any crisis relief packages in the absence of specific measures. It is worth noting that only 7 % of arable land in Asia is owned by women compared to around 18 % in Africa, which is the next lowest region. However, in some countries where public policies have been more supportive of farming, agriculture has emerged as an important bulwark against the crisis. This is evident in Vietnam and Sri Lanka, where continued output growth in agriculture and higher rural incomes have served to mitigate the negative effects of the global crisis on manufacturing and some services. 6.3. Impact of Reduced Access to Credit Borrowing has been an important coping mechanism for those badly affected by the crisis whether through job loss or through declining wage incomes or other routes. Various surveys conducted in the wake of the crisis in different countries have all found households in the first instance seek to increase their borrowing to shore up their consumption and maintain \u201cdesirable\u201d expenditures such as education of children. However, in large parts of developing Asia, informal sector workers and cultivators have poor or non-existent access to formal credit institutions, such as banks and credit co-operatives, and even formal \u201cmicro- credit\u201d institutions can provide only a small fraction of their needs especially in emergencies. Therefore they are driven to informal credit sources at very high rates of interest. This puts an enormous burden of debt on the household that affects their ability to recover from the crisis even when economic conditions improve. In addition, small and micro enterprises face a significantly increased problem of inadequate access to credit. This is particularly important to note because typically most policy responses to the crisis in the region", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e54d06fc-6dc1-4196-8245-ad1aafeed50c": {"__data__": {"id_": "e54d06fc-6dc1-4196-8245-ad1aafeed50c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Global Financial Crisis and the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c3e08d302cd1e187bb300f912fb69c0e68f03ec55677fd1019d84c20af9f529e"}}, "hash": "c3e08d302cd1e187bb300f912fb69c0e68f03ec55677fd1019d84c20af9f529e", "text": "have tended to ignore the specific needs of such micro entrepreneurs and self-employed persons who constitute the bulk of employment. Women in particular find it difficult if not impossible to access institutional credit for productive purposes. This increases costs of operation and makes it even harder to be competitive in the much more difficult economic environment. 71 When they lose their jobs they are forced either to stay in precarious conditions in the urban areas, or go back to their places of origin \u2013 villages or smaller towns. They consequently change from becoming providers of remittance incomes to their households, to becoming dependents of these households. 6.4 Impact on Migrant Workers The impact of the global crisis on cross-border migration has already been discussed in an earlier section. But there are other human development implications of the impact upon migrant workers that need to be noted. For example, in Bangladesh it was found that many migrant workers who travelled abroad in search of work often had to incur debt for large down payments to labour contractors and therefore were unable to generate much savings even after several years of work in often unsavoury conditions. The adverse economic situation in destination countries has made matters much worse for many of them who now are also unable to repay the debts they have taken on and feel unable to return home for fear of social censure. Internal migration has been an important feature of the export-led industrialisation process across developing Asia. The economic boom of the past decade relied heavily on such workers: not just in the export sectors themselves but in related labour-intensive services, such as cleaning, maintenance, private security, driving and related services. These were not simply informal activities: many of them catered to the requirements of the expanding corporate sector in the booming economies, and in effect subsidised it by providing a cheap and flexible external labour force. The direct and indirect employment effects of the crisis that were mentioned earlier have been most evident for such migrant workers. As migrants, they are typically denied the residence-based socio-economic rights that governments in the region recognise, even when they are employed. When they lose their jobs they are forced either to stay in precarious conditions in the urban areas, or go back to their places of origin \u2013 villages or smaller towns. They consequently change from becoming providers of remittance incomes to their households, to becoming dependents of these households, even as these households face more fragile material circumstances than before. Many of these migrant workers, for obvious reasons, come from more depressed and backward regions, where there is relatively less potential for productive income generation, and where remittance incomes can play a vital role in sheer survival. These problems have been noted for large countries such as China and India, but also in smaller countries such as the Philippines, Cambodia and Bangladesh. The loss of remittance incomes has other effects within rural economies. A study by Cambodia Development Resource Institute found that 93 % of urban migrant workers remit money home to their villages, on average about US$20 per year. This suggests that internal migrants send home as much as US$150 million per year to rural Cambodia or about 8 % of the total income of rural households. In Nepal, remittance income is found to contribute as much as half of household income in certain pockets. As such remittances dwindle, this directly affects consumption, including of essential items. 6.5 Impact on Income Poverty and Human Poverty There are particular concerns about the impact of the current crisis on poverty and inequality, because the earlier boom was characterised by increasing inequality and therefore the persistence of poverty in many countries. Several studies have found extremely adverse indirect effects of the crisis in terms of reduced household spending on essential items, for the reasons noted above. This was particularly marked among households where the main earner had recently lost employment or households that faced a significant decline in wage incomes or remuneration from 72 self-employment. Health and education spending appear to be the types of spending that are most affected. Several studies (especially in India, Cambodia, Vietnam, etc) reported not only reduced food consumption but also reduced health spending and avoidance of trips to medical personnel in order to reduce household costs. Withdrawal of children \u2013 especially girl children \u2013 from school or their shift to lower quality but less costly municipal schools was a very common response. Several cases studies found that the children were also put to work in order to increase family income and therefore the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e65a7115-270c-47c6-bc4e-b4a28400d7d5": {"__data__": {"id_": "e65a7115-270c-47c6-bc4e-b4a28400d7d5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Global Financial Crisis and the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "30a18ad600a96ea673f3edbbc70eb03f37ddbd177e350a6b9575b9daddbfd4bb"}}, "hash": "30a18ad600a96ea673f3edbbc70eb03f37ddbd177e350a6b9575b9daddbfd4bb", "text": "family\u2019s survival chances. Several surveys in India also noted some increase in domestic violence as the greater insecurities and frustrations of daily existence led male heads of households to vent their anger on the womenfolk. The withdrawal or reduction of public services, which has been part of the fiscal problems emerging from the crisis, usually put a greater burden on unpaid labour within the household. This is typically performed by women, and this too is already evident from quick surveys in different parts of developing Asia. An economy-wide shock is likely to have heterogeneous impacts within any given country, depending on household demographics, education attainments and location. The impacts of a crisis on children are understandably of great concern. When poor families are compelled to cut short their kids\u2019 schooling in response to a shock this creates a lasting impact on poverty. This impact varies depending on the extent of the shock and initial conditions. Declining wages make child labour relatively less attractive and schooling more so, but (at the same time) lower parental incomes increase the value of the extra money that children can bring to the family budget if they work. The balance of these economic forces will vary from place to place. There is evidence that in low income countries schooling tends to decline in an economic crisis while in middle- and high-income countries schooling rates increase. Impacts on the nutrition of young children in poor families are also of special concern. A number of research findings suggest that poor nutrition in the early years of life retards child growth, cognitive and learning ability, schooling attainments and (in all likelihood) earnings in adulthood The growth elasticity of poverty which indicates the percentage change in the incidence of poverty associated with a 1 % increase in per capita income varies widely across Asian countries. Among the major Asian countries, the Philippines is the only country where positive elasticity has been found implying that the growth of per capita income is not associated with a decline in poverty. In most Asian countries, the elasticity is negative implying that growth of per capita income associated with some decline in poverty incidence. On average, the growth elasticity of poverty reduction has been estimated at -0.8 for 13 Asian countries (Palanivel, 2008). However, the pattern varies across countries and critically depends upon the nature of the growth, its sectoral content and the distribution of its benefits, in all of which state policies play an important role. It has been found that in China the most impressive reductions in poverty were concentrated in phases when the growth pattern favoured rural areas and improved the terms of trade of agriculture versus industry (Ghosh 2009). A similar result has also been noted for Indonesia: the astonishing egalitarian and poverty alleviating growth in Indonesia during the 1970s and the 1980s was principally due to a diversion of a high proportion of public investment towards the rural areas, and to reforms of the domestic trade and marketing regime, which led to an improvement of the agricultural terms of trade. When India experienced relatively fast agricultural growth (mainly due to the green revolution) in the 1970\u2019s and in the first half of the 1980\u2019s, poverty declined despite a relatively low rate of overall economic growth. However, the slowdown in agricultural growth in the 1990s and early part of this decade, despite high aggregate economic growth, had an adverse impact on poverty reduction. 73 Some countries have managed to reduce poverty fairly rapidly even in periods of relatively slow growth by ensuring that gains from such growth accrue relatively more to the poorer segments of the population. For example, despite only moderate annual growth rates of per capita income of 3 %, Malaysia and Sri Lanka in the 1980s were able to reduce poverty annually by as much as 4-7 % due to declining inequality. A striking case is that of Pakistan in the 1970s, when poverty declined despite slow growth (of less than 2 % per annum) and rising inequality. This can be traced to the rapid increase in labour migration of Pakistani workers to the Middle East in this decade, which led to large and growing inflows of remittances that contributed to poverty reduction at home. Clearly, when inequality is rising, growth will have a less direct and beneficial impact upon poverty reduction (Bourgignon 2007). For the region as a whole, a one percentage point increase in the growth rate of per capita income has translated into only about 0.7 % - 0.9 % decline in the incidence of poverty. Inequality as a whole has", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d05e8d1e-e386-4035-a7eb-c356710b8c6a": {"__data__": {"id_": "d05e8d1e-e386-4035-a7eb-c356710b8c6a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Global Financial Crisis and the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "65eeeb882eeabd77b8b3ec7ba7c838fafb4b41404a2cdf9b6e92c0cfa1811099"}, "3": {"node_id": "cb017a38-26f0-4996-8408-1dc92b2a8d00", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b2f109949b818708f0935b3a86dd4690fd51311ee045e70dfe1f42ee07aa002f"}}, "hash": "c4ba48bc73b463d749992e5bac0a03757f56d34bc54fd30839fb6b856e5407aa", "text": "worsened in the region since the early 1990s, and while it has been successful in achieving high rates of economic growth, it has implied slower progress in terms of poverty reduction. If economic growth is to be favourable to the poor, it should have a pattern that directs resources to the sectors in which the poor work (agriculture), areas in which they live (relatively backward regions), factors of production which they possess (unskilled labour) and outputs which they consume (such as food). 74 Policy Responses Asia-Pacific countries found themselves in very divergent situations regarding the scope for fiscal stimulus and easing monetary policy, depending mainly on their initial fiscal and current-account positions. At the time of the crisis Asia\u2019s initial conditions were stronger than at any time in the past. As Table 18 shows, Asian countries (except perhaps Maldives, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam) enjoyed large policy space for counter-cyclical measures to address the crisis. These conditions gave Asian economies in general the space to move towards a more expansionary monetary and fiscal policy regime by cutting interest rates sharply and adopting large fiscal stimulus packages. As a result, overall domestic demand has held up remarkably well, despite the collapse of external demand. 7.1. Fiscal and monetary policies Monetary policies were the first to be deployed once the adverse effects of the crisis in terms of asset market declines, exchange rate depreciations and domestic credit crunch began to be felt. Monetary policy in most countries of the region had been tightened from early 2008 in response to the sharp increases in commodity prices, which were feared to spark and inflationary spiral. In some countries, the deceleration in output could even be traced at least partially to such monetary tightening. However, by late 2008 almost all governments in the Asia-Pacific region were indulging in substantial easing of monetary policy, through reductions in prime lending rates and repo rates, increases in liquidity through changing of cash reserve rules and other central bank actions designed to make institutional credit more accessible. Measures were also taken to support domestic financial markets. Blanket guarantees on deposits, swaps to companies and banks needing foreign currency, and guarantees on external bond issuance for banks have all helped maintain confidence and sustain the banking systems\u2019 ability to play their intermediation function. By mid 2009 these appeared to have had some positive effect, even though credit remained tight especially for small entrepreneurs.

interest rates significantly in late 2008. Developed Asia also reduced their policy rates substantially. In the first half of 2009, the central banks of Asian economies moved further towards a more expansionary monetary policy. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, developing Asia reduced their interest rates by an average of 152 percentage points and developed Asia by 233 percentage points (Table 19). Consequently money and credit aggregates recorded rapid growth in many Asian countries in the last one year. Aggressive monetary policy easing by regional central banks has contributed to Asia\u2019s recovery. Only Pakistan, where monetary policy is being operated under IMF programme, interest rates remained high (at 14 %), as fighting inflation with a restrictive monetary policy has taken priority over countercyclical demand stimulation. The degree of interest rate easing in Asia stands out compared with that in previous business cycles or other regions. The median policy rate has declined by about 2.3 percentage points, about five times as much as in previous recessions. Lending rates, however, have declined by smaller amounts, raising questions about whether monetary transmission mechanisms have buckled under the strain of the global crisis.

Other governments also announced fiscal packages, though these were typically much smaller in relation to GDP, such as India (1.8 %), Philippines (3.1 %) and Thailand (3.4.1 %). Since China is such a large player in the region, and since the need to shift from external demand to domestic consumption is the greatest in that economy, the quick fiscal response was certainly very welcome. The Chinese fiscal plan also has had the interesting result that it has shifted the geographical sources of demand from the eastern coastal region (which had hitherto dominated in growth) to the relatively neglected western and central regions. 80 Table 21: Fiscal Stimulus and support to the Financial System in Selected Economies (Per cent of GDP) Fiscal Stimulus a Support to the Financial system b Year to spend fiscal Stimulus Fiscal Stimulus a Support to the Financial system b Year to spend fiscal Stimulus Developed economies c 3.7 48.5 Developing economies c 4.7 2.9 Australia 5.4 9.5 3 Argentina 6.4 0.9 1 Austria 1.2 35.4 2 Brazil 5.6 1.5 1 Belgium 1.4 31.0 2 Chile 2.8 0.0 1 Canada 4.1 24.8 3 China 6.2 0.5 2 France 1.5 19.1 2 Hong Kong SAR China 2.4 0.0 1 Germany 3.6 22.2 2 Taiwan Province of China 2.1 0.0 1 Greece 0.8 11.6 1 India 1.8 6.4 3 Hungary -7.7 9.1 2 Indonesia 2.0 0.1 2 Iceland -7.3 263.0 2 Malaysia 2.8 6.3 2 Ireland -8.3 266.4 3 Mexico 1.6 0.0 1 Italy 0.3 3.3 2 Peru 3.2 0.0 2 Japan 4.7 22.3 3 Philippines 3.1 0.0 1 Netherlands 2.5 46.5 2 Republic of Korea 6.2 20.5 3 Norway 1.2 17.8 1 Saudi Arabia 9.2 9.4 3 Poland 1.2 3.2 2 Singapore 8.0 0.0 1 Portugal 0.8 14.4 1 South Africa 7.4 0.0 3 Spain 3.9 22.9 3 Thailand 3.4 0.0 1 Sweden 3.3 70.2 2 Turkey 1.1 0.5 2 Switzerland 0.5 12.0 2 Transition economies c 5.8 7.4 United Kingdom 1.9 81.7 3 Kazakhstan 11.1 0.0 2 United States 5.5 81.1 3 Russian Federation 5.4 8.0 2 Total c 4.0 36.1 Source: UNCTAD (2009) a Corresponds to discretionary measures on public spending or revenues in response to the financial crisis, excluding the \u201cautomatic stabilizers\u201d. b Comprises capital injection, purchases of assets, lending by government treasuries, central bank support provided with treasury backing, liquidity provision by central banks and guarantees, excluding deposit insurance provided by deposit insurance agencies.

Third - faster implementation. Close to 50 % of the stimulus has been implemented on average in Asian economies, well above the G-20 norm, driven primarily by strong implementation of spending programmes.

It appears that the fairly large fiscal stimulus of the Chinese government, along with other measures to ease interest rates and increase credit access, have worked in terms of increasing both domestic demand and economic activity in China. Thus, while exports have slumped in response to the global trend, domestic demand and retail sales have picked up. As a result, preliminary data for the second quarter of 2009 suggest that GDP is growing by nearly 9 % at an annualised rate, and industrial production in June was 10.7 % higher than it was in the same month of the previous year. However, not only countries in the region have the fiscal space or the freedom in terms of balance of payments to engage in desirable countercyclical measures. In some countries of developing Asia, the crisis has also been associated with a fiscal crisis of the state, and some countries (such as Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Mongolia) have already had to approach the IMF for emergency assistance. Unfortunately, the IMF, which now accepts the need for countercyclical macroeconomic policies in the developed countries, still insists on very harsh pro-cyclical policies in the developing world, and forces governments to cut back on expenditure and raise user charges for public services in order to reduce fiscal deficits. This has meant reduced access to crucial public services. When combined with the effect of losses of livelihood and wage incomes, the effect can be disastrous. Such adverse effects are not inevitable, since they can be ameliorated or even reversed by policy measures. But the extent to which different governments in Asia can undertake effective policy responses is conditioned by the extent to which they have been affected by the crisis in the first place. In particular, the extent of financial contagion and possible local financial crisis has depended on how far the developing country concerned has gone along the road of financial liberalisation. Countries with large external debts and current account deficits (such as Pakistan and Sri Lanka) have faced particular problems. The developing countries that have gone furthest in terms of deregulating their financial markets along the lines of the US (for example Indonesia) have been badly affected. By contrast, China, which has still kept most of the banking system under state control Asia\u2019s fiscal stimulus has differed from that in other regions on three aspects: first, the size of fiscal stimulus; on average, in Asian economies, fiscal stimulus in 2009 amounts to about 2.7 % of GDP, compared with about 2 % on average in the G-20. Second a greater reliance on spending than tax measures. Asian economies devoted about 80 percent of their discretionary fiscal stimulus to increased spending, against about 60 % in the G-20. 82 and has not allowed many of the financial \u201cinnovations\u201d that are responsible for the current problem in developed markets, is relatively safe. The degree of flexibility available to different countries of developing Asia in terms of fiscal space varies greatly. Most Asian countries have followed prudent fiscal policies during the recent period of strong growth, and have also accumulated substantial foreign exchange surpluses that could be used as a hedge against capital flight in the event of financial markets\u2019 discomfort with larger fiscal deficits. As a result, \u201cfiscal space\u201d has been generated that could be used to boost domestic demand, through automatic stabilisers to work or countercyclical policies. Most East Asian countries (China, Malaysia, Korea, Singapore, and Thailand) have sufficient fiscal space to boost social spending to reduce the high level of precautionary saving and thus keep growth relatively high. On the other hand, most South Asian countries and some East Asian countries like the Philippines and Vietnam have relatively little room to manoeuvre owing to high fiscal deficits, relatively high levels of public debt and current account deficits that continue to require external financing. The ability to engage in expansionary fiscal policy has also been severely constrained in some countries by resources and the continuing explicit or implicit conditionality of international sources of funds. Thus the IMF package for Pakistan explicitly requires a reduction in the fiscal deficit from 7.4% of GDP to 4.2% through lowering public expenditure, gradually eliminating energy subsidies, raising electricity tariffs by 18% and eliminating tax exemptions. In other Least Developed Countries, the drying of ODA in the aftermath of the crisis has also played an extremely adverse role in reducing the possibility of countercyclical fiscal policy.

Fiscal policy that provides more wage income directly to unskilled workers and in rural areas is likely to be much more effective in increasing aggregate incomes than other forms of public spending, because of the higher value of the multiplier in such expenditure. That is why the recent emergence of certain automatic stabilisers in government spending in India (such as the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, or NREGS) had some effect in mitigating the very adverse impact of employment and wage income losses due to the crisis. This more \u201cinclusive\u201d form of public spending is not only desirable from a social or welfare perspective \u2013 it also provides very direct economic benefits because it is much more effective in dealing with the slump. Therefore the NREGS is about more than equity; it is also a macroeconomic weapon against slump, and this is at least partly so because it does generate more equity. All this is of significance because it means that even without increases in the level of the fiscal deficit, changes in the composition of public spending \u2013 towards rural areas and more backward regions, towards agriculture and employment intensive non-agricultural activities, towards ensuring universal provision of basic needs such as food, low cost housing, health services, etc. \u2013 can have significant positive effects in ameliorating conditions of life and contributing to wage- led recovery and growth. While the global crisis has been associated with synchronic movements of output, there are signs that developing Asia, or at least some countries in the region, are likely to emerge from the crisis faster. To a significant extent, the recovery in some countries in the region has been associated with quick and proactive countercyclical monetary and fiscal policies that were designed to avoid the kind of sharp collapses in output and employment that were experienced most recently during the Asian crisis of the earlier decade. On the other hand, most South Asian countries and some East Asian countries like the Philippines and Vietnam have relatively little room to manoeuvre owing to high fiscal deficits, relatively high levels of public debt and current account deficits that continue to require external financing. 83 7.2. Financial regulation The UN Commission on regulating finance (the Stiglitz Commission) has already made a number of valuable suggestions with respect to recommendations at the international level for regulating finance so as to ensure that it meets the basic goals of international financial intermediation and stability. While some economists have been pointing out for some time that finance is special for a variety of reasons (including asymmetric information, and associated propensity for adverse selection, moral hazard, and the like, taken in combination with the crucial role banking plays in lubricating a market economy) this is now more widely accepted in the wake of the global crisis. But the pre-crisis experience has also shown that the globalisation of finance necessarily leads to regulatory arbitrage and tax arbitrage, even though both regulation and taxes are in the interests of nations and societies. How to resolve these contradictions is at the heart of the current discussions on future pathways of financial regulation, both nationally and at the international level. The need to establish sound and efficient systems of financial regulation and supervision is clearly one of the important lessons from the crisis; another is the need to ensure that financial innovations are sensible and do not disguise risk in the name of reducing it. These issues are especially important in Asian developing countries because it is widely perceived that financial widening and deepening still have a long way to go in this region. Indeed, the divergence between domestic savings and investment rates (the so-called \u201csavings glut\u201d) has been blamed on inadequate development of financial institutions. However, it should be noted that developing Asia is extremely diverse in this respect, and some of the countries that have exhibited the greatest savings surpluses (such as Malaysia, Indonesia and South Korea) are precisely those who have had the most deregulated, financially sophisticated and globally integrated financial systems especially since the Asian crisis. The role played by falling investment rates in creating the savings surplus has already been discussed; what should be recognised here is that the export of capital from such economies did not reflect lack of financial development in these countries any more than it did in Germany and Japan, which also exported capital to the US in this period. It is certainly true that China and India remain relatively more regulated especially in terms of banking (although in these countries as well the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cea24dee-75de-49fa-96fc-922213ce66d4": {"__data__": {"id_": "cea24dee-75de-49fa-96fc-922213ce66d4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Global Financial Crisis and the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "08ff689f2ddcd36f46aff830b4dd7f3b6557876dfbd43a1b843a491c3220f864"}}, "hash": "08ff689f2ddcd36f46aff830b4dd7f3b6557876dfbd43a1b843a491c3220f864", "text": "trend has been towards further liberalisation) but this is now recognised to be a major factor behind the relative financial stability exhibited by these countries before, during and after the crisis. However, insufficient financial widening \u2013 in particular the lack of extension of institutional credit and formal insurance to major segments of the economy such as small and medium firms, producers, cultivators and informal sector producers - remains an important constraint on both development and equitable growth in most Asian countries, and this needs to be addressed. Two extensions to these proposals may be noted. First, given the highly unequal and potentially contractionary effects of devaluation upon developing countries, which in turn have adverse impacts upon real wages and essential consumption, it is necessary to encourage developing countries in Asia and elsewhere to institute capital management techniques that will control the destabilising flows of capital that cause havoc in exchange rates. Second, the crucial interaction between food and finance that was noted in Chapter 3 needs to be recognised and dealt with. It may now be a good time to consider restricting capital inflows in order to avoid a future bubble. If such an option is now not feasible, it may also be prudent to establish a substantial regional financial facility that can help countries deal with their weakened national currency. The 84 recent announcement of a US$ 120 billion facility under the Chiang Mai initiative is a good start that must be developed further and help avoid ad hoc arrangements. It is true that the resolution of the global food crisis requires policies in the real economy, such as government interventions to provide more public support for sustainable and viable cultivation patterns and to create and administer better domestic food distribution systems; and international arrangements and co- operative interventions, such as strategic grain reserves, commodity boards and other measures to stabilise world trade prices. But dealing with the food crisis also definitely requires specific controls on finance, to ensure that food cannot become an arena of global and national speculation. These controls should include very strict limits (indeed bans) on the entry of financial players into commodity futures markets; the elimination of the \u201cswap- dealer loophole\u201d that allows financial players to enter as supposedly commercial players; and the banning of such markets in countries where public institutions play an important role in grain trade. 7.3 Redirecting production and demand to resolve external and internal imbalances One of the important factors that made the current crisis so extensive was the previous build-up of what are clearly unsustainable global imbalances. To a significant extent these reflected the varying growth patterns in the US (which involved large and growing current account deficits) and in some countries of developing Asia like China, along with other net exporting countries like Germany (where the growth was based on large and growing current account surpluses). The unwinding of these imbalances is both inevitable and necessary, but for these to occur in a manner that does not generate painful restructuring in both sets of economies, active policy intervention is required. In the United States, the recession is already working towards reduced imports and increased exports, involving some decline in the current account deficit, while the winding down of private debt and growing protectionist pressures are likely to lead to further changes in this direction. In the near future, it is extremely unlikely if not impossible for the US economy to serve as the global growth engine in the same manner as in the recent past. This means that the mercantilist obsession with increasing net exports, which has formed the underlying principle for recent growth strategy in the surplus countries, must be discarded. Despite clear indications to this effect, it is fair to say that export-led growth still remains the basic economic strategy in the Asian region, even in countries where the quantitative share of exports is not that large, and even in countries with current account deficits. For example, recent growth in most South Asian countries has been driven predominantly by domestic consumption and domestic investment. External demand, as measured by merchandise exports, accounts for less than one sixth of GDP in these economies. However, global integration has still played an important role, either by providing the qualitative catalyst for recent growth or by encouraging capital inflows that generated domestic asset booms and high animal spirits. In most East and Southeast Asian countries, exports contribute very large shares of GDP and the reliance on external demand is both more open and more explicit. Given the sharp decline and projected stagnation in export demand, particularly from", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "798ffeb8-e732-40d1-a12e-4bd019760dff": {"__data__": {"id_": "798ffeb8-e732-40d1-a12e-4bd019760dff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Global Financial Crisis and the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c1ba579aa212eabdf70c41eebc08811d008f1f105c12c9fc031ead88f8d29998"}}, "hash": "c1ba579aa212eabdf70c41eebc08811d008f1f105c12c9fc031ead88f8d29998", "text": "Northern markets, it is critical that domestic demand rises rapidly in these countries. Since market functioning is likely to lead to the opposite outcome (because loss of business confidence and jobs are likely to curb domestic consumption growth across the region) it is necessary for government policies to be proactive in this regard. The unwinding of these imbalances is both inevitable and necessary, but for these to occur in a manner that does not generate painful restructuring in both sets of economies, active policy intervention is required. 85 Redirection and diversification of external demand away from excessive dependence upon Northern markets will clearly require greater emphasis on more trade within the region and South-South trade. There have already been significant moves towards this, especially through extension and deepening of bilateral and regional free trade agreements that have promoted more cross-border trade and investment and strengthened regional supply chains across developing Asia. The potential for expansion in such areas is now greater than ever before. In the past, South-South trade has been constrained by the lack of resources to lubricate such trade in the form of trade credit, investment flows and aid- for-trade arrangements. Such a resource constraint is no longer operative for the region as a whole, given the large volume of external reserves held by the aggregate of countries in the region as well as the large current account surpluses run by some countries. Therefore it is possible to conceive a broader regional strategy (along the lines of a Marshall Plan for the South) where by China and other surplus countries make financial resources available to other countries in the region to import their goods, in a mutually beneficial arrangement. Some initial moves in this direction are already being made, for example through the substantial expansion of credit advanced to partner countries by the China Exim- bank, but there is much scope for further expansion of such tendencies. In addition, improvement of intra-regional trade facilitation procedures and infrastructure and transport linkages are likely to play a significant role in contributing to future economic dynamism in the region. It is evident that as the process of global economic rebalancing gets under way, developing Asia (and the surplus countries like China in particular) can no longer depend on exports as its primary engine of growth. It has been pointed several times in this study that Asia\u2019s record growth performance has come at a price. High rates of saving and investment, combined with respectable rates of technological progress have been the main drivers of Asia\u2019s capital intensive, non-agriculture-based export-led growth. While this did serve the region well in many respects, there are macroeconomic downsides to this growth pattern. The first is that it may not be possible to finance the current capital intensive mode of growth in the long run. Over time, more growth has come from capital accumulation, and less from employment and productivity increases. For developing Asia to continue on the same trajectory, rates of saving and investment would need to increase to more than half of GDP, which would be difficult as the economy matures. Secondly, this pattern of growth has created fewer jobs than a more labour intensive pattern, and has in the process increased urban-rural inequality. Thirdly, and most central to the financial crisis, is the issue of global macro imbalances, particularly between the US and East Asia. From the external perspective, accelerating manufacturing production means continued strong export expansion and increase in the current account surplus and foreign exchange reserves. The growing US trade deficits against emerging economies like China in recent years have triggered intense debate over global imbalance. Of course, it makes little sense to blame China alone for the trade imbalance, since as a low-labour-cost country, China is naturally positioned to gain a larger manufacturing share in the international market as it is increasingly integrated into the global economy. However, the very high rates of domestic saving (significantly in excess of the high rates of domestic investment) obviously play a role. Several factors have been cited as possible contributors to the recent surge in East Asian private savings rates. These include rapid GDP growth; increased uncertainty in the wake of the Asian crisis, which led to an increase in precautionary saving; the region\u2019s ongoing demographic transition, in which the average age of its population is increasing; and financial There have already been significant moves towards this, especially through extension and deepening of bilateral and regional free trade agreements that have promoted more cross-border trade and investment and strengthened regional supply chains across developing Asia. 86 development, which may have either a", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d6ade933-bbbc-48bb-9c92-628046ff8094": {"__data__": {"id_": "d6ade933-bbbc-48bb-9c92-628046ff8094", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Global Financial Crisis and the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "22db302ea7504c03a3762f16ecfee3916a2d9fc90b016ac5e39320bb14878a5b"}}, "hash": "22db302ea7504c03a3762f16ecfee3916a2d9fc90b016ac5e39320bb14878a5b", "text": "positive or a negative impact on saving. For example, the precautionary motive for saving is very strong among Chinese households because of the lack of an adequate pension system and the sharply rising costs of health care. Demographic factors add to this saving motive. The one-child policy instituted in the 1970s to control population growth has intensified the aging of China\u2019s population. The need to finance education expenses has also bolstered saving. The slow development of financial markets in China has meant limited availability of credit, so that households generally have to save in order to purchase big-ticket items, like houses and cars, rather than being able to borrow against future income. It also has meant that there are low returns on households\u2019 financial assets and limited opportunities for portfolio diversification, since there are few alternatives to depositing savings in state-owned banks. Fourthly, the current growth pattern has contributed to growing inequality. Accumulation of capital in industry and services has led to starkly widening productivity differences, which in turn have led to large rural and urban income inequalities. This is because Asia\u2019s heavy reliance on manufacturing and services meant that urban formal sector jobs became rapidly more productive, and wages rose in line. As a result, agricultural incomes increasingly lagged behind average income per capita, contributing to inequality. During the last decade, Gini coefficients of many Asian countries rose to 0.40 or above, and several Asian countries are now similar to Latin American countries in terms of income inequality. Finally, developing Asia\u2019s heavy reliance on industry for growth and its rapid rates of urbanisation have put increasing strains on the environment. Overall, the region has dramatically improved the efficiency of use of natural resources and energy over the past two decades. Nevertheless, environmental constraints on growth now loom large. The issues extend beyond climate change per se to over-extraction, degradation, pollution and congestion, which are among the more pressing problems facing citizens of the region today. On current trends, Asia\u2019s growth imbalances\u2014with growth driven by investment in industry and services in urban areas, environmental strains, and income inequality\u2014are likely to become worse. Governments in the region are becoming more aware of these challenges and of the need to change the pattern of growth. A more balanced approach can boost social welfare by using its savings more productively. It would mitigate the return of the unsustainable current account surpluses that helped feed the current crisis. Of course, the current economic downturn is likely to reduce developing Asia\u2019s current account surplus to some extent. However, the slow projected pace of surplus reduction over the next few years suggests that rebalancing the region\u2019s growth or, equivalently, the reduction of the region\u2019s excessive dependence on external demand, will not happen automatically. Instead, a wide range of government policies, ranging from boosting domestic consumption to promoting more competitive domestic markets, will be required to facilitate the transition of the region to a more balanced growth path. Governments can play a major role in influencing the saving and consumption behaviour of households, particularly through provision of education, health care and pensions. Reducing uncertainties in these areas could substantially diminish the strong precautionary saving motive among households and give them the confidence to raise their consumption. The focus should be on structural reforms that would stimulate a more permanent increase and make GDP growth more balanced over the medium term, rather than look for short-term fixes for increasing private consumption. 87 Some policies that would contribute to such rebalancing include: \u2022\ufffd Fiscal stimulus to boost domestic consumption and expanding health, education and pension systems, so as to reduce incentives for precautionary household savings. \u2022\ufffd Government investments in public infrastructure (like roads and ports) and social infrastructure (education) will raise returns to private investment. \u2022\ufffd Price and tax measures to support rural development and agriculture , to adjust the relative attractiveness of tradable over non tradable sectors and to redirect patterns of consumption and production. \u2022\ufffd Financial development based on greater financial inclusion needs to be accelerated. \u2022\ufffd More emphasis on R&D that develops new green technologies and is appropriate to the specific level of development of the country concerned and its own constraints and context. 7.4. Supporting agriculture and promoting faster rural development During the 1990s, the share of government spending on agriculture declined sharply throughout the region, with the exception of some countries such as Sri Lanka and Vietnam. This trend will have to be reversed.

In addition, relative price movements (the inter-sectoral terms of trade) and institutional changes such as land reforms or allowing peasant producers greater autonomy (as in the case of China) can be important. Fortunately, the importance of agricultural growth and rural employment programmes are being increasingly recognised. In India, the share of government spending on agriculture increased after 2004, and consequently, agricultural growth \u2013 with the benefit of some good monsoons \u2013 also accelerated from 2 % per annum during 2000-04 to 4 % during 2005-08. Rural development expenditure also increased, in particular through the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NRGES) which is discussed in more detail below.

Ensuring food security through \u2022\ufffd increases in agricultural productivity, changes in cropping patterns, and sustaining the viability of cultivation.

Most of these schemes, even when available in developing countries, are accessible only to formally employed workers. Since such workers constitute a small proportion of the total workforce in most Asia-Pacific developing countries, the coverage of these schemes tends to be limited. Even in China, social insurance was until recently restricted to the urban population and it is only recently that the government making a concerted effort to offer it to migrants and to the rural population. In sum, in most countries available social insurance largely bypasses the informal and rural sectors where most of the workers and much of the poor are present. The countries where this is less true are the developed countries such as Japan and the Republic of Korea, and some Central Asian countries (Chart 18). 89 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Japan Korea Mongolia Cook Islands Kyrgyzstan Azerbaijan Kazahkstan Sri Lanka Uzbekistan Viet Nam Indonesia Armenia Tajikistan Malaysia PRC ASIA India Philippines Nauru Marshall Islands Bangladesh Maldives Lao PDR Nepal Cambodia Tuvalu Bhutan Fiji Islands Vanuatu Tonga Pakistan Papua New Guinea Chart 18: Coverage of Social Protection Source: ADB (2008) A major concern in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "331ed280-55cd-4202-b353-8fbfa03e291e": {"__data__": {"id_": "331ed280-55cd-4202-b353-8fbfa03e291e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Global Financial Crisis and the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0a4375fcdabb3314d1232cae9e0e55b4f6df26dbc8b3ef15829c188ae57a319e"}}, "hash": "0a4375fcdabb3314d1232cae9e0e55b4f6df26dbc8b3ef15829c188ae57a319e", "text": "the region is that the coverage of basic social protection programmes is very low (Chart 18). For example, for the region as a whole, only 30% of the elderly receive pensions, and only 20% of the unemployed and underemployed have access to labour market programmes, such as unemployment benefits, training or public works programmes, including work-for-food programmes. Health care has emerged as one of the biggest issues: only 20 % of the population has access to health care assistance, and Asia has the highest rates of out-of-pocket health care expenditure in the world. The financial and economic crises in the 1990s highlighted the importance of effective social policies to cushion the impact of adverse economic developments. Already, as has been noted above, the case studies show that some features observed in earlier crises are already emerging within developing Asia: significant increases in the proportion of people in extreme poverty and without jobs or access to essential services, as well as rising rates of malnutrition and school dropouts among poor children. These conditions tend to aggravate chronic poverty and may lead to irreversible losses in human capital among the poor and vulnerable, undermining an economy\u2019s ability to sustain growth. Moreover the case studies also show that many of the affected are not adequately protected by any of the social assistance and insurance schemes in place. Sound information and monitoring and evaluation systems are important for an effective social policy response. The information problems are compounded in a crisis, in which it is hard to know where the short-term impacts are greatest and how well policy responses are working. Various types of data are needed, including household and enterprise surveys and data on public spending. 90 At the same time, countries need urgent action to ensure that the most vulnerable are protected in the short-term while they are putting the global economy back on the path to economically, socially and environmentally sustainable growth. However, the need for a fast response means that adapting existing programmes may be more effective than creating new ones. In countries hard hit by the crisis, there is a strong case for the expansion of appropriate forms of social protection to minimise the impact on the poor. However, short-term action must be consistent with longer-term structural reforms. Therefore governments may need to provide short- term relief by extending unemployment benefits and subsidising employment in certain sectors or for certain groups. Moreover care has to be taken not to create an over-dependence on benefits which would persist even after economic recovery. They need to be temporary and targeted. Clearly Asian economies need to look for home grown solutions that build on Asian conditions such as the existence of large informal sectors, large working poor, high prevalence of malnutrition, high vulnerability to extreme poverty, and on traditions such as self reliance and family orientation. Solutions need to minimise equity-efficiency tradeoffs and to fit changing Asian conditions, for example rapid urbanization, increasing urban poverty, aging population, and a significant proportion of the population faces the risk of becoming poor due to the financial/economic crisis. The experience with social protection schemes after the Asian crisis has already provided some lessons. Thus, it is better to expand and modify if needed, established safety net programmes rather than to create new ones; it is important to protect pro- poor spending, not only on health and education, but also relevant infrastructure; self-targeted schemes (such as those based on work) are more effective than other attempts at targeting. There is a need for governments to prioritise social protection and pro-poor expenditures. In the 1990s many Asian governments attempted to protect social sector expenditure by cutting investment in rural development and this resulted in slower agricultural growth. But maintaining investment in agriculture and rural infrastructure can also be pro-poor. It is important to remember that social policy and social protection are not just welfare or redistributive measures; they are also critical parts of an overall development strategy and can contribute to macroeconomic stabilisation by providing automatic buffers against shocks, as well as to future growth by improving the potential for productivity increases. The following principles should guide the design and implementation of social safety net instruments: (1) social safety nets should be in place before a crisis occurs since they can address the needs of the poor in good economic times and be adaptable to combat the effects of crisis; (2) pre-crisis planning is essential to effectively address the social effects of crises and includes the availability of reliable and timely information on the poor and frequent evaluation of safety net programmes; and (3) countries", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c704957a-57d1-46bf-896d-0d38c743fa76": {"__data__": {"id_": "c704957a-57d1-46bf-896d-0d38c743fa76", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Global Financial Crisis and the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aad2ce00690a2e73254f860fc3d202747c9cd4ea072547545e668ebffbd20400"}, "3": {"node_id": "08490b45-4ec4-4a46-9e7d-a6a3238f0870", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "843f147703c1573af147130cf59fb47c498b58fa15cba8913321ea9db7e9b285"}}, "hash": "27c430f9ef683f4dbe311a57822d41765b4269fbf366899e638815f5948ada21", "text": "can select from a wide range of available instruments depending on their administrative capacity and target populations. Social safety nets have been designed with various objectives. Depending on these objectives they can be classified into income transfers through cash, food related transfer programmes, prices subsidies, human capital related social safety nets, public works programmes, and micro credit and informal insurance programmes. Conditional Cash Transfers Conditional Cash Tranfers (CCT) programmes are a new and innovative approach to basic social assistance. They provide money to poor families contingent upon certain behaviour changes, such as sending children to school or bringing them to health centres on a 91 regular basis. Cash transfer programmes could be based on employment generation or a universal programme that transfers some income to poor households, which can be used to spend on basic needs. Cash transfer programmes could be used for emergency purposes in periods of crisis or could be used as short- or medium term poverty alleviation programme. Almost all CCTs have tried to target their benefits rather narrowly to the poor through a combination of geographic and household targeting (mostly via proxy means testing). Moreover, many programmes use community-based targeting or community vetting of eligibility lists to increase transparency. CCTs are proven versatile programmes, which largely explain why they have become so popular worldwide. Virtually every country in Latin America has such a programme. The largest CCTs, such as Brazil\u2019s Bolsa Fam\u00edlia and Mexico\u2019s Oportunidades (initially called as PROGRESA) cover millions of households. (Both these cases are iconic cases of CCTs). In Asia, CCTs have been used to reduce gender disparities in education\u2014some only secondary (Bangladesh\u2019s Female Secondary School Assistance Programme [FSSAP], Cambodia\u2019s Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction [JFPR], and Cambodia Education Sector Support Project [CESSP]), and occasionally both (Indonesia\u2019s Jaring Pengamanan Sosial [JPS] programme). The genesis of these programmes is rather varied. In Bangladesh, the FSSAP was part of a strategy to close the gender gap in education. In Indonesia, the JPS programme was instituted following the Asian financial crisis to prevent students from dropping out. Recent CCT pilot programmes or proposed programmes in India, Philippines and Pakistan also focused on education. CCTs generally have been successful in reducing poverty and encouraging parents to invest in the health and education of their children. CCTs, by and large, have increased consumption levels among the poor. As a result, they have resulted in sometimes substantial reductions in poverty among beneficiaries\u2014especially when the transfer has been generous, well targeted, and structured in a way that does not discourage recipients from taking other actions to escape poverty. In many countries, school enrolment has increased among CCT beneficiaries\u2014especially among the poorest children, whose enrolment rates at the outset were the lowest. CCT beneficiaries also are more likely to have visited health providers for preventive checkups, to have had their children weighed and measured, and to have completed a schedule of immunizations. These are important accomplishments. This is why CCT programmes are increasingly perceived as being \u201ca magic bullet in development.\u201d However, like all so- called magic bullets, they should not be overestimated. CCTs vary a great deal in scope. Some programmes are nationwide, others are niche programmes that serve a regional or narrow target population, and yet others are small-scale pilot efforts. In terms of absolute coverage, they range from 11 million families (Brazil) to pilot programmes with a few thousand families. In terms of relative coverage, they range from approximately 40 % of the population (Ecuador) to about 20 % (Brazil, Mexico) to 1 % (Cambodia). Even if a country can afford a CCT programme, it is sometimes argued that, relative to other types of social safety nets, they are expensive to operate. Closer scrutiny, however, shows a different picture. The costs range from about 0.50 % of gross domestic product (GDP) in such countries as Brazil, Ecuador, and Mexico to 0.08 % of GDP (Chile). The generosity of benefits ranges from 20 % of mean household consumption in Mexico, to 4 % in Honduras, and to even less for programmes in Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Pakistan.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "08490b45-4ec4-4a46-9e7d-a6a3238f0870": {"__data__": {"id_": "08490b45-4ec4-4a46-9e7d-a6a3238f0870", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Global Financial Crisis and the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aad2ce00690a2e73254f860fc3d202747c9cd4ea072547545e668ebffbd20400"}, "2": {"node_id": "c704957a-57d1-46bf-896d-0d38c743fa76", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "27c430f9ef683f4dbe311a57822d41765b4269fbf366899e638815f5948ada21"}}, "hash": "843f147703c1573af147130cf59fb47c498b58fa15cba8913321ea9db7e9b285", "text": "92 National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme The National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) in India, which is a demand-driven scheme based on a legal guarantee for employment NREGS, was launched on February 2, 2006, driven by a law passed in the previous year.

If employment is not provided within 15 days, the applicant is entitled to unemployment allowance. The scheme aims to provide work on labour-intensive projects focusing on rural infrastructure. A key feature is that the scheme is to be implemented through local governments, unlike earlier schemes that were implemented by the central or state governments. In the first phase, it covered 200 most backward districts; in the second phase, it has been expanded to 330 districts. Now it has been formally extended to all 596 rural districts in India with budgetary provision of around 0.6 % of GDP. The scheme, which is still in it\u2019s early stages, has received mixed reviews so far but has been successful in some important ways. Thus far, the official records suggest that more than 30 million households have been provided some employment, and nearly 1.2 billion person days of employment have been generated. The enhanced wage earnings have led to a strengthening of the livelihood resource base of the rural poor in India, have reduced distress migration, and have become an extremely important buffer against both the employment shocks generated by the economic crisis (as migrant workers returned home to their villages) and against the drought that has swept across large parts of rural India in the summer of 2009. In the past two years, nearly 70 % of funds utilized were in the form of wages paid to labourers, and the scheme has been far more effective in generating work per rupee spent than earlier public works programmes. Self targeting in nature, the programme has significantly higher work participation of marginalised groups like Scheduled Castes (30 %), Scheduled Tribes (22 %), and women (52 %). Thus far, more than 2.3 million works have been undertaken, of around half were for water conservation, 15 % were for rural connectivity and 12 % were for land development. The Central Government has been encouraging the State Governments to make wage payment through bank and post office accounts of wage seekers, and nearly 50 million NREGA bank and post office accounts have been opened to disburse wages. The NREGA workers are also being encouraged to obtain insurance under Jan Shri Bima Yojana. (Data from NREGA website www.nrega.nic.in accessed on 20 September 2009.) However, concerns about corruption have been raised. Also, implementation has been found to be highly variable across and within states and even districts. There have been implementation problems such as misuse of programme funds, ghost workers, and underpayment of wages. This is scarcely surprising, given the past experience with public spending in India, but the NREGA rules and guidelines do specify a greater degree of transparency and public accountability than in other schemes. Other concerns about the effectiveness of this spending have been raised. First, as with most workfare programmes, it is unclear how large the economic return from the projects undertaken (which are supposed to focus on roads and agricultural infrastructure) will be. Second, implementing such a large programme entails significant administrative burdens, and demands a level of efficiency and accountability that previous programmes have largely failed to achieve. 93 In principle, the NREGS could make a significant contribution to reducing rural unemployment and poverty. Research suggests that the lean season rural poverty rate could be reduced by 10\u201315 percentage points, with poorer households benefiting more than others. More fundamentally, the NREGS has the potential to transform rural economic and social relations at many levels. It is this capacity to engender change that is at once a source of strength and a weakness for the implementation of the programme. This is because it unleashes forces in the rural economy, society and polity which necessarily threaten the status quo and therefore also those who benefit from it, and so it is precisely where it is most needed that there is likely to be the most resistance to effective implementation. In fact, the huge potential of the NREGS has already been evident particularly in the enthusiastic response of local people, landless and marginal farmers and women workers in particular, wherever information about the programme has been properly disseminated. But there is also no doubt that this enormous potential is still incipient and requires to be substantially supported in many different ways. This is because the way that the NREGA has been framed, and the desired mode of implementation, amount to no less than asking for a social and political revolution.

The NREGS is therefore completely different in conception from earlier government employment schemes since it treats employment as a right and the programme is intended to be demand- driven. Furthermore, the Act and Guidelines anticipate very substantial participation of the local people in the planning and monitoring of the specific schemes, to a degree which has not been at all common. The very notion of employment as a right of citizens (even if it is limited to 100 days per household in the Act); of the obligation of the government to meet the demand for work within a specified time period, and to have developed a shelf of public works that can be drawn upon to meet this demand; of the local elected government participation in planning and monitoring; and the provision for social audit, are all very new concepts. For this to work, it requires, at the minimum, two things: the ability and willingness of the local government and locally elected governments to plan works and run the programme effectively; and the dissemination about the programme and its guidelines to local people who can make use of it to register, demand work and run social audits. It should be evident that neither of these is very easy to attain, especially very quickly, and they require both much more capacity building and administrative support at local government levels, as well as significant mobilisation among the people who may be workers under the scheme. Obviously, all this will take time to permeate down to the local levels. So to start with, it is only to be expected that there will be an uneven record of implementation as well as the presence of a large number of problems that require correction. There are bound to be difficulties and time lags in making local officials and others responsive to this very different approach. And of course, the NREGS necessarily challenges the prevailing power structures, in some cases quite substantially. Therefore attempts to oppose or subvert the correct and full implementation of the scheme in rural areas are only to be expected. Nevertheless, the extent to which the scheme is being implemented with even partial success in many parts of the country, including some very backward pockets, is already a source of optimism. Close monitoring and evaluation, as well as greater social mobilisation, will all be critical to ensure the programme\u2019s success. It is affecting the labour market in some parts of the country quite significantly. It has raised the 94 The surplus agricultural region of Punjab is getting much less labour from Bihar and is shifting to greater mechanisation as more and more labour stays back in rural Bihar during the lean season. reservation wage by 10-15% in some areas and changed seasonal migration patterns to some extent. For example, the surplus agricultural region of Punjab is getting much less labour from Bihar and is shifting to greater mechanisation as more and more labour stays back in rural Bihar during the lean season. Similarly large construction projects across India are finding that costs of migrant labour have increased because rural workers are more able to find some gainful employment during the lean season. These trends may actually be seen as positive in terms of contributing to a wage-led recovery especially in rural India. More recently some people have accused NREGS of stoking inflation because it injects more purchasing power in rural areas but with no corresponding improvement in productivity, but it should be noted that the type of works that are typically undertaken (such as minor irrigation and water harvesting, soil improvement, etc.) are likely to improve land productivity with a lag, while other activities such as road building improve rural infrastructure and therefore supply and transport linkages. Food-for-Work Programmes The economic rationale for the food- for-fork programme, which uses food as a wage good in attracting labour for implementing the public works programme, comes from surplus and ready availability of food in rural areas that can be purchased by the implementing agency and cost effectively distributed by the public works programme. However, if the programme is not properly designed it can attract a wide range of beneficiaries who may not be entitled to food. Yet, the quality of food provided through the public works programme as wage may be better than the quality of food available in the open market. However, the food-for-work programmes can target the beneficiaries effectively by providing geographical targeting approaches and attracting labourers during the lean season of crop cultivation and by providing low quality food as wage", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5484ef86-8776-448e-bf78-3340ae18baf5": {"__data__": {"id_": "5484ef86-8776-448e-bf78-3340ae18baf5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Global Financial Crisis and the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "033c0dff981e54ce11a7f85b557eb4bd1a60aaf0c5e7fb0c0aab84bf1c2019ea"}}, "hash": "033c0dff981e54ce11a7f85b557eb4bd1a60aaf0c5e7fb0c0aab84bf1c2019ea", "text": "so that only labourers in real need of food will participate in the programme. Food security The evident and growing problems of food insecurity in the region were noted in Chapter 5 of this study, and these problems have been compounded by the recent rise in food prices in most countries. It is therefore not surprising that many existing safety net programmes in Asia use food distribution as a mechanism to transfer resources to poor and vulnerable sections of society. It is evident that genuine food security among a population requires a wide range of features all or many of which are associated with the need for some public intervention. Ensuring adequate supplies of food requires increases in agricultural productivity, possibly changes in cropping patterns, and certainly the sustained viability of cultivation, all of would be necessary at both local and national levels. Making sure that food can be accessed by all the people requires that they have the purchasing power to buy the necessary food, which in turn means that employment, remuneration and livelihood issues are important. Social discrimination and exclusion still play unfortunately large roles in determining both livelihood and access to food by different social categories, and this too needs to be reckoned with. Malnourishment is closely linked to poor sanitation and other unhealthy practices, so that the provision of clean drinking water, sanitation and access to other basic amenities, as well as knowledge about correct or desirable eating habits, are all necessary. It is important for governments to be aware of the need for a multi-pronged approach to the problem that has to extend beyond food distribution to its production and patterns of consumption, so as to eventually ensure genuine food security. Several challenges confront food distribution programmes. One of the most obvious is the difficulty inherent in targeting the most deserving or hungry sections of the population. There are many reasons 95 Programmes of public food distribution, across societies, have been those that have gone in for universal or near universal access. This provides economies of scale; it reduces the transaction costs and administrative hassles involved in ascertaining the target group and making sure it reaches them; it allows for better public provision because even the better-off groups with more political voice have a stake in making sure it works well; it generates greater stability in government plans for ensuring food production and procurement. why targeted schemes are unlikely to work. There are the well known errors inherent in targeting, of unjustified exclusion of the genuinely poor and unwarranted inclusion of the non-poor. These are not simply mistakes that can occur in any administrative scheme, they are inbuilt into systems that try to provide scarce goods to one section of any population. In hierarchical and discriminatory societies, where social and economic power is unequally distributed, it is often the case that making a scarce good (cheap food) supposedly available only to the poor is one of the easiest ways to reduce their access. Further, there tend to be substantial differences between food insecurity and income poverty. In India, for example, the proportion of the population that is nutritionally deprived is significantly larger than the \u201cpoor\u201d population, and the two are not completely overlapping categories either. To deal with food insecurity in an effective manner, it is counterproductive to base public food provision on a predefined group of the \u201cpoor\u201d, which would deprive a large number of others who are also food-insecure. Part of the reason for this relates to the third problem, the absence of any notion of dynamics in a rigid law that defines \u201cpoor\u201d and \u201cvulnerable\u201d households in a static sense and changes the group only at infrequent intervals. Households \u2013 and people within them \u2013 can fall in or out of poverty, however defined, because of changing material circumstances. Similarly they can also go from being food-secure to food-insecure in a short time. The reasons can vary: crop failures, sharp rises in the price of food, employment collapses, health issues that divert household spending, the accumulation of debt, and so on. Monitoring each and every household on a regular basis to check whether any of these or other features has caused it to become food-insecure is not just administratively difficult, it is actually impossible. This is why most successful programmes of public food distribution, across societies, have been those that have gone in for universal or near universal access. This provides economies of scale; it reduces the transaction costs and administrative hassles involved in ascertaining the target group and making sure it reaches them; it allows for better public provision", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5fe9e986-2fda-4b48-bf44-cd0d113de0c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "5fe9e986-2fda-4b48-bf44-cd0d113de0c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Global Financial Crisis and the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ae13788a90f54762fc0b6ab4b5399ab5e76ae75a6649555772a61ddd32f426ff"}}, "hash": "ae13788a90f54762fc0b6ab4b5399ab5e76ae75a6649555772a61ddd32f426ff", "text": "because even the better off groups with more political voice have a stake in making sure it works well; it generates greater stability in government plans for ensuring food production and procurement. However, universal schemes are obviously more expensive overall and may be difficult to afford by governments that are already in fiscal difficulties. Health Insurance Countries such as China, Indonesia and Thailand are experimenting with multiple approaches to expanding health coverage. One model that seems to be working is Thailand\u2019s universal coverage \u201c30 baht\u2019 scheme, which has sharply increased health utilization rates among the poor while reducing out of pocket spending. The success was made possible through prior investments in health care infrastructure (for example, every rural sub-district has a staffed health centre). Old Age Security The political demand for effective pension coverage is likely to grow as population aging proceeds. Well managed and regulated pension funds can help fill this gap, contribute to the development of capital markets and indirectly help sustain growth rates needed to keep up with a historically unprecedented aging process. Expansion to the informal sector needs to be done in a measured way, for example through voluntary participation in well regulated defined contribution schemes, as recently proposed in India, Thailand and Vietnam. In selecting the appropriate instruments, governments should ensure that the measures: (i) provide adequate protection to the poor; (ii) promote efficient targeting; (iii) avoid creating a culture of dependency among recipients by limiting the size and 96 duration of benefits; (iv) are consistent with economic incentives and overall targets of fiscal and macroeconomic policy; and (v) encourage transparency and accountability in the design and implementation of programmes and in the use of resources. Can Asia afford social protection? Developing Asia spends less as a share of GDP on social protection than other regions. In many countries the main social safety net is via product subsidies (e.g. on fuel and rice), and is often fragmented among many schemes. In India and Thailand, for example, a multiplicity of small schemes each reaches only a small number of beneficiaries, providing meagre benefits and leaving gaps and unmet needs. Countries can therefore make some headway by consolidating multiple schemes into a more coherent programme. There is also significant scope for moving from product subsidies to more targeted and equitable cash transfer schemes. For instance, Indonesia and Egypt spent 5 % of their gross domestic product (GDP) in 2005 and 8 % of GDP in 2004 on energy subsidies. Another example is the bailouts of insolvent contributory pension funds. In Brazil, the government spends 3.7 % of GDP to cover the deficit in the main federal pension programmes, which deliver more than 50 % of their benefits to the richest 20 % of the population. On the other hand, Brazil\u2019s Bolsa Familia, covering the poorest 20 % of the population, cost about 0.4 % of GDP in 2007, which is only one tenth of the federal pension programmes. During the initial period of implementation, CCT programmes can be quite expensive to administer. Much of the budget is spent on undertaking targeting of transfers and monitoring the recipients\u2019 actions. However, administrative costs will spread over the implementation of the programmes, and their ratio to total transfers will fall rapidly over the years.

Spending on social protection programmes in Korea and Thailand rose by 1 percentage point of GDP and by almost 4 percentage points in Indonesia during 1998-99. The increased spending was achieved by relaxing the initial fiscal targets in response to the assessments of the social impacts of the crisis as well as the increase in financial support made available by international financial institutions. 7.6.

Six broad areas of public intervention create an agenda for a new Asian century in which the legitimate aspirations of the majority of Asian citizens can be met: Rebalance Asian growth, from a focus 1. on export-led to more regional and domestic demand expansion. Make the economic growth process more 2. inclusive and employment intensive: direct resources to the sectors in which the poor work (such as agriculture and informal activities), areas in which they live (relatively backward regions), factors of production which they possess (unskilled labour) and outputs which they consume (such as food). Re-orient growth in Asia in cleaner 3. and greener directions: shift from carbon-based (coal and oil) growth to solar, nuclear and renewable energy; emphasise cleaner transport systems and better urban planning and management, protecting and nurturing the regions\u2019 dwindling water and other natural resources, and mitigating the effects and adapting to the possibilities of climate change-induced natural disasters. Provide much better social protection, 4. with more funding, wider coverage and consolidation, more health spending and more robust and extensive social insurance programmes including pensions and unemployment insurance. Improve financial sector performance 5. while ensuring financial stability, by emphasising financial inclusion and deepening. Expand Asian trade integration and 6. monetary and financial co-ordination. To conclude, this study has provided a broad summary of the impacts as well as challenges Asia has faced in dealing with the global financial/economic crisis and the preceding fuel and food price shocks. It has shown that the initially Asia was affected severely from the crisis. Trade and financial flows collapsed in almost all countries. Output contracted more severely in many Asian economies than even those nations at the epicentre of the crisis. But starting from the mid-2009, the region is recovering fast. Since the rest of global economy is expected to recover only slowly, unlike the Asian crisis in late 1990s, this time Asia cannot rely on an export-led recovery. Moreover, the export led growth strategy followed in much of Asia created its own limitations as it led to rising inequality, huge savings and lowered investment rates. The resulting surpluses were translated into massive accumulation of reserves and a perverse effect of transferring these to the developed world as Asia\u2019s weak financial systems were unable to transfer these funds into investment. Instead they fuelled overconsumption in the US but which was eventually unsustainable. Weak regulatory systems and an accommodating monetary policy in the US and Europe allowed the resulting bubble to become bigger and bigger and eventually burst, sending the world economy into a huge crisis which is still unwinding. As the world now sits on a knife-edge it is an opportunity to rethink where Asia is headed. Going back to the growth model of the last two 98 decades is tempting to some as they feel it brought Asia the dynamic momentum for rapid growth and signs of prosperity. Asia re-emerged from almost two centuries of gloom and decline and began to emerge as a major growth centre in the world economy. But as we have shown in this paper the crisis is also an opportunity for many countries in Asia to re-orient their growth and development strategy. Asia cannot simply reset to 2007 and continue on the same path even if it wanted to because the global imbalances created by that growth strategy cannot continue. The looming threat of global warming (and associated natural disasters ) provides another major impetus to rethink and rebase Asia\u2019s growth model. Asia must grow rapidly in order to provide a better life to the millions of poor people but it must also do so with a much lower carbon trajectory. The witnessed was a warning of the impending climate change crisis because it signalled that the resources needed to maintain that growth path were too difficult to handle. In all of this Asia stands to lose if it does not change as it still has the largest number of poor people in the world who can ill afford even a small reduction in their incomes. For Asia the need to change is a matter not just of jobs and fiscal balances it is a matter of sheer survival. The stakes are too high not to make the change to a green and more inclusive growth model. In addition to facing a series of global crises (food, fuel and financial crises) in the last two years, Asia also witnessed a series of natural disasters", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "828412cb-7b7c-43a7-a0c8-a44e31d9aa33": {"__data__": {"id_": "828412cb-7b7c-43a7-a0c8-a44e31d9aa33", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Global Financial Crisis and the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e0de16a13244dd4885ecf91fd17d4b9ede8357b71b388b4a3660f7d3bcba61bd"}, "3": {"node_id": "50cfb339-540d-4c79-aadb-b439520fcf8e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/global-financial-crisis-and-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "772bd9d4d78acec652079babe496c3f32dbd5f60ae87dc9a241276de763793b7"}}, "hash": "e0736e76e70807749f2f1063c73a13bc1dbb310238be0b432c357803802850db", "text": "starting from Asian tsunami in December 2004 to a more recent (September/October 2009) earthquake/tsunami/floods in India, Indonesia, Philippines, Samoa, Tonga and Vietnam.

Trade Agreements in Asia Trends, Characteristics, and Implications for Human Development Introduction Since January 1995, about 130 Free Trade Agreements (FTA) have been notified to the World Trade Organization (WTO). There are two facets to this proliferation: on the one hand, the establishment of the WTO (and its Single Undertaking) has facilitated the expansion of FTAs by setting common trade obligations, particularly disciplines on non-tariff measures; on the other, setbacks in advancing the multilateral agenda have created new outlets for consideration of bilateral and regional options. Asia-Pacific has been the latest region to catch up with the trend, and its countries are exerting renewed efforts to both deepen and expand regional and sub-regional economic integration, as reflected by a remarkable scale of negotiating activity under way. In addition to liberalising most trade in goods and providing improved access for services, regional and bilateral free trade agreements can be \u201cWTO-plus,\u201d1 involving a higher degree of obligation than provided in multilateral trade agreements. Thus, while some FTAs can constitute a step toward greater regional integration in Asia-Pacific, others may frustrate such an effort or even undermine WTO rights of concerned parties. Further, many governments have yet to fully reckon with the development implications of the resurgence of an overt political element in bilateral trade relations. Because there are countries in Asia-Pacific engaged in such negotiations, it is essential that the implications of various models of FTAs with diverse trading partners are well-grasped. For example, qualitative differences in scope, intent and implications exist between South-South FTAs and North-South FTAs, all warranting greater understanding. 1 The term \u201cWTO-plus\u201d has become common usage to describe provisions in FTAs that go beyond WTO obligations. By definition, almost all FTAs would be WTO-plus in providing freer access for goods (and services) than offered under GATT MFN tariff schedules and GATS schedules of commitments. Most WTO agreements also provide members with rights to take specific actions in pursuit of development objectives; provisions in FTAs that erode these rights could be termed \u201cWTO-minus.\u201d 9 This Paper is divided into four main parts. Parts I, II and III examine this phenomenon of FTA proliferation and the underlying forces and motivations of key players at work. Part IV builds on the analysis to address the impact of the FTA explosion on human development policy choices in key areas such as agriculture, textiles, rules of origin, intellectual property, trade in services, and investment. 10 | THE GREAT MAZE: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia Trends, Characteristics, and Implications for Human Development PART I RULES OF THE GAME The increase in the negotiation of FTAs reflects renewed dynamism in economic integration among developing countries, as well as a \u201cnew generation\u201d of North-South FTAs with important implications for the multilateral trading system. Since 1995 the number of notifications of free trade agreements2 to the WTO has dramatically increased \u2013 now, only one of its members is not party to at least one FTA. More than 220 regional FTAs have been notified to the GATT/WTO (including the period prior to 1995), reflecting a new dynamism in regional economic integration efforts among developing countries. In particular, a noteworthy trend has been the rapid extension of FTAs between developed and developing countries. While developed countries derive economic benefits, including specific sectoral interests, from participation in North-South FTAs, their interest could often be non-trade-related, including such key issues as: i) concerns related to long-term energy security; ii) desire to reward developing countries for supporting global foreign policy objectives; and iii) mitigating pressures for migration by lifting living standards in poorer, neighbouring countries (Abugattas Majluf 2004).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "981d47e6-3541-4ad9-b1dc-c7a613bb5130": {"__data__": {"id_": "981d47e6-3541-4ad9-b1dc-c7a613bb5130", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Great Maze: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "290987ed9fdc1cc4df76ca2902f8e8134699b057a79daefcd89b552a16dd5fed"}, "2": {"node_id": "ce36ca47-61b6-4522-b2ff-6ca511975348", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c6abc635412c3f71c18715308bee48b5de0489465f7db186cd3d6b02edb72d7b"}}, "hash": "cfe6eeef3947413eb5c0d6ff6b69db7097e79c24765202d6aa2a9e565f37b981", "text": "Another objective of developed countries for their participation in North-South FTAs is to expand and modify the trade agenda beyond 2 This paper addresses trade agreements that are covered by Article XXIV of GATT 1994 or Article V of GATS (see Appendix).

Because customs unions have not been attempted by Asia-Pacific countries, this Paper uses the term FTA regardless of whether there is sub-regional, regional, inter-regional, plurilateral or bilateral membership. 11 what has currently been agreed to in the WTO. The practice of setting precedents \u2013 say, on environmental standards, investment rules and TRIPS-plus disciplines \u2013 that can then be reintroduced in the WTO is becoming prominent. Major trading powers also are attempting to bind smaller trading partners to commitments that consolidate their respective positions on issues where they find themselves in opposition in multilateral negotiations. Described as \u201cthird-generation agreements,\u201d they extend into the realm of domestic policies covering, inter alia, sanitary measures, trade facilitation, liberalisation of trade in services, investment and competition disciplines, intellectual property rights and Government procurement. These FTAs are transforming the traditional relationship based on unilateral preferences for trade in goods to developing countries into reciprocal agreements encompassing deep integration measures. The Seattle and Canc\u00fan Ministerial Conferences of the WTO also have demonstrated the power of developing countries acting in groups, so the bilateral FTA approach can be interpreted as a partial attempt to shift the rule-making process to the regional and bilateral stages. The question then arises: Why do so many developing countries appear eager to enter into asymmetric North-South FTAs? This is curious, especially when much of their trade in manufactured goods enters rich- country markets duty-free under the unilateral preferences of the GSP. Bound MFN tariff rates in the OECD countries are quite low and have been eliminated in many sectors of interest to developing countries. The current NAMA negotiations in the Doha Round are aiming at an extension of sectoral free trade to a longer list of such products.3 Thus, the marginal gain from their elimination is minimal, while bound rates 3 Bicycles, chemicals, electronics/electrical equipment, fish, forest products, gems and jewellery, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment, raw materials and sporting have been identified as candidates for sectoral free trade, while consideration is being given to textiles and apparel, and automobiles and auto-parts. See Report of NAMA Chairman to TNC, WTO document Job (05) 298, 26 November 2005. 12 | THE GREAT MAZE: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia Trends, Characteristics, and Implications for Human Development in the developing countries are often considerably higher. The burden of tariff liberalisation in North-South FTAs then weighs disproportionately on the developing countries.4 Indeed, while trade among FTA partners makes up an estimated 40 percent of world trade, a much smaller amount actually benefits from preferences (World Bank 2005, 41). By contrast, FTAs among developing countries (South-South) may result in meaningful tariff reductions and substantial margins of preference.5 Sectoral interests in developing countries may extract significant advantages from the elimination of duties on products not covered by preference where tariffs are substantial, such as apparel, footwear and agriculture. However, duty-free entry on textiles and clothing may be subject to complicated rules of origin, while sensitive agriculture products of export interest to poor countries may be excluded or subject to stringent sanitary regulations. Furthermore, FTAs do not establish disciplines on the agriculture subsidies in the major developed countries, exposing farmers in the developing partner to unfair competition. In services, developing countries generally do not have the competitive strengths to take advantage of liberalisation in services trade, particularly because not many new opportunities are provided for the movement of persons. Some developing countries expect that North-South FTAs could result in increasing inflows of FDI, but no convincing evidence exists that FTAs with developed countries increase investment flows to developing countries generally. Most developing countries appear to be motivated by the \u201cfear of exclusion\u201d and uncertainty over the future of unilateral preferences. Thus, there can be advantages in being the \u201cfirst mover.\u201d The first few 4 For example, 32 percent of tariff lines in the United States MFN tariff are duty-free and 45 percent at rates of 3 percent or less (i.e., at a level where it is often more profitable for enterprises to pay the MFN tariff than assume the costs involved in satisfying the rules of origin and related administrative procedures). 5 For example, only 1 percent of India\u2019s MFN tariff lines are duty-free.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bcc779c0-0f93-4d5a-a19c-9b1c83069d0f": {"__data__": {"id_": "bcc779c0-0f93-4d5a-a19c-9b1c83069d0f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Great Maze: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b16353dda31560fe9c96f28ac58688e8fc06e256d34edc477476e54248ce2471"}, "2": {"node_id": "397f3008-d638-4dea-a6be-dccc7e8d8a94", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ff6265866d980c1ff692563d6196183cd2b35e29884e919017389eca26e4517f"}}, "hash": "045ebc6bd360eb75cabb7545f49ee47677d14f528fe208177bc2bc7e872a565c", "text": "13 countries to establish FTAs with economically significant economies (i.e., Japan and the United States) ensures these countries are not discriminated against if the developed partner later enters into FTAs with \u201ccompetitors.\u201d Moreover, precedents set", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3ac85803-4184-4edc-a746-c0f8fdab0354": {"__data__": {"id_": "3ac85803-4184-4edc-a746-c0f8fdab0354", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Great Maze: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "04b3e92fb86868e5de0ddf9afd8a4e4285abb2ead604afc2aabfef8639afe5e2"}, "3": {"node_id": "c1b6a35f-a4bd-4595-9803-c54e3c694b1b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2a7f876a0d962f0b571b0f515b0a5ab5deef94de9afde541e733d387160e0cc4"}}, "hash": "a738f80027266f2846732116bfc2113d168e5d10f682c3ae20560732b94fc82d", "text": "with any \u201cfirst mover\u201d may create difficulties for latecomers that are less developed or have different economic and social structures. When developed countries negotiate FTAs on the basis of a \u201ctemplate\u201d agreement, negotiations have tended to centre on securing only minor departures from such models to take into account specific interests of the developing-country partner. However, recent experience is showing a greater awareness on the part of developing countries on the need to develop their own models, or at least to insist on major departures.6 This fear of exclusion is most acute at the sectoral level when FTAs provide significant margins of preference to competitors. The industries that stand to be affected consider their very survival threatened and exert heavy political pressure to pursue the FTA route. Impact on such sectors, particularly those subject to high tariffs, is pressing and urgent, while negative consequences for public health, economic development and national sovereignty in general only become apparent over the longer term. Economists have long been concerned with the welfare implications of a group of countries forming exclusive clubs that discriminate against non- members. These welfare implications are often analysed by estimating the scale of economy-wide trade diversion and trade creation. For example, upon joining an FTA, a country may switch its imports from an efficient producer of certain goods to a less efficient one, just because of incentive distortions created by tariff differentials. These distortions are most pronounced when goods are highly substitutable. In theory, trade diversion may be \u2013 but is not necessarily \u2013 welfare-reducing, whereas creation of trade is almost always welfare-enhancing. The net welfare result is obtained by weighing the positive aspects of trade creation 6 For example, the Thais insisted on positive list on services in FTA negotiations with the United States. 14 | THE GREAT MAZE: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia Trends, Characteristics, and Implications for Human Development against the negative aspects of trade diversion. In practice, however, this is hard to assess. Schiff and Winters (2003, 212-213) refer to studies that have attempted to ascertain scales of trade diversion at the thematic level \u2013 on manufactures, or \u201cinvestment switching\u201d among members of the EEC, EFTA and NAFTA. When it comes to South-South FTAs, they have been cited as tending to be more trade-creating than trade-diverting (Abugattas Majluf 2004). Yet differences in tariffs do not always account for all trade creation or diversion: rules of origin and exchange rate fluctuations also can complicate the picture. In orientation, this Paper departs consciously from textbook discussions of \u201cwelfare.\u201d The FTAs, especially those between countries with different GDP levels, have assumed a strategic fervour, and explanations for the phenomenon of the proliferation of FTAs will increasingly have to be sought in this realm.7 This approach can, of course, always be complemented by other conventional categories of studies: those that are quantitative and empirical, or those that deal with systemic issues.8 7 One early illustration is the U.S.-Canada FTA that was implemented on 1 January 1989. While academics note that this FTA was an \u201cunusually clean trade policy exercise not bundled into a larger package of macroeconomic or market reforms,\u201d permitting quantitative assessments of trade liberalisation on short-term adjustment costs and long- term efficiency gains (Trefler 2001), the authors of this Paper feel that some political motivations were stronger: Energy security and access to investment propelled the United States to seek an FTA, whereas Canada was keen on rules that would be written down in detail in U.S. legislation that would prevent future trade harassment, especially against its export of lumber. The United States took countervailing duty action against this export in subsequent years, which was eventually found illegal by the dispute settlement mechanism of the WTO. 8 The caveats remain: Empirical studies are subject to the constraint that many components of FTAs are difficult to model accurately because of data lag or irrelevance, while studies on systemic issues do not sufficiently acknowledge the political content of a new generation of FTAs, an aspect that the post-war global trade order sought to minimise. 15 Whether regional free trade agreements contribute to or undermine the multilateral trading system depends on specific contents of each agreement. Considerable debate has occurred in academic circles on whether FTAs constitute \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d or \u201cstumbling blocks\u201d to the multilateral trading system.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c1b6a35f-a4bd-4595-9803-c54e3c694b1b": {"__data__": {"id_": "c1b6a35f-a4bd-4595-9803-c54e3c694b1b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Great Maze: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "04b3e92fb86868e5de0ddf9afd8a4e4285abb2ead604afc2aabfef8639afe5e2"}, "2": {"node_id": "3ac85803-4184-4edc-a746-c0f8fdab0354", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a738f80027266f2846732116bfc2113d168e5d10f682c3ae20560732b94fc82d"}}, "hash": "2a7f876a0d962f0b571b0f515b0a5ab5deef94de9afde541e733d387160e0cc4", "text": "While authors like Schiff and Winters (2003) assert that the canon of \u201cmultiple trade blocs is still too new to allow a definitive answer,\u201d rules of thumb could be proposed: FTAs that accelerate trade liberalisation (with minimal distortion in global allocation of resources), while not upsetting the balance of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "436e5298-586e-4b58-8b70-d42ba9c9b61a": {"__data__": {"id_": "436e5298-586e-4b58-8b70-d42ba9c9b61a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Great Maze: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e0a698b1e5bff2b1cbb9f35cfe08c659d1881436572f4e56226f841b3d9779d2"}, "3": {"node_id": "eae71ab7-0123-4f40-a051-e7ad99566827", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0c0c5e591c8e5c3822544a8b5912a798db9764704e462753eae50ea965d8aa2c"}}, "hash": "036d05ce2336ae17e5796ffd126e9ff81f9d163f10932f1b51f65ccaa15f0685", "text": "rights and obligations in the WTO, could be reasonably judged to be building blocks. In particular, South- South FTAs can provide a training ground to build up competitive strengths. Customs unions among developing countries allow the members to exert greater negotiating leverage in multilateral trade negotiations as well. An independent report9 on the future of the WTO acknowledges that some FTAs act as \u201cspurs to the more hesitant development of the multilateral system\u201d and that \u201csmall groups of developing countries may see value in liberalising within regional trade arrangements as a means of working their way up to the harsher competitive realities of the global economy.\u201d On the other hand, to the extent that FTAs detract from WTO rights, or contain rules of origin and other trade diversionary provisions that create vested interests against multilateral liberalisation, they could be said to be \u201cstumbling blocks.\u201d When major countries enter into FTAs for essentially political motives, they also would seem to create a bias against multilateral agreements.10 9 Report by the Consultative Board to the WTO Director-General on \u201cThe Future of the WTO,\u201d 2004. 10 Some observers, including the authors of this Paper, question whether the premature suspension of the WTO\u2019s Cancun Ministerial Conference in 2003 could be a manifestation of this phenomenon. 16 | THE GREAT MAZE: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia Trends, Characteristics, and Implications for Human Development Some observers have used the term \u201cspaghetti bowl\u201d to portray what appears to be an incoherent, often overlapping and seemingly random maze of FTAs. The hub-and-spoke analogy also is used to describe the constellation of agreements centred around the United States and the European Union. Such a configuration can marginalise the \u201cspokes,\u201d so the choice of certain Asia-Pacific countries to actively promote FTAs is partly motivated by the desire to avoid becoming \u201cjust\u201d a spoke (World Bank 2005, 40). However, FTAs have become a tool used to pursue quite coherent global political strategies by major trading countries engaged in a \u201cgreat game\u201d on the world stage. Unfettered by multilateral constraints, major powers (see Part III) are pursuing geopolitical objectives through bilateral and regional trade negotiations, while smaller countries struggle to ensure that their vital sectoral export interests are protected. The GATT set out rules for the negotiation of customs unions and free trade areas in its Article XXIV. Up to the launching of the Uruguay Round in 1986, the major exceptions to the fundamental principle of GATT (the unconditional MFN clause of Article 1) were the following: i) EEC and EFTA, subject to the disciplines of Article XXIV; ii) regional agreements among developing countries, mainly in Latin America and Africa; iii) autonomous unilateral preferences granted by developed countries to developing countries, either universal (GSP) or regional; and iv) Global System of Trade Preferences among developing countries, which was largely symbolic. The main criteria in Article XXIV of GATT that allow regional trading arrangements to be set up as a special exception to the MFN rule are: \ufffd Tariffs and other barriers to trade should be eliminated for \u201csubstantially all the trade\u201d \ufffd Barriers should not be raised against outsiders \ufffd Interim arrangements must establish a free trade area or customs unions within a reasonable period of time 17 These criteria intend for regional integration to complement the multilateral trading system, not threaten it. Further, the Tokyo Round had produced the Enabling Clause (1979), which provided legal cover in GATT for the Generalized System of Tariff Preference (GSTP), negotiated in UNCTAD. It also subjected developing countries to less stringent criteria when they enter into FTAs among themselves. Article V of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) set out rules for economic integration agreements in services. The proliferation of FTAs, however, has led to a concern that the MFN principle is becoming more of an exception than the rule, as remarked by a former Director- General of GATT who chaired the Consultative Board to the WTO Director-General in 2004. At the Doha Ministerial Conference in 2001, Ministers agreed on the need for a harmonious relationship between the multilateral and regional processes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eae71ab7-0123-4f40-a051-e7ad99566827": {"__data__": {"id_": "eae71ab7-0123-4f40-a051-e7ad99566827", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Great Maze: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e0a698b1e5bff2b1cbb9f35cfe08c659d1881436572f4e56226f841b3d9779d2"}, "2": {"node_id": "436e5298-586e-4b58-8b70-d42ba9c9b61a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "036d05ce2336ae17e5796ffd126e9ff81f9d163f10932f1b51f65ccaa15f0685"}}, "hash": "0c0c5e591c8e5c3822544a8b5912a798db9764704e462753eae50ea965d8aa2c", "text": "They agreed to launch negotiations aimed at \u201cclarifying and improving the disciplines and procedures under the existing WTO provisions applying to regional trade agreements.\u201d The result of these negotiations to date has been summarised in the Report by the Chairman of the Negotiating Group on Rules (NGRs) to the Trade Negotiations Committee, on 21 April 2005.11 11 The paragraph relating to regional FTAs states: \u201cThe Group's work on systemic issues has gained a certain momentum following a Participant's proposal on the interpretation of \u2018substantially all the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3919f9e9-27c4-48b8-9320-5afe1ed58823": {"__data__": {"id_": "3919f9e9-27c4-48b8-9320-5afe1ed58823", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Great Maze: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e0ca29757854b6cc2b598fdfbccfb6ab6f4af07e6a2764d3fce0f3258b68d83d"}}, "hash": "e0ca29757854b6cc2b598fdfbccfb6ab6f4af07e6a2764d3fce0f3258b68d83d", "text": "trade.\u2019 This proposal, made shortly before the Group's last meeting, has already generated a preliminary but detailed discussion \u2026.

These tendencies persist and are more apparent in bilateral free trade agreements. Regionalism is a European invention: In the 1660s, 12 provinces in the Paris basin (cinq grosses fermes) erected a common tariff wall. During the colonial era between the 1700s and 1900s, most European powers followed preferential trade arrangements with each other\u2019s empires. After the political and economic turbulence in the first half of the 20th Century, a customs union was created in 1947 among Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg (Benelux), followed by the Treaty of Rome that created the landmark European Economic Community (EEC) in 1957. The EU has continued to expand its linkages to the east as well as to the Mediterranean in the south. Of the 87 notifications of FTAs to the WTO between 1990 and 2002, only 13 had no European partner (Schiff and Winters 2003, 5). As newly independent countries tried to construct a post-colonial world order, South-South trade agreements could have been governed by a similar motive, but they were hindered by the complicated negotiating modalities that reflected the general acceptance of import substitution policies in the 1960s and 1970s, relatively limited trade flows, and difficulties in mutual political relations. The United States assumed the role of defender of the MFN clause of GATT, which it viewed as a means of unifying the non-communist world and reducing the influence of political considerations in trade relations that had dominated the pre-war scene. It adopted a benevolent attitude to European integration, while at the same time attempting to ensure that it conformed to GATT disciplines. However, a major shift in U.S. policy occurred in 1984 when the Trade and Tariff Act provided the Administration with authority to enter into FTAs. In 1988 it entered into an FTA with Canada, its largest trading partner and a country that had also been a major defender of the MFN clause. With the Uruguay Round still under way, this Agreement was subsequently widened to include Mexico and form the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). 19 One objective of NAFTA was security of energy supplies: Canada and Mexico committed not to impose restrictions or taxes on energy exports. In return, they obtained duty-free entry to the United States market, even though tariffs were already low and Mexico benefited from GSP. They also expected that the Agreement would lessen trade harassment in the United States in the form of anti-dumping petitions and countervailing duties. During this same period, many developing countries liberalised their trading regimes under structural adjustment programmes of the Bretton Woods Institutions. This liberalisation was to a large extent consolidated in the tariff schedules negotiated in the Uruguay Round. The Single Undertaking of the WTO imposed similar levels of disciplines on all members. This raised the \u201cfloor\u201d of mutual trade obligations, facilitating the negotiation of FTAs because they only had to focus on the WTO-plus aspects.12 A conspicuous dimension of most FTAs is that their negotiations are subject to political dynamics quite different from multilateral negotiations in the WTO. The advantage of being larger and more advanced can be exercised more easily in the bilateral context. In the WTO, developing countries form coalitions around issues, often including rich countries. These coalitions not only enhance their negotiating leverage, but the exchange of information that takes place enhances the technical knowledge of the less advanced developing countries. Furthermore, the efforts to increase transparency in the WTO have borne fruit to a considerable extent as negotiating issues are 12 Such WTO-plus liberalisation measures could include specific obligations in areas where the application of the unconditional MFN clause has proven to be technically or politically difficult, such as action on SPS, liberalisation of MNP, commitments on government procurement, and exchange of MRAs. The \u201cWTO-minus\u201d measures could include those that erode the rights of members enshrined in the WTO Agreements, such as the imposition of compulsory licensing of patents or performance requirements on foreign investors. 20 | THE GREAT MAZE: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia Trends, Characteristics, and Implications for Human Development analysed and negotiating papers made available on the WTO website.

Korea Negotiation in progress ASEAN plus Agreement Source: Informal compilation by authors 30 | THE GREAT MAZE: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia Trends, Characteristics, and Implications for Human Development PART II EVERYONE IS INVITED Asian countries have been late to join the trend, but now there exists an unprecedented amount of negotiating activity within the region and with extra-regional partners. Asia was slow to get caught up in the FTA frenzy. Before the late 1990s, the political factors that provided the impetus for regional integration in other regions were largely absent in Asia. Economic integration had been attempted at the region-wide level through a preferential tariff arrangement, the Bangkok Agreement, signed in 1975 between Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Republic of Korea, Lao PDR, Philippines and Thailand (under the auspices of UNESCAP). Its results have been limited, although China\u2019s signing of the Bangkok Agreement in 2000 may provide more impetus. The second tier of regional integration initiatives was at the sub-regional level, in Southeast Asia (ASEAN) and in South Asia (SAARC). However, Asian countries have now become very active in deepening existing sub-regional agreements, and the sub- regional groupings are integrating with each other through a variety of mechanisms, including \u201cframework\u201d FTAs, bilateral FTAs and a new sub-regional agreement, BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi- Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation), which provides an interface for some South and Southeast Asian integration. The accession of China to the WTO in 2001 and its assumption of an energetic role in trade negotiations likewise have introduced a new dynamism into regional integration in Asia. Japan and the Republic of Korea, which had traditionally remained aloof from regional agreements, also have joined the great game. This has resulted in a complex maze of overlapping agreements. The three ASEAN Framework Agreements with China, India and Japan eventually would involve 30 sets of bilateral FTA negotiations, and another such framework with the Republic of Korea would add 10. The 31 countries negotiating SAFTA have a series of bilateral FTAs with each other. Australia and New Zealand have entered into, or are currently pursuing, FTAs with members of both sub-regional groupings (China, SAARC and ASEAN). China is starting an FTA with Pakistan; Singapore has negotiated a large number of FTAs with extra-regional partners, both developed and developing, while Thailand, Republic of Korea, Japan and China are following suit. Member countries of the Islamic Conference are negotiating their own FTA; Singapore, Brunei, New Zealand and Chile have signed a trans-Pacific FTA.13 Established in 1967, ASEAN remained more or less a political organisation until the last decade. Efforts at strengthening economic linkages were initiated in 1978 in the form of the ASEAN Preferential Trading Agreement (PTA) which was upgraded into an ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (AFTA) in 1992. The original goal of AFTA was to reduce tariff rates on intra-ASEAN trade to between 0 and 5 percent within 15 years through the Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) plan. The focus now is on integrating services, investment and other trade-related areas. AFTA liberalisation obligations among member countries vary according to the level of development of each member \u2013 the CEPT tariff schedule for manufacturing, processed agricultural goods and non-processed agricultural goods was signed in 1992, with the target to reduce tariffs to between 0 and 5 percent by 2003 for the six original member countries; 2006 for Viet Nam; 2008 for Lao PDR and Myanmar; and 2010 for Cambodia.

Although the CEPT scheme is almost fully implemented, liberalisation is slower and intra-regional competition feared for a number of products (say, by Malaysia\u2019s national car industry or Indonesia\u2019s rice farmers). The ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services (AFAS) was signed in 1995, aimed at expanding the scope of liberalisation beyond those already undertaken under the GATS. Under AFAS, initial negotiations focused on financial services, transport, telecommunications and tourism as well as professional business services, while progress is being made on Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs). In the third round of negotiations under the Common Modified Sub-Sector Approach, held in March 2004, member countries considered improving commitments to expand seven sectors onto the fast-track programme and make commitments for an additional 27 sectors. The ASEAN Investment Area (AIA) also was signed in 1998 to govern investment liberalisation. The establishment of AIA is expected to encourage investors to think in regional terms and adopt a regional investment and network strategy. As integration deepens in ASEAN, its individual members have embarked on FTAs with regional and extra-regional partners. It has adopted the approach of negotiating, as a group, \u201cframework\u201d FTAs with other regional trading partners, within which individual ASEAN members subsequently carry out their negotiations. The Early Harvest of the ASEAN-China Agreement has been finalised with all ASEAN members; Thailand and Singapore have both negotiated FTAs with Japan, while Malaysia is currently engaged. Some ASEAN countries are looking farther for FTA partnership outside the context of these \u201cframework\u201d agreements. 33 ASEAN Framework Free Trade Agreements ASEAN-China FTA: The Framework Agreement between ASEAN and China was signed on 4 November 2002 and entered into force on 1 July 2003. The Agreement is to be implemented within the next 10 years and includes an Early Harvest package covering HS Chapters 1-8 (agricultural products such as live animals, meat and meat products, fish, dairy produce, other animal products, live trees, edible vegetables and edible fruits and nuts) as well as selected specific products beyond those chapters (palm kernel oil, vegetable fats and oils, margarine, cocoa products, coffee, soap, stearic acid, erasers and glass envelopes). The Framework Agreement contains guidelines for negotiating an FTA in goods, services and investment and identifies other areas for economic cooperation, including provisions on dispute settlement. ASEAN-Japan FTA: The Comprehensive Economic Partnership (CEP) between ASEAN and Japan was signed in October 2003. The Work Programme includes trade and investment facilitation and liberalisation as well as cooperation in other areas, such as science and technology; HRD, SMEs, ICT, tourism and hospitality; transportation and logistics; and energy. A two-track process is envisaged for FTA negotiations: first, the bilateral FTAs between Japan and selected ASEAN countries with a common set of rules of origin, and second, a region-wide CEP to be implemented by 2012. ASEAN-India FTA: Main elements of this Framework Agreement provide for negotiations to establish an FTA in goods, services and investment; contains an Early Harvest package on goods and trade facilitation measures, and identifies areas for cooperation activities aimed at capacity building. ASEAN-Republic of Korea FTA: Negotiations under way. Trans-Regional EU-ASEAN Trade Initiative (TREATI): In April 2003, ASEAN and EU Ministers agreed to work toward the establishment of TREATI to enhance the ASEAN-EU economic partnership. The main areas of cooperation include trade and investment facilitation, technical barriers to trade, sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures, customs and tourism. The implementation of TREATI could pave the way for a future preferential trading agreement between ASEAN and the EU. 34 | THE GREAT MAZE: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia Trends, Characteristics, and Implications for Human Development With an FTA with the United States, Singapore seized the role of \u201cfirst mover\u201d in the region.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7de8dcac-219b-4e92-ac02-c65407961e82": {"__data__": {"id_": "7de8dcac-219b-4e92-ac02-c65407961e82", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Great Maze: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a57bc4524db64d1f4bf83077e07abb189ad9414c723bd04c99d4804581c5e03e"}, "2": {"node_id": "8c66a78b-7d8c-4ef2-b7a7-bb0a62878e66", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f893ae685c605e5868425249234b4afea72e0e40634ad8648fb58c5dcabc8e64"}}, "hash": "61d9f8756556c453e9b949243b85d10a4dc97dd550ed7efdb01adf3ec614cef4", "text": "As a major trading country with very low tariff protection and a negligible agricultural sector or poorer sections of the population requiring special support, it was in an ideal position to adopt what has been termed a \u201cpromiscuous\u201d approach to FTA negotiations.

The European Union\u2019s ambitions in seeking preferential markets through FTAs in Asia are less explicit than those of the United States. The EU is not against FTAs as long as they complement, and not substitute, multilateral approaches. It also views the two tracks as mutually supportive to the extent they both improve trading conditions, promote growth and employment, and build upon WTO rules and framework to foster more openness and integration than is possible multilaterally. While it has recently stated that the possibility of FTAs with ASEAN will be pursued, its primary emphasis is on signing agreements with MERCOSUR and the GCC. The EU recognizes that, \u201cthere is a clear downside to standing on the sidelines while others scoop the markets.\u201d14 14 See \u201cEurope\u2019s Global Trading Challenges and the Future of Free Trade Agreements,\u201d speech at the Foreign Policy Centre Debate, Brighton, U.K., 26 September 2005, by Peter Mandelson, EU Trade Commissioner. 35 Negotiating FTAs with multiple partners raises a wide variety of issues, but the involvement of civil society is essential: The example of Thailand. The experience of Thailand demonstrates how a more active role for civil society can strengthen a country\u2019s negotiating leverage in bilateral trade negotiations with more powerful trading partners. Thailand was the second ASEAN country to enter into extra-regional and North-South FTAs. Its situation, however, is very different from that of Singapore, illustrating the spectrum of issues that arise in conducting FTA negotiations with a variety of countries in different time zones, and especially at different levels of development. As these FTA negotiations with multiple partners have progressed and intensified, there had been calls for greater involvement of civil society and of the legislative branch of Government. Recent statements by Thai officials, as reported in newspapers, indicate a degree of frustration with the FTA negotiations with Japan and the United States and a shift of priority back to ASEAN.15 Concern also exists over the growing trade deficit. Thailand embarked on a programme of negotiating bilateral FTAs with the following selected developing countries both within and outside the Asia-Pacific region and pursued a regional FTA within the framework of BIMSTEC. Bahrain: The Thai-Bahrain \u201cCloser Economic Partnership\u201d has been effective since December 2002, under which tariffs were set for elimination on 626 products by January 2005 through the Early Harvest scheme. China: In the context of the ASEAN Framework Agreement, Thailand reached an Agreement on 1 October 2003 for mutual tariff elimination on fruits and vegetables. This Agreement has led to substantial increase in trade in these products. Some Thai producers (of onion, garlic, apples, 15 \u201cThai Focus on ASEAN Trade,\u201d Asia Times, 9 August 2005. 36 | THE GREAT MAZE: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia Trends, Characteristics, and Implications for Human Development pears) have been seriously affected, and complaints were aired that stakeholders had not been consulted during the negotiations or even made aware of the outcome. However, exports of other products, notably cassava, have prospered. Both partners have tightened SPS requirements on a large number of Early Harvest products. Peru: Negotiations were launched in January 2004 with the goal of forming a comprehensive FTA that would eliminate tariffs on all products by 2015. SPS regulations have been a major issue, and both countries are guided by strategic concerns for each country; it is the first FTA with a country in the other\u2019s region. Thailand sees the Peru FTA as an entry point to the Latin American market. India: Thailand began negotiations in January 2004. The Thai-India FTA follows the three-stage model (Early Harvest, normal track and sensitive track) and includes commitments on services, investment, TBT and MNP (business visas), as well as a provision for cooperation in areas including health, education and fisheries.

The following paragraphs highlight the main issues. Thai-Australia FTA: Thailand signed an FTA with Australia in October 2003, its first with a developed country. Australia clearly viewed an FTA with Thailand as part of its strategy to ensure that it is not left out of regional integration in Asia. It also aimed at access for its competitive agricultural and dairy products. Australia further wished to acquire an advantage over its competitors in service exports, particularly education services, where it has a strong export capacity. The FTA with Australia provoked major protests from the dairy and livestock industries in Thailand. As in the FTA with China, the negotiations gave rise to criticism that the involvement of civil society had been inadequate. Thai-New Zealand FTA: This Agreement came into effect on 1 July 2005 following on the heels of the Australia FTA, so the concessions on dairy were less controversial; dairy products make up 58 percent of New Zealand\u2019s exports to Thailand. New Zealand has reduced tariffs to between zero and 5 percent for imports of Thai tuna, shrimp, cereal, cosmetics, electrical appliances, glass and plastic. Thai-Japan FTA: The product coverage of this FTA, to come into force in September 2006, has been a major issue. Japan succeeded in excluding rice, Thailand\u2019s major export (although 16 to 20 percent of rice consumed in Japan comes from Thailand), but opened itself at negligible tariff rates to shrimp (zero percent), chicken (3 percent) and scores of other agricultural products. The Thai private sector has taken a position against the 60 percent domestic-content rule of origin requirement sought by Japan, believing that this will make a large number of exports to Japan ineligible for duty-free treatment. Thailand\u2019s largest trade deficit is with Japan (more than US$8 billion in 2004) \u2013 but having agreed to lower tariff on Japanese vehicle parts and fully built cars of 3000cc or more, Thailand expects to consolidate its position as the automobile hub of the 38 | THE GREAT MAZE: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia Trends, Characteristics, and Implications for Human Development region, even aspiring to be the \u201cDetroit of the East.\u201d16 Japan has responded with proposals to provide technical and financial assistance to help Thai producers meet SPS requirements and to upgrade technology in industry. Thai-USA FTA: The experience with the China and Australia FTAs has underlined the need for greater public and parliamentary involvement in the negotiating process.17 Negotiations with the United States are attracting considerably greater involvement of civil society. Reaction has been strong to the usual WTO-plus elements of the U.S. FTA model. The access of the poor to drugs has become a major issue, drawing protests in favour of eliminating IPRs from the agenda altogether. It has been pointed out that HIV/AIDS patients in Thailand currently can obtain the necessary drugs for US$30 per month, while those produced by U.S. pharmaceutical firms sell at US$250-750. The Government has committed to protecting these patients\u2019 health care schemes and to including Health Ministry officials on the negotiating team. Concerns also exist over another U.S. WTO-plus objective, to obtain patent protection for plant varieties, which is not required by the WTO. The Thai side is pressing for provisions to \u201cshield\u201d against bio-piracy. Thai negotiators also have challenged another element of the U.S. model on services, the \u201cnegative list\u201d approach, insisting that the GATS-style positive list that Thailand was successful in including in the FTA with Australia be adopted. In the most recent round of negotiations, while the two parties agreed on the basic definition and transparency conditions around financial sector liberalisation, they differed over the Government\u2019s power to regulate capital outflow, remittances and transactions in certain situations. Lastly, concern has grown that sugar, a major Thai export, will be excluded from liberalisation, given strong 16 \u201cA break in the negotiations,\u201d The Sunday Bangkok Post, 21 August 2005. 17 \u201cFTA Talks, and the Right to Know,\u201d The Bangkok Post, 2 April 2005. 39 political pressures within the United States.

SAPTA was established in 1993, and the first round of concessions came into effect in December 1995, with the latest round completed only in December 2002; LDC member countries were offered larger concessions (62 percent) vis-\u00e0-vis the three non-LDC countries. The depth of tariff cuts was mostly restricted to 10 percent to non-LDCs. SAARC\u2019s intra- regional trade as a percentage of its total trade is one of the lowest among regional groupings (under 5 percent), mainly because of two factors: First, most South Asian countries have a comparative advantages in similar products, and second, political tensions between the two largest countries of the region have stalled intra-regional progress. Individual SAARC members have, however, pursued sub-regional integration through bilateral FTAs. India has a free trade regime with Nepal and Bhutan and has entered into negotiations with Bangladesh. It negotiated an ambitious FTA with Sri Lanka that is now being deepened into a \u201cComprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement.\u201d Sri Lanka itself negotiated an FTA with another SAARC member, Pakistan. In 2004, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and 40 | THE GREAT MAZE: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia Trends, Characteristics, and Implications for Human Development Thailand signed the \u201cframework\u201d agreement of BIMSTEC, which straddles ASEAN and SAARC. Parallel to these bilateral negotiations, SAARC countries agreed to a Framework Agreement on a South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) in January 2004 to supersede SAPTA. Over 12 rounds of negotiations, the four contentious issues -- rules of origin, list of exclusions, technical assistance, and creation of a fund for compensation of the Least Developed Countries for the loss of trade-based revenue -- were finally agreed on 1 December 2005. SAFTA takes effect on 1 January 2006. Implementation of the new tariff regime offers three sets of deadlines: India and Pakistan will complete SAFTA implementation by 2012; Sri Lanka, as a \u201csmall economy,\u201d is granted one year more, until 2013, to bring its tariffs down to zero to 5 percent; Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives and Nepal, with the status of Least Developed Countries, have a longer deadline, until 2015. The Agreement provides for the elimination of quantitative restrictions, but it does not cover trade in services yet. Small countries struggle within the maze of agreements to protect their vital trading interests: The example of Sri Lanka.18 Of the top 50 exports of Sri Lanka to the sub-region, 24 received concessions under SAPTA, of which only 11 are of actual trade relevance to the country. In addition, other barriers exist, such as import licensing requirements that nullify tariff concessions. Under SAPTA, exports from Sri Lanka registered impressive figures only with respect to India and Pakistan. SAPTA exports as a percentage of total exports to Bangladesh, Nepal and Maldives have been minimal, and there were no exports to Bhutan. Although the number of concessions looks generous, some are in products not actively traded, and some tariff preferences for Sri Lanka duplicated preferences granted under the Bangkok Agreement, and later under the Indo\u2013Lanka FTA. 18 Draws on Jayasekera (2004), prepared for UNDP Asia Trade Initiative. 41 India and Sri Lanka accelerated their economic engagement process by signing a bilateral FTA in 1998 that became operational in March 2000. Out of a total of 4,919 tariff lines on which India offered concessions, 1,348 tariff lines are listed for 100 percent reduction in the first year; in the rest, this is to be effected in a phased manner. India committed to grant duty-free access, within three years, to all Sri Lankan exports except tea, textiles and other items listed in the negative list; some 196 items are excluded from tariff reduction on the grounds of injury or threat of injury to domestic industry, as well as national security reasons. Although this negative list hinders the effectiveness of FTA, it eases adverse political pressures by delaying the exposure of domestic industry to international competitors.

The Indian negative list accounted for nearly 6 percent of Sri Lanka\u2019s total exports to India. Some items on the Sri Lanka negative list that India exports are onions, vegetables, masoor dhal, fruits, wheat, rice, sugar, paper products, motor vehicles and auto parts. Sri Lankan exports on India\u2019s negative list include rubber, plastics, printed labels, polyester and nylon yarn. Imports from India are diverse, consisting of motor vehicles, pharmaceuticals, cement, food items, fruits, cotton yarn and so forth. While Sri Lanka has been able to send new export items to India (namely, memory modules, ink, cosmetics, medicaments, glue and plastic products), there have been murmurs of protest from Sri Lankan industrialists: Manufacturers of local refrigerators, for example, who enjoyed a tariff edge of 17.9 percent, are predicting plant closures when the zero-duty rate comes into effect in 2008. Agricultural items, by and large, are on the negative list. The FTA does not contain obligations on investment but nevertheless has stimulated foreign direct investment in rubber-based products, ceramics, electric and electronic items, wood-based products, agricultural commodities and consumer durables. India is the third-largest investor in Sri Lanka; Indian companies have invested more than US$400 million in the country, or about half of India\u2019s total investment in the SAARC region. Investment flows from India to Sri Lanka on the capital account 19 Garment items under ITC-HS Chapters 61 and 62, while remaining in the negative list, are given 50 percent tariff concession under a tariff quota. Other items on the negative list are rubber products, plastic articles and manmade filaments. Edible fruits and nuts, coffee, spices, oilseeds, lac and gum, animal and vegetable fats, rubber articles, copper articles, and zinc articles are some of the items that fall under phased reduction of 50 percent in the first year and duty-free in the third year. The main item scheduled for duty-free treatment in the first year is pulpwood (Chapter 47). 43 appear to counterbalance the trade deficit that Sri Lanka has with India.20 Indeed, the two countries are now moving to a Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which will deepen the integration achieved in the FTA primarily by including wider coverage of goods, all service sectors and removal of regulatory and operational constraints to investment. Commitments also are being made on trade facilitation and Mutual Recognition Agreements. The Sri Lankan experience under the Indo-Lanka FTA shows that if the regulatory framework \u2013 as well as the time frame for tariff phase-out, rules of origin, and negative lists \u2013 is properly designed to accommodate the disparities between the two countries, then a smaller country could gain from an FTA (Jayasekera 2005). It has to be noted, however, that it is the sectoral interests that are usually the driving force behind FTAs in smaller developing countries. In Sri Lanka, exports are highly concentrated in a limited number of sectors; its priorities in negotiating FTAs are thus to obtain duty-free treatment for such products (even though both tea and garments face restrained imports in India). After its experience with the FTA with India, Sri Lanka has negotiated an FTA with Pakistan, which came into effect in June 2005. Pakistan has pledged to grant duty-free entry to 206 products, including 10,000 metric tonnes of tea.

The reduction or elimination of duties on Sri Lankan exports of garments to the United States, under which Sri Lankan exporters would enjoy a margin of preference over competitors such as India and China, would seem to be the main motivation for Sri Lanka seeking an FTA with the United States. 45 PART III CARVING UP ASIA The world\u2019s growing and major economies \u2013 China, India, Japan and the United States \u2013 have joined the free trade maze in Asia, each trying to carve out its sphere of influence with distinct political-economic strategies. China China has recently become active in negotiating FTAs. Its first FTAs were with the SARs of Hong Kong and Macao in 2003, supplemented in- depth by CEPA II on 27 October 2004. China entered into a framework agreement with ASEAN as of 1 July 2003. An Early Harvest agreement includes all ASEAN countries in principle, although some negotiated exclusion lists are Annexes to the Agreement. China negotiated an Early Harvest list with Pakistan in May 2005 (China\u2019s list provides duty-free entry to 767 items, including textiles, surgical and sports goods, vegetable, fruits, rice, citrus and mangoes from January 2006, while Pakistan\u2019s contains primarily machinery and raw materials). Beijing also has virtually completed FTA negotiations with New Zealand, its first FTA with an OECD country, and is negotiating with Australia, as well as with trading partners outside the Asian region. FTA negotiations have been completed with Chile, and are ongoing with Peru, SACU, the GCC and Iceland. Most importantly, China is making overtures to Japan, Republic of Korea and India, seemingly positioning itself to become the hub of the largest FTA ever. A central element of China\u2019s FTAs is that its FTA partners agree not to apply those provisions contained in its terms of accession to the WTO; these permit WTO members to impose discriminatory restrictions against China that would otherwise be prohibited by WTO rules. Included are post-ATC restrictions on textiles and clothing, \u201cselective\u201d emergency safeguard actions and \u201cnon-market economy\u201d criteria for anti-dumping actions. For example, the relevant provision from the 46 | THE GREAT MAZE: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia Trends, Characteristics, and Implications for Human Development Agreement on Trade in Goods of the Framework Agreement on Comprehensive Economic Co-operation between ASEAN and China, which entered into force on 20 July 2005, states: \u201cEach of the 10 ASEAN Member States agrees to recognise China as a full market economy and shall not apply, from the date of the signature of this Agreement, Sections 15 and 16 of the Protocol of Accession of the People\u2019s Republic of China to the WTO and Paragraph 242 of the Report of the Working Party on the Accession of China to WTO in relation to the trade between China and each of the 10 ASEAN Member States.\u201d The same paragraph is included in the agreement between Pakistan and China. India India, a member of the Bangkok Agreement since its inception, has accelerated the sub-regional integration process beyond SAPTA by negotiating FTAs with four of its five immediate neighbours: Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh (negotiations under way) and Sri Lanka. Recently it took new initiatives at the intra-regional level by signing a Draft Framework Agreement for an FTA with ASEAN, under which an FTA has been negotiated with Singapore and Thailand; this already has resulted in an Early Harvest scheme covering a modest number of products for tariff liberalisation. In addition, India is a member of BIMSTEC, with which FTA negotiations have begun. In the inter- regional context, it has been a member of the GSTP, and a PTA has been signed with MERCOSUR, which already is yielding positive results.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1adbc656-f1ad-4850-b10b-a12281bf72b7": {"__data__": {"id_": "1adbc656-f1ad-4850-b10b-a12281bf72b7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Great Maze: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3faf563ee7573666efcbaad76d218e11533cf7bfa1158c009da444a82c6bf222"}, "2": {"node_id": "48c75492-bfd5-40a9-9b47-f813e19647a1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cade18c7638f1c72b247309a5fc18cee9c1cf6e8b53c0018f7e4966c11480660"}}, "hash": "c0957c90a06eb21e5b591ccf40335cb0bced6e7f0374128cf78b79144d95aad4", "text": "Initiatives that are in the process of studies, negotiations and implementation include India-Singapore CECA, India-Sri Lanka CEPA, India-Bangladesh FTA, Bangladesh-Bhutan-India-Nepal Growth Quadrangle, IOARC, India-China Economic Cooperation, India-GCC Economic Cooperation, India-Brazil-South Africa (IBSA) Initiative, India-Mauritius and India-Egypt Economic Partnerships.

Intensive work is being done on issues like rules of origin, Mutual Recognition Agreements, anti- dumping provisions, revenue compensation mechanisms, safeguards, dispute settlement modalities and others. In short, India has placed considerable emphasis on making Agreements as comprehensive as possible. It has adopted a \u201ccoalition building\u201d strategy, preferring to enter into \u201cframework\u201d agreements with developing-country sub-regional groupings within and outside Asia, including ASEAN, MERCOSUR and SACU, rather than with their individual members. Its recent overtures to discussing possible FTAs with developed countries such as the EU and the United States could be limited to services, a possibility foreseen in Article V of GATS.21 Japan Japan traditionally was a strong advocate of multilateral trade liberalisation and an opponent of regional trade agreements. The Government White Paper on International Trade 1999 \u201cgrudgingly\u201d admitted the positive aspects of regional trade agreements for complementing and improving the multilateral trading system. It was only in 2000 that Japan fully embarked on its dual-track policy \u2013 as witnessed by its speedy negotiation of the Japan-Singapore FTA (JSEPA). Singapore was a strategic first choice \u2013 it has negligible tariff protections and agricultural exports to Japan, which meant that political opposition to the deal would be less significant. The Japan-Singapore FTA was used as a tactic to \u201csoften up\u201d those interests in Japan opposed to moving from a strict commitment to multilateralism.22 Following this strategy, Japan is negotiating FTAs with other ASEAN countries. An FTA has been reached with Thailand, and negotiations are under way with Malaysia, 21 \u201cIndia Inc. wants FTA in Services with EU,\u201d India Online News, 5 September 2005. 22 Aoki, Maki, \u201cNew Issues in FTAs: the Case of Economic Partnerships,\u201d Paper submitted to APEC Study Center\u2019s Consortium Meeting, Vina del Mar, Chile, 26-29 May 2004. 48 | THE GREAT MAZE: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia Trends, Characteristics, and Implications for Human Development Indonesia and Philippines. An FTA was reached early with Mexico to enable Japanese exporters to compete on an equal basis with Mexico\u2019s other FTA partners, notably in NAFTA and the EU. Tokyo also is pursuing an FTA with the Republic of Korea, but has remained cool to the idea being promoted by China of a trilateral FTA among the three countries.23 Japan has encountered difficulties in agreeing to free trade in sectors that it deems sensitive, notably agricultural products.24 As noted above, rice was excluded from the Thai-Japan FTA, even though it is Thailand\u2019s largest export item, and very stringent rules of origin were imposed on fishery products. This resulted in reduced concessions in favour of products of export interest to Japan; other potential FTA partners might not accept such exclusions. These considerations have led Japan, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, to adopt a flexible and pragmatic approach to FTA negotiations, in contrast to strict adherence to a model approach pursued by the world\u2019s largest economy, the United States. While future FTAs would be based on the FTA with Singapore, \u201cSingapore-plus\u201d and \u201cSingapore-minus\u201d agreements could be contemplated.25 Also sensitive to Japan is the liberalisation of the movement of natural persons. In the negotiations with Philippines, where labour remittances are of crucial importance, there appears to be a wide gap between the offer of Japan to allow entry to a few hundred health care and IT professionals, and that of Philippines, which is requesting quota-free entry for these occupations.26 Energy security also is a priority \u2013 Japan is 23 \u201cChina urges movement on trilateral FTA,\u201d Yomiuri Shimbun, 7 May 2005. 24 \u201cSticky situation for Japan\u2019s rice policy,\u201d Asia Times, 28 July 2005. 25 Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan, Economic Affairs Bureau, \u201cJapan\u2019s FTA Strategy,\u201d October 2002. 26 \u201cNo Quota,\u201d Manila Bulletin, 27 July 2005.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a95a0c3-addd-47fc-b61d-d5eb6de1478a": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a95a0c3-addd-47fc-b61d-d5eb6de1478a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Great Maze: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f9a70f02729d415e2dbaca067369eb2fd08548a92a2449cf161824862f99870d"}, "2": {"node_id": "47d4c60e-e02d-454d-94d9-866363ec12e7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "06c422100a3449da85ca4a5515b1791bbed99ebe26fc51a8e73964f57456e3dc"}}, "hash": "abd93cbf31579e5f2873cf207701e385edb93405082bc47580b9994a047527fd", "text": "26 \u201cNo Quota,\u201d Manila Bulletin, 27 July 2005. 49 seeking security for supply commitments in its FTA negotiations with Indonesia, an OPEC member.27 United States28 Since 2001, the United States has negotiated FTAs with Chile, Jordan, Singapore, Bahrain, Australia, Morocco, Dominican Republic and Central American states, and has engaged in negotiations with other countries (e.g., Thailand, SACU, Oman, UAE, and Kuwait).

The first consists of Middle Eastern countries that cooperate with the United States in the regional peace process. The United States reached FTAs in the past with Israel and 51 Jordan and has recently concluded agreements with Morocco and Bahrain; now it is negotiating with Oman and UAE. The second, larger category consists of countries that support the U.S. war efforts in Iraq by participating in the \u201cCoalition of the Willing.\u201d For example, all countries in Latin America that joined the Coalition have become FTA negotiating partners. The only non-Coalition countries in Latin America with which the United States has initiated FTAs are former G-20 members. The United States and the European Union encountered opposition on agriculture negotiations from a group of non-subsidising developing countries during the Fifth WTO Ministerial Conference. Originally called the Group of 20, this coalition soon attracted additional adherents. The United States sought to reduce the size of this coalition, and hence its influence, by inducing some of its members to reach separate FTAs with itself. Those efforts have met with some success; several countries have left the G-20.29 It has been noted that the United States has entered into an FTA with Australia, but not its neighbour New Zealand, whose anti-nuclear policy had given rise to frictions with Washington.30 Outside of Latin America, the United States is negotiating FTAs with two Asian and African countries that remain part of the G-20.

Only Israel and Jordan have escaped the \u201cyarn forward\u201d provision in their FTAs. The preferential trade programmes offered to the Caribbean Basin, Andean partners and sub-Saharan Africa have been designed to set up captive markets of this nature. Under this approach, trade with the Americas is promoted at the expense of Asia, especially China. Compared to trade with the Americas, apparel imports from Asia are not nearly as beneficial for U.S. producers. While some Asian countries import significant amounts of U.S. fibre, some of which comes back in the form of fabric or apparel, they import very little fabric or semi-finished apparel from the United States. By contrast, much of the apparel imported from the Americas \u2013 and especially Mexico and the Caribbean Basin \u2013 consists of goods assembled in offshore plants from U.S.-made components. The apparel and energy sectors help to explain the current selection of FTA partners, but the sensitive agricultural products (sugar, certain fruits, vegetables and dairy products) are especially troublesome for U.S. negotiators. The United States previously interpreted the \u201csubstantially all the trade\u201d criterion of GATT Article XXIV as meaning \u201call\u201d trade, and insisted that all products be made duty- and quota-free in an FTA.31 This interpretation came under strain when the United States began to negotiate FTAs with some major sugar suppliers. The first step came in the U.S.-Chile FTA negotiations, where the two sides essentially agreed to a non-aggression pact on this commodity. The United States also is attempting to circumvent the constraints of the WTO by incorporating systemic issues in the FTAs. The most significant, particularly from a human development angle, is the inclusion of TRIPS- plus provisions as well as the pursuit of strong disciplines for investment, 31 With the exception of dairy trade with Canada. 53 antitrust, labour and environmental standards, and trade in services, including electronic commerce and audio-visuals. According to Das (2005), this serves as a reminder of a historical strategy: During the early 1980s, the United States engaged in bilateral agreements and understandings with several developing countries aimed at reducing their subsidy options. Most of these got consolidated in the subsidies agreement in the Uruguay Round. During this round of negotiations, the United States also contracted bilateral agreements with several developing countries in the area of IPRs that eventually smoothed the process of having an effective IPR protection regime in the Agreement on TRIPS. 54 | THE GREAT MAZE: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia Trends, Characteristics, and Implications for Human Development PART IV PLAYING WITH CAUTION Agriculture FTAs should provide meaningful access for key agricultural exports from developing Asian countries, shield poor producers from disruptive surges in imports and reflect food security concerns unambiguously. While trade distortions caused by agricultural subsidies in developed countries cannot be effectively addressed in FTAs, they can include provisions to assist poor producers to meet sanitary regulations. Agriculture remains a mainstay of the Asian rural economy for incomes, employment, nutrition and food security. Although its relative importance varies with countries, agriculture is a key sector, contributing more than 25 percent of the GDP in South Asia and more than 15 percent in East Asia. Nearly 6 in 10 Asians are employed in the agriculture sector, and the degree of their reliance on agriculture is quite systematically correlated with the depth of poverty. Issues of nutrition and food security also are related to agriculture, with 4 in 5 malnourished children in the developing world living in Asia. The incidence of hunger and poverty is high in areas characterised by weak agricultural production systems and the absence of effective control by poor people over resources, such as land ownership and tenure, credit, public infrastructure, and access to domestic and international markets. The latter is where pro-poor trade negotiations, rules and policy can intersect to contribute to human development.

The participation of both categories of Asian countries in the G-20 demonstrated their political will to overcome these differences when confronting the subsidised exports of the EU and the United States. The same issues that arise in the WTO need to be confronted in FTAs: high tariff protection, export and production subsidies, safeguard clauses and special lists of products vital for food security and poverty alleviation. FTAs may provide a better opportunity for dealing with issues whose technical complexity impedes action at the multilateral level, such as SPS and free access for agricultural products of special export interest. However, major distortions caused by subsidies are difficult to address in a bilateral or regional context. These concerns have been reflected in FTAs among developing countries in Asia. In some cases, agriculture exports have been in the vanguard of regional cooperation, such as the Early Harvest of fruits and vegetables (and other products in HS 1-8), contained in FTAs negotiated under the umbrella of the China-ASEAN Agreement. Vietnam and Cambodia have negotiated exceptions lists from this Early Harvest, and China is negotiating such lists with Lao PDR, Malaysia and Philippines. The China-Pakistan and Thai-India agreements also include agricultural products in the Early Harvest. On the other hand, some regional FTAs have excluded key agricultural products or scheduled them for a long phase-in period, such as tea in the Indo-Lanka FTA. Within ASEAN many agricultural products have been placed on the CEPT-AFTA Sensitive List with a longer period for tariff cuts (2003 to 2010). Understandably, Singapore is the only country that does not have this list. The inclusion of agriculture in FTAs with developed countries also has been problematic. The two most active, Australia and New Zealand, have used the FTAs to obtain access for their highly competitive agricultural exports targeting dairy products, a sector characterised by high levels of 56 | THE GREAT MAZE: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia Trends, Characteristics, and Implications for Human Development protection in most OECD markets. However, they have been willing to accept a lengthy phase-in period in the FTA with Thailand where the duty-free treatment and the elimination of tariff quotas have been staged until 2020, with a further five-year delay for milk, cream and milk powders (Findlay 2005). The U.S. FTAs aim at obtaining access for a wide range of agricultural exports, although certain products defended by strong lobbies in the United States (notably sugar) are excluded, thus creating the potential for imbalances in the agreement. Similarly, Japan insists on excluding rice in any FTA. The main issue affecting agricultural trade \u2013 the massive subsidies applied by developed countries to their production and export \u2013 does not lend itself to bilateral solutions. The Chile-USA FTA has attempted to deal with export subsidies to the effect that the partners will refrain from subsidising exports to each other, but may do so when faced with export subsidy competition from third parties, unless the other party takes countervailing measures. However, the deeper problem of overproduction caused by subsidies also is not addressed; under NAFTA, even though Mexican exporters of fruits and vegetables have benefited, imports of subsidised corn and soybean from the United States have had devastating effects on poor farmers in terms of hundreds of thousands of jobs displaced (Carlsen 2005). Developing countries attempt to identify products deemed most crucial for food security and ensure that they are included on a list of exceptions. Many FTAs include, in addition to the standard safeguards, a special agricultural safeguard clause that borrows elements of Article 5 of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture; the Thai-Australia FTA, for example, contains a special list of agricultural products for which a \u201ctrigger volume mechanism\u201d applies. Agreement has been reached in the Doha Round negotiations on agriculture that developing countries will have recourse to the \u201cspecial safeguard mechanism\u201d and will be able to exclude a list of \u201cspecial products,\u201d although details remain to be worked out. It would 57 seem unlikely that developing countries would give up these rights in bilateral FTAs. FTAs can provide a mechanism for dealing more effectively with SPS regulations that often present insurmountable trade restrictions on exports by poor producers. Although disciplines exist in the WTO SPS Agreement, a trend is evident toward more stringent regulations, particularly with respect to food safety. FTAs thus can provide more country- and producer-specific cooperation to prevent poor producers from being excluded from the market of the partner country.

At their worst, they can create captive markets for suppliers of rich- country inputs and undermine the competitiveness of poorer trading partners. Rules of Origin (RO) ensure that imports from third parties do not benefit from negotiated preferential treatment. There are three basic methods of determining RO for goods, namely, value-added, changes in tariff classification and process definitions, and often combinations of these. Each method has an economic impact, often peculiar to specific sectors. The World Bank considers that restrictive rules of origin can easily wipe out any margin of preference generated by an FTA (World Bank 2005, 68-70). In extreme cases, as in textiles and clothing, ROs can be used to create captive markets for exporters of raw and semi-finished products. There is no single rule of origin found in FTAs; rates are set at between 30 and 60 percent (of local content or value-addition requirements), depending on the products. This product-specific approach is complex, with a range of formulae and tests applying to thousands of different products in the parties\u2019 tariff schedules. Such an approach may provide opportunities to impose protection at every point. The Japan-Singapore Economic Partnership Agreement employs mainly the \u201ctariff jump\u201d requirements and the local content requirements for its RO. The former are set at the HS 4-digit basis,33 which means stricter RO because products must jump across tariff classifications by undergoing additional processing and change. These are complemented by 60 33 Hamonised System (HS) numbers are normally six to 10 digits long. Most countries use the same six digits for most products; these HS numbers are universally used to determine tariffs and tariff preferences, certification and shipping document requirements, and so forth. 59 percent local content requirement, which also is at the higher end of the scale for comparable FTAs. The U.S.-Singapore FTA introduces a new concept of the Integrated Sourcing Initiative (ISI), which applies to non- sensitive, globalised sectors such as IT. Under the scheme, certain IT components and medical devices are not subject to RO when shipped from either party \u2013 the objective is to encourage MNCs to take advantage of each ASEAN country\u2019s competitive advantage. Because LDCs generally lack manufacturing and processing capacity, relaxed rules of origin can provide meaningful Special and Differentiated Treatment (S&DT) in their favour. They tend to respond favourably to such concessions, as indicated by the response of four Asian LDC apparel exporters to Canada after its Market Access Initiative for LDCs was launched in 2003 (UNDP-RCC 2005, 26). Within Asia, LDC members of SAPTA were permitted to enjoy a local content requirement that was 10 percentage points less than stipulated for more advanced parties (40 percent vs. 30 percent). But generally, rules of origin have been very contentious in FTA negotiations.

RO for the services sector are based on the definition of service provider or natural person involved in the provision of the services.34 Under GATS Article V:6, a service supplier of any other member that is a juridical person in one of the parties shall be entitled to the treatment under the FTA, provided that it engages in substantive business operations in the territories of the parties. However, paragraph 3(b) of the same Article gives developing countries the right to grant more favourable treatment to juridical persons owned or controlled by natural persons of the other party, if the FTA involves only developing countries. The objective is to avoid third-party enterprises benefiting from the FTA when they have not previously engaged in such substantial business operations. The criterion of incorporation of nationality must be given to genuine companies that are engaged in substantive businesses in the country. Therefore, nationality should not be accorded to corporations that are incorporated in a country for tax avoidance or related purposes or do not have business or assets in those countries. For a natural person, the definition is based on nationals or permanent residents of a country. It should be noted that the India-Singapore FTA paraphrases GATS Article V but provides more stringent rules for sensitive sectors such as audio- visual, financial, education and telecommunications services, where the additional criterion of citizenship is added. Article 804 of the Thailand- Australia FTA permits the parties to deny the benefits of this Chapter to a service supplier of the other Party, where the Party establishes that the service supplier is owned or controlled by persons of a non-Party. 34 Exports of services under GATS Mode 3 are those services supplied by a commercially owned or controlled by a natural juridical person of another member. Owned is defined as more than 50 percent of equity interest, while controlled means that the persons of the other member have the power to name the majority of the directors or otherwise control its actions. 61 Regardless of the stringency of the rules of origin, an additional barrier to trade is presented simply by the use of different rules of origin in different FTAs.35 The levels of local content and the use of tariff jump criteria vary considerably. Thus, one customs administration can be obliged to apply many different rules of origin to assess whether the same product qualifies for preferential treatment, depending on its source. 35 The International Chamber of Commerce has highlighted this confusion in rules of origin as a major impediment to business in its submission against FTA. 62 | THE GREAT MAZE: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia Trends, Characteristics, and Implications for Human Development Textiles and Clothing Some Asian countries have sought FTAs with developed countries as a means of acquiring specific preferential access for their textiles and clothing exports, and to obtain the same terms as FTA partners in other regions. However, tariff preferences do not seem adequate if supplying countries are hampered by restrictive rules of origin. Unilateral preferences combined with relaxed rules of origin seem to be the best ways of assisting LDCs and their small suppliers. Textiles and clothing industries in Asia have lifted millions of people, especially women, out of poverty in different countries at different periods of time. They also have served as a steppingstone for diversified industrialisation in many East Asian nations, and as major labour- absorbing light manufacturing bases in other, less industrialised countries. Global export of textiles and clothing (T&C) exceeds US$350 billion per year, and Asian economies, excluding Japan, produce about half of that. It is worth noting that the major gainers from the quota- based world trade in T&C (until 31 December 2004) were some of the poorest countries in Asia (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Nepal and Lao PDR); they and other small exporters are now in need of special international preferences to preserve their shares in world trade and national employment. Tariff preferences have been seen as crucial to being able to compete with those countries in other continents that already enjoy such preferential access, or to obtain advantage vis-\u00e0-vis the large competitive exporters like China and India. The focus has primarily been on the United States market because of the dynamism of its T&C imports and the fact that T&C products, even those", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c9a72908-e540-4a83-934f-dbbe3630d607": {"__data__": {"id_": "c9a72908-e540-4a83-934f-dbbe3630d607", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Great Maze: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2b6c1501a497f604d328318c9f68b5b84c815bb67603e5f8be1923c77c00920d"}, "3": {"node_id": "f013c98a-e9e7-495a-a06c-b42d72c9208d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7772c9ed9e32be817268d337a427ac1fbeae2209f05352dad08d0036daaa5d64"}}, "hash": "61cee96f52e63ef4b7e3b4fba23d2729be5a739a7c77de1468a55ffa80018876", "text": "exported by LDCs, do not benefit from GSP treatment there.36 Many countries enjoying duty-free access to the United States for clothing, either through FTAs or special outward 36 In 2002 only 2.5 percent of apparel imports into the United States received GSP treatment, even when the definition of apparel used was broad, including certain plastic items. 63 processing arrangements, have demonstrated spectacular export growth, which Asian countries believe they could emulate. There are two basic elements, however, that might frustrate such emulation. The first is that it may not have been the tariff preferences that stimulated the export growth, but rather the \u201cquota preferences\u201d \u2013 the fact that the main potential competitors were still subject to quotas that had been negotiated under the MFA, up until their abolition with the full implementation of the ATC on 1 January 2005. The second is that, with two exceptions, these preferential arrangements with the United States include the yarn-forward rules of origin requiring the use of U.S. yarn and fabrics as a condition for made-up or clothing products to enjoy duty-free entry. This tends to create a captive market for U.S. exporters of yarns and fabrics and increases the cost of products incorporating these inputs that are exported by countries benefiting from duty-free entry. The WTO Agreement on RO does not discipline rules of origin used in the granting of preferences, and thus there exist no binding multilateral rules governing their use. ROs are also technically complex37 and administratively burdensome. It has been pointed out that these strict ROs could play some role in deterring both upstream investments in textile production, by distorting incentives to use imported yarn, as well as in raising the input costs of apparel production by mandating usage of U.S. or EU yarn and fabric. Usually, the FTA partner is given a quota under which fabric and yarns from third countries can be used without losing preferential status, but these quotas are phased out over a period, the result being that their impact on the competitiveness of the exporting countries only becomes apparent over time. 37 As examples, the recent U.S.-Singapore FTA has a 284-page-long Annex 3A only on \u201cproduct-specific Rules of Origin.\u201d Similarly, the annex on RO in the U.S.-Chile FTA is 95 pages. 64 | THE GREAT MAZE: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia Trends, Characteristics, and Implications for Human Development The most recent trade data, since the full implementation of the ATC, indicates a drop in market share of countries benefiting from FTAs or outward processing arrangements. Comparing the first seven months of 2005 against the same period in 2004, the share of U.S. imports from China increased from 16.8 percent to 25.1 percent in value terms. In contrast, the share of Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) countries plus Mexico declined from 22.1 percent to 19.9 percent, and African countries under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) declined from 2.0 percent to 1.6 percent (Adhikari and Yamamoto 2005). This growth trend of imports from China, albeit often from low levels, has provoked the United States and the EU to invoke the discriminatory textile safeguard clause accepted by China in its terms of accession to the WTO. The restrictions applied against China appear aimed more at preserving trade flows with FTA partners than protecting domestic producers. However, a relaxation of rules of origin would seem the best means of enabling smaller partners to preserve market shares.38 Regional free trade agreements among Asian countries should present increased opportunities for T&C trade. If rules of origin are accompanied by lax regional cumulation39 requirements, Asian countries could gain in the form of a stronger supply chain, from regional integration efforts among SAARC, ASEAN, Japan and China. There is a need to reduce dependence on Northern markets and promote South-South trade. In this regard, the recently re-launched Agreement on GSTP,40 administered by UNCTAD, could contribute to deepen the scope of tariff preferences 38 See statement by the Executive Director ITCB to UNCTAD Meeting on Strengthening Participation of Developing Countries in Dynamic Sectors of World Trade, 9 February 2005. 39 Cumulation refers to a flexible provision in trade agreements whereby inputs imported for production from other countries party to a common preferential agreement (or even another agreement) can be factored in to determine national origin of a product.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f013c98a-e9e7-495a-a06c-b42d72c9208d": {"__data__": {"id_": "f013c98a-e9e7-495a-a06c-b42d72c9208d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Great Maze: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2b6c1501a497f604d328318c9f68b5b84c815bb67603e5f8be1923c77c00920d"}, "2": {"node_id": "c9a72908-e540-4a83-934f-dbbe3630d607", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "61cee96f52e63ef4b7e3b4fba23d2729be5a739a7c77de1468a55ffa80018876"}}, "hash": "7772c9ed9e32be817268d337a427ac1fbeae2209f05352dad08d0036daaa5d64", "text": "40 http://www.unctadxi.org/templates/Press____897.aspx; 10 Asian countries have ratified the Agreement on GSTP. 65 amongst developing countries.

FTAs should not be permitted to undermine development objectives in key sectors such as public health, environmental, energy and cultural services. FTAs provide an opportunity to obtain greater liberalisation for the movement of persons in various occupations and different skill levels, and to include obligations to protect foreign workers, particularly women, against exploitation and abuse. Since 1980, trade in services has grown faster than trade in goods, despite the former being subjected to complex non-tariff barriers (WTO 2003, 9). Partly because of possibilities created by IT-enabled technologies, trade in services today includes sectors that are the drivers of modern economic growth; however, it also includes sectors where commercial motivations are secondary to the human development objective of ensuring basic well-being through decent health, education, energy, and water and sanitation supplies, among others. As public institutions come under great strain in coping with increasing development claims, they are compelled to explore options to fill glaring gaps through domestic revenue mobilisation, recourse to overseas aid and transfers, and international trade through the four modes of supply.41 For the poor men and women in Asia, opportunities to temporarily migrate across borders as service suppliers could dramatically increase earnings and upgrade skills. Remittances also feed extended family safety nets, enhancing access to health and education and financing small local businesses. The entry into force of GATS at the WTO in 1995, which recognised the development role of services, actually overtook most regional FTAs then 41 Mode 1 (cross-border supply); Mode 2 (consumption abroad); Mode 3 (commercial presence); Mode 4 (movement of natural persons) 67 in existence because they did not include provisions on services. Thus, until recently the only commitments on trade in services among Asian countries were those incorporated into their GATS schedules. Now countries are endeavouring to incorporate services into the regional integration process. ASEAN moved ahead with the AFAS, under which the member countries negotiated GATS-plus commitments on a positive- list basis. Members also are negotiating Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) for a variety of professions within this framework. The share of services in GDP is seen to systematically correlate with levels of per-capita income. In developed countries, such shares typically exceed 70 percent of national output (73 percent in the United States), while in developing countries it is around 50 percent (lower in the Least Developed Countries, down to 25 percent in Lao PDR). Not surprisingly, the developed countries have placed high importance on the liberalisation of services in their FTAs. In the case of the Singapore- Japan, Thailand-Australia and Singapore-Jordan Agreements, this is a positive GATS-plus list, under which the two countries go beyond their respective GATS commitments. In contrast, the Singapore-Australia and Singapore-USA FTAs adopt a negative-list format, with Singapore specifying sectors not covered by the Agreement; this reflects the U.S. approach aimed at moving to a negative list. Although it could seem logical to use the negative-list approach in the FTA context, it has the obvious disadvantage for the developing-country partner of automatically liberalising new services that might evolve from new technologies. Services of traditional interest to the developed countries, notably telecommunications and financial services, are targeted in these FTAs. Japan accepted a positive-list approach in its FTA with Singapore, but has preferred to adopt a negative-list approach to liberalising trade in services with partners like Malaysia, whose officials have admitted having to spend substantial negotiating capital to incorporate safeguard modalities.42 42 Based on unofficial remarks made by Malaysian negotiators at the Asian Regional Workshop on Bilateral Free Trade Agreements, Kuala Lumpur, 26-28 August 2005. 68 | THE GREAT MAZE: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia Trends, Characteristics, and Implications for Human Development The main goal for developing countries in North-South negotiations is to obtain transfer of technology commitments and access to networks, as well as access for natural persons, all foreseen in GATS.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ab37249e-6427-441e-b473-5608875758c9": {"__data__": {"id_": "ab37249e-6427-441e-b473-5608875758c9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Great Maze: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6a993b4ea4b74ad8902267675a86a88a94f14a4a61d896a8125bd908e0ed1efb"}, "2": {"node_id": "1a0bffad-d977-4c1a-aba0-3fb446d438d2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "626c265eb5e49dc5271e201210969f490d4823ef47f10affcaac10d9e215b48a"}}, "hash": "7ba803bb5c626ccce205897ea1d3b7c48d09b42ea55f8258325282e974b91f55", "text": "With developing regional partners, however, opportunities exist for export of tourism, professional services and construction.

The chapter on services mostly covers cross-border trade, for example, while Mode 3 is put in the investment chapter, Mode 4 in movement of natural persons, and financial services in a separate chapter. This breaking up of the services mode of trade allows separate treatment for each component of the services sector; in turn, this weakens the negotiating position of the developing-country partner and creates incoherence in the country\u2019s international commitments.43 Developing countries may find themselves under pressure to open up key service sectors central to human development (e.g., health, environment, energy and audio-visual/cultural services) to foreign participation in FTA negotiations. While such liberalisation, if properly channelled to support development strategies, can be beneficial, it is essential that FTAs not infringe on the sovereign rights of partners to implement regulatory rules or measures that are in the public interest (TDRI 2004, 115). National objectives in these sectors should be firmly embedded in legislation before entering into negotiations. One example of the impact of negative listing is the audio-visual sector, where most countries have carved out their \u201ccultural exception\u201d by not making commitments in GATS. The United States has been keen to use the FTA approach to achieve an objective that has proven infeasible in the multilateral context (e.g., elimination of local content regulations on films and TV programmes). Most of the countries entering into FTAs have sought to 43 Abidin (2004) prepared for UNDP Asia Trade Initiative. 69 preserve their cultural identity and have made reservations in their negative lists. The recent adoption of the UN Convention on the Protection of Cultural Contents and Artistic Expression should strengthen their hand in this respect.44 However, these reservations soon may become technologically out of date and be nullified in practice by the special provisions in the FTAs regarding electronic commerce (Bernier 2004). Electronic commerce is an area where FTAs can be the avenue to set new rules for trade, given that internationally recognised conventions have yet to be established. The United States is seeking to consolidate in FTAs the temporary moratorium of taxes on electronic commerce transactions. Some FTAs could set the pattern for a future global framework governing such activities. Indeed, the Japan-Singapore FTA has set the protocol for e-commerce trade between the two countries. Because the United States has \u201cbound\u201d Mode 1 in most sectors, it already has committed to an open market for outsourcing of service activities, so not much need be sought in the FTA context. In GATS, the negotiation of MFN commitments going beyond the standard provisions for technical experts, traders and inter-corporate transferees has proven difficult. Improved access on Mode 4 is one area where gains could be made by a poorer trading partner in an FTA by incorporating commitments with respect to sectors or occupations of its interest. Meaningful access for temporary migrants can result in real economic gains for developing- country partners in North-South FTAs \u2013 and this has the potential of inserting more balance into bilateral agreements. FTAs can provide mechanisms to permit a freer movement of persons in a wider range of categories and at different skill levels. They also can facilitate movement through special visa provisions. Importantly, FTAs should include obligations to protect foreign workers, especially women, from exploitation and abuse. 44 See Choike Report on UNESCO Convention: www.choike.org 70 | THE GREAT MAZE: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia Trends, Characteristics, and Implications for Human Development Often a tendency exists to confine provisions on Mode 4 to movement of business persons, not going much farther than the horizontal commitments in most countries\u2019 GATS schedules. However, this misses a major opportunity for developing countries\u2019 export of labour-intensive services to go beyond the constraints of multilateral negotiations. For example, Philippines, a major exporter of services under Mode 4 and a dependent on labour remittances, is seeking meaningful commitments from Japan, including freer access for certain specialised categories (such as nurses and caregivers). An area where FTAs can provide advantages to developing countries is in the negotiations of Mutual Recognition Agreements. GATS encourages members to enter into MRAs, and to the extent possible, permits other members to accede to such Agreements (Zarrilli 2005).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1ea705a5-7874-488c-822d-d9fa51c71e39": {"__data__": {"id_": "1ea705a5-7874-488c-822d-d9fa51c71e39", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Great Maze: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "561d2890160ddb32e877c5634ef03c826037bc7d7bfa7dda7b7e7f42f5eb6270"}, "2": {"node_id": "914cfbac-5994-4f6b-98d9-ab374b67ca3d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "14f99326410896534bf54646515f0e18bdee87d67b85ad8cd77ebc00e1148f56"}}, "hash": "2ad57e9181512693c79dc250c3a50475ed795cddd266c86489373f339f47f795", "text": "FTAs can include provisions for the negotiation of MRAs in key professional service sectors, as well as for the provision of technical assistance to assist partner countries in meeting their standards.

For example, measures that seek to limit foreign ownership and control are designed to empower people to have more control over vital economic decisions that can affect their lives. Limitations on foreign ownership also help to ensure that a robust, competitive, domestic private sector can emerge and provide the basis for sustained national development. Investment measures aimed at redressing inequities in access to opportunities include regional and sectoral investment incentives for SMEs; employment- and gender-related performance requirements; and public service obligations. The developed countries had attempted to bring investment policy fully under multilateral trade rules by introducing the concept of trade in services and \u201ctrade-related\u201d investment. However, this was not fully possible because the TRIMs Agreement did not establish any new obligations, leaving WTO Members free to restrict access and national treatment (except for sectors specifically committed in GATS). They also could impose a variety of performance requirements on foreign investors, including transfer of technology conditions. Through FTAs, developed 72 | THE GREAT MAZE: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia Trends, Characteristics, and Implications for Human Development countries now seek to include those provisions they were unable to incorporate in the multilateral framework. Developed countries have since moved to impose bilateral obligations on investment in Bilateral Investment Treaties and FTAs. The U.S. model, for instance, includes six core principles: (a) prohibition on a variety of performance requirements permitted by TRIMS and GATS; (b) the right of establishment, unless excluded in a negative list; (c) the right to expropriation compensation; (d) selection of top management; (e) assured access to investor- state arbitration; (f) the right to free transfer of all transfer related to the investment, e.g., interest, dividends, proceeds for exports, needed imports and so forth.46 Like in TRIPS, the longstanding objective has been to set up a system under which trade sanctions can be applied legally to protect property rights. Bilateral FTAs thus include a goal that was missed in the WTO: of linking investment obligations and trade commitments. These elements are also included in BITs. However, there is no link to trade commitments or tariff protection, and this makes them easier to negotiate, because they are less prone to challenge from local businesses. Many developing countries believe that entering into an FTA with a major developed country will result in increased investment flows, but the empirical basis for this view is unconvincing. The World Bank points out that \u201ccountries that had concluded a BIT were no more likely to receive additional FDI than were countries without such a pact\u201d (World Bank 2005, 98 and 129). UNCTAD\u2019s World Investment Report 2003 also posits that an aggregate statistical analysis does not reveal a significant independent impact of BITs in determining FDI flows. However, a study47 cited in the Report on the determinants of FDI in CEE found that 46 Remarks by Randall K.

Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz has remarked, however, that for most countries, bilateral FTAs merely represent \u201cfalse hopes and dreams\u201d for a torrent of inward investment.48 Investment chapters of FTAs can determine the quality of the entire agreement. Granting of national treatment at the pre- and post- establishment phase would imply that foreign investment is treated no less favourably than domestic investment with respect to the establishment, acquisition, maintenance, sale or disposal of investment. The new wave of BITs in Asia is different from the previous set signed between the 1950s and 1980s.49 The old investment treaties served a protective function against nationalisation or excessive interference in the post-colonial period. However, new investment provisions in BITs or FTAs go beyond the protective function by conferring rights of commercial value and widening the definition of investment to include any type of right or asset of economic worth, including IPRs. If countries were to liberalise pre- and post-national treatment for investment, they must put in place measures to ensure that the domestic economy and participants can benefit from a more liberalised investment regime. The inclusion of across-the-board national treatment obligations undermines the position of developing countries in GATS, where national treatment can be bargained for other reciprocal commitments. 48 The Bangkok Post, 10 January 2005 49 The first modern BITs in Asia were concluded by Germany with Pakistan (in 1959) and then with Malaysia, Thailand, Sri Lanka and Republic of Korea in the 1960s. 74 | THE GREAT MAZE: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia Trends, Characteristics, and Implications for Human Development Recent FTAs in Asia that contemplate forms of investment liberalisation (pre- as well as post-establishment rights) are: Japan-Singapore, Japan- Mexico, Thailand-New Zealand, Republic of Korea-Chile and India- Singapore. From a human development angle, countries may need exceptions to national treatment provisions to meet social objectives (say, positive discrimination in favour of a disadvantaged group), and it would be unwise to surrender the policy option of affirmative action.50 The United States\u2019 FTAs go farther to include provisions on expropriation and mechanisms for investor-state dispute settlement. These have proved to be problematic in the NAFTA context, however, where foreign investors have successfully challenged Government activities and public policies, such as those aimed at environmental protection. As of February 2005, foreign investors have been awarded compensation in five cases (worth US$35 million), often over claims that might not have been allowed under domestic courts.51 In Asia, according to Halle and Peterson (2005), investment treaties vary in their scope of exposure to international arbitration; while Chinese treaties tightly circumscribe external arbitration, others offer easy exit for foreign investors from the local judicial system, e.g., U.K.-Sri Lanka BIT. The important point here, nonetheless, is not so much the mechanism of international arbitration, but the scope of rights that investors enjoy. FTAs that include compensation provisions for expropriation of investment by direct or indirect means could lead to claims against Government regulations aimed at enhancing public welfare, if they are perceived to affect an investor\u2019s profitability. While in recent disputes 50 For example, the Thai-New Zealand FTA allows measures to treat its indigenous Maori people favourably. Earlier, during WTO negotiations on financial services in 1998, Malaysia successfully resisted requests for commitments that it deemed would undermine its national policy of favouring Bumiputra enterprises. 51 For analysis based on 42 claims under NAFTA Chapter 11 Investor-State Cases, please see Public Citizen (2005). 75 (especially under NAFTA), legitimate, non-discriminatory regulations have not been interpreted as expropriation, some countries have been rightly concerned about the potential pitfalls of similar clauses: the 2003 BIT between Japan and Viet Nam, for example, makes an effort to clarify that legitimate tax measures will not constitute a form of expropriation. Another risk of such expropriation clauses is that they may lock in private delivery of goods and services, given that moves to dislodge foreign-owned private operators (say, in attempts to universalise aspects of health care) could be interpreted as a form of expropriation (Halle and Peterson 2005). Most recent Agreements include investment as a reflection of deepening integration at the regional or bilateral level (ASEAN or Indo-Lanka CEPA). Indeed, countries seem to increasingly contemplate the inclusion of investment provisions together with services. In Asia-Pacific, except for the Trans-Pacific CEP, all new FTA agreements that include services also cover investment.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3ede1ab3-ef1f-4cc8-b4ff-9116e12cadd9": {"__data__": {"id_": "3ede1ab3-ef1f-4cc8-b4ff-9116e12cadd9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Great Maze: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "639f845b20fed0b6d94ac59ed822562794427866170b7ab063210f985bef2c85"}, "2": {"node_id": "30c62d5b-423e-43c1-90d7-24a1f355a839", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d1d6cdc9b908e2d945b5a9d178276bb055d55df4a70b74ff3c0446c637891971"}}, "hash": "f275f9e14a06f25074c4daee9e7387fd2c329c3cade15f9979e50dec6df83441", "text": "In most cases, the commitments on investment have been left to future negotiations under framework FTAs, and the outcome of many such negotiations is not yet known. 76 | THE GREAT MAZE: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia Trends, Characteristics, and Implications for", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ca237e96-2965-4181-bd58-2850de2b9a3c": {"__data__": {"id_": "ca237e96-2965-4181-bd58-2850de2b9a3c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Great Maze: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/great-maze-regional-and-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "873f8678b2cf6e01e1d9ed1966982d8751892f295e74ec0ab419f7ea739c6155"}}, "hash": "873f8678b2cf6e01e1d9ed1966982d8751892f295e74ec0ab419f7ea739c6155", "text": "Human Development Intellectual Property Rights Provisions in FTAs that nullify the rights of developing countries under the WTO TRIPS Agreement and the Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health restrict the access of the poor to essential medicines. This is particularly grave when such provisions restrict the use of compulsory licensing and prevent parallel imports of patented products. Conventional Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) categories include patents, copyrights, trademarks, industrial designs, layout designs of integrated circuits, and geographical indications. The basic principle behind IP protection is to award exclusive rights for exploitation of information to innovators and creative thinkers so as to give them the incentive to create and commercialise ideas, while ensuring that society as a whole benefits from the pursuit of knowledge, through public dissemination. This necessitates a balance between the commercial end of profit, moral recognition of the personality of the creator, and the human development objective of enhancing capabilities of users in societies at large. When FTAs are used to upset this balance and obtain commitments that go contrary to the thrust of current initiatives in multilateral fora that permit flexible uses of TRIPS, they undermine the rights of developing countries. Civil society groups have been particularly critical of FTAs negotiated by the United States that seek to dilute the rights of governments to issue compulsory licenses authorising companies to produce generic drugs without the patent holder\u2019s permission. They also limit the ability of poor countries that do not have the capacity to produce generic drugs to avail of imports from countries with such capacities. Low-cost generic versions of patented drugs have been of tremendous value to poor countries for decades, especially the introduction of generic antiretroviral drugs for treating HIV/AIDS, which made antiretroviral therapy available at costs as low as US$140 per person per year compared 77 to about US$12,000 in industrial societies. This transformed HIV from a fatal disease into a manageable, chronic illness.52 While new laws on product patents will not eliminate the supply of generic drugs, companies will be required to pay royalties to patent holders, which could push up prices. Because only a few countries like India and Thailand have a sophisticated generic industry in Asia-Pacific that produces cheap drugs for the large home market and export to poorer countries in Asia and Africa, any disruptions to existing supply would affect thousands of poor and diseased lives. The best response for countries facing difficult public health situations is to make use of TRIPS flexibilities and have the political will to act in the national interest by issuing compulsory licenses as and when necessary. Countries in Asia, however, have tended to underutilise TRIPS flexibilities. After the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health, only Malaysia and Indonesia have issued compulsory licenses or opt for government use to secure required medical supplies at affordable prices.53 It is this important policy flexibility that is under threat in bilateral FTAs (see, for example, FTAs between the United States and Singapore, Morocco and Australia).54 When grounds for issuing compulsory licenses are restricted to national emergencies or are made conditional on other factors, such as adherence to anti-competitive laws, they unduly circumscribe the TRIPS and Public Health Declaration, which gave countries the \u201cfreedom to determine the grounds upon which such licenses are granted.\u201d Other TRIPS-plus provisions incorporated in FTAs with the United States include the prohibition of parallel imports, patent term extensions beyond the 20-year limit in TRIPS Agreements, and prevention of the use of clinical trial data by generic producers. The lack of respect for human life implied by these provisions has attracted severe 52 Briefing Note on \u201cTrade Regimes and HIV in Asia Pacific,\u201d by HIV/AIDS Practice Group, UNDP RCC, 2005. 53 For specific examples from Malaysia and Indonesia, see Chee Yoke Ling (2005) 54 Article 16.7 of US-Singapore Bilateral FTA 78 | THE GREAT MAZE: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia Trends, Characteristics, and Implications for Human Development criticism not only in ongoing FTA negotiations, but also by third countries and the U.S. Senate.55 Recently, 16 Thai NGOs have requested the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Health to appeal to the Thai Government, including trade negotiators, to take account of their obligations under the right to health when they negotiate IPRs in trade agreements. Stringent FTA provisions on the scope and duration of data exclusivity and the so-called \u201clinkage\u201d between patenting and regulatory processes also potentially pose barriers to accessing of essential medicines.

But if these processes are linked and the marketing approval bodies are made to police whether drugs are under patent or not, this obstructs the market entry of cheaper generic drugs and could render the compulsory license provision redundant. Countries could thus follow the European example of de- linked processes and the placing of the onus on companies themselves to not infringe on patents. Similarly, while TRIPS Article 39.3 requires the protection of undisclosed data on new chemical entities, especially from commercial use, pressures to enforce protracted data exclusivity delay generic drug availability in markets and create patent-like monopoly even when a drug is not under a patent (MSF 2004, 2).

Massachusetts Sen. Edward M. Kennedy has also declared the U.S. Administration\u2019s IPR policies on FTAs \u201coutrageous.\u201d 79 protection similar to that found in U.S. law,\u201d an analysis of characteristic provisions in FTAs with the United States has led to the observation that they are not only TRIPS-plus but often \u201cU.S.-plus.\u201d This places a tremendous burden on weaker FTA partners in the form of added compliance costs and restricted policy options. The U.S.-Jordan FTA, for instance, noted for its brevity (only 19 pages) still devotes half the content to intellectual property issues. Another TRIPS-plus trend pursued in FTAs by developed countries like the United States is to request the developing-country partner to accept patenting of life forms and of plant varieties, and to accede to the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV).56 The option provided by Article 27.3 (b) of the TRIPS Agreement is to protect plant variety through an effective sui generis system. This flexibility is designed to protect the interest of subsistence farmers whose livelihoods depend greatly on farm-saved seeds. The UPOV system in its current form does not allow farmers to save, exchange or sell seeds of the varieties it protects, thereby subjecting poor farmers to overt dependence on commercial breeders. A less publicised area where TRIPS agreement could be further undermined by FTAs is in the area of geographical indications (Articles 22-24 of TRIPS). Geographical indications have the advantage of being permanent and community-owned, thus providing one of the mechanisms for the protection of some forms of traditional knowledge and culture. Some FTAs insist on a \u201cfirst to file\u201d trademark approach, which permits developed-country firms to expropriate traditional knowledge and the interests of communities by registering a trademark 56 Countries like Singapore and Jordan that have signed FTAs with the United States have been obliged to become UPOV members; Singapore joined in June 2004 and Jordon in October 2004.

While it is too early to conclude what long-term development results are likely, the emerging trend offers broad guidance for countries in Asia-Pacific. In particular, the regional process in Southeast Asia, as well as the intensity of bilateral trade activity occurring there, have lessons for South Asia, where countries are signalling interest in bilateral trade agreements with extra-regional industrialised nations, even as regional integration moves forward more slowly. In all cases, it must be remembered that the world of trade negotiations is fluid. It consists of diverse theatres and actors \u2013 at the multilateral, regional, bilateral and unilateral levels \u2013 but all initiatives underpin most countries\u2019 intention to secure meaningful political and economic roles by embracing a liberal enlargement of all forms of freedom. The unfettered exchange of goods, capital, ideas and people across borders holds tremendous promise to generate unprecedented prosperity. But the development challenge is that, in the absence of conscious national policies or fair global rules, no guarantee exists that these benefits will be equitably shared among nations and sub-groups. This challenge is most stark in trade negotiations, where the interests of narrow sectoral lobbies could exert such a concentrated influence upon governments that they offer reciprocal concessions to trading partners in sensitive areas such as services trade, intellectual property standards, and investment measures \u2013 with widespread impact. Not all pursuers of Free Trade Agreements are driven by mercantilist motivations, however. Political considerations prevail, especially when Government leaders are eager to make a statement about their emerging clout, political alliances and identity through strategic associations with 82 | THE GREAT MAZE: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia Trends, Characteristics, and Implications for Human Development powerful countries. While this Paper highlights the non-trade content of trade agreements, it does not judge the motivations. This is up to the national constituency to identify and articulate, and this is where the role of non-state institutions is important \u2013 to demystify the technical trappings of trade and macroeconomic policies. There is a need not only for different arms of the government to talk to each other, but also to open the debate in the media and civil society fora. Recent experiences in Asian democracies on this issue are worth emulating, not only because they help expand and deepen understanding of what different Free Trade Agreements mean for development, but because they also lend citizens\u2019 voices to negotiating processes where egregious proposals can be legitimately resisted. While relatively advanced developing countries may have several products that can gain through preferential market access, potentially translating into greater national incomes and jobs, less developing countries must remain cautious. Even though these poorer countries may have little to gain but much to offer, they should proceed warily into asymmetric bilateral trade agreements, especially with partners not in the immediate neighbourhood. The best option for poor and small countries in the international trading system is still to expend their scarce negotiating capital in furthering regional integration efforts. At the same time, they can work to secure fair and universally acceptable multilateral rights and obligations at the WTO that discipline trade and promote development. 83 Appendix The Relevant WTO Articles on Regional Integration and FTAs [Reproduced from WTO (1999) and Schiff and Winters (2003)] Article XXIV of GATT 4.

(a) A customs union shall be understood to mean the substitution of a single customs territory for two or more customs territories, so that: (i) duties and other restrictive regulations of commerce (except, where necessary, those permitted under Articles XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV and XX) are eliminated with respect to \u2026 substantially all the trade in products originating in such territories .\u2026 (b) A free trade area shall be understood to mean a group of two or more customs territories in which the duties and other restrictive regulations of commerce (except, where necessary, those permitted under Articles XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV and XX) are eliminated on substantially all the trade between the constituent territories in products originating in such territories. 9. The preferences referred to in paragraph 2 of Article I shall not be affected by the formation of a customs union or of a free trade area but may be eliminated or adjusted by means of negotiations with contracting parties affected. This procedure of negotiations with affected contracting parties shall, in particular, apply to the elimination of preferences required to conform with the provisions of paragraph 8 (a)(i) and paragraph 8 (b). 10. The CONTRACTING PARTIES may by a two-thirds majority approve proposals which do not fully comply with the requirements of paragraphs 5 to 9 inclusive, provided that such proposals lead to the formation of a customs union or a free trade area in the sense of this Article. 85 The Enabling Clause (Decision on differential and more favourable treatment, reciprocity and fuller participation of developing countries) This decision by signatories to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT \u201cCONTRACTING PARTIES\u201d) in 1979 allows derogations to the most-favoured nation (non-discrimination) treatment in favour of developing countries. In particular, its paragraph 2(c) permits preferential arrangements among developing countries in goods trade. It has continued to apply as part of GATT 1994 under the WTO: 1. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article I of the General Agreement, contracting parties may accord differential and more favourable treatment to developing countries, without according such treatment to other contracting parties. 2. The provisions of paragraph 1 apply to the following: \u2026 (c) Regional or global arrangements entered into amongst less- developed contracting parties for the mutual reduction or elimination of tariffs and, in accordance with criteria or conditions which may be prescribed by the CONTRACTING PARTIES, for the mutual reduction or elimination of non-tariff measures, on products imported from one another; .\u2026 The Uruguay Round Understanding on the Interpretation of Article XXIV of GATT 1994 2.

It is recognised that for the purpose of the overall assessment of the incidence of other regulations of commerce for which quantification and aggregation are difficult, 86 | THE GREAT MAZE: Regional and Bilateral Free Trade Agreements in Asia Trends, Characteristics, and Implications for Human Development the examination of individual measures, regulations, products covered and trade flows affected may be required. 3. The \u201creasonable length of time\u201d referred to in paragraph 5(c) of Article XXIV should exceed 10 years only in exceptional cases. In cases where Members parties to an interim agreement believe that 10 years would be insufficient, they shall provide a full explanation to the Council for Trade in Goods of the need for a longer period.

Decentralisation and Urban Governance in Asia and the Pacific Asia is host to half of the world\u2019s urban population, and that population continues to grow.1 This rapid urbanization has caught some governments by surprise, both at the local and national level. Cities across the region face increasing poverty; lack of basic amenities and services such as water supply, electricity, sanitation, housing, education and healthcare; worsening pollution and depletion of natural resources; crippling traffic congestion; declining safety and security, and increased dissatisfaction by urban residents. These problems are exacerbated by the challenges brought on by the adverse impacts of climate change. Many Asian cities lack the mandate, resources and capability to deal with these multiple issues.2 The technical and political capacity of urban governments to deliver services depends on existing rules and regulations, so an understanding of the different systems of government prevalent in Asia is important, as they vary greatly. There are several countries which follow a unitary system of government, i.e., where local governments are often the only sub-national layers of government, thus putting them under central 1 UN-HABITAT. 2013.

These include, for instance, China, Indonesia and Thailand. On the other hand, in a federal government structure, in India and Malaysia, states or provinces can be quite powerful and are usually responsible for overseeing the functions of local governments, both urban and rural. Countries like East Timor, Nepal and Myanmar are going through a critical transition phase, from conflict to peace, and from significant centralized control to a gradual opening up and sharing of power and responsibilities between different levels of government. In general, decentralization processes began around the late 1980s in the region, and included both reform of the local government3 system, as well as increased democratization.4 However, while de jure reforms seem to have been extensive, local governments still work under the close supervision of higher levels of government, and rely on them for a large portion of their budgets. Most national governments exercise strong central control on decentralized governance structures, either through limited functional devolution, constraining fiscal arrangements, or political control. Bank of China, Hong Kong \u00a9 Reuters/Bobby Yip In terms of devolution of key functions, on paper, several countries have devolved a large number of functions to local governments, especially urban governments which have greater technical and financial capacities than their rural counterparts. However, this devolution is often unclear, or inadequate. Malaysia, for instance, has a federal system organized in three tiers: central, state and local. The constitution makes provisions for local government through a number of legislations, but the distribution of functions between the three tiers of government is often overlapping, either leading to duplication of efforts, or resulting in inaction. Furthermore, national governments 3 In this paper, the terms local governance and local government include both urban and rural forms, unless otherwise specified. In many countries, decentralization laws cover both settings, though decentralization arrangements in urban and rural areas may vary significantly.

In other words, executive power is vested not in local elected officials but bureaucrats handpicked by higher levels of government. In China, for instance, the delivery of basic services, urban/town planning, health care and education, water, electricity, and welfare functions all rest with cities. Emergency services and disaster management are also local competencies. The proceeds of some locally collected taxes are shared with higher tiers of government. Larger cities are fairly independent and well-resourced. Yet, central control is exercised through the appointment of hand-picked Mayors , with unlimited five year terms, and no provision for a popular vote either for the election or recall of the Mayor.5 There are also other challenges. In Indonesia, the organization and functioning of all local governments (municipalities in urban areas; regencies and villages in rural areas) used to be the responsibility of the provincial authorities but the Regional Government Law 22 of 1999 eliminated the hierarchical relationship between provincial and municipal governments. This significantly shifted resources and responsibilities from the central and provincial levels directly to the urban (kotamadya) and rural (kabupaten) municipalities, but often caused conflicts between the provincial and local governments given their equal relationship vis-a-vis the central government. Many metropolitan areas and city regions often lie outside the purview of the \u201cregular\u201d legislation and policies related to decentralization, and may have exceptional powers and/or resources.6 National capital territories are usually governed directly by the central government, even where local government is a state/provincial responsibility, for example the Kuala Lumpur federal territory or the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration. At the same time, large municipal corporations (or city corporations as they are sometimes called), have both strengths and weaknesses. The Dhaka City Corporation (DCC), for instance, has a strong Mayor who is able to act independently as well as lobby national and/or external support for the development of the city; on the other hand, the planning function rests in the hands of a Capital Development Authority, which is a \u201ctechnical\u201d institution, not accountable to the citizens in the same way as the Mayor or local councillors. This makes local governance issues and concerns very different in the DCC as compared to the smaller towns in Bangladesh.7 Even where the hierarchical structures are clear, the cooperation and collaboration required between different entities at local level \u2013 local government and line departments, for example, often remains a key challenge. Given the presence of multiple stakeholders, including non-state actors in many contexts, institutional coordination across (rather than only vertically) is extremely important to ensure effective responses. 5 Ibid. 6 This is an issue that affects urban local governments much more significantly than their rural counterparts. Many urban governments are assigned a special status of some sort, while in rural areas usually decentralization laws are uniformly applied. 7 Islam, N. 2012.

Given the variety of local governance systems, practices and capacities in the region, it is not possible to propose one strategy to work with urban governments on inclusive and resilient climate change responses, as these involve policies and practices emanating from multiple layers of government. While larger cities and city-regions may have the political power, technical skills and fiscal base to deal with emerging challenges such as climate change, the same cannot be said of the thousands of smaller local governments that dot the Asian landscape.

Without these, responses to climate change may not necessarily be inclusive of different stakeholder priorities. Furthermore, concerns of equity \u2013 particularly vis-\u00e0-vis the informal sector (both informal housing as well as the informal economy) \u2013 are critical in several cities and countries. Kathmandu, Nepal \u00a9 Ilija Gubic II. Decentralisation and the Efforts to Improve Resilience to Climate Change through Improved Urban Governance As noted in the previous UNDP-UN-Habitat issues brief on addressing vulnerability,10 a high percentage of the urban population is at risk due to the effects of climate change. Climate change is a concern beginning to feature in national policy and legislation across the region, with several countries adopting national laws, policies and action plans to combat climate change and move towards low-carbon/low-emission development and growth. In India, the most explicit recognition of the challenges to sustainable development and climate change have come through the adoption of the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) in June 2008. The Ministry of Environment and Forests further requested all sates to develop State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCC) to ensure the implementation of the vision at sub-national level. Though there is no explicit role assigned to local governments in the NAPCC, the National Mission on Sustainable Habitat does highlight the importance of adopting climate change adaptation as well as mitigation measures in cities.11 10 See, UNDP and UN-Habitat. 2013. \"Addressing Urban Poverty, Inequality, and Vulnerability in a Warming World\".

City of Publication:Routledge. 5 In Indonesia, recent reports indicate that while the national and local level policies appear well crafted, with a growing understanding and integration of climate change, there are gaps in strategies to implement the policies. Enforcement also continues to be weak, and the capacity of both city staff as well as the urban poor communities to engage in climate change policy issues, is inadequate.12 A key challenge facing urban governments in addressing climate change is different policy frameworks that sometimes contradict each other. Often, new national policies on climate change, while not explicitly contradicting decentralization legislation and policy, might simply not acknowledge the important role that local governments can play in these processes. Urban planning, for instance, is a local function in most countries, but national policies fail to take into account its role in climate change, or encourage city governments to formulate new types of plans that ensure city resilience and inclusion.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0eb3336d-9955-4dde-af1c-e2f927f6fa20": {"__data__": {"id_": "0eb3336d-9955-4dde-af1c-e2f927f6fa20", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/impact-decentralization-and-urban-governance-building-inclusive-and-resilient-cities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Impact of Decentralization and Urban Governance on Building Inclusive and Resilient Cities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/impact-decentralization-and-urban-governance-building-inclusive-and-resilient-cities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a7f5af247a8b69606ac31dcb07112dfc9535eae3459ca5db7e5a94bc0a256f21"}, "2": {"node_id": "72090332-58d4-4797-ad1d-9ff466a137ef", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/impact-decentralization-and-urban-governance-building-inclusive-and-resilient-cities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "391844c18ad4ce97eb3361723d508d6f4415dc1a5e4538d691e9745bc92bf82a"}}, "hash": "fa8b83bc49a7e494a838f4e37c4c2ae1cb10d137f4b85a2eed8eefceb943f6e6", "text": "Furthermore, sectoral ministries at the national level sometimes direct resources for climate-change related to the line departments without engaging with local government per se, thereby creating a potential for duplication of priorities and resources, or even contradictory efforts.

To illustrate the point further, it is useful to examine recently concluded Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR) studies, which have analysed public climate budget expenditures in a number of countries in Asia (and the Pacific)13. The CPEIRs were introduced as an analytical tool aimed at helping countries review how their national climate change policy objectives were being reflected in public expenditures. The reviews explored how institutions might be adjusted to ensure that financing a response to climate change is delivered in a coherent way across government. Studies in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Nepal, Samoa, and Thailand illustrated that ministries of local government, infrastructure, physical planning and agriculture were key to climate related public expenditures. At the same time, the studies also illustrated that climate change budget allocation and expenditure are driven by sectoral policies, rather than climate change policy per se. Although some of the studies did examine the level of expenditure on climate change at the local level, the studies were primarily focused at the national level. Similarly focused and in\u2013depth analyses at the local level could be useful in demonstrating that building climate resilience and inclusion are much more the result of \u201cregular\u201d local government activities expenditure, as opposed to specially packaged mitigation and adaptation interventions. In other words, the required enabling environment and the capacity of cities to perform their day-to-day functions effectively very often has a direct bearing on the effectiveness in addressing climate change. This has been recognized, for instance, in legislative and policy changes in the Philippines over the last decade. As in many other countries, the 12 Scott, H. 2012.

Considering that the Philippines is an archipelago of over 71,000 islands, with over 65% of its population living in urban areas, vulnerable to storms, typhoons and sea level rise, this was a critical omission. Since then, however, there has been a gradual shift in approach, culminating in The Philippine Climate Change Act of 2009. The Act mandated the creation of the Philippine Climate Change Commission and the development of a National Framework Strategy of Climate Change, and recognized local governments as the frontline agencies for climate change action planning and implementation.14 Furthermore, a national directive from the Executive Department instructed all Local Government Units (LGUs) to revise/enhance their Comprehensive Land Use Plans (CLUPs), taking into consideration disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. Butuan, the Philippines \u00a9 Ilija Gubic The actual process of mainstreaming climate change concerns into local level planning instruments such as the Comprehensive Land Use Plans (CLUPs) and the Comprehensive Development Plan (CDPs) has not been an easy one, however. Local government capacities remain very weak and information on how they could effectively incorporate climate change into their local plans is not part of the existing planning guidelines. To respond to this, a pilot project was undertaken by the Department of Interior and Local Government, and the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council, with the support of UN-Habitat, to mainstream climate change into the local planning system. AVulnerability and Adaptation Assessment (V&AA) Tool and a risk-sensitive planning process have been developed within the project in Sorsogon City, which are expected to be rolled out to other cities as well as scaled up at the provincial and national levels. The urban communities most at risk from climate change are those who live in slums and informal settlements. They often have the knowledge and the capacity to identify, reduce and deal with risks, and are a very important part of the governance equation. 14 DILG and UN-HABITAT. 2011.

But, addressing priorities identified by community organizations from informal settlements, such as housing, infrastructure and basic services, often means that many risks are reduced, and inclusion enhanced at the same time.16 III. Towards More Effective Decentralisation for Inclusive and Resilient Cities in Asia and the Pacific As seen from the discussion above, there are several issues and challenges that need to be addressed in order for urban government to be able to combat climate change effectively, and in an inclusive manner. Some potential options to address them are presented below: \u2022\ufffd Clarify mandates of different actors, vertically, but also across the local level. Urban governance involves many different actors and stakeholders, whose mandates are driven by specific rules and regulations \u2013 which may sometimes contradict each other, create duplication, or be unclear about specific responsibilities. These include, for example, independent entities created to manage water supply in several Indian cities; planning or development authorities which are fairly autonomous, for example in Bangladesh, and India. There is often little coordination between line departments of ministries, and the departments of the municipality or city corporations. Overcoming these could include developing, or strengthening mechanisms for better cooperation, such as information sharing, or joint-planning meetings, with a specific focus on climate change issues. It is essential to note however that these challenges may not always be confined to technical obstacles, but rather emanate from political incentives which prevent the hand-over of specific responsibilities, or even, sharing information among different actors. Therefore, support for policy advice must be accompanied by an understanding of the reasons why policies are not being followed. \u2022\ufffd Institutionalise approaches to enable responses that are demand-based, and inclusive of different priorities, particularly those of the most vulnerable. In many instances, there is no opportunity for marginalized groups to voice their concerns or meaningfully participate in climate change and other activities at the local and urban level. These challenges are linked to either, a lack of regulation on participatory planning, or other institutionalized practices that discriminate against specific groups of people. In informal settlements, such as urban slums, these problems may be even more exacerbated, as the communities therein have few or no opportunities to be heard and contribute to plans that are aimed at enhancing climate resilience within their communities. 15 Satterthwaite, D. 2013. \u20188 Points on Financing Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas\u2019. [http://www.iied.org/8- points-financing-climate-change-adaptation-urban-areas]. Last accessed on10 July 2013. 16 Ibid. 8 \u2022\ufffd Improve knowledge and access to best practices and resources. Many local governments across the region, particularly smaller ones, face serious capacity constraints in executing even their day-to-day functions, let alone looking at these from a climate resilience or inclusion lens. In India, several cities have just one town planning official, and similarly tiny departments for disaster management. Data is often outdated or inaccurate, and data management systems antiquated. Knowledge and information on innovative practices is hard to come by, as are resources to adapt innovations to the local context. Likewise, there is a need to encourage learning between departments or institutions in local and regional governments (horizontal coordination). Lessons from urban governance at the local level can feed into the national policy process and promote more enabling policy frameworks to build climate resilience across government. \u2022\ufffd Improve resources base of local governments - Most local governments, even if they have been assigned an impressive list of functions by legislation or policy, do not have resources to match these functions. This can be linked to a weak capacity to raise revenues, as well as to spend them effectively.. At other times, this may be due to functional devolution that is not accompanied by fiscal devolution, whereby they have no authority to raise and spend their own resources. This makes them heavily financially dependent on higher levels of government, which in turn also allows the latter much greater influence in local decision-making. Given the context specific nature of climate change manifestations, the size of investment required by urban governments to address the problems will also vary. Therefore, support to increasing the resource base of urban governments needs to be approached within the broader remit of the decentralisation processes. Where this is not possible, policies for resource transfers need to be flexible enough to ensure that resources envelopes are varied enough for urban governments to respond adequately to emerging local challenges.

Since its founding in 2002, the APTII has promoted innovative research and policy advice that seeks to define clear substantive linkages between trade and human development, and that is consistent with the objective of supporting the Millennium De- velopment Goals (MDGs). The APTII, striving to build on its previous work and achievements in this third and current phase of its work programme (2008-2011), aspires to make a significant contribution to policy dialogues by fostering re- gional trade and investment regimes that are consistent with human development goals in the region. A cen- tral challenge facing policy-makers is to facilitate patterns of inclusive regional integration that enable them to address specific development priorities and goals, particularly with reference to the development needs of least developed countries (LDCs), landlocked developing countries (LLDCs), and small island developing states (SIDS). The focus of APTII\u2019s current work programme, therefore, is on: 1) enhancing trade competitive- ness and capacity development to formulate employment-responsive and gender-responsive trade policies; and 2) strengthening the capacity to implement pro-poor regional integration strategies, including through key regional processes and/or mechanisms. In line with this focus, APTII will publish a series of studies and discussion papers highlighting the policy implications of the multifaceted dimensions of current trade trends and patterns, as well as their human development impact in the Asia Pacific region. vi Preface With the spread and deepening of the global financial crisis across the world, a number of issues are likely to be intensely debated in the coming months and years. Policy makers in the Asia Pacific region for instance need to think creatively about national, regional and global policy options addressing the inherent vulner- abilities in the region arising on account of the current nature and pattern of production and international trade in goods and services. The emergence of China and India as major regional and global economic powers, the dynamics un- leashed in its wake and the possible impact of the two economies on the rest of the countries in the region has been an issue of central interest and importance to policy makers in the region. The Policy Paper, The Potential for Cooperative Regional Industrial Development Strategies in Asia and the Implications of Emerging China and India, by Emel Memi\u015f, attempts to provide an analytical framework, and carries out an empirical assessment of the recent patterns of growth, trade and investment flows in Asia with a special emphasis on China and India. The study argues that the trade structure of countries in Asia is undergoing a change with the emergence of China and India as major economic powers, and that neighbouring countries are likely to face opportunities and/or challenges, depending on their current industrial structure. While examining the current import patterns of China and India, the Policy Paper has highlighted that countries which export highly sophisticated products are more likely to benefit from the growth dynamism in these two countries, and there may not be significant opportunities for countries whose exports comprise of low value added products. It has been argued that for neighbouring developing countries to overcome their challenges, strong domestic demand for local production would be the key to their successful integration into regional development, as domestic demand generates motivation for domestic investment and attracts high-quality, pro-trade FDI. Such a policy also assumes salience for overcoming some of the challenges on account of the ongoing global economic crisis. The findings in many ways echo the results of the previous APTII Policy Paper on South-South Regionalism and Trade Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region. From a policy perspective, the Policy Paper underscores the point that for countries to benefit from the current trading patterns in the region, they need to focus on an integrated approach to trade, industrial and social policy and argues further that it may be useful to evaluate regional integration arrangements on the basis of their potential impacts on industrial development at the sectoral level.

The results indicate that, based on Flying Geese (FG)-consistent patterns in trade structures over the last decade in the region, opportunities exist for developing nations to benefit from increasing trade and investment opportunities in the context of the growing absorption capacities of China and India. Some schol- ars have argued that should these two economies proceed and expand in tandem, they will provide growth leverage both for their neighbours and economies elsewhere through a web of supply chains. However, these opportunities also involve policy challenges for the slower-growing economies that are following China and India. Exploring the changes in the structure of China\u2019s and India\u2019s imports, the study highlights that countries exporting highly sophisticated products are likely to benefit more from the growth of these two emerging economies. In the framework of the study, it is seen that for the slow-growing potential successors barring the more advanced economies and exporters of higher levels of sophistication such as the Philippines and Viet Nam, there are no significant opportunities if the current patterns of regional trade integration are to persist. Compared to the earlier successors of Japan and the Republic of Korea, the transfer of labour-intensive start-up industries from China and India to other countries might take a longer time given the huge labour reserve of these two populous nations. The study also discusses the policy responses that Asian producer and exporter countries of labour-intensive goods should undertake to have enhanced benefits from the regional integration process. Developing nations should consider the improvement of trade facilitation and underlying frameworks which drives regional integration and growth. Attention has been raised to a lack of an institutional base that strengthens and supports the regional integration process focusing on the promotion of economic develop- ment within the region. The study suggests that there is a significant role for regional trade agreements (RTAs) and bilateral trade agreements (BTAs) in the facilitation of regional division of labour thereby opening up new possibilities for slower-growing nations. However, these agreements should be evaluated considering the possible positive and/or negative impacts on industrial development from a regional development perspec- tive, rather than the standard static approaches usually implemented. Assessments on the changes in trade volume that ignore industrial transformation through domestic or foreign investment are incomplete, and do not capture the synergies among trade, investment, and development, which have important implications for the FG pattern of development in a regional context. Attention is needed to ensure a socially cohesive progress and an approach to free trade in its larger context including its social costs. Even though international links and trade related policies are deeply significant in order to benefit from regional division of labour, historical evidence tells us that we should not downplay the role of public policy.

Recent shifts in the structure of production within the region through product fragmentation can enable slower-growing economies to reap the benefits of being part of these dynamic international net- works facilitating reinvestment of the profits in other domestic industries. Should the institutional settings be such as to provide available opportunities through an integrated trade and industrial policy framework the fragmentation of production processes can possibly confer possible gains for all. However, one cannot conclude fragmentation is good without any conditionality. Suffice it to say that the challenges are vast for the economies hosting the production of low value-added parts and pieces of the final good produced. Being locked into the labour-intensive phases of production may result in investors\u2019 perception of the host countries as low-wage labour reserves. Unless participating in international production networks facilitates job creation and capital formation and strengthens the balance of payments of that economy, the value-added created in such activities is usually transferred outside the host country through the operations of multinational firms. Rising foreign direct investment (FDI) flows among economies in the region throw up new possibili- ties for regional development. Yet, it is important that corresponding FDIs be pro-trade with backward and forward linkages with domestic industries in order to provide opportunities for the hosting countries to boost their accumulation of capital as well as extend their existing innovative capabilities. Neither rising exports of manufacturing nor FDI have always been accompanied with economic growth. Overdependence on foreign resources for domestic capital accumulation may not always enable the receiving country to receive the investment in particular sectors of industry. Industrialization which depends on domestic market expansion can be a better strategy in a rapidly integrating world. The significance of domestic demand with respect to domestic investment in capital accumulation is critical for a FG pattern of development. Growth in domestic demand proves to be a strong policy for rising employment as well. Finally, this study asserts that the evolution of a FG pattern requires a holistic policy approach to regional integration through trade, industrialization, and, hence, development. In addition, the criteria for receiving high-quality FDI inflows must include qualitative measures along with existing quantitative measures. Criteria such as knowledge intensity and provisioning of resources for innovation have formed new policy measures for FDI. High-quality FDI is critical for enabling a country to join the FG pattern of development. 1 Cooperative strategies in regional integration based on trade and international investment flows have turned out to be very important for the sustainability of region-wide development. The famous analogy between the flying pattern of wild geese and empirical observations on the formation of regional industrialization in Asia was introduced to the development literature by Kaname Akamatsu as early as the 1930s. The flying geese (FG) pattern of development involves a process of regional integration through which industries in advanced countries are adopted in less advanced countries, creating an international division of labour that resembles the cooperative interdependence implicit in the inverse V-pattern of flying geese.1 In this framework, coun- tries with technologically advanced industries are followed by successor2 economies with less advanced industries. In an idealized form, all countries move forward together in an orderly fashion. A number of studies looking at the regional industrial development patterns in Asian economies over the last six decades have pointed to evidence consistent with the FG pattern of development. In these analy- ses, Japan primarily plays the role of a leading goose. First-tier countries, consisting of Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan, Province of China (PoC), are succeeded by the second-tier countries of Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand, and, finally, by the recently emerging countries, such as China and Viet Nam, in the order of their level of industrial sophistication. Within the emerging economies, the recent rise of China and India has initiated significant debates in international political and economic arenas. Scholars have been asking whether China and India will become comrades or competitors with the rest of the region (Ahearne et al. 2003, 2006; Xing 2007; De Castro 2006; Kui 2006; Kwan 2002). Will this recent development disrupt the presumed FG pattern of development? Have China and India caught up with more advanced countries and become leading geese? If so, do they create either opportunities or obstacles to the development of other developing countries in the region? This study aims to provide a useful basis for a potentially revamped FG framework in Asia, and it discusses the possible opportunities and challenges for the other developing nations in the region posed by emerging China", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a70bbe0a-2c4c-4c8c-8760-5ad7b8942246": {"__data__": {"id_": "a70bbe0a-2c4c-4c8c-8760-5ad7b8942246", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Potential for Cooperative Regional Industrial Development Strategies in Asia and the Implications of Emerging China and India", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8e48958e97f7d86c9808a9a7b2192b0195370029c5927ee64fcb3f0624330c44"}}, "hash": "8e48958e97f7d86c9808a9a7b2192b0195370029c5927ee64fcb3f0624330c44", "text": "and India. It is important to point out that the question of whether the FG framework constitutes a theory of development or simply describes an empirical observation has not been resolved in the literature. There is no consensus as to whether the FG pattern of development only describes particular shifts in the industrial structure of a country relative to its regional partners at a specific point in time, or it is a genuine \u2018theory\u2019 of industrial development that can be applied repeatedly. Looking at Akamatsu\u2019s original argument, it is possible 1. Introduction 1 The conceptual framework of the FG pattern of development in Asia and critiques of FG framework are summarized in Annex A. 2 To avoid analytical confusion and misinterpretation, we use the term \u201csuccessor\u201d instead of the more often-used term \u201cfollower\u201d for countries that are technologically less advanced. The use of the term \u201csuccessor\u201d or \u201cfollower\u201d in this literature is not meant to describe such countries are being geopolitically subordinate to countries with more advanced industries. In our view, regional cooperative patterns of industrial development are not automatic outcomes of market relations (which in earlier times were also imposed by colonial supremacy) but instead require strategic policy interventions by all countries involved. 2 to argue that the FG framework does not provide a complete theory of development, i.e., the FG framework is not an attempt to explain the underlying factors behind a particular economy\u2019s advancement. To put it differently, based on our reading of Akamatsu (1962) we believe that the reasons why one or another country is associated with the leading goose is not pinpointed by the FG framework; rather, the framework provides an empirical pattern that sheds light on the development dynamics of a region. This study discusses the FG pattern of development as a description of the changes in industrial structure that have important implica- tions in employment patterns as well as the productivity level of members of a society. We take the view that, beyond empirical patterns, strategic policy choices are indispensable in understanding the spread of regional industrial development. The position of the countries in the FG formation is not perfectly fixed like the flying pattern of wild geese; rather, the ranking of countries has a dynamic nature that changes over time. In this study we aim to provide a framework that can be used to evaluate trade outcomes within an industrial development perspec- tive that can be considered as the first step in impact assessments. We implement an empirical method that enables us to perform a dynamic analysis that indicates shifts in the advancement level of an economy within the region. We calculate the average sophistication level of exported goods by nations in terms of technologi- cal content, which we call \u201ccountry sophistication.\u201d Country sophistication informs us on the relative position of nations within a region. We then evaluate our results introducing a framework (using S-shaped curves) that recasts the FG pattern, deriving some important policy implications in terms of opportunities and challenges, from a FG perspective, based on our empirical analysis. The historical evidence regarding the FG pattern of development also indicates major shifts in the trends of economic growth, trade, and investment patterns in each country group (Akamatsu 1962; Tung 2007). Accordingly, our specific objectives also involve an as- sessment of this historical evidence, looking for similar patterns in economic growth, trade, and investment among the nations of the region, with a particular emphasis on the emerging economies. The focus of the current study is limited to the question of the potentials and challenges of a revamped FG pattern of development in Asia. The FG framework not only provides a useful perspective to evaluate changes in the industrial structure of an economy but also can be helpful in evaluating regional and bilat- eral trade agreements from an industrial development perspective. Industrial development per se enhances the employment, productivity, and capabilities of the members of a society if buttressed by the required social programs in health and education. A human development approach to regional development must pay particular attention to the impact of industrial development on empowerment, productivity, equity, and sustainability3. If human development is the goal, shifts in industrial structure should be evaluated as to whether they generate new employment, help eradicate poverty, or enhance people\u2019s well-being. The specific application of the FG framework in this study can be considered as an initial step in analyzing trade from an industrial development perspective. However, further research is required to investigate the human develop- ment impact of a potential FG pattern of development in the region.

We observe FG-predicted shifts in country sophistication, particularly for countries where we observe major changes in growth, trade, and investment patterns. \uf06c The pace at which Japan or the first-tier countries transformed their place in the regional division of labour may not be relevant in the case of China or India. Rather, it might take a long time for China and India to move away from production of less sophisticated products, the majority of which correspond to the export goods of other less technologically advanced developing countries, due to the sheer sizes 3 See Memi\u015f and Montes (2005) for a more detailed discussion of these facets of human development and a human development approach to trade. 3 of the two economies. Further, export concentrations in terms of destination are observed among some developing countries in lower technological ranks, which might signal possible difficult development challenges for these countries. However, there exists significant potential if less developed countries are able to benefit fully from the growing absorption capacities of China and India. \uf06c The import patterns of China and India show that the shares of highly sophisticated products have risen. This provides promising evidence for growth externalities for countries that are exporters of these products, i.e., first and second-tier nations. What should be the policy responses of the followers? \uf06c Facilitate agreed specialization in regional trade agreements or bilateral trade arrangements with lead- ing geese. Any trade agreement either at the regional or bilateral level should be evaluated in terms of the possible positive and/or negative affects on industrial development from a FG-type development perspective. \uf06c In order to achieve cooperative regional industrial development through foreign-direct investment (FDI), high-quality pro-trade FDI is required. FDI should enable a country to take part in international production networks that support job creation, capital formation and improve the country\u2019s balance of payments; otherwise, the value produced domestically is only to the advantage of external parties. \uf06c The process of regional integration, being part of an international production network, should be assessed not only by quantitative measures but also by qualitative measures, such as the effect of a unit of FDI on economic growth, employment, skill enhancement, or on the competitiveness of local enterprises. \uf06c Domestic demand as well as external demand plays an important role in a FG-consistent development pattern. Overdependence on foreign resources through exports implicitly assumes that external de- mand will always exist. In addition, when foreign resources are available, they may not be directed to the industries that need these resources most. Domestic demand matters for achieving economic growth, and the increasing size of domestic demand establishes the motivation for domestic as well as foreign investment. \uf06c A holistic approach to development at the regional level is needed for the sustainable economic devel- opment of the successor countries. Any trade or investment policy should be accompanied and led by an industrial and public policy. This study is presented in the four sections. The following section investigates recent trends in the trade and investment patterns of Asian countries over the last two decades. Section 3 provides a recast of a FG framework within a regional development context and summarizes the empirical findings. Section 4 presents possible policy outcomes suggested by the empirical analysis and discusses the scope for development- oriented cooperative regional integration. The last section concludes with the main findings of this study and some suggestions for further research. 4 The historical evidence regarding Japan\u2019s economic development since World War II establishes four facts on FG-consistent economic growth, trade, and investment trends: a) Japan experienced enormous economic growth during this period \u2014 the highest in the world during the 1950s and 1960s. b) Japan\u2019s exports and imports have grown at significant rates. Japan\u2019s share in world exports rose from 4 percent during the 1960s to 8 percent in 2000. The yearly growth of imports increased from 4 percent on average during the 1980s to 9.5 percent since 2000. c) Japan\u2019s major trading partners and countries that have received the majority of Japanese FDI have been located within the nearby Asia-Pacific region. d) The range of income levels of Japan\u2019s partner economies is much broader than those of countries that are trade or investment partners of other integrated regions, such as the European Union and North America. In this regard, we look at recent trends in economic growth, trade, and investment in Asia to see if there have been shifts in the regional division of labour. 2.1 GDP growth trends Despite the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ffa7054-fc38-4021-93f7-ddc7dc3543e3": {"__data__": {"id_": "2ffa7054-fc38-4021-93f7-ddc7dc3543e3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Potential for Cooperative Regional Industrial Development Strategies in Asia and the Implications of Emerging China and India", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "288e3cc1eb5c04200ab414551df790499a56bc36026a1c1645ee8dcf44423957"}, "3": {"node_id": "bdd1fdec-2cf3-4cd1-9a89-93114bcc965d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cf01a409924b41356a39968529dce5bd12b3780cd75c1cc13c7464e11b22a42d"}}, "hash": "7c69930b1d17fdc3193ce937556e58d810d87c44d53b4ecc0353bf22a3573c57", "text": "financial crisis of the 1990s, growth performance of Asian economies has been impressive (see Figure 2.1). Annual average growth rates of GDP per capita for all sub-regions in Asia show enormous success when compared to the global average, and these high economic growth rates have been sustained over a long period. In the East Asia and Pacific region, for example, with the exception of the crisis years the growth rate has been at least three times higher than the world average. Furthermore, China\u2019s growth rates have been even higher; and India\u2019s growth was not disrupted during the 1990s, resulting in uninterrupted progress over the decade. 2. Recent trends in growth, investment, and trade patterns in Asia 5 Figure 2.1 GDP per capita growth (annual average %) Source: See Annex Table B1. In every decade after World War II there have been sustained episodes of rapid growth in at least one Asian economy when there was no other region with similar records (Tung 2007; World Bank 1993). As noted earlier, in the 1950s and 1960s the Japanese economy reached the highest growth rates in the world. In the 1970s first-tier Asian economies replaced Japan; and since the 1980s the highest growth rates have shifted to China. High-growth rates over the last decade show FG-consistent trends. These prolonged periods of economic growth have been the subject of a long debate in the literature. Scholars have asked why and how these Asian countries managed to maintain high growth rates and why this pattern was not observed elsewhere. The two pillars of these sustained episodes of growth are proposed as trade and FDI. The following sections will focus on these dimensions. 2.2 Expansion of external trade Similar to economic growth, trade growth rates in all Asia sub-regions stand much above the global average (Figures 2.2 and 2.3). Growth rates in Chinese exports have been unique over the last decade. For the period 2001-2006 we observe a declining trend in global imports and exports but a rising trend in all sub-regions in Asia. In the case of China, the annual growth rate of exports and imports for 2001-2006 are approximately 25 and 20 percent, respectively. 6 Figure 2.2 Export growth of goods and services (annual average %) Source: See Annex Table B1. Figure 2.3 Import growth of goods and services (annual average %) Source: See Annex Table B1. 7 In addition to the growth rate, the direction of trade also matters for an examination of consistency with FG predictions. The export matrices of the region with destination countries are displayed below. Table 2.1 shows FG-consistent patterns of trade in the region. The share of China as a destination country rose in the exports of almost all countries. This indicates the growing significance of China as an importer of goods, especially from relatively advanced countries in the region such as Japan, the Republic of Korea, and second- tier economies, implying that China\u2019s growing imports consist more of high-tech intermediate capital goods. On the other hand, the share of Chinese exports to some of the first and second-tier countries, namely the Republic of Korea, Indonesia, and Malaysia, increased from 1994 to 2003, whereas Japan\u2019s share declined, indicating that China\u2019s role has been changing in the family of successor geese. India\u2019s share as a destination country also rose in terms of exports of all countries, other than Japan (which remained flat), even though the rate of increase is slower compared to that of China. Particularly, India\u2019s share in exports from Nepal and Sri Lanka showed a significant increase, accounting for 52.4 percent and 5.0 percent total exports, respectively. The share of neighbouring countries in India\u2019s exports also increased slightly from 1994 to 2003. In summary, evidence displayed in this section shows FG-consistent shifts in the region\u2019s trade structure, particularly the rising significance of China and India, which have large domestic markets and have became important trading partners of the regional economies.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template":

Source: Calculations are based on United Nations Commodity Trade Database (Standard International Trade Classification) Revision 3, provided by UN Statistics Division, available at: comtrade.un.org/. 10 2.3 Trends in FDI flows The experience of the last two decades has shown that FDI plays a critical role in the expansion of external trade as well as industrial development.4 Table 2.2 shows the shares of FDI inflows as a percentage of gross fixed capital formation in each region/country. A declining trend is observed in Japan\u2019s FDI inflows, which is consistent with the FG framework. Declining trends are also observed in some of the newly industrialized economies (NIEs), such as Indonesia and Thailand, implying that emerging economies might have created difficulties for the Asian NIEs, as pointed out by the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD 2007). In 2007, China and Hong Kong (SAR) of China have kept their positions as the largest FDI recipients in Asia, followed by Singapore and India. Since 2004 the inward FDI performance indexes of China and India have risen, while those of Indonesia and Thailand have declined. In the case of China, the share of FDI inflows of total investment has been quite stagnant in the range of 8 to 10 percent since 2000. This observation contradicts the argument raised rather frequently that China\u2019s economic growth owes much to the increasing size of FDI inflows. Although FDI inflows into China are quite high in absolute terms, their share in total investment remains stable and does not correspond to the majority of total investment in the country.5 In general, FDI inflows in the region suggest a pattern in keeping with the FG framework. Table 2.3 shows that FDI outflows as a percentage of total investment increased overall. According to UNCTAD (2007), the rise has been at a rate of more than 50 percent in 2006; and the largest sources of FDI in the region in 2006 were China and India, which is FG-consistent.

However, Liu, Chow, and Li (2006) suggest the opposite; the ASEAN-4 (Indo- nesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand) received above-average inward FDI from the high-income OECD economies for the period 1990-2003, whereas China\u2019s FDI from the high-income OECD economies was below average. 11 Table 2.2 Inward FDI flows as a percentage of gross fixed capital formation, by host region and economy, 1980-2006 Region/economy 1980 1990 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 World 2.2 4.2 20.6 12.5 9.3 7.5 8.5 10.4 12.6 Developed economies 2.5 4.3 22.0 12.2 8.9 6.5 6.6 9.3 11.8 Japan 0.1 0.2 0.7 0.6 1.0 0.7 0.7 0.3 -0.6 Asia (includes West Asia) 0.2 4.1 13.6 10.5 8.3 8.3 10.3 11.3 12.9 South, East, and South- East Asia 1.7 4.9 15.3 11.2 8.9 8.4 10.2 10.4 11.5 East Asia 0.7 3.5 17.3 11.5 8.9 8.1 10.0 10.0 10.1 China 0.1 3.5 10.3 10.5 10.4 8.6 8.0 8.8 8.0 Hong Kong (SAR), China 7.6 16.3 138.9 55.7 26.4 40.6 96.4 90.4 103.9 Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea . . . . . . . . .

The share of Asian countries as recipients of Japan\u2019s investments has increased since 1981 (Table 2.4). Shares of first and second-tier coun- tries slightly increased over the two decades 1985 to 2005; and China has been a major recipient of Japan\u2019s FDI since 1995, growing to 40 percent in 2005. India\u2019s share doubled in 2005 compared to the previous year, but in terms of overall size this seems negligible compared to China\u2019s share. Similar changes in the structure of FDI outflows were seen in the Republic of Korea for the period 1985- 2004 (Table 2.5). The share of recipient countries shows that Malaysia and Indonesia were the major recipients of the Republic of Korea\u2019s investment in the region during the period 1985-1990. However, from 1995 onward the share of these ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations) countries declined, whereas the Republic of Korea\u2019s FDI into China rapidly increased, and China quickly became the top recipient of the Republic of Korea\u2019s investment in 1995. In 2004, 57 percent of the Republic of Korea\u2019s outward FDI went to Asia, and more than two-thirds of that investment went to China. 13 Developing countries such as Cambodia, Lao PDR, Mongolia, and Sri Lanka currently receive only a very small percentage of both Japan\u2019s and the Republic of Korea\u2019s FDI. This suggests that they are not likely successor countries to China and India, an observation confirmed by recent figures on China\u2019s FDI outflows6 (Table 2.6)7. A comparison of China\u2019s FDI structure with those of Japan and the Republic of Korea reveals a dif- ferent picture in terms of destination. However, whether this is sufficient to argue that FDI figures show a FG-consistent character or not is unclear. In order to make a more robust comparison we need data over a longer time period for China; thus, it might be too early to make a conclusion. Yet, Hong and Sun (2004) argue that the composition of recipient countries of China\u2019s FDI outflows is quite similar to that of the Republic of Korea during the period 1988-2002, and to Japan\u2019s outflows twenty years ago, in the period 1968-1982, targeting resource-rich regions and countries in Latin America and Africa. These facts are also confirmed by the figures presented in Table B.3. Given the recent developments in economic growth and trade flows within the region, we argue that empirical trends provide supporting evidence for an existing FG pattern of develop- ment to a major degree. The expansion of FDI inflows into the region, as well as the rising trade flows out of and into emerging economies, signifies FG-consistent patterns. The recent expansion of FDI and trade flows indicates the shifts in the production structure. Since the 1990s the expansion in cross-border production sharing, the disintegration of production activities, and fragmentation \u2014 that is, the production of a part or parts of a larger component (particularly in the manufacturing sector) \u2014 have been more apparent.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f240d924-9fb5-46ca-9d34-71dac6049015": {"__data__": {"id_": "f240d924-9fb5-46ca-9d34-71dac6049015", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Potential for Cooperative Regional Industrial Development Strategies in Asia and the Implications of Emerging China and India", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ed09c642eb8b0f83f7207d177c33452c9ebd405d6b3ae6e3af1b6e1a7eebcb5e"}, "2": {"node_id": "e2e91653-d564-4ace-bd7b-9ee1d70118da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ddbe72ebe42887caf05708f95a41d5737a913ccc282d467bd845cbc9cab89e0a"}}, "hash": "682b6e9e5ddee6b6067d5d005fee77ff49c32955782560bf23243c071e6f4291", "text": "At the same time, intra-industry trade through agglomerations built with international investment flows increased in the region.

Thus, here we compare Japan and the Republic of Korea only with China. 7 There are many contributions in the literature that discuss both the size and the composition of China\u2019s FDI outflows. Cheng and Ma (2007), for instance, describe China\u2019s outward FDI flows from 1979 to the mid-1990s in detail. The study shows that more than 60 percent of China\u2019s FDI went into the services sector, and that more than two-thirds of these investments were received by Hong-Kong (SAR) of China and Macau (SAR) of China. Twenty-five percent of China\u2019s FDI went to mining, and the remaining to manufacturing. 14 Table 2.5 Republic of Korea\u2019s FDI outflows: Destination country share in total (%) 1985 1987 1990 1995 2000 2003 2004 World excluding OECD countries 28.2 51.5 7.3 61.9 61.2 61.5 59.0 ASEAN countries 13.9 31.1 23.9 17.8 5.4 14.5 8.4 Asia .. .. .. 58.1 20.8 57.1 57.0 Asia - excluding Near & Middle East .. .. .. .. 19.0 .. 51.7 NICs1 .. .. .. 3.8 8.2 9.5 6.4 NICs2 .. .. .. 6.2 0.5 1.4 1.6 Cambodia .. .. .. .. .. .. 0.2 China .. .. 1.7 29.4 7.1 37.1 38.4 Hong Kong (SAR), China 1.0 0.6 0.5 2.9 5.7 2.5 3.3 India .. .. 0.1 0.5 0.4 0.5 0.7 Indonesia 5.5 30.7 17.1 4.4 1.6 2.2 0.9 Japan 0.3 0.3 0.7 3.8 0.9 1.4 4.8 Malaysia 8.4 0.2 1.8 3.8 -0.4 0.2 0.6 Mongolia .. .. .. .. .. .. 0.1 Philippines .. 0.1 3.4 2.0 0.4 0.5 0.2 Singapore .. 0.1 0.3 0.8 2.4 6.7 2.8 Sri Lanka .. .. 1.6 0.1 .. .. 0.0 Taiwan, Province of China .. .. 0.2 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 Thailand .. 0.0 1.3 0.4 0.5 0.8 0.8 Viet Nam .. .. 0.0 6.4 .. .. 2.9 Source: OECD International Direct Investment Statistics compiled by OECD Directorate for Financial and Enterprise Affairs, available at: www.oecd.org/statisticsdata/0,3381,en_2649_34863_1_119656_1_1_1,00.html.

To answer this question, we need to look at trade and investment at more disaggregated levels in each country. The type of industries that are significant in a particular country\u2019s trade might also inform us as to the country\u2019s role in the regional division of labour and its evolution. In order to find a benchmark description that we can utilize, we go back to the original 1962 study by Akamatsu. 3.1 Empirical methods The underpinning mechanism of the FG framework involves the transfer of certain industries from more advanced countries to less developed economies of the region, which occurs with industrial upgrading (Aka- matsu\u2019s first variant of a FG model) and the catching-up of less developed nations (Akamatsu\u2019s second variant of a FG model).

To analyze these patterns, we aim to demonstrate a dynamic picture of the countries of interest over time using our own empirical method. Our method is built upon methods that have been used earlier in the literature to verify a potential pattern of FG framework (see Box 3.1). Box 3.1 Empirical methods used in earlier research A widespread method used in earlier studies is the calculation of the revealed comparative advantage (RCA) index. RCA measures the relative strength of a country in exports of certain products, which can be defined as the ratio of export share of each sector in total exports of the country to the share of exports of that good in world exports. In a FG context, RCA is used to rank countries according to their degree of comparative advantage and to identify the shifts in comparative advantage of countries in a region. Another common method is based upon the co-variations between FDI and RCAs, which helps to ana- lyze the role of FDI as a channel to recycle comparative advantage. Dowling and Cheang (2000) asked whether the industry\u2019s share of FDI was linked or matched with the RCA vectors of that industry. Authors provided evidence for the validity of the FG framework pattern for 1970-1995 by comparing the Spearman rank correla- tion coefficients between the RCA vectors of countries, or groups of countries, for the years 1970, 1985, and 1995. An analysis of the relative specialization of the countries in the region in three industries \u2014 computer, electronics, and textile and clothing \u2014 show rankings consistent with a FG pattern. Their results indicate Japan to be the leading country, followed by the NIEs, which are in turn followed by the ASEAN-4. The FDI patterns 3. Empirical analysis and assessments 8 Sequential move of labor-intensive industries from a relatively advanced country to a relatively disadvantaged one is termed by Ozawa (2005) as \u201cmarket recycling\u201d or \u201crecycling of comparative advantage.\u201d 17 in the region revealed that they reflect recycling of comparative advantage8 as suggested by the FDI-based FG framework. Likewise, Cutler et al. (2003) provided confirming evidence for a FG pattern of development, exploring the labour-intensive sectors\u2019 trade patterns among Japan, the NIEs, and the ASEAN-4. Based upon our discussions on empirical testing of the FG pattern, the method we choose must be able to provide a dynamic description of the shifts of countries within the region\u2019s structure of division of labour, which will then enable us with a metric to order the ranks of the countries as suggested by the FG pattern, i.e., the leading goose and the latecomer or group of latecomer geese. One such method along these lines is introduced by Kwan (2002). He analyzes product characteristics classified based upon their sophistica- tion levels. Product sophistication depicts both the product\u2019s and the economy\u2019s advancement level (as a weighted average of all product sophistications); and by ordering the development levels of the countries in terms of their export structure9 this method proves to be useful to trace the sequential ordering of individual countries, as in a FG formation. Our empirical analysis starts with the calculation of sophistication indices both at the sectoral and national levels. We then construct distribution of product sophistications (SPs) for individual countries, fol- lowing Kwan (2002).10 His method has two stages. One is the calculation of the level of sophistication indices of the traded products, i.e., SP. The other is the development of an index for the country by calculating the weighted average of the overall sophistication indices of exported products of the country,11 i.e., country sophistication (SC).12 If a single country is a part of the FG pattern of development, in our framework one would expect to see an improvement of SC over time as it moves forward in the FG formation. The pattern of SC is first rapidly moving up and then slowing down as the SC reaches a particular level of sophistication. At low levels of sophistication increasing SC might be much easier to achieve in comparison to high sophistication levels. In a very crude way, we would expect to see this change as an extended S-shaped curve, which maps an individual country\u2019s SC over time (Figures 3.1a).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "96c37ad8-b044-45e9-a9c5-718de28ea3fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "96c37ad8-b044-45e9-a9c5-718de28ea3fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Potential for Cooperative Regional Industrial Development Strategies in Asia and the Implications of Emerging China and India", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "05438ca165612f599f227b7a6b4468e21429f36a3b2fc7e4d42e2ce0d93516b6"}, "2": {"node_id": "b38414cd-fd48-436a-b3c5-15b727f1fc06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1117a6fe2813c9c0b0d4e20893d54b81d0832b892c157b025cccc2456c98f75e"}}, "hash": "372cac03af57f6129f5a06de166056af50eecdcddb3ed12dfdf59cf07a726ad5", "text": "In a regional context, if one is to look at the group of countries of the FG formation at a certain point in time and rank them in a linear formation as the leading goose, then the first-tier followed by second, third, and fourth-tier countries, the scatter-plot of SPs would provide a similar picture (Figure 3.1b).

If the FG pattern of development was in effect in this region, then the evolution of SC of a single country over time should appear identical to the snapshot of that region at a point in time, just as the figures below. The differences among countries in reality will take us away from this abstraction. Nevertheless, if there does exist a FG pattern, then we might expect to get empirical results along these lines. In fact, these differences among countries, specifically the peculiarities of China and India, shape the heart of our study. 9 Ideally, one should explore and analyze as much information as possible provided by the production, trade, and investment structure. A way to approach this might be to explore the distribution of products, considering their characteristics and their shares in total produc- tion, trade, and investment, respectively. However, our focus here will be mainly on trade structure. Note that the scope of this paper puts particular emphasis on shifts in the regional division of labor through trade flows. 10 The method used here is a modification of Kwan\u2019s (2002) original method with differences, to be explained in Annex C. 11 For a detailed explanation, see Annex C. 12 For the pros and cons of the Sophistication Indices, see Annex C. 18 3.2 Data and empirical results In order to calculate sophistication indices, we used the UN commodity trade database for the global in- ternational trade flow of each product and the World Development Indicators dataset for per capita GDP (PPP at current US dollars). For product classification, we used the five-digit13 Standard International Trade Classification Revision 3 (SITC rev. 3) series. Our data covers 2,243 manufacturing sectors14 for 162 countries. In order to capture SC changes over the recent decade, we repeat the two-step procedure (see Annex C) for the three years: 1995, 2000, and 2005.15 The main indicator we investigate is the distribution of SCj for individual countries and their dynamic shift over the 10-year period. Our findings confirm the advanced level of the manufacturing exports of Japan; the first-tier and second-tier countries depict a FG-consistent pattern over the period of analysis (Figure 3.2). Japan has the most advanced export structure, with the highest SC level in each year, followed by the first-tier16 countries, the second-tier countries, and China and India. We also observe that there is a significant shift and a faster advancement change in the second-tier\u2019s exports sophistication level in comparison to the first-tier countries, particularly from 1995 to 2000. Figure 3.2 displays a picture consistent with our earlier argument that the sophistication level of a country goes up at an increasing rate during early stages of development and then at a slower pace as the country\u2019s development level increases. Figure 3.3 also shows that the differences in sophistication level among countries shrinks as they climb the development ladder as a result of getting closer to the technology frontier. Figures 3.4a, 3.4b, and 3.4c present the SC evolution of each country over time and illustrates FG-con- sistent patterns, i.e., rank ordering among the countries in general stays the same over the period of analysis, except for a couple of countries. Among the second-tier countries, Malaysia had a lower sophistication level than Thailand in 1995, but achieved a higher sophistication level than Thailand in 2000. Similar improvements were made in Indonesia in 2000 and Viet Nam in 2005 (Figure 3.4b). The Philippines\u2019 sophistication level in 2005 became as high as Indonesia after experiencing a dramatic decline in 2000.17 Nepal\u2019s exports present a 13 UN commodity trade data provides the five-digit series as the highest level of disaggregation in SITC. 14 Industry codes represent following manufacturing industries: SITC 5 - Chemicals and related products (not elsewhere specified); SITC 6 - Manufactured goods classified chiefly by material; SITC 7 - Machinery and transport equipment; STIC 8 - Miscellaneous manufactured articles.

Mongolia also shows a high degree of transformation, whereas Bangladesh and Cambodia display relatively stagnant patterns. 17 The decline in 2000 was the result of the huge variation in the share of electronic-integrated circuits and micro-assemblies in total exports, which rose from 12 percent in 1995 to 41 percent in 2000 and then declined to 13 percent in 2005. Since micro-assemblies have a low sophistication index; when its share rose to a level that corresponded to almost half the country\u2019s exports, it greatly affected the average sophistication index. 18 Similar to the Philippines case, Nepal\u2019s exports show a decline in 2000 due to the rise in the share of carpets and other textile floor cover- ings, which has a very low sophistication level. The share of carpets and textile floor coverings went up to 40 percent of its total exports in 2000 but declined to 10 percent in 2003, pushing the sophistication index up again.

As the share of the relatively more sophisticated products and that of low-technology goods go down, the country\u2019s trade structure changes. The shift of the distribution through this compositional change for a country can be seen as the left tail of the distribution gets thinner and the right tail gets fatter over time. This will be reflected upon the transformation process of a particular country\u2019s export structure. (See Figures 3.5 and 3.6 as an example of a dynamic change in SP distribution.) Figures 3.5a and 3.5b display the distribution of exports\u2019 shares by product types on the y-axis (all shares add up to 1) and show the level of sophistication indices on the x-axis. In order to provide informative and interpretable representations of the distribution, we first grouped the sectors into sophistication index ranges from 0 to 40,000 by 1,000 units: e.g., 0-1,000; 1,001-2,000 .... 39,000-40,000. Next, we calculated the total share of sectors (y-axis) compiled under each range in total exports.

China\u2019s export structure shows the most dynamic picture as the compositional change in SP distribution is leaning towards high sophisticated goods. Likewise, India\u2019s export structure shows a compositional change with an increase in the shares of highly sophisticated products.19 Figure 3.5b presents SP distributions for the Philippines, Viet Nam, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Mongolia, and Nepal. There are major compositional shifts in product sophistication in the Philippines, Viet Nam, and Mongolia. On the other hand, the Bangladesh and Cambodia export structures are quite stagnant.

Philippines Viet Nam Bangladesh Cambodia Nepal Mongolia 25 An important question is whether the export structural changes of the more advanced countries allow new opportunities for the late comers. In other words, do the declining shares of low sophisticated products in the exports of the first and second-tier countries and of China and India reflect their graduation from these industries? The answer to this question is not only significant in terms of what it says about the potential for the latecomers but it also might provide some information on possible challenges posed by emerging China and India. A good way to approach this question is by looking at the change in a country\u2019s market share in the world. In this section, we consider those goods with SP levels less than 25,000. Goods falling within this SP range are primarily those with declining shares in the leading economies, which also correspond mostly to low value-added, low-technology, and labour-intensive products. Figure 3.6 shows the following results: \uf06c Except for India and China, there exists evidence that both first and second-tier countries are losing their market share in world exports of goods with low SP levels\u2014a finding consistent with the FG pattern. The degree of the losses depends on the peculiar features of each economy. \uf06c Japan\u2019s export figures confirm systematic declines over the years in its share of all low-sophisticated products. \uf06c China\u2019s share of exports shows a rising trend in almost all product categories except for those at the very low end. \uf06c The extent of the increases in China\u2019s share in global exports depicts a positive correlation between the shares and the level of sophistication of the products. Despite the compositional shift in China\u2019s export structure in favor of more sophisticated products, Chinese firms show basically no sign of moving out of low-sophisticated exports. Rather, Chinese firms have increased their export share in all types of low- sophisticated products. It would be unjust to expect China to follow exactly the same transformations experienced in the lead- ing economies, given its unique size and nature. Nevertheless, its rising share of all products in the world market gives us some hint about the possibilities for other developing nations in the region with respect to a revamped FG pattern in the near future. One can simply argue that if any FG pattern can somehow be sustained, shifts in Chinese exports towards more sophisticated goods will most probably take a much lon- ger time as compared to earlier experiences of the leaders in the region. Such peculiarities of the Chinese economy do certainly matter for the FG pattern of development. Similar to China, India\u2019s exports of low-sophisticated products have increased, even though the extent of the rise is negligible compared to China. Further, India shows no sign of moving away from such low- sophisticated products. A more dynamic upward shift in Indian exports can be observed in products ranging between SP 15,000 and 20,000, including the manufacturing of textile yarn, fabrics, apparel and clothing accessories, and nonferrous metals.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6197798e-6354-4d7a-96be-586e2284b783": {"__data__": {"id_": "6197798e-6354-4d7a-96be-586e2284b783", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Potential for Cooperative Regional Industrial Development Strategies in Asia and the Implications of Emerging China and India", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d2b0129eca2ef39f4b2eb8fe31d9036763f7114b624b557f85ef8d5684f351e5"}, "2": {"node_id": "db99c955-8c6e-44e5-b656-01eb5bb3bd73", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fdb8df0dc2a94ae16e0fa03b53906d51c121d030e84a2598095cf8640ec84e3c"}}, "hash": "4a215134360ee1e2a8ce0579aa7a1ed0bc958f516ec472e0d3fa708eb2d14c8e", "text": "Overall, our findings on China and India suggest that there is little optimism for such countries as Bangladesh, Cambodia, Nepal, and Mongolia, whose almost entire export structure are comprised of low- sophisticated products.

We will also draw attention to some challenges that could be faced particularly by relatively less developed countries with respect to the emerging players in the region. These possibilities and challenges are presented below, following each of the \u201cfacts\u201d that we have discussed earlier in this study. Fact 1. Country sophistication (SC) indices show a FG-consistent pattern when the sophistication curve of the exports of each country/country-group is S-shaped and when the dynamic picture of the distribution of so- phistication indices of exports shows a rising share of highly sophisticated goods while shares of low sophisticated goods decline. Do neighboring developing countries have to worry about the upward shift of sophistication indices in emerging economies? The pace at which advanced countries move away from products that require relatively lower levels of capital intensification and technology does matter. The number of years that would be left to the successors to produce and export low-capital and low-tech commodities plays a significant role in deter- mining the economic outcome for the rest of the region. Whether or not the advanced economies abandon the jump-start industries completely while climbing the sophistication curve is another issue; this has been debated ever since Akamatsu\u2019s original contribution. For instance, researchers have found that even Japan has not moved out of labour-intensive industries entirely (Bernard and Ravenhill 1995). Clearly, the evolution of climbing the sophistication curve depends on several factors, some of which are exogenous to the production and trade structure of an economy and some of which are endogenous. While identification of each factor might not be easy, some factors are evident from earlier research. For example, the geographical size of a country or other spatial conditions is a crucial determinant of the nature of a country\u2019s production and trade structure. Effective industrial and/or trade policies at all levels are also instrumental in making a difference in shifting the role of each economy in the regional division of labour. With respect to the pace of the evolution, the rate at which Japan or the first-tier countries changed their place in the regional division of labour might not be applicable for China or India. One underlying reason is the sheer size of their economies, including their labour pool. Tung (2003) points to a possible disruption in the FG pattern of development if certain latecomers have become new leaders in the region but remain too long in low-technology industries. In the case of China, for instance, the relocation of labour-intensive low value-added production might take a much longer time due to the large labour pool in the interior of the country and restrictions on labour migration between regions. The urban/rural divide as well as coastal/ inland divide indicates that the FG formation may not appear rapidly not only in labour-intensive industries but in other industries as well. In addition to physical regional dualities, social dualities make any discussion of China or India as one country extremely difficult. For instance, Feng (2007) describes China as one country yet three people: urbanities, migrants, and peasants \u2014 groupings that determine the boundaries of inequality 4. Opportunities and challenges for cooperative regional integration in Asia 28 in China. Such inequalities warn us to be cautious when one considers the process of industrial upgrading or shifts in production only within an economic perspective. Social constructs play a significant role both on the nature and speed of the process. Despite these observations, it is still possible to identify opportunities for developing neighbors when China and India join the group of leaders. First, Chinese exports do not affect each and every developing economy in the region. Some argue that manufacturing goods exports would be affected negatively all over the world with a rise of China, but Hanson and Robertson (2007), for example, have counter-argued that had China\u2019s export supply capacity been constant over the period 1996-2003, demand for exports would have been 0.6 to 1.4 percent higher in the 10 developing countries studied.20 Thus, even", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9d82aebf-92c9-4059-a5d0-4e5e16f8a813": {"__data__": {"id_": "9d82aebf-92c9-4059-a5d0-4e5e16f8a813", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Potential for Cooperative Regional Industrial Development Strategies in Asia and the Implications of Emerging China and India", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8bd76ea539d889958f2f12f422dbdf82d35c6a63262215c494d82653b84e12a3"}, "3": {"node_id": "822fc1b3-211e-41c7-8283-b4f30fa7c93f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bbe7a7210386d31fcfa2a6f31106ba7b8bdefc94306b6978f7d30af858b1d4f5"}}, "hash": "1617bdf63fa953b960f3c6cdeedfaef6ab71503c2ed5c4c99fc513ae4c3eb6f3", "text": "for countries most special- ized in export manufacturing and that are expected to be adversely influenced by China\u2019s export growth, China\u2019s expansion signifies only a moderate negative shock. Second, Roland-Holst, Verbiest, and Zhai (2005) argue against the claim that Chinese growth crowds out other developing neighbors\u2019 economic growth. The authors found that the recent acceleration of China\u2019s and India\u2019s growth process brought rapid growth across the region. It has also been argued that should the two economies grow fast, then their trade grows very fast and their mutual trade becomes a major part of world trade. As a result, mutual growth forms a motivation for forming links and affinities between two econo- mies. With further trade expansion they would grow even faster. Third, besides raising the region\u2019s export competitiveness, emerging China and India also form a new basis for Asian regional growth as their domestic demand for consumption increase. Roland-Holst, Verbi- est, and Zhai (2005) claim that over the last decade China\u2019s growth has become a driving force for regional growth and development. They suggest that as these two economies proceed and expand in tandem, they will provide growth leverage both for their neighbors and for economies elsewhere through a web of supply chains. In this process, they also predict that ASEAN economies will form a growth bridge between the two emerging markets and that growth externalities will be transferred to slower growing economies. Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam, among others, are likely to benefit from this dynamic growth, leading to a convergence in Asia. In order to examine who might benefit more from increasing demands in China and India we analyze the imports of the two emerging economies to see whether there is any shift in the structure of their imports from a country or country group in Asia compared to the world. Figures 4.1 and 4.2 present an upward and a rightward shift in Chinese and, to some degree, in Indian imports. The shares of relatively high sophisticated imports from the world shifted up. Thus, countries that export such highly sophisticated products (those with sophistication levels above 22,000) are likely to benefit from the growth of these two emerging economies. Within the region, Japan, first-tier, and second-tier economies appear to be the beneficiaries as exporters of relatively high-sophisticated goods. On the other hand, there does not seem much potential for the rest of the region at this moment, particularly for the slow-growing potential successors, given the rising share of China\u2019s and India\u2019s exports and their declining imports of goods with low levels of sophistication (see Figure 3.6). The distributions tell us that opportunities are available more for exporters of higher levels of sophistication; for instance, the Philippines and Viet Nam. These two developing nations appear to have benefited most from rising China and India over the last decade, and this pattern might persist in the near future as well. What can be done in order to benefit fully from the growth process of China and India? As Roland-Holst, Verbiest, and Zhai (2005) point out, developing nations should consider the improvement of trade facilitation and underlying framework which drives regional integration and growth. Scholars have raised attention to a lack of an institutional base similar to an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Asia. The Asian Economic Community (AEC) has been proposed as an example to provide a more robust 20 The authors identified 10 developing economies for which manufacturing represents more than 75 percent of merchandise exports: Hungary, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, the Philippines, Poland, Romania, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Turkey. 29 China\u2019s Imports - World China\u2019s Imports - Japan & First Tier Figure 4.1 Distribution of product sophistication (SP), China\u2019s imports China\u2019s Imports - Second Tier China\u2019s Imports - Rest of the Region Rest of the region includes the following countries: Philip- pines, Viet Nam, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Mongolia, Pakistan, Cambodia, and Nepal.

Recent industrialization processes in almost all developing nations in the region have led to a shift towards intra-industry trade. Agreed specialization opens up new possibilities when inter-industry trade has reached its limits; and it also supports pro-trade FDI, which is the second pillar of Kojima\u2019s theory. What matters, as mentioned earlier, is whether such an agreed specialization among nations is feasible or not. It is certainly a valid solution in theory; however, when considered within the context of state business and today\u2019s complicated production network nexus, one can easily see that it is un- likely to mobilize common interests on the agreed specialization at the national level. Historical evidence tells us that, other than the Soviet Bloc economies, agreed specialization among nations has not yet happened. Nevertheless, there is still a significant role for regional trade agreements (RTAs) and bilateral trade agreements (BTAs) in the facilitation of agreed specialization to some degree. As proposed by Memi\u015f and Figure 4.2 Distribution of product sophistication (SP), India\u2019s imports India\u2019s Imports - Japan & First-tier China\u2019s Imports - World India\u2019s Imports - Second-tier India\u2019s Imports - Rest of the Region Note: Own calculations based upon UN Commodity Trade Database. 31 Montes (2006), any trade agreement at the regional or bilateral level can be evaluated considering the pos- sible positive and/or negative impacts on industrial development from a FG-type development perspective, rather than the standard static approaches usually implemented. The focus of these agreements should not be narrowly settled on only the expansion of trade, but rather on a variety of other developmental dimensions as suggested by the FG pattern of development. In this study we propose a dynamic tool for examining country sophistication through an examination of the country\u2019s export and import structure. The framework introduced can be utilized in evaluating the affects of any change in trade regulations by comparing the ex-ante and ex-post profiles of trade structures within a single country or across nations region wide. Fact 2. Over the last two decades the structure of production has become more a part of international production networks through fragmentation as well as agglomeration, which might provide a scope for FG forma- tion. This transition has had an important impact on the patterns of trade both within a single country as well as in a regional context with respect to the regional division of labour. For instance, Wagle (2007) discusses the linkages between product fragmentation and trade integration intensively looking at the Asian countries, showing how fragmentation and trade integration spur the two pillars of growth \u2014 trade and FDI \u2014 in the region. Starting with low-tech labour-intensive industries, many countries\u2019 production, particularly in East Asia, has shifted towards more sophisticated goods. This process has happened not only in the electronics sector but corresponds to a wide range of goods, from cars to footwear. Wagle (2007) points out that between 1990 and 2000 trade in parts and components grew at an annual rate of 9.1 percent, which is faster than the annual growth of world merchandise trade (6.5 percent) and world output (3.7 percent). East Asia\u2019 s share in the production of parts and components for offices, machinery, telecommunications, and motor vehicles accounts for over two-thirds of total export in these sectors during the 1990s. These sectors are also shown as the most dynamic of all export sectors. As long as the less technologically sophisticated economies can reap the benefits from being part of these dynamic international networks and facilitate reinvestment of the profits in other domestic industries, fragmentation can be a well-suited system. Should the institutional settings be such to as provide available opportunities through the sound interaction of market forces among states, for instance, a trade policy, a good industrial policy, and the fragmentation of production processes can confer possible gains for all. Nevertheless, caution is required in concluding that fragmentation is good without any conditionality. The challenges are vast for the economies hosting the production of low value-added parts and pieces of the final good produced. Being locked into the labour-intensive phases of production may result in investors\u2019 perception of the host countries as low-wage labour reserves. Hence, unless participating in international production network facilitates job creation and capital formation and strengthens the balance of payments of that economy, the value-added created in such activities is usually transferred to outside the host country through the operations of multinational firms.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "599c704c-da93-483e-a756-048968ce9cd8": {"__data__": {"id_": "599c704c-da93-483e-a756-048968ce9cd8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Potential for Cooperative Regional Industrial Development Strategies in Asia and the Implications of Emerging China and India", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1667a4162052fe1bfab17e06dfbfd900314a348494cd7175040b7069697359ab"}, "2": {"node_id": "ed694c28-62e7-4e88-a8e3-87352d597c24", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8868b9fde83f3d1d7c8665df7b3ba2e4e8f4e590205860a0265b33b705c2c8f9"}}, "hash": "470b41fcc418aa81e38359848a9b783fc6ebf7326949b6d453c16c42edcb8a3b", "text": "These have important implications from a human development perspective.

What matters is not only how many multinationals come to invest in a domestic market but, more specifically, how much of the final value-added of their operations contributes to growth, productivity, and its sustainability. Fact 3. If the FG framework is to be exploited, trade might become more of a two-way trade type providing a cooperative interdependence among economies. As a result of the penetration of product fragmentation in the production systems and growth through industrialization, trade has become more of an intra-industry rather than inter-industry trade. Rising intra-region or intra-group trade among the first and second-tier countries supports this third fact. Industries in lower-income countries have become integrated with those in advanced societies, evolving 32 through a convergence process. Debates on the relationship between intra-industry trade and the growth of trade suggest that there is a positive relation between the two, i.e., trade expands more in the presence of intra-industry trade. Countries benefit from trade expansion as long as trade-induced efficiencies provide the needed resources for industrial upgrading. Industrial upgrading, on the other hand, is possible if the industry ladder is not blocked for the successor economy. Historical evidence tells us that we should not downplay the role of public policy. Both empirical evidence, as well as theoretical framework of the FG model in its original form, suggests positive impacts of public policies. One cannot dismiss the fact that a robust domestic economy with its external trade policy depends particularly on achievements in social development (Memi\u015f and Montes 2005). Import-substitution industrialization, that is, reducing imports of industrialized products through local production of those prod- ucts, has been an essential phase of the convergence process. Whether this process evolves at a faster pace or not depends on exploiting a FG framework that is aligned with an appropriate industrial and social policy framework. Even though trade-centered development is necessary for a FG pattern of development, it cannot be sufficient if not supported by the latter. Since industrial upgrading, innovation, technological capacity, and human capabilities are interwoven with each other in a FG pattern of development, social, industrial, or trade related policies cannot be taken as totally separate factors. Rather, all three policies should be considered within an inclusive holistic structure. The opportunities are immense, even more so when the nature of trade is of the intra-industry type. Yet the challenge is obvious: Success depends on an integrated framework that combines trade, industrial, and social policy together within a human development perspective. Fact 4. The FG formation could induce more free trade agreements (FTAs). A proliferation of bilateral FTAs has already intensified regional integration in Asia over the last two decades. As of 2007 there have been 300 FTAs negotiated globally, 119 of which have been implemented in the Asia-Pacific region since 2002. China has been a major driving force in these negotiations; there are almost 30 countries with which China is negotiating or has proposed an FTA. 21 FG presupposes a regional development scenario through the flow of trade and investment. Thus FTAs that are in accord with the essence of the FG pattern could play a crucial role in regional development. There are two broad categories of FTAs: South-South and North-South. The former involves negotiations among developing countries while the latter corresponds to the negotiations between an advanced economy and a developing economy or group of developing economies (Khor 2007). FTAs offer both potential costs and benefits to developing countries.22 One obvious benefit is market access, which is particularly crucial for land- locked countries. In addition, FTAs, through FDI, enhance the possibilities of investment flows and technology transfers. Evaluations of FTAs within a FG context should consider the possible positive and/or negative impacts on industrial development at the sectoral level. Assessments on the changes in trade volume that ignore industrial transformation through domestic or foreign investment are incomplete and do not capture the synergies among trade, investment, and development, which have important implications for the FG pattern of development in a regional context (Memi\u015f and Montes 2006). Nevertheless, FTAs should be approached with caution. Questions arise about whether new integra- tion arrangements promote trade or lead to trade diversion, and whether they support social development or bring social exclusions and tensions. Social costs come along with any type of economic transformation, and FTAs usually act as an accelerator of this process. Thus, with regards to employment policy, attention is needed to ensure a socially cohesive progress and an approach to free trade in its larger context. 21 See www.bilaterals.org/ for more detailed information. 22 See Khor (2007) for an extended discussion on possible costs and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "adf34d9f-6394-44f8-b72e-c1513b21ed4a": {"__data__": {"id_": "adf34d9f-6394-44f8-b72e-c1513b21ed4a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Potential for Cooperative Regional Industrial Development Strategies in Asia and the Implications of Emerging China and India", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "042b949499e7181cf09404d7f02c204d4b76b7157ef584394febec4f224c5c5d"}, "3": {"node_id": "3fd920c6-96bf-4c53-89d2-abeb62a90e0e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "977ce71938cb2a7a2d2cb90ed8dbb19e1b7b485b8ec7487dd2f93c2192624589"}}, "hash": "bb397e4ea3d33ef4f33af72db7a3484b67232ecd2a03a67221eac284bb018c64", "text": "benefits of FTAs for developing countries. 33 Fact 5. Through FG formation intra-regional FDI flows in Asia have been transferred from high-income countries to successor countries at a growing rate over the last decade (Table B.2). This fact is consistent with an FG pattern of FDI. More recently we observe a fast changing pattern of FDI flows between China and its ASEAN neighbors. A more extensive discussion on this issue can also be found in earlier research. Shu and Zeng (2006) present such patterns in FDI flows between ASEAN and China since the 1990s. The authors suggest that the historical growth rates of FDI flows among these countries could extend further, mainly through new bilateral economic agreements, China\u2019s new mega-economic zone, and ASEAN\u2019s new foreign policy. As long as the corresponding FDIs are pro-trade and come with backward and forward linkages23 with domestic industries, they should be able to provide opportunities for the hosting countries to boost their accumulation of capital as well as extend their existing innovative capabilities. It is important to emphasize that neither rising exports of manufac
