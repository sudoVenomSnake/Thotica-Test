hosted a weeklong knowledge sharing event on two key access to justice issues in the region: engaging with non-state justice systems and conducting access to justice assessments in the region.1 Since there has been significant interest in both of these areas demonstrated by UNDP country offices in the Asia Pacific region, UNDP APRC sought to bring together academics and practitioners to discuss key challenges and opportunities in engaging with non-state justice systems and in conducting access to justice assessments, so as to share best practices and lessons learned for better programming and to ensure that interventions in the region are grounded firmly in human rights standards. The following report captures some of these discussions. Engaging with Non-State Justice Systems (NSJS) to Enhance Access to Justice for the Poor Non-state justice systems are complex and varied structures. They exemplify the relationships between authoritative (often poly-centric) powers within communities and their constituents who legitimise those 1 UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre is grateful to all participants in the Access to Justice Week workshops. Academics, practitioners, government and civil society representatives engaged in lively discussion which was provoked by insightful presentations. We acknowledge that this report cannot do full justice to the richness of the dialogue.

Mila Sopova was the Rapporteur for the workshop. authorities. These systems, their processes and procedures, embody and reflect community values and identity. As such, they are dynamic and evolving structures, capable of both shaping and responding to socio-economic dynamics within a community. For development organisations and justice practitioners, non-state justice systems demand particular scrutiny. On one hand, as highly accessible, culturally legitimate sources of authority they are valuable in settling community disputes, enabling people to collaborate and cooperate. On the other hand, they can perpetuate cultural biases and be discriminatory, creating more barriers to equality and empowerment. Increasingly, development agencies are working with non-state justice systems to improve access to justice for marginalised and poor communities. UNDP, for instance, has been working with non-state justice systems in Afghanistan, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Nepal, Pakistan, Timor- Leste, and Viet Nam. These development partners and their national counterparts are grappling with the practical implications of working with such pluralistic legal systems. Critical questions include: How can external development partners support processes of positive change within non-state justice systems without undermining their legitimacy, inhibiting their dynamism and responsiveness, or disempowering community actors? In the case of non- state justice systems, which are contextually specific and vastly diverse, could there be best practice or guiding principles for agencies working on improving access to justice? Participants at this symposium were invited to discuss existing policy, analytical literature, and field experience with non-state justice systems. From this, participants Executive Summary EXECUTIVE\ufeffSUMMARY 2 were encouraged to consider common themes, which could then lead to the formulation of some key \u2018principles of engagement\u2019. After two and a half days of deliberations however, it was evident that the complexity and contextual-nature of non-state justice systems defy encapsulation in a definite set of principles of engagement. However, clear recommendations for programming purposes were often made in the course of discussions. Among them is the recommendation that no programming in this area should be taken up without adequate research and full involvement of the constituencies that give non- state justice actors their legitimacy and influence over community norms and behaviour. Some Key Points on engaging with NSJS Research \u2013 Are we asking the right questions? How is the problem identified? Who identifies the problem is important. Concerns with non-state justice systems identified by the state may not reflect concerns of the actual users. Likewise, values espoused by international development partners may not resonate with existing community norms. If there are no local champions to espouse an alternative set of norms and values, there remains the risk that desirable changes in current community norms may not come about. Moreover, activism on the part of international actors in this arena carries the risk of defining the issues as a conflict between two sets of norms that are incommensurable or irreconcilable. The notion of \u2018injustice\u2019 was identified as a starting point better suited to identifying more holistic solutions. In this context, the entry point for engagement becomes \u2018people\u2019s grievances\u2019, or discriminatory actions against particular groups, i.e. horizontal inequalities2. Such a programmatic focus directs attention to the purpose and function of justice systems, rather than only the forms of justice systems. While identifying problems, we must also \u2018identify ourselves\u2019: How do we manage our own self-awareness? What can be achieved by expanding community- awareness raising? What is the role of international actors in systems of governance and organisation established through custom? Are interventions having the desired affect? Rather than measuring awareness levels raised, agencies should seek to measure impact \u2013 what are the tangible results of the programme and has the user\u2019s experience improved. 2 Francis Stewart, \u2018horizontal inequalities\u2019, forthcoming. Programming tools \u2013 What kind of programmatic initiatives can support more holistic approaches to expand access to justice?

Paralegals who have familiarity with both the formal and non-state systems can bridge the two, to benefit seekers of justice. Often, as members of the community, they will be known and trusted and can counter ill will and negative feelings towards professional lawyers and the formal system. However, paralegals who are perceived to push justice seekers towards mediation or towards particular outcomes will compromise the neutrality and trust which their position requires. Therefore, there must be clarity in the purpose of paralegals including a clear mandate and appropriate training. Codes of Conduct & Demarcation of Jurisdiction It is essential to provide platforms for deliberation on the demarcation on jurisdictions between non-state and state systems so there is consensus on which crimes should be handled by the state and what redress is best provided through non-state systems. There is the risk of \u2018vigilantism\u2019 should the state fail to meet the community\u2019s needs for justice and security. Retributive justice meted EXECUTIVE\ufeffSUMMARY\ufeff 3 by self-appointed agents will often be violent, lack due process and result in irreversible consequences. Non- state justice actors can be encouraged and supported to develop codes of conduct for themselves to ensure due process and reduce arbitrariness in their modes of making decisions as well as to ensure increased fairness, clarity, and standard procedures in dispute resolutions. \u2018Substitution\u2019 \u2013 eliminating harm whilst maintaining harmony In the course of resolving disputes, traditional communities often tolerate what could be seen as violations of human rights in the interest of \u2018balance\u2019 or \u2018social harmony\u2019 between disputing parties and also in the community as a whole. In such cases, creating space for discussions on what is \u2018injustice\u2019 with a broader perspective could help the communities to find alternative ways of dealing with such issues, so that more fair and transparent justice outcomes for the victims can be made without criminalising a party or naming certain practices as human rights violation. Training Manuals It can be strategic and effective to develop training manuals for non-state justice actors that reflect their local values (e.g. religious norms) while identifying legal and human rights standards. Such trainings can help develop their legal knowledge in culturally sensitive ways and reduce discrimination and arbitrary decision-making as a result. For instance, discussing human rights issues through the application of verses of the Qur\u2019an, other religious texts, local folklore, or particular traditions can lead to greater understanding and acceptance of human rights standards and legal norms among non-state justice actors. Roles of government \u2013 Duty to Engage with the NSJS? Under the human rights-based approach, the state has the duty to protect human rights and provide access to justice for the claim-holders. The need and potential scope for governments (both local and central) to engage with non-state justice will be circumscribed by specific contexts. \u2018Problematising\u2019 the interface between the state and non-state justice systems then requires adequate research into the capacity and willingness of the state to work towards the realisation of rights. Roles of external partners \u2013 Do No Harm An understanding of the risks of a sudden or large infusion of donor funding into community-based justice systems is important. Non-state justice systems normally do not need large amounts of external resources, and any additional resources must be invested in ways that do not upset the existing social structures and distribution of power and influence within the community. Since making positive changes in non-state justice systems is a long term project, there is always the risk that short-term project horizons of external partners can cause more harm than good. Therefore, such interventions should be designed only after adequate research leading to a proper understanding of such poly-centric power equations within the community. Regional Consultation on Access to Justice Assessments The second component of the Access to Justice Week \u2013 the Regional Consultation on Access to Justice Assessments was an opportunity for UNDP Country Offices and practitioners who have conducted access to justice assessments to come together and share their experience and lessons learned in designing and conducting access to justice assessments as well as in utilising the assessment findings to influence policies and programmes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f98b08f0-07ac-48c9-9afa-e35b4a546264": {"__data__": {"id_": "f98b08f0-07ac-48c9-9afa-e35b4a546264", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sharing Experience in Access to Justice: Engaging with Non-State Justice Systems & Conducting Assessments", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a828c8d7c2216304d50b1ef2d751f4e264ab12b3707b13a8a30f431d05bb2d4c"}, "2": {"node_id": "d15efd8a-4711-4e02-b431-8edcaff95380", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f8a0408d0ba5ccff619fdbe9e71870c3cca290fec7677971dd1cdb5fa7c83382"}}, "hash": "b4bd46c11d3803e52216a9c5756cf4c1539ab22adb4bce6958533d4c2057b828", "text": "The experience from a broad range of countries such as Indonesia, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Vietnam, Mongolia, Cambodia, Timor Leste, the Philippines, India, and Pakistan provided a rich basis for discussion and learning on the challenges and opportunities encountered in designing and conducting the assessment as well as analyzing and disseminating findings and building partnerships.

EXECUTIVE\ufeffSUMMARY 4 Key Points on Conducting A2J Assessments \u2022 Participatory action research is a way to empower people in the process of conducting an assessment \u2013 the assessment itself can be a political process to initiate change. \u2022 The assessment can strengthen ownership of national partners \u2013 government and civil society -in the data collection process and contribute to national data collection effort. National ownership and strong political will to carry forward the assessments and uphold the findings are critical, if we want the findings to influence national policy. At the same time, it is important to ensure that other local stakeholders \u2013 including customary authorities \u2013 also participate in the assessment to ensure buy-in. \u2022 A significant investment of time and resources is necessary to apply a human rights-based approach in the assessment and to properly conduct participatory consultations. This is particularly relevant when assessments seek to build local capacities and skills as part of the assessment process. \u2022 Note that translation can provide many challenges especially in translating such complex concepts such as \u201cjustice\u201d and precautions and extra efforts need to be made to ensure appropriate translation. \u2022 Explore alternative means of collecting information such as the use of paralegals to strengthen participation in projects and promote dialogue within the community members. \u2022 Choose carefully an appropriate time to initiate for an A2J assessment. In times of conflict or transitional periods, access to justice assessment can touch on very sensitive issues, and may not be condusive to peace building. Furthermore, there are additional risks involved in terms of safety of the teams and suspicions regarding the motives behind the assessments. \u2022 Discern and assess expected benefits as well as potential risks of using local data collectors to deal with sensitive information (especially in conflict or post-conflict situations) . \u2022 Sometimes the best results of the assessment can be unanticipated ones. \u2022 Explore creative and innovative tools to enrich the assessment process, from the data collection stage (e.g. use of PDAs and storytelling format for questionnaires) to the dissemination of findings (e.g. through documentaries and street theatre performances). \u2022 Media can be a powerful tool to publicize results of the assessment and to encourage positive action on recommendations from the assessment. The assessment process should find ways of partnering with the media, such as inviting journalists to take part in the assessment, holding press conferences, developing documentaries, hosting photo exhibitions, etc. \u2022 If it is not possible to conduct an access to justice assessment, it may be useful to incorporate access to justice elements into other ongoing assessments/ surveys. \u2022 In data analysis, be aware of and avoid analysis deadlock and \u2018paralysis out of too much analysis\u2019. \u2022 Monitor the impact of access to justice assessments \u2013 what happens after the assessment and how it influences policies and programming. In particular, document whether and how the assessment translates into a process of strengthening access to justice for the beneficiaries (i.e. obtaining remedies for grievances). \u2022 Assessments are expensive and time consuming and it would be beneficial to ensure donor coordination in conducting assessments to avoid duplication and \u2018assessment fatigue\u2019. \u2022 Be sure to document processes in conducting the assessment including partnership building and ensuring government buy-in, so as to generate useful lessons learned for other countries. \u2022 Ensure that best practices and lessons learned are shared of what works and also of what does not work in conducting access to justice assessments. Some recommendations that emerged from the consultation include: \u2022 Set realistic objectives that are commensurate with available resources. \u2022 Establish and revise objectives based on people\u2019s priorities as identified by the civil society, government or public survey, feasibility upon the given time-frame and resources. It is useful to think in terms why the assessment is being conducted and for whom. \u2022 Maximize government partnership to minimize risks and negative consequences; government endorsement is critical", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e76dc019-fa0f-45e5-910f-db7741bf87f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "e76dc019-fa0f-45e5-910f-db7741bf87f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sharing Experience in Access to Justice: Engaging with Non-State Justice Systems & Conducting Assessments", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d52ac9b3f55314fb5e6581c0d28895d66f28198b27b0e74e8af28eab4735573b"}, "3": {"node_id": "fc4d4ae6-c329-44f8-a18b-e20971c2dd9f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "09cf3b4b5919eaac41a5ebbeaf37deb7ed1f43f8efa8c21b30852376dbdc1364"}}, "hash": "3fc6c12f70b89b58ac6d9f834283db01ac7b6335c6dc5179650fecb05afa69f9", "text": "to ensuring the utilisation of the assessment results.

EXECUTIVE\ufeffSUMMARY\ufeff 5 \u2022 Team composition should consider how the findings of the assessment can be disseminated. For instance, journalists and documentary filmmakers can be invited in addition to social scientists and legal experts. \u2022 Focus more on the quality rather than the quantity of the research sample. Lastly, recommendations included suggestions to move away from developing a toolkit or specific guidelines (since it would be difficult to develop universal approaches given diverse local contexts), and instead develop a review and analysis report that highlights the implications of different choices employed in different assessments. Such publication could include short case studies written by those practitioners who conducted different assessments. The case studies could provide a rich and contextual discussion of key issues such as how to define objectives, ensure ownership, develop appropriate targets, tailor to the local context, analyse pros and cons of particular approaches, and engage in partnership building. PART\ufeffI:\ufeff\ufeffENGAGING\ufeffWITH\ufeffNON-STATE\ufeffJUSTICE\ufeffSYSTEMS\ufeff(NSJS) 6 Introduction There is a notion that law is made by the state, legislators and judges and that this rule of law permeates society and regulates social behaviour. Therefore, it is assumed, society reflects the great pyramid of legal order. Yet, as we go through life we discover it is not exactly that way. \u2018Pluralism\u2019, \u2018Non-State\u2019, \u2018Informalism\u2019: each of these terms represents a departure from regulated, pyramid-like legal order, and suggests a counter-utopia, characterised by a lateral exchange rather than hierarchical authority. However, the term \u2018informalism\u2019 is a very elusive concept: When a tribunal labels something \u2018informal\u2019 what exactly does it mean? It can mean that decisions made are non- binding, or that procedures depart from those of a state established court system. If the formal meets at a specified place, during a specified hour, by people who wear distinct clothing, and render decisions based on specified rules, is the absence of any one of these informality? Legal pluralism often presents a confused landscape where we must remember that not everything is as it is labelled. Like animals disguised to fool predators and prey, we find \u2018informal\u2019 systems and formal systems often use or reject each other\u2019s characteristics to serve specific purposes. In spite of claims made by promoters and defenders, none of the terms \u2013 formal, informal, state and non-state \u2013 can be referred to as a homogenous \u2018good thing\u2019. There is no formulaic loyalty that can be drawn to any of these terms. We should be sceptical of generic claims of moral superiority and judge each scheme meticulously based on its particulars. Issues of \u2018injustice\u2019 will be more effectively addressed by moving from a frame focused on the dispute, to look at the dynamics of the situation in a wider frame. For instance, when the Supreme Court of India undertook the case to free bonded labourers twenty years ago, the court successfully declared the cessation of such practices. But 20 years later, practices have not changed significantly, because the Court did not understand the complex dynamics and underlying causes of bonded labour and the court\u2019s ruling provided no real incentive to change. Most workers today still have no claim and no means to claim their rights. In other words, on the books, the law was inspiring; but on the ground, it had little effect. If conversations about human rights in plural legalities are restricted to binaries, (\u2018culture\u2019 versus human rights, \u2018traditional versus modern\u2019) then real ways of protecting rights on the ground becomes obscured by terminologies \u201cand apparent competing interests.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc4d4ae6-c329-44f8-a18b-e20971c2dd9f": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc4d4ae6-c329-44f8-a18b-e20971c2dd9f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sharing Experience in Access to Justice: Engaging with Non-State Justice Systems & Conducting Assessments", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d52ac9b3f55314fb5e6581c0d28895d66f28198b27b0e74e8af28eab4735573b"}, "2": {"node_id": "e76dc019-fa0f-45e5-910f-db7741bf87f5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3fc6c12f70b89b58ac6d9f834283db01ac7b6335c6dc5179650fecb05afa69f9"}}, "hash": "09cf3b4b5919eaac41a5ebbeaf37deb7ed1f43f8efa8c21b30852376dbdc1364", "text": "\u201d PART I: Engaging with Non-State Justice Systems (NSJS) The following discussions were informed by presentations by: Marc Galanter, Professor of Law Emeritus, University of Wisconsin Vijay Nagaraj, Research Director, International Council on Human Rights Policy Erica Harper, Senior Rule of Law Officer, International Development Law Organisation PART\ufeffI:\ufeffENGAGING\ufeffWITH\ufeffNON-STATE\ufeffJUSTICE\ufeffSYSTEMS\ufeff(NSJS)\ufeff\ufeff 7 Modifying social norms and behaviours involves more than simply a change in legislation or policy.

Where human rights principles and values are threatened, it becomes important to reflect on how legal reform can safeguard principles, while at the same time making sure that it does not advance certain narrow versions of what is \u2018legal\u2019. There is a strong tendency to institutionalise the asymmetries of custom and law. If conversations about human rights in plural legalities are restricted to binaries (e.g. \u2018culture\u2019 versus human rights, \u2018traditional versus modern\u2019), then real ways of protecting rights on the ground becomes obscured by terminologies and apparent competing interests. To overcome such black-and-white approaches, it is necessary to recognise the debate as a political issue \u2013 despite it often being posed as an issue of contested \u2018cultures\u2019. The power of law lies in making the weak powerful and thus shaping social realities. For example, indigenous peoples\u2019 claims are often considered acceptable, so long as they are framed as a human rights issue. They often become less amenable when framed in terms of \u2018self-determination\u2019. International human rights law can be used to legitimise certain claims to civil, political, social, economic and cultural rights; however, when referencing international human rights law, it must be remembered that the results are a negotiated compromise between states. This is not to say that human rights standards and laws are not relevant, but it becomes critically relevant to ensure that justice programming takes its direction from the struggles and principles of human rights, rather than the results of negotiations between states. Justice should be remembered as an enduring political negotiation, one in which supporters use and evoke rights not just as legality, but as political legitimacy. When we look at legal empowerment of the poor, we must ask, who are we talking about? Are the poor easily identified? How do we \u2018unpack\u2019 poverty itself? Are we trying to save those who are already victims of the law, through \u2018more law\u2019? What is the rationale behind our intervention? Development agencies generally seek to apply general principles and standard frameworks to their responses. However, when working in the absence of such standards, we are required to go beyond wholesale approaches and to take on more \u2018messy\u2019 approaches which require political commitment and a wholly different vision. Engagement with Non-State Justice Systems: \u2018Enhancing legal empowerment through engagement with non-state justice systems\u2019 For those seeking to engage with non-state justice systems, there is a common expectation to enhance the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses of non-state justice systems. This has led to a \u2018fix it\u2019 approach where solutions are applied to specific weaknesses within non-state justice systems. These may include more representative dispute resolution, codification of customary rules, establishment of jurisdictional limitations, specific practices proscribed by legislation, among others. However, \u2018fix it\u2019 solutions often simply challenge vested interests, provide few returns and present no better alternatives. Limiting the jurisdiction of non-state justice systems in certain instances (e.g. violent crime, rape, murder, etc.) can create a vacuum of remedy in these instances if the formal system is unable, unwilling or not welcomed to respond. Similarly, the act of codifying customary practices to ensure predictability of results can risk locking communities into narrow, static interpretations of certain norms, while undermining the positive aspects of the non-state justice, namely flexibility and intuitive decision making. There is a movement towards approaches that seek to expand choice and place power in the hands of disputants themselves, as changes to customary norms driven by bottom-up or competitive forces are more likely to be sustainable. Justice programmers should consider instead empowering non-state justice system users to make choices and expand their freedoms in accessing and participating in justice services. By providing more options as to where individuals can resolve their disputes, often incentivized through better protections, non-state justice systems are capable of reforming themselves to maintain legitimacy based on the expectations of the community.

In 1987 the Bashingantahe were integrated into the official legal system. The nomination procedures were almost exclusively controlled by political parties which used the nominations as a means of seeking political legitimacy. After 7 years of civil war, the 2000 peace accord in Burundi provided new opportunities for the \u201crehabilitation\u201d of the Bashingantahe, and UNDP financed a nation-wide programme to identify the \u201creal\u201d Bashingantahe. However, the process became increasingly politicised, and due to inadequate participation and consultation with local actors in the programme, the initiative ended up reinforcing the dominance of urban elites within the Bashingantahe. After democratic elections held in 2005, the newly elected Hutu government decided to exclude the Bashingantahe from the formal judicial system again, and created democratically elected hill councils to work specifically on mediation, arbitration and conciliation in the local entity. Unlike the Bashingantahe, the hill councils had women elected to their boards and spoke a distinctly \u2018alternative dispute resolution (ADR)-oriented\u2019 language, which was perceived to be a very \u2018Western concept\u2019 by the locals. Recent research has shown that the interference in local dynamics was so disconnected from cultural perspectives and on-the-ground realities that it has almost completely discredited traditional authorities. Further, frequent changes to the formal legal system have discredited state systems, as there is confusion as to which legal system is recognised and where access to remedy is guaranteed. There has been no improvement to citizen\u2019s ability to access justice in Burundi, and there is even an indication that access has decreased as a result of heightened interference. Proper participation and consultation with the users of the Bashingantahe councils, and more detailed research into the nature of inter-ethnic relations could have provided justice programmes with better insight as to appropriate responses to the divisions between the non- state and state justice systems. Gradual reforms based on consultation would have been more sustainable; and the involvement of justice \u2018users\u2019 could have prevented elite capture and deligitimisation of justice suppliers and avoided bringing justice actors discredit. There is a movement towards approaches that seek to expand choice and place power in the hands of disputants themselves\u2026 Justice programmers should consider instead empowering non-state justice system users to make choices and expand their freedoms in \u201caccessing and participating in justice services. \u201d The following discussions were informed by presentations by: Dominik Kollhagen, Institute of Development Policy and Management, University of Antwerp, Belgium.

The Gram Nyayalayas Act of 2008 provides for establish- ment of nearly 5067 village courts across India. The Act purports to provide access to justice to the citizens and to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are not denied to any citizen by reason of social, economic or other disabilities. A key purpose of the Act is to reduce court backlogs. The Act declares that Gram Nyayalayas will be the lowest court of subordinate judiciary in a State, and shall exist in addition to the regular civil and criminal courts. At the same time, in order to speed up the case disposal, the Act has removed some basic procedural rights in the judicial system, such as the right to appeal3, the right against self- incrimination, and rights to legal aid and legal counsel.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "22feac29-9038-4f05-abc3-12e39b8ca7a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "22feac29-9038-4f05-abc3-12e39b8ca7a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sharing Experience in Access to Justice: Engaging with Non-State Justice Systems & Conducting Assessments", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0961a2370cccca951a32d89903cb4b143489c74306f7e80746a926fdaa6e8062"}, "2": {"node_id": "fadb87ed-9165-4720-9048-fc53c0ff510f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9dc2e34462f2c5d481cf2933253b5df22b6379e75921987396cad92ccc016bb0"}}, "hash": "a87e004952402fcaa54950496ffde698456a1f391f0c359b2216c6657089dec7", "text": "The jurisdiction of the Gram Nyayalayas covers certain crimes (such as theft, concealment, disposal and receiving of stolen property, and insult with intent to provoke a breach of the peace) and includes other offenses which are not punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding two years.

The creation of such a fast-track system has resulted in unequal access to justice by doing away with procedural rights in cases where poor people are the litigants, whilst those with resources can continue to access regular courts with all the procedural rights. In effect, the Gram Nyayalayas has combined the negatives of the formal system with inherent weaknesses of the non-state justice system: results are binding, adversarial, and non-restorative, while there is no appeal, legal representation and support for the poor. The result is \u2018rough justice\u2019, considered to be \u2018good enough\u2019 for poor people: poor justice for the poor. 3 Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, S. 19.

In favour of whom? Even judges at Gram Nyayalayas are generally less well trained. We need to look at social disempowerment from a wider perspective. Would fettering the right of the State to appeal actually have more impact on reducing the burden on courts? \u2022 We need to consider our motives \u2013 why are we bringing about change? There is a tendency to urbanise the way we express concerns and the remedies we promote. Results achieved for urban populations cannot give less, to a lesser quality, while reinforcing hierarchical control. It should not become UNDP policy to blindly promote the \u2018urban\u2019\u2013 and yet, often international agencies work with urbanised NGOs and hardly ever with social movements. \u2022 Politicisation of the Gram Nyayalayas is significant. They are better imagined as little parliaments, rather than little courts. They are thoroughly political. If we pretend they are sources of justice like courts, we are disillusioning ourselves.

Some of the critical challenges faced in accessing justice in Pakistan includes: high levels of poverty and low levels of literacy, outdated colonial legal frameworks, growing populations and meagre resources leading to an over-burdened formal justice system, and very weak enforcement of decisions. For women, additional social, economic and cultural barriers may further prevent them from accessing justice. The Musalihat Anjuman (conciliatory bodies) at the grass roots level (Ward/Union Council level) provide for the amicable resolution of disputes through mediation, arbitration, or conciliation. The courts frequently refer cases for resolution to the Musalihat Anjuman. Typically, cases at the Musalihat Anjuman include issues of inheritance, domestic violence, forced marriage and other illegal cultural practices, human trafficking, child abuse, and property disputes. Critical success factors: \u2022 The Musalihat Anjuman mediates disputes based on standards that draw from various sources such as the Quran and other Islamic scriptures, the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, existing cultural practices, as well as local government legislation. \u2022 The Musalihat Anjuman recognizes strong achievements for its service providers and provides incentives and rewards to them for cases resolved according to best international practice.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "83929957-8da5-4d6c-8d97-6bc6c376f6b8": {"__data__": {"id_": "83929957-8da5-4d6c-8d97-6bc6c376f6b8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sharing Experience in Access to Justice: Engaging with Non-State Justice Systems & Conducting Assessments", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8e64594d6b5501cc06da9e0f13e752e094a36c26915140d2f83a3bc4222081bc"}, "2": {"node_id": "2d304141-e8fe-4aee-8c0d-f1dce1f39fdb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eb96dc1e4cc648791401cafe2a67a1a9a7794d487e406e8c51a3dd0f33d34e19"}}, "hash": "e7c9cf3bc6dfbc7acbb2a2a38ee79790e24ac7ee02f0c6a42662d070e99e8415", "text": "\u2022 Through a cost sharing arrangement with federal and provincial governments, Musalihat Anjuman are established in 1,063 Union Councils, with 992 (93%) women members.

The in-depth study of the actors and users of the panchayats and nari adalats, which focus on serving poor and marginalised populations in slum-like resettlement colonies, found a high level of understanding and implementation of international human rights principles and norms, particularly those defined by CEDAW, among decision makers when dealing with cases of serious violence against women. In comparison, such principles, particularly those of equality and autonomy, rarely featured in the decision making processes at formal, lower courts or lok adalats. Generally, lawyer advocates and lower court judges processing cases involving violence against women in lok adalat proceedings did not feel that international human rights principles, including those enshrined in CEDAW, were pertinent to their cases. Thus neither the language nor the principles of international human rights such as equality or autonomy were utilised in case processing. Decision makers referred instead to mainly local customs and traditions as reason for verdict. The study proposed three contributing factors for discrepancy in the application of human rights norms in the two settings: \u2022 As there is no mandatory legal education for those who completed their legal training before CEDAW was ratified, those justice professionals may not be aware of such new international legal standards. \u2022 Civil society organisations, especially those who have received regular training in international human rights laws and principles by various international agencies and external partners are more knowledgeable and apply that knowledge to their decisions. \u2022 These female, non-lawyers, who are the adjudicators in the nari adalat and mahila panchayat are better able to appreciate multiple modes of disempowerment and empathise with the victims of injustice. This disposes them to greater sensitivity to a rights-based approach to decision making. \u2018Holistic Approach\u2019 The Mahila Panchayats and Nari Adalats were also found to provide \u2018holistic case processing\u2019 not available through formalised courts also dealing with cases of violence against women. Members of the women\u2019s courts provide numerous follow up visits to former sites of abuse to ensure that their judgments and signed agreements PART\ufeffI:\ufeffENGAGING\ufeffWITH\ufeffNON-STATE\ufeffJUSTICE\ufeffSYSTEMS\ufeff(NSJS)\ufeff\ufeff 11 are being followed. These visits to victims, accused, and family members are considered by the community to be critical to the successes of the system in stopping violence against women. As community members themselves, the panchayat members were able to additionally use social pressure and public shaming to motivate perpetrators of violence against women to acquiesce to their judgments. The non-state justice systems were often enlisted by poorer victims of violence as a means of obtaining compromise agreements with their abusers in order to peacefully return to, or remain in, their places of abuse. As poor, disempowered women, most likely to be living with her spouse\u2019s family, an adversarial court driven process against one individual may jeopardise her security at home. Cognisant of this, women\u2019s courts often first seek to educate, apply peer pressure, or establish support networks, rather than seeking criminal convictions. Drawing Evidence-Based Conclusions The data supports evidence that grassroots compliance with legal, international and other norms requires additional factors beyond the norms per se. These include local systems of legitimacy and sanctions which can have more influence on compliance than state sanctioned decrees. Discussion \u2022 We need to examine what actors in formal legal systems imagine are the advantages of non-state justice systems. This may include more flexibility and less formality, however attempts by formal justice systems to \u2018informalise\u2019, without acquiring at the same time the cultural understanding of non-state justice actors, can result in informality informed by continued bias or prejudice. For example, informally dealing with cases on women\u2019s rights in the formal system, without the required empathy for victims may not improve the situation of women. \u2022 Human rights laws and standards are used by women\u2019s groups to advocate for rights. But to try and change customs and practices through a top-down system would be dangerous.

It is important to overcome this tension not by denying self-determination, but by focusing on what changes are needed in traditional normative systems and values in order to bring about consistency with universal human rights norms. Gender Justice in Bougainville In post-conflict Bougainville, Papua New Guinea, the Peace Foundation Melanesia, a mainland-based NGO, worked to increase dispute resolution skills among customary leaders, women and youth in a participatory way. A study conducted on Peace Foundation Melanesia\u2019s training and methodology focused on topics including gender roles, mediation, and restorative justice techniques. The objective of the research was to understand the impact of this training for justice seekers, with a particular focus on the experience of women and cases involving gender-based violence. Peace Foundation Melanesia\u2019s training had increased the skills of many of the chiefs and mediators engaged in dispute resolution, particularly by providing more opportunities for participation during the dispute resolution process. As a result, the satisfaction levels of users in relation to process and outcome were higher when the chief or mediator had received training. The Peace Foundation Melanesia training had largely focused on procedural issues, and dealt minimally with strengthening human rights. However, by directing mediation skill development training towards women and youth, research showed that women could be empowered to offer alternative interpretations and solutions to serious issues facing women and youth, such as domestic violence and rape. Female mediators were also found to deal with gender-based violence in different ways: changing the interpretation and application of legal norms and processes, while not deligitimising the non-state justice system with what is seen as \u2018radical\u2019 or \u2018incompatible\u2019 values at the expense of values of harmony in the community. Female mediators were more likely to consider \u2018alternate pathways\u2019 to justice, and were, in some cases, able to link victims to NGOs that provide specialised services to women in abusive situations. External training however was unable to effect change on power asymmetries reinforced through decisions made by many chiefs. Despite mediation training, some disputants felt they were under significant pressure to agree to outcomes that reflected notions of fairness within the community. Nevertheless, there is some potential for an external intervention to reform non-state justice systems. The findings of the research point to the development of an internal dialogue within the community, facilitated by engaging marginalized groups (such as women) in decision-making and thus challenging the dominant group\u2019s monopoly over the interpretations and applications of customary law. However, tackling power asymmetries and empowering the disempowered is a long term process that requires champions within the community who can give voice to it and define its struggle.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "50475dc3-5d62-4261-9c47-966d279047d7": {"__data__": {"id_": "50475dc3-5d62-4261-9c47-966d279047d7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sharing Experience in Access to Justice: Engaging with Non-State Justice Systems & Conducting Assessments", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0902acca751f12dcb1654716e4e9043fbd16d4a3e002d4db31e28497893bddf1"}, "2": {"node_id": "18717569-b15d-49f0-a9bb-9d43d91fde05", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "347925a2a035b86fcdddaa9f77a40bea3993ce5a20ead5fa2ade8c0483723d42"}}, "hash": "e6bda5c5d4f126a8b57bf3585fcbc91326ad08f668a04637e8943758db83fc04", "text": "Customary Law in Cambodia The UNDP Access to Justice initiative in Cambodia recognised the particular challenges facing the indigenous people and sought to address them by strengthening the capacity of the traditional authorities, raising awareness of government and political stakeholders to the situation of the indigenous peoples, providing legal representation and translation as required, and through experimentation with \u2018peace tables\u2019 \u2013 discussions involving customary leaders and local and national government officials.

They also acted as a conflict resolution mechanism, providing a platform for concerns to be voiced and solutions to be reached through discussion. Cambodia\u2019s Land Law (August 2001) defines indigenous communities as \u2018a group of people that resides in the territory of the Kingdom of Cambodia whose members manifest ethnic, social, cultural and economic unity and who practice a traditional lifestyle, and who cultivate the lands in their possession according to customary rules of collective use\u2019. Further, the law stipulates exactly who may be described as \u2018indigenous\u2019. The drafting of the national Land Law presented an opportunity to discuss and advocate for recognition of the rights of indigenous people to own land collectively. However, tying the definition of indigenous peoples so closely to land and land ownership raised concerns of inequality between indigenous people and lowland individuals. Indigenous peoples are less able to sell land parcels, whereas non-indigenous, lowland people can readily enforce purchase contracts with a title from the cadastre office. PART\ufeffI:\ufeffENGAGING\ufeffWITH\ufeffNON-STATE\ufeffJUSTICE\ufeffSYSTEMS\ufeff(NSJS)\ufeff\ufeff 13 Given the spectrum of ministries and agencies with a role to play in the empowerment of indigenous peoples, the UNDP project partnered with the Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Interior, and local NGOs. The project noted the need for awareness raising among the government, other stakeholders, as well as the indigenous communities. In doing so, the project supported the documentation of customary procedures and practices. Rather than codifying the laws, the research highlighted the values and rationale that drive some of the decision-making on the ground. The research and the subsequent publications also highlighted the strengths of storytelling methods as well as fair, full and equal participation as means of mediating conflicts. It also noted the shifts in customary norms and rulings \u2013 for example, the cessation of the use of the death penalty. This reflects the acceptance of state abolition of the death penalty by traditional leaders. Discussion Gender: \u2022 When we talk about \u2018restorative justice\u2019 we must ask: \u2019Restorative\u2019 to whom? To the individual pressured into remedy that serves community harmony? \u2022 Further to this, we must ask what constitutes a \u2018better outcome\u2019 for women seeking justice as victims of violence. In majority patriarchal systems, women occupy positions of social and economic dependence on husbands or their patrilineal family. Breaking that connection may leave her without the recognition of the community and the protection of an income. Yet exonerating perpetrators of crime in the name of \u2018social harmony\u2019 is an untenable solution. \u2022 We must be wary of \u2018choicelessness\u2019 masquerading as \u2018choice\u2019. Women who \u2018choose\u2019 to forego their individual human rights to restore balance to the community may in fact do so because they have no other choice. Choosing between devastating economic and social exclusion or staying in a relationship with an abusive partner is not much of a choice. \u2022 Looking at customary practices through a binary prism of human rights and culture is unhelpful. We should not presume that human rights principles do not fit into an internal critique. This is demonstrated in narratives of struggles against gender based violence. \u2022 Certain \u2018solutions\u2019 can and will be contested within communities \u2013 there is human agency. To assume that human rights is an abstraction, that it is not based on the struggle of individuals and agency, is a mistake. Indigenous Peoples: \u2022 The definition of \u2018indigenous people\u2019 as recognised by the state will have a bearing on the kind of system the individual can access. \u2022 Fundamentally, choice is at stake here too. Does \u2018free and prior informed consent\u2019 apply to the choice of indigenous peoples between state and non-state systems? Should indigenous peoples be able to choose whether they participate in communal land management, or can they sell individual parcels?", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9383fa4b-6e5d-4fbc-874c-f058ccdba992": {"__data__": {"id_": "9383fa4b-6e5d-4fbc-874c-f058ccdba992", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sharing Experience in Access to Justice: Engaging with Non-State Justice Systems & Conducting Assessments", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "209a5c3fcb333271c3e3d8798add76d559abbcac40960ce99f5249d64ded9b8b"}, "2": {"node_id": "e4f541bf-6ec5-475c-a496-2ec3dac33189", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "65f06c6ba2170a30255175efee941f519a638a8033ec558ed902a564dc763e5c"}}, "hash": "ec9727d192dac914d5033d7d78cfe5f4009ba05ccfb716ba1662361a7f577a30", "text": "Non-State Justice Systems in Contexts of Socialist Legalities \u2018Rethinking the Role of Customary Law in Dispute Resolution at Highland Communities in Viet Nam: Case studies of the H\u2019Mong and Ede minorities\u2019 Much of the research conducted in Viet Nam on non- state, or customary systems of \u2018ethnic minorities\u20194, is anthropological.

Swift changes in the Vietnamese society over last 20 years may have had a positive influence towards rethinking the role of customary practices and laws in local governance and promoting access to justice for ethnic minorities. 4 In Viet Nam the term \u2018ethnic minorities\u2019 is used to refer to people who would be classified as \u2018indigenous\u2019 in other countries. In total there are considered to be 54 ethnic groups, of which the Kinh or Viet represent more than 80% of the total population.

The Hill Tribes also protested the government\u2019s restriction of their religious practices. \u2022 At present, customary laws and legal systems are acknowledged by local officials but regulatory obstacles remain. The Vietnamese Constitution recognises the equality among the country\u2019s ethnic groups. At official levels, the equality of ethnic minorities is protected by the department of Minorities within the National Assembly. The Ministry of Mountains and Ethnicity is headed by a member of the Hmong community. However, this does not ensure that the laws are actually put into practice. The role of traditional elders and clan leaders in ethnic community governance remains significant. There are clearly stipulated guidelines as to who has the responsibility for dispute resolution in which instances and at which levels. For example, among the Hmong people: \u2022 \u2018Level 1 disputes\u2019 refer to the more frequent, simple cases such as animals destroying crops and family borders, is usually self-regulated among families, with only a minor role of elders and clan leaders. \u2022 \u2018Level 2 disputes\u2019 are complex cases pertaining to land border, land/asset division, land inheritance, etc. These issues are resolved at the clan, or inter-clan level and are adjudicated by more influential clan leaders or elders. \u2018Level 3 disputes\u2019 are taken to the new to hoa giai (conciliation unit) or alternative dispute resolution mechanism to resolve the irresolvable cases within and between clans. The structure of the new ADR is diverse, depending on each village; however, it is proven that most effective when clan leaders and elders are involved. \u2018Level 4 disputes\u2019 are those beyond the Hmong boundaries and those where the matter is one of state law. Despite this clarity of practice, and the recognition that customary laws in principle may be recognised in civil dispute settlements, judges and judicial officials interviewed for the study revealed they are reluctant to take customary rules into consideration. Further, official recognition of ethnic minority autonomy in natural resource management is challenged by forest areas being re-classified as \u2018watershed-forest\u2019 by the watershed forest management board. Much forest area is being used for national development interests and private companies seeking to extract resources or develop plantations. Community-based natural resource management through clan systems is still strong in practice, but without formal recognition of their potential role in ensuring sustainable development, there is a risk that ethnic minorities will be forced off their land.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b17f0e19-b0ea-4117-a7e3-9be539d82ee9": {"__data__": {"id_": "b17f0e19-b0ea-4117-a7e3-9be539d82ee9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sharing Experience in Access to Justice: Engaging with Non-State Justice Systems & Conducting Assessments", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ce8ce205a0701755defd0383d5f36cab26e195193d50598396ca2a4c11684e12"}, "2": {"node_id": "3d418f29-512d-4161-9d19-4e51f4751845", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "996b69da737f2e766e6a66b84bc09f4a4a056db93944b1b8f45a33fb55e3394e"}}, "hash": "e24b822adfe003c1e9763d315fbec8238569909e56374543c4de9b3d5bfe67f1", "text": "Initial recommendations from the study (forthcoming) are: \u2022 Uphold Constitutional rights and principles (recognition towards customary law) \u2022 Continue to raise the awareness of policy makers to role of customary systems in contributing to community and national development \u2022 Promote traditional education and bilingual education for ethnic minorities \u2022 Extend research efforts to other ethnic minority groups \u2022 Advocate for ethnic empowerment and legal empowerment \u2018Mapping Customary Practices: UNDP experience in Lao PDR\u2019 Customary practices remain a crucial source of law for many people in Lao PDR, where social structure, language and culture, including customary practices of ethnic groups5 are still flourishing.

The main areas of investigation covered by the survey were: reviewing and cataloguing of customary norms and practices with a focus on most relevant topics; people\u2019s perception of customary law (including targeted / disaggregated groups); and potential impact resulting from a change in the context and environment of the community. The survey sought to cover five key areas: 1. Cultural configurations \u2013 social organizations, religious beliefs and practices, leadership and decision making, basic concepts related to customary law 2. Civil issues \u2013 Family obligations and rights; marriage; inheritance; community level rights and obligations; land ownership and access to resources; contracts 3. Criminal issues \u2013 Concept and definitions; proof- evidences; conflict resolution and adjudication; arbitrage; infraction against individuals; infraction against assets and reputation 4. Changes in customary law \u2013 Induced by market economy, policies, urbanization and transition toward formal justice system. 5. Perceptions of the customary law \u2013 By villagers, women, youth, poor, and users. Consultations were conducted successfully and all 49 ethnic groups were included in study results. However, a number of challenges plagued the survey, from methodology to results, such as the following: \u2022 The protocol for lessons learned was not used by the project, subsequently, no reports have been presented to the consultant concerning the lessons learned \u2022 Often also the planning has not been respected while conducting the workshops \u2022 Not enough feedback was provided on the process and methodology used for each workshop \u2022 Low capacity of the ethnic researchers to develop reports prohibited a clear analysis of results In hindsight, the involvement of the Lao Front for National Construction members may have discouraged the participation of certain ethnic groups due to a history of mutual distrust between them and the state. A number of ethnic groups did not attend the workshops arranged by the project, and the data initially provided by the Lao Front led to the selection of a few inappropriate districts in a few cases. The project relied heavily on the capacity of the ethnic researchers to gather data and develop reports, through a Participatory Action Research methodology. Their actual capacity to do this to a level which would support analysis was limited. Further, the project recognised that codification of customary laws will negatively affect the flexibility of the systems. The intention of the Lao government vis a vis the findings of the study is not clear. There is a risk that the documented laws and customs will be defined as either \u2018positive\u2019 or \u2018negative\u2019 and certain practices and customs banned or used to further discriminatory stereotypes of indigenous peoples. Lastly, the Lao Customary Justice Project found that it was \u2018too ambitious\u2019 to define a national strategy on how to incorporate such a demanding and complex process. Discussion \u2022 It should be recognised that state dominance in the conduct of customary justice studies may not be in the best interests of indigenous peoples. Indigenous peoples often have a strained relationship with the state owing to unresolved differences over their rights to self-determination. \u2022 While there can be benefits to cataloging and formalising customary rules, there may be also inherent risks as to who actually benefits from such codification.

The OralWiki is a reporting tool that creates an audio archive of decisions made by tribal elders or other non-state justice actors. The case study shown addressed the abunzi non-state justice system in Rwanda. Reconciliatory in its aim, the abunzi justice system uses mediation and arbitration to resolve disputes. In the abunzi system, mediated decisions are not documented. Interviews among the abunzi revealed that they have to walk long distances in order to discuss practices and procedures with their peers. The OralWiki enables the abunzi to call a recording service and describe the context of the case, the evidence available, the parties\u2019 positions, and the reasoning behind the decision made. Other abunzi can call the service and listen to cases classified by category. By sharing information, the abunzi decision makers can ensure consistency in mediated outcomes, and thus develop a \u2018jurisprudence\u2019.

Research \u2013 Develop an Evidence Base for Policy and Programming The value of empirical evidence in understanding non- state justice systems and designing relevant and useful strategies to engage with them is imperative. But often we begin with the wrong question. Instead of asking \u2018how do we engage?\u2019, we need to ask \u2018how do we improve the experiences of justice users?\u2019 By narrowing our focus to \u2018engagement with non-state justice systems\u2019, we risk misunderstanding and indeed, missing too much of the problem. If we take \u2018people\u2019s disputes\u2019 as the starting point, we are better able to focus on function rather than form and bridge the academic/ practitioner divide. From here we move from legalistic forms of justice \u2013 the laws, institutions, and structural relationships \u2013 to focus on the qualitative function of justice \u2013 fairness, effectiveness, legitimacy. We have to recognise also that research should consider inevitable variations from one location or social structure, to another. Differences in local specificity will include religion and ethnicity; urban and rural; the degree of heterogeneity; impact of conflict; extent of government presence; and other historical, political and social factors. The research process should also bridge the academic/ practitioner divide and involve both legal experts and social scientists as a deeper, contextualised understanding of the issues and challenges will go beyond the procedural legal framework. As much as possible the communities themselves should be supported to develop the capacity to examine their own systems and use the evidence base to advocate for change among district actors and national policy makers. Empirical data can de-politicise the discussion about customary law and prevent it from being co-opted and misused for power or political gain. \u2022 Research should focus on the actual experience of those seeking justice \u2022 Research should aim to understand justice and dispute resolution on a deeply contextual basis \u2022 Research should take into account the inevitable variations from one location to another \u2022 Research should be a joint effort of policy makers/ practitioners and social scientists \u2022 Research should not be seen as a one-time event, but a process for both informing policy and measuring impact \u2022 Research can be used as a policy tool in a variety of ways The following discussion was informed by a presentation by: Deborah Isser, Senior Rule of Law Advisor, United States Institute of Peace.

In Liberia, the dual legal system was seen by the international community as perpetuating discrimination, which prompted the UN to promote one system for all. Whereas the perception among Liberians who used the non-state system was that it is this move that is discriminatory, against their system and them. The right questions to ask in this context could be: \u2018how can the justice demand of the population be met so as to fill the current justice vacuum?\u2019 and \u2018how can the Liberian justice system be more inclusive of the values of all of the Liberian people?\u2019 The answers to these questions would open up consideration of a wider range of policy options and improvement in the delivery of justice. Earlier described efforts of the Gram Nyayalayas established to address backlog of cases in India is another example of a poor effort to \u2018problematise\u2019 justice gaps. This leads to the fundamental question we must ask ourselves regularly, who gets to decide what the problem is? Take an incremental approach calibrated to current realities Shifting the point of departure to \u2018what is\u2019, rather than \u2018what should be\u2019 grounds reform strategies in current and realistic contexts. Studies show that laws and policies banning certain practices or limiting the jurisdiction of non-state justice systems do not consider the realities of people\u2019s disputes. Support to demarcation of jurisdiction has often backfired if there is no viable alternative in place to provide remedy to legitimate grievance, reducing faith in the state and state institutions due to their limited capacities. This can lead to mob violence and vigilantism. Engagement with non-state justice systems must address the social context. Many of the rights abrogating decisions and practices within customary systems serve an alternative social purpose. Practices such as bad in Afghanistan, a process whereby a family\u2019s daughter is married to another family in order to repay a debt, or the identification of \u2018witches\u2019 through trials by ordeal in Liberia, serve a social purpose. Abhorrent as these practices may be, communities are economically and socially dependent on one another, and alternative terms of exchange must be found to protect and facilitate social order. Promote an Inclusive Vision of Legal Pluralism Local solutions are more likely to have sustained and transformational effect. The international community and NGOs should help to facilitate constructive spaces for concerned communities to come up with solutions and to advocate those solutions to national policy makers. An illustration of altering terms of exchange can be found in Liberia. Previously, swearing an oath had to be done by drinking poison to affirm the primacy of promise over person. Nowadays, the demonstration of the commitment to upholding the seriousness of the oath is done by swallowing a bit of dirt from the earth, which also symbolically demonstrates a commitment to the land. For such changes in the terms of exchange we should allow sufficient time for experimentation and pilot activities undertaken with the concerned communities. Support the good struggle Practitioners seeking to engage with non-state justice systems should look to critical insiders who contest given norms. An example of such critical insiders would be women mediators in Bougainville who challenge the received wisdom that women seeking to escape abusive relationships must necessarily be bound by the decisions of village chiefs. As much as possible the communities themselves should be supported to develop the capacity to examine their own systems and use the evidence base to advocate for change among district \u201cactors and national policy makers. \u201d Justice reform strategies should be focused on promoting a constructive process of \u201cchange, rather than imposing an end state. \u201d PART\ufeffI:\ufeffENGAGING\ufeffWITH\ufeffNON-STATE\ufeffJUSTICE\ufeffSYSTEMS\ufeff(NSJS)\ufeff 18 Discussion \u2022 Adopting an incremental approach need not always imply that a great deal of time is needed to bring about changes.

The variations of quality of service and reach of the state affect their degree of involvement with non-state justice systems. The state is not the same at every level. Local governments and local authorities may be better at navigating non-state justice jurisdictions based on community realities and needs than could a distant state located in a national capital. \u2022 A research process dealing with the interface between state and non-state justice systems is itself a part of the dynamics of change because it necessarily opens up spaces for dialogue and discussions about what to do about \u2018injustice\u2019.

Traditional Actors in New Councils Strengthening Informal Justice System through Guideline Development and Training: Case of UNDP collaboration with Aceh Adat Council in Indonesia The case study from Aceh, Indonesia, examined linkages between customary (adat) actors and state institutions at lower levels of governance. The people of Aceh had suffered 30-year-long conflict and the 2004 tsunami, which together killed more than 200,000 people and devastated the lives of another million. In this context, UNDP Indonesia with the Indonesian National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) conducted a comprehensive Access to Justice Assessment in Aceh in 2006\u20137, and found a range of challenges that constrain the ability of formal and informal justice providers to handle grievances effectively. According to the assessment, a majority of Acehnese preferred the adat (customary/informal) justice mechanisms available in their communities for resolving their disputes over the formal justice system. At the same time, the adat justice system had various challenges, such as: lack of knowledge and capacity of customary (adat) justice leaders, absence of guidelines and common standards, discrimination against women and other vulnerable groups, ambiguity of jurisdiction divisions with the formal system, and insufficient accountability safeguards. Therefore, the assessment recommended engaging with the adat justice system in Aceh, so as to improve the quality of justice delivered to people in the communities. Out of these findings, UNDP Indonesia implemented \u201cAdat (customary or informal) Justice Enhancement Component\u201d as part of the Aceh Justice Project (2007\u201311) in partnership with the Aceh Customary Council (MAA). The project developed and distributed the Informal Justice Guidelines, and trained thousands of informal justice practitioners on these guidelines and case management. MAA first produced a description of current adat practices and the normative framework governing adat6. Following extensive consultations with relevant stakeholders, the MAA developed information which sets out agreed demarcation of jurisdiction, standards and procedures for adat justice. The guidelines focus on substantive rather than procedural functions of the MAA. The general guidelines on adat justice cover the following issues: \u2022 Principles of Adat Justice \u2022 Legal Basis of Adat Justice \u2022 The Aceh Adat Justice Executive Institution \u2022 Types of Dispute and Resolution Procedures 6 The project did not work with sharia law specifically due to donor requests.

As such, rather than simply demanding women\u2019s participation or setting quotas, confidence and capacity building activities for women were adopted, and MAA implemented a dedicated programme to build the capacity of female elders in its latest stage. The MAA experience resulted in: \u2022 Improved understanding of the appropriate division of jurisdiction between adat justice and the police. \u2022 Increased communication and coordination between adat leaders and community police in resolving or closing cases that may have been reported and investigated simultaneously through both channels. \u2022 Improved means of resolving jurisdictional conflicts between village adat justice providers and community police through reporting. \u2022 Overall improvement in case management, including standardized documentation and filing practices that facilitate the correct implementation of jurisdictional divisions and coordinating procedures. \u2022 Recognition and acceptance by MAA and adat leaders of the importance of gender and human rights in strengthening the adat justice system to make it fairer and more equitable. \u2022 In relation to the local regulations, strengthening of the adat\u2019s role in supporting and driving the empowerment of adat leaders in providing community-level justice. For UNDP Indonesia, working to improve the informal justice systems is not to diminish the importance of the formal justice systems. Rather, it is based on the recognition that adat system, derived from local wisdom of the various ethnic groups in this vastly plural nation plays a critical role in strengthening access to justice, particularly of the poor and marginalised, using mechanisms that they are most familiar with. Lessons from the Aceh Justice Project: 1. Begin with a needs assessment of high quality. 2. Work with those who have a standing in legal institutions and the reputation and legitimacy to promote non-state justice. 3. Creating an enabling environment through appropriate legislation on powers of the police and non-state justice system actors is important. In the case of Aceh, the MAA\u2019s legitimacy and effectiveness was significantly enhanced by provincial legislation addressing these issues. Partners must have, or be willing to establish, a legal basis for their work. 4. External partners cannot be the main drivers. In the case of Aceh, it was the MAA that led the process. 5. Working in coordination with other projects and agencies to synchronize similar or mutually supportive programs is essential to ensuring the effective implementation of non-state justice programs. 6. In order to promote cooperation between state and non-state justice actors, it may be desirable to extend support to both sets of institutions, instead of only focusing on non-state justice systems.

Should the state assimilate customary laws and deprive them of their distinctive identity or should the state acknowledge and uphold the distinctiveness and validity of customary law? Moreover, this issue is important because under existing frameworks of legal pluralism, there can be asymmetry in the standing accorded to different legal systems. Politics often decides which system will prevail over another. Furthermore, legal pluralism can lead to some questionable forms of forum shopping where the more powerful parties to a dispute can pick a forum that will favour them.

Perpetual requests for land surveys by the state are met with distrust, as land surveys are seen as alien concepts. There is a fundamental tension between the state approach to land and land ownership and customary commons.

Once there, they should maintain a level of openness \u2013 to not preach and provide, but engage and learn. \u2022 We must be mindful that norms of customary law as interpreted elite groups within the community will be biased and not necessarily accurate or authoritative.

They can have professional profiles, or be layperson volunteers. Community-based paralegals require a variety of skills, including mediation, education, and organizing. They frequently work with lawyers, but the degree to which paralegals are regulated or even recognised by the formal system varies greatly.

Participatory Consultations for Constitutional Recognition of Non-State Justice Systems in Timor-Leste: Involving non-state actors in drafting procedures\u2019 Why a process of consultation? Processes of consultation in drafting laws on customary justice systems is necessary in order to ensure that the legislation responds to the reality of the country, the needs and demands of the population. Participation is a constitutional right in many countries, including Timor- Leste. Further, consultation processes provide space for dialogue and consensus among justice actors, i.e. traditional authorities, women, justice operators, human rights organizations, NGOs, and others. A research and consultation process is also necessary for the following purposes: By working across the plural justice spectrum, paralegals begin from the perspective of \u2018people\u2019s disputes\u2019 and can navigate both state and non- state systems to reach an appropriate remedy.

The consultations resulted in four main proposals related to local justice: 1. Recognition of customary mechanisms for conflict resolution as non-jurisdictional mechanisms. This includes the customary authorities\u2019 capacity to negotiate mediate or decide on remedies to which both parties voluntarily commit. These negotiations will have legal effect before the courts, after agreements or decisions are reviewed to determine correlation to human rights standards. If the agreements are related to semi-public crimes, the case will be dismissed, if the case is related to public crimes, the reparation or reconciliation may help reduce the penalty imposed by the court. 2. Recognition of customary law with limitations to accommodate human rights, based on consultation. The Timorese people proposed limits to customary practices related to gender issues (forced marriages, domestic violence, inheritance issues), elimination of the cast system, and systems of prohibitions and fines. 3.

Multiple State and Local Justice Hybrids in \u2018Special Areas\u2019 of Pakistan There are two broad categories of approach prevailing in these discussions: the prescriptive (i.e. those based on best practice, success stories and lessons) and the deconstructionists (i.e. context determines everything and every context is unique). We must develop bridges between the two. There is no convenient binary. Every context has similarities and differences. Similarly, there is no convenient duality between state and non-state; instead there are overlaps and ambiguities.

Further, the rushed timeframe (consultants had 15 days to develop the strategy) and unclear conceptions led to prescriptions without data and without deliberation. Lack of adequate engagement with non-state justice systems in the rest of Pakistan is on account of the predominant court-centric approach. The courts are confronted with mounting litigation, delays and backlogs. The challenge of case management has resulted in general neglect of substantive and procedural reforms in law. Complex dualities of supply and demand, state and citizen, state and non-state justice have been overlooked. In some cases traditional non-state justice systems have been co-opted, i.e. Panchayat, Faislo & Jirga has also been revealed. In this context there is a growing tendency on the part of people to avoid courts and increasingly rely upon non-state or private dispute resolution.

Cases at the jirga must be registered. Some challenges within the non-state justice systems of Afghanistan include: \u2022 Exclusion of women from participation in decision- making; \u2022 Discrimination against the poor and powerless; \u2022 Violations of human rights principles, for example: bad, or forced under-age marriages; \u2022 Procedures and rulings that are contradictory to national laws; \u2022 Enforcement of decisions is not guaranteed; \u2022 Lack of proper record keeping; \u2022 Traditional perceptions and tribal codes/values are considered instead of \u2018real justice\u2019; \u2022 Deep roots of enmity among the tribes can result in discriminatory decision-making; \u2022 Low level of knowledge about human rights (Islam and international constitution); \u2022 Weak coordination between the NGOs and Government and donors; and \u2022 Low rate of literacy. Civil Society Organisations in Afghanistan Civil society groups in Afghanistan have been conducting awareness training for judicial officials, government employees (men and women), religious leaders, Mullahs, Maliks, village leaders, police, school teachers and students, youths, housewives, and NGO employees. The topics covered have included Constitution of Afghanistan, Islamic Human Rights, and other adopted laws. CSOs have also supported advocacy projects. They have sought to empower women through literacy programmes. They have also addressed means of engaging with parliament, provincial level shura, and to participate in Community Development Councils (CDC). Guidance has also been given on small business development. One civil society organization, the Education and Training Centre for Poor Women and Girls of Afghanistan (EWC), has worked with non-state justice systems in Afghanistan to: \u2022 Train more than 2000 influential people, such as religious leaders, as potential trainers to work as Human Rights Awareness trainers; \u2022 Establish Youth Volunteer Committees at village and city level to advocate for human rights; \u2022 Develop and publish materials on human rights awareness, including conflict resolution and mediation training manuals with the help of the community elders and leaders; \u2022 Establish a Legal Aid Clinic in Kunduz province focusing on women\u2019s rights support and have encouraged the community to report on incidents calling for legal attention; and \u2022 Conduct advocacy campaigns to call for support on human rights. Recommendations \u2022 The donors and NGOs should support and implement programmes that directly or indirectly support and assist the formal justice systems. \u2022 The programmes related to non-state justice systems conducted by NGOs, should highlight positive aspects of those institutions and Afghanistan traditions that give them legitimacy. \u2022 There must be strong coordination among the government, councils and NGOs (CSOs and Donors). \u2022 A proper and standard database should be established for recording the cases decided by state institutions and non-state institutions. \u2022 The international community should provide the formal justice system with technical assistants and advisors to assist them in the implementation of law.

When do communities respect the authority of the government? Why are customary systems of organisation effective? The separation of local authority as well as checks and balances between actors maintains the legitimacy, authority and perceived fairness of the systems. The Malik, the shura and the Mullahs are largely independent entities whose legitimacy is derived from different sources. The study found that village governance is most effective when no single actor dominates the others. Customary governance actors maintain long time horizons. They are familiar with the history of the community and they are recognised as enduring entities. This is an advantage not enjoyed by the international community, nor the state. Customary governance actors maintain and use revenue from reliable local sources and are not dependent on aid, local government budgets or bribes. As such, customary decision makers are accountable to the community. Key findings from the survey include the following: \u2022 There is no evidence that the presence of customary organisations undermines state support. In fact, better quality of customary organisations is associated with increased level of support for the state. Faith in their shura and jirgas with increased accessibility to decision- making and participation also reflects a faith in the state and confidence in democracy. Access to customary organisations is highly compatible with democratic values. And, government leaders are more legitimate in the eyes of community members when they take cognizance of customary law instead of only the state law. \u2022 When the scale of conflict increases, the ability to resolve issues locally decreases. The scale of conflict is affected by the influx of larger numbers of power holders and claimants. Following the influx of finance from CDC projects (these can be community \u2018mobilisation\u2019 grants of up to $60,000) the number and complexity of claims have increased. \u2022 Strong customary actors have the ability to check the authority of the state, because customary structures are governance structures. They are much more than courts or arbiters. \u2022 Aid can only have a limited positive impact, and is not a substitute for the state. \u2022 There is regular interaction between customary actors and the state at the local level. For practitioners and development partners, the fundamental question becomes:\u201cEngage for What?\u201d We have to remember that external engagement alters incentives. Non-state actors can be perceived as, or indeed, become agents of the state or agents of NGOs. Engagement raises other critical questions \u2013 do we strengthen one body over others? What are the incentives and disincentives we are creating and how will that affect the balance (or imbalance) of power? Access to customary organisations is highly compatible with democratic values. And, government leaders are more legitimate in the eyes of community members when they take cognizance of customary \u201claw instead of only the state law. \u201d PART\ufeffI:\ufeffENGAGING\ufeffWITH\ufeffNON-STATE\ufeffJUSTICE\ufeffSYSTEMS\ufeff(NSJS)\ufeff 26 How can we overcome limitations of projects with short durations? Lack of long term planning horizons is often a cause for failure in development programming. If we are creating new bodies, altering incentives, and flushing certain systems with attention and money \u2013 what happens when the attention and money is gone and the systems are abandoned? The research demonstrates that intervention by the state is in high demand, particularly for larger scale public goods and services, such as intra-communal goods and infrastructure. Yet, donor proclivities are towards \u2018community development\u2019. There is tremendous demand for impartial state structures, even among those who are strongly supportive of customary structures.

A separate training manual was developed for officials within the formal justice system. The training materials combined statutory laws, Sharia and those international conventions which had a positive resonance among the beneficiaries. The human rights messages in these manuals were supported by direct citation of Quranic verses and the hadith. Other sources of law, including interpretations by non-authoritative institutions or personalities could not have the same kind of credibility among the trainees. The training gave the ulama opportunities through the facilitated and interactive discussions to reach \u2018human rights compatible\u2019 interpretations. After each chapter the manual set out examples of conflicts and disputes that could be resolved on the basis of authorities cited in order to guide other users of the manual. \u2018Legal Pragmatism and Rights Protection in Customary Legal Mechanisms in Afghanistan\u2019 Some key points regarding the process of understanding how to engage with non-state actors include the following: \u2022 Ownership by Afghan stakeholders is critical. \u2022 We must engage a multi-disciplinary approach to understanding this system \u2013 history, anthropology as well as current approaches of law and political science and to some extent economics. The current approach to intervention in Afghanistan\u2019s justice system is policy driven and implemented by legal scholars, however, this is too narrow. A recent example of this is the law that has been passed by Parliament to regulate the operation of shura. The Ministry of Justice is not in a position of regulating such a mechanism for justice. The regulation of these mechanisms should be done by the traditional authorities and respected persons, including both men and women. \u2022 The international community\u2019s interventions in Afghanistan have been hampered by an over reliance on international human rights norms and complex legal formulations, and a relative neglect of existing power structures within the community. \u2022 The injection of international funding has created \u2018dependency\u2019 in both the state and non-state actors in the justice systems of Afghanistan. \u2022 International actors need to employ a \u2018more humble approach\u2019. The use of regional examples of justice delivery institutions drawn from neighbouring countries (e.g. India or Pakistan) might be more useful than borrowing from \u2018Western\u2019 models and practices. Engaging with Non-State Justice Systems \u2013 Principles and Recommendations The symposium participants broke into four groups to address the following concerns: 1. Problematisation: defining objectives and the research agenda for engaging with non-state justice systems 2. The relevance of local legal principles and practices 3. Consideration of feasible, alternative mechanisms for justice delivery If we are creating new bodies, altering incentives, and flushing certain systems with attention and money \u2013 what happens when the attention and money is gone \u201cand the systems are abandoned? \u201d PART\ufeffI:\ufeffENGAGING\ufeffWITH\ufeffNON-STATE\ufeffJUSTICE\ufeffSYSTEMS\ufeff(NSJS)\ufeff\ufeff 27 4. Possible principles governing the state/non-state interaction Problematisation: defining objectives and doing the research At the very outset the issue of whether to engage or not with state or non-state systems should be proceeded with an understanding of \u2018what is known\u2019 and \u2018what is not known\u2019. \u2022 The dichotomy \u2018non-state/state system\u2019 is problematic. Both sets of justice systems operate with different forms of formality. The assumption that non-state systems are less formal compared to state systems may not be correct. \u2022 It is important to recognize that justice systems, both state and non-state are part of the political landscape and cannot be treated as insulated entities. Therefore, it may be better to approach the problem as part of governance involving a plurality of governance modes and mechanisms. \u2022 The idea of justice should be broadened from a narrow sense of \u2018seeking remedies to resolve conflicts\u2019, to encompassing questions of distribution, social justice, and violations of human rights. \u2022 Which comes first \u2013 identifying the problem or doing the research? Action research provides a \u2018way out\u2019 because it enables problems to be identified through participatory research, informed by interactions amongst stakeholders. This method is capable of yielding solutions that make sense to the community.

It rules out grandiose projects of social-engineering. Consideration of feasible, alternative mechanisms for justice delivery The discussion in this group identified some entry points and the pros and cons of alternative modes of justice delivery that need not be grouped into state or non-state. The role of paralegals in justice delivery can often straddle both state and non-state institutions. Some examples from country contexts were provided: Cambodia: Access to formal institutions affected by logistical and resource constraints. Where justice is delivered at the community level by \u2018elders\u2019 or community leaders, there is the problem of enforceability. This raises the need for state recognition, in addition to community acceptance of these mechanisms. China: Sending paralegals to remote areas has proved to be a viable option in China. Paralegals have been successful where they have been properly trained and they have been able to win the trust and confidence of communities. Peoples\u2019 Mediation Boards have also proved to be useful in resolving disputes and avoiding recourse to state courts. When a mediated agreement has the consent of disputants, this serves as a contract between them which they are obliged to respect. If necessary, it can be also enforced by a formal state authority. India: Non-state \u2018justice\u2019 systems range from mechanisms established by communities of scavengers and sweepers, to grain traders in towns to which farmers bring their produce, to diamond dealers. All of these are grounded in their respective communities and are motivated to avoiding excessive costs and maintaining harmony and fair play in their transactions. Pakistan: The Musalihat Anjuman enjoys legitimacy as their processes are grounded in local culture, and they are a component of the national judicial policy. All stakeholders are willing to use the system, and the police are mandated to respect their outcomes. Possible principles governing the state/ non-state interaction The group discussing this topic did not think it desirable to draw up \u2018principles of engagement\u2019. Instead, it directed attention to the following points: PART\ufeffI:\ufeffENGAGING\ufeffWITH\ufeffNON-STATE\ufeffJUSTICE\ufeffSYSTEMS\ufeff(NSJS)\ufeff 28 \u2022 Nature of engagement: The reasons for and the nature of engagement with state and non-state actors must be clearly understood. \u2022 Nature of state: It is important to understand the type of authority that a state might want to assert when it seeks to determine the jurisdiction of non-state institutions. A dogmatic adherence to the state as having a Napoleonic ideal of the state as having monopoly over delivery of justice should be avoided. \u2022 Actors: who are the relevant actors \u2013 what is their duty and what role can they play in improving access to justice? Where is the agency of the community? How can this be developed with regards to relationships with the state? \u2022 Nature of context: it is important to consider the demand of communities that are engaged and their context, as this is helpful for the designing of an intervention. Participation from all bodies is a key for a good programme design. \u2022 Above all, \u2018Do No Harm\u2019: Interventions should not spur new conflict. Concluding Reflections Marc Galanter: It is important to acknowledge the moving frontier of justice and that it is inherently dynamic. Injustice is a valuable starting point when engaging with state and non-state justice systems. People can have different senses of what injustice is. Different senses of injustice can give rise to different expectations. The sense of injustice is triggered not only in instances of unfairness amongst individuals but could also emanate from a more general appraisal of the performance of governance institutions, especially police and executive officials.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8fe0b5d2-e840-4502-bfe2-31bd87175c5c": {"__data__": {"id_": "8fe0b5d2-e840-4502-bfe2-31bd87175c5c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sharing Experience in Access to Justice: Engaging with Non-State Justice Systems & Conducting Assessments", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "325a0e17618d90f6c10eed4ae0814a8d0215d15576838a79662603cd61b0c97f"}, "2": {"node_id": "8929f202-1de5-4157-8278-cd17c671eb04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4a944b96beb0f7eccc253fef0bdc80813bc140adc7e6476444e4933a5a9b196d"}}, "hash": "4e7b72fce16f92e18a6c5024da2b8d2c962e9c02cd85007a7ad4f2ebd2d72a8a", "text": "Erica Harper: Several points are important for any development programme, including the value of research and evidence based programming with a participatory and multidisciplinary approach; holistic programming; the \u2018do-no-harm\u2019 principle; and the importance of finding entry points other than justice and thus avoid marginalising people\u2019s priorities.

This relates to varying conceptions of injustice. Perceptions over the \u2018ideal\u2019 will vary. \u2022 It is important to recognize agency. People are not mere clients. They are capable of fashioning solutions to injustice. \u2022 Justice should be understood broadly. Justice needs to be done not only to prevent violence and conflict, but also to ensure that people have access to everything that is needed for life with dignity and humanity. Anyone who seeks to work in the area of justice must be prepared to shoulder the burden of a high standard of accountability which extends not only to the people that are sought to be served, but also to patterns of funding and committment to durability and the \u2018long haul\u2019. Deborah Isser: The focus of development partners should be function, not form. This is why they must evaluate our impact. A couple of points to in elaboration: \u2022 While selecting the right entry points is important, assessment of impact is more important. What do programmes supported by external actors actually do is the point, not what inputs they provided, such as how many people they may have trained. Bringing about desirable changes in inequitable distribution of power would be an important impact. The challenge is how to make that happen. \u2022 Raising legal consciousness: What does this actually mean? Awareness and sensitization are not useful terms. The question is instead, how do we help create real opportunities? \u2022 Engaging in order to reinforce justice for the poor. Making a difference in the lives of people who are struggling against exploitation and injustice should be the touchstone. \u2022 Social embeddedness: Socially embedded interventions are more likely to have a systemic impact. Masood Amer: We must be critically aware of the dynamism of non-state justice systems. They are capable of change, they are susceptible to incorporating new norms when they are supported or pressured by their constituencies. It is important to avoid confusing, diluting or deligitimising this inherent dynamism among non- state justice systems. External development partners must be cognizent about this potential for change and coherent in their support for change. PART\ufeffII:\ufeff\ufeffCONDUCTING\ufeffACCESS\ufeffTO\ufeffJUSTICE\ufeffASSESSMENTS\ufeff 29 Introduction \u2013 UNDP and Access to Justice Assessments in the Asia Pacific Region The UNDP regional initiative on the human rights-based access to justice \u2013 the Asia Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative (AP-A2J) has been ongoing since 2002. The AP-A2J Initiative is focused on a bottom-up approach to ensure that people have better access to justice. The AP-A2J Initiative grounded UNDP\u2019s justice related work firmly within the framework of the human rights-based approach (HRBA). By adopting the human rights-based approach to access to justice, practitioners found a framework for the process of human development that is normatively based on, and operationally directed to, developing capacities for the realization of human rights. HRBA seeks to address and correct existing power imbalances in development processes. It recognizes human beings as rights-holders and establishes obliga- tions for duty-bearers (accountability/empowerment). It targets efforts pro-actively towards groups suffering discrimination and marginalisation and focuses on the processes used in programming for human development. The foundation of the HRBA lies in principles of non- discrimination, participation, and accountability. HRBA is critical in terms of both the what and the how of development processes. The substantive value (what) of adopting HRBA includes: \u2022 Focuses on most disadvantaged groups and their entitlements as human beings \u2022 Strengthens Human Development and Capacity Development perspectives \u2022 Brings process of development to the forefront The process value (how) of using HRBA includes: \u2022 Improves assessment and analysis \u2013 holistic, systematic, results-oriented \u2022 Actively seeks inclusion of most disadvantaged people \u2022 Improves accountability systems \u2022 Expands partnerships and strengthens communication flows Discussions in this session were informed by presentations by the following: Aparna Basnyat, UNDP APRC Human Rights Specialist.

It also explicitly notes the quality of justice that is required (respectful of human rights) and recognizes both formal and traditional justice mechanisms. As a result of the AP-A2J Initiative, there have been many UNDP access to justice programmes in the region that have undertaken assessments. The assessments have been used as the starting point for justice policy and programming as it provides necessary information as to who has access to justice remedies and who does not and why. Further, these assessments: \u2022 Address a specific access to justice issue rather than an institution; \u2022 Build knowledge of the problem to better address the problems; \u2022 Analyse perceptions on the meaning of \u2018justice\u2019 and \u2018access to justice\u2019; \u2022 Provide a space for dialogue among duty bearers and rights holders that can influence policy making; and \u2022 Serve as a vehicle for empowerment and accountability. UNDP have started or completed access to justice assessments in several countries including Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, the Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Timor-Leste, and Viet Nam. These assessments have been designed and implemented independently of each other and methodologies and scope have varied. Some countries chose to pursue a nationwide assessment while others focused on certain groups or issues, such as access to justice for women, indigenous peoples, and conflict- affected populations. Some assessments were conducted with a limited geographic scope, targeting specific districts or provinces. These assessments have also served various purposes. In Cambodia, the assessment provided the basis for designing UNDP programmes on access to justice. In Viet Nam, the assessment served as a baseline measure for impact from the access to justice. In Indonesia, the assessment initiated and informed a national strategy on access to justice. In Sri Lanka and Nepal, the assessments were intended to facilitate a dialogue with the government on justice and human rights issues during the conflict, but they could not be completed due to political sensitivities. Here, there are some important lessons about conducting assessments in conflict or post-conflict environments, which will be detailed later in this report. Mapping and Review of Access to Justice Assessments in the Region \u2013 Draft Paper In 2010, UNDP APRC commissioned a paper to review the different tools, processes and methodologies used as access to justice assessments in the region. The paper reviewed seventeen access to justice assessments conducted both by UNDP and other development agencies. The presentation underlined aspects of the design, the analysis of the findings, the impact of the assessments, as well as mainstreaming of sensitivities within the assessment, and identifying particular special situations that affect the assessment including conflict situations. Some preliminary findings from the review include the following points: \u2022 Use of different methods. Assessments have developed and refined research designs, methods and tools to suit specific contexts. Often, despite different methods findings and conclusions will be similar in broad areas, however certain methods can reveal more specific findings in target areas. \u2022 Defining Access to justice. A clear definition of access to justice can usefully guide assessments. However, some leave the definition vague and open to probing by the target communities thus establishing a definition based on community understanding. Some definitions have included overarching issues of rights protection, as well as rights enhancement in positive enabling environments. Some have defined access to justice in legal empowerment terms; as a combination of individual awareness, access, and confidence. Some assessments focused on access to social justice or access to resources and others focused on both supply and demand side understandings. \u2022 Approaches to assessments. Some assessments start with a clear acceptance that the human rights based approach will be followed, while some assessments merely imply it. \u2022 Rationales and Assumptions. Some assessments are conducted with prior understanding of access to justice issues within a country or community group and follow on from such. Others are conducted in order to develop an understanding about potential issues, or more generally to provide baselines for assessing changes in access to justice for selected groups. \u2022 Methodologies and tools. The majority of assessments follow time tested research methods to examine and understand phenomena and perceptions. A few assessments go beyond exploration and understanding, and work action research into methodologies aimed at empowering the people who participate in the research process. \u2022 Assessment design. Explicit objectives influence the assessment design. Detailed terms of reference provide clear guidelines for those undertaking the PART\ufeffII:\ufeffCONDUCTING\ufeffACCESS\ufeffTO\ufeffJUSTICE\ufeffASSESSMENTS\ufeff\ufeff 31 assessment but also in ensuring a focused approach to the assessment.

The selection criteria can also be based on qualitative data gathered through socio-economic mappings of sites. Assessments should attempt to ensure samples that are representative of populations in terms of geographical distribution, ethnicity, age, sex, professions, income levels, and education. The actual sample sizes vary in assessments. Clearly defined timeframes and implementation plans are important as assessments can range from three weeks to two years. Constraints and unforeseen problems have delayed assessments; and yet assessment designs typically do not have strategic plans to mitigate such risks. Furthermore, there is no established methodology for rapid assessments. \u2022 Data collection methods. Assessments often use both quantitative and qualitative data collected through both primary and secondary sources. Primary data, both qualitative and quantitative is collected through surveys, focus group discussions (FGDs), in-depth interviews, and information gathering and sharing workshops. Secondary data is collected from case studies, literature and desk reviews from various sources. \u2022 Research design. Most assessments outline a series of research questions that guide the assessment. Research questions must be specifically formulated in culturally familiar and acceptable ways in different assessments. Often direct questions need to be complemented with hypothetical problems posed for the participant to respond to more comfortably. Some are probing questions which look at wide conceptual issues together with direct practical issues. \u2022 Innovative methods and tools. Some assessments involve additional objectives and have included capacity building efforts for people conducting or participating in assessments. Others have considered strategic training of researchers, quality control systems, process-monitoring frameworks and development of a \u201cDo no harm\u201d note. \u2022 Partnering for Research. Partnerships add strategic value to the assessments and many are jointly conceptualized and implemented. Past partnerships include those between governments, UN agencies, donors, non-government organisations, research institutions and academic institutions with diverse levels of decision making placed on each partner. There is value in \u2018outsourcing\u2019 research to national research institutions too. \u2022 Teams and Experts. The team arrangements for assessments vary. Some rely heavily on national partners and include local and international experts from various thematic and methodological expertise to provide technical assistance. Some also invite an external review of findings and conclusions. The involvement of wider audiences at local and national forums is critical for results dissemination and awareness-raising. \u2022 Arriving at Findings, Conclusions and Recommendations. Assessments can provide extensive and comprehensive findings. It is difficult to arrive at a uniform system of data analysis and distilling conclusions from the vast amount of information gathered. Some use a collection of analysis tools- conflict analysis, institutional analysis, service analysis, dispute resolution analysis, perceptions analysis, needs analysis to identify conclusive statements. \u2022 Results of Assessments. How do these assessments impact on the lives of the people who they aim to serve? To date, many assessments do not include follow up for monitoring and evaluating projects and programmes that are conceptualised and implemented as a result of these assessments. This is an area that requires discussion. \u2022 Mainstreaming Focus on Disadvantaged Groups. How do you ensure mainstreaming of gender, ethnicity, class, caste and other sensitivities to access to justice assessments? Does the human rights based approach ensure this? \u2022 Special Situations. Assessing access to justice in spe- cific situations need clear guidelines. Specific situations could include conflict situations, post conflict situations, and situations where access to justice for poor and mar- ginalized populations is not a national priority, or where certain groups are oppressed by the government.

In each province, two districts were targeted with two sub-districts within the districts and two villages per sub-district, to a total of 40 villages. These villages were selected due to specific characteristics including intensity of conflict, ethnic/religious composi- tion, strength of traditional governance, distance from the capital and the level of poverty/development. The research framework examined the following issues: \u2022 Citizen\u2019s trust in the justice system \u2022 Legal and normative protection of rights and remedies \u2022 Legal awareness \u2022 Legal aid and counsel \u2022 Investigation \u2022 Detention \u2022 Prosecution \u2022 Judicial adjudication \u2022 Administrative dispute resolution \u2022 Informal and traditional dispute resolution \u2022 Enforcement \u2022 Civil society and parliamentary oversight Adopting a human rights-based approach (HRBA) for the research framework meant that there was an overt focus on the perspectives of the poor and disadvantaged, and that the issues were framed in terms of duty bearers and claim holders. These perspectives allowed \u2018justice\u2019 to be framed more widely than it might have been. However, there were challenges posed by using HRBA since it was less helpful in aiding identification of priority issues. In terms of conducting the assessment, the assessment was managed by UNDP and BAPPENAS, the National Development Planning Agency of the Government of Indonesia, and implemented by Peace and Security Studies at the University of Gajah Mada (PSKP-UGM) with five research teams and five NGOs conducting the surveys. Secondary research was conducted for preliminary site selection. After selecting the sites, 200 focus group discussions were conducted followed up with 700 in-depth interviews and a quantitative survey of 4500 respondents. Some key issues and lessons that emerged from the assessment highlight some of the challenges in applying HRBA in the research framework and implementation. The focus on disadvantaged groups, for example, is easier said than done as identifying and obtaining access can take time and finding \u2018the most\u2019 disadvantaged may not always be strictly necessary, as often in poorer areas, the difference between \u2018average\u2019 and disadvantaged may be marginal. Additionally, HRBA encourages a strong focus on participation at all levels, but greater participation can involve trade-offs including a large investment of time and money. In many cases, additional investments much be made in the capacities of those taking part in order to ensure meaningful participation. Finally, a strict adherence to HRBA has the potential to undermine true \u2018partnerships\u2019 where the approach is unfamiliar to the implementing partners. For more details see Assessment publication, Justice for All, available at: http://www.undp.or.id/programme/ governance/ Equal Access to Justice Survey in Sri Lanka The access to justice assessment was aimed at providing a baseline for the UNDP justice project as well as other national actors in the sector to enable better targeting and monitoring of the impact of their intervention. It was also an effort by the UNDP Equal Access to Justice Project to identify areas of intervention for their programme as they moved from the first phase (2004\u20132009) to the second phase (2009\u20132012). However, due to the sensitive context in which it took place, the assessment was halted upon request by the Ministry of Defence, citing security reasons. In any assessment, the context that the assessment takes place is very important. In Sri Lanka this was critical in HRBA encourages a strong focus on participation at all levels, but greater participation can involve trade-offs including \u201ca large investment of time and money \u201d PART\ufeffII:\ufeffCONDUCTING\ufeffACCESS\ufeffTO\ufeffJUSTICE\ufeffASSESSMENTS\ufeff\ufeff 33 determining the outcome of the assessment. Planning for the assessment began in 2008 in a context where the conflict was escalating. There was a lack of data on the justice sector. In the north of the country, there was no access to two districts and Jaffna was extremely costly to get to. In the east, the provinces had just been brought under government control. The assessment, in trying to determine the access to justice for the most vulnerable, sought to focus on the north and east conflict affected areas.

The assessment fieldwork was conducted from August 2008 until November 2009 where fourteen out of the twenty-two districts were surveyed by UNOPS. Of the eight remaining district, five are partially completed (Mannar, Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Badulla, and Anuradhapura). UNOPS led the quantitative part of the survey which included the household survey. Based on key issues raised from these surveys, FGDs were held on particular subjects and led by the local NGO Center for Policy Alternatives\u2019 Social Indicators. Social Indicators also conducted focus group discussions with service providers. UNOPS\u2019 quantitative results were analysed by the UNDP Access to Justice Project and Social Indicator to identify key trends. The FGDs were then held to try to understand the reason behind the numbers and trends. For example, the quantitative survey posed the question: \u201cQ. In the event that your husband ill treats you, where would you go first for advice? a) Mediation Board, b) Legal Aid Provider, c) Religious Leader, d) GN or DS, e) Police, f) School principal, g) Other\u201d. The qualitative part of the survey would follow up to try to answer why the answers were given. In this case, if 84% of people say religious leader or school principal, the FGD would try to identify the reasons such as a lack of knowledge about the importance of reporting to the police, lack of awareness that domestic violence is a crime, or there is no legal aid clinic in easy reach. The access to justice survey would be a key tool in developing project interventions. Using the above example possible interventions could include: \u2022 Awareness raising and training for religious leaders and school principals, so that they come to recognise that domestic violence is a crime and can provide appropriate support to people in the community. \u2022 Legal awareness campaign in the assessment target area and mobile legal aid services in remote villages. Some responses from the districts included: \u2022 Puttalum \u2013 where competition over fishing grounds, thuggary and work-related disputes were identified as the top disputes, potential responses were identified as: consultative forums between the different fishing associations; training for mediation boards to handle work related disputes; or sharing results with the police and discuss best ways of addressing thuggary. \u2022 Ampara \u2013 where lack of legal documentation, land disputes and alcohol use were identified as key issues, interventions could include mobile documentation clinics; training for legal aid providers to advice on land related cases; or highlighting dangers of alcohol abuse with local schools, religious leaders and community organisations who are better placed to assist. Some key lessons from the assessment include the following: \u2022 The framework for the assessment needs to be clear and it is necessary that there is an agreement among the implementing partners on a common approach to the assessment. \u2022 In this case, it was critical that the national stakeholders (especially the government) have ownership of the data. \u2022 Context is critical in determining the success/outcomes of the survey and it is important to be sensitive to the environment in which the survey is being conducted. During times of insecurity, participants in the assessment may be suspicious of how their contributions will be used.

Through the Protecting Human Rights and Promoting Access to Justice Project signed in 2008, UNDP is supporting the Government to provide critical preparatory assistance and support for the production of baseline data needed to create the foundation for applying the human rights based approach to strengthening the justice sector. The survey will also identify interventions necessary to address the gaps identified in the system. This includes obstacles for citizens to access to justice and the capacity of service providers to deliver justice. The findings of the survey will provide policy recommendations to guide the justice sector and broader democratic reforms. The study considers the following objectives: \u2022 Provide baseline information on public confidence in the justice system; \u2022 Provide insights into citizen\u2019s awareness of the justice system and to access to justice; \u2022 Identify types of grievances faced by people and the obstacles in seeking redress; \u2022 Identify the knowledge base of duty bearers; \u2022 Identify the challenges and obstacles faced by duty bearers; \u2022 Provide information related to legal and rights awareness to survey communities; and \u2022 Provide avenues for policy discussions, sensitization and recommendations for informing policy, access to justice and justice sector reforms. Involving all project partners is critical to the success of the survey. Through every stage there was consultation with all the project partners which includes the Attorney General\u2019s Office, the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office, Home Affairs and the Judiciary (including the High Court and the subordinate courts). The inputs from all the institutions which worked as a team helped to localize the survey. Also it was seen that feedback at every stage is essential with regard to all aspects of the survey. Prior to commencing the assessment, a human rights- based approach to access to justice workshop was held with support from the UNDP Asia Pacific Regional Centre which helped in bringing all the partners together in understanding and agreeing on the aim and objectives of the survey. The inputs from this workshop were also used to inform the survey and the Indonesia assessment experience was used as the framework which was modified to fit into the local context. The survey was conducted using a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods which provided for an extensive in-depth analysis of access to justice and related issues. Questionnaires were administered by enumerators (employed by a survey firm) to a randomly selected sample of around 2000 citizens. The enumerators were also trained by an international consultant as to the objective and purpose of the access to justice. Some key points in conducting the survey are as follows: \u2022 Although the sample was randomly selected, the importance of a gender balance in the sample was thought and those polled were selected to ensure that there was gender balance; \u2022 Maldives was divided into four strata according to the distance from Male\u2019 as distance was an important factor influencing access to justice; \u2022 The court system is structured in a way that all the courts of first instance with full jurisdiction along with the tribunals are situated in Male\u2019; and \u2022 Samples were taken from all the atolls and one island was randomly selected for the survey- this was done to strengthen the legitimacy of the survey among the population. The questionnaires to ascertain information on public perception consisted of: \u2022 Small Questionnaire \u2013 designed to measure general perceptions on law and specific perceptions of the justice system (sample size of 2,000); and \u2022 Large Questionnaire \u2013 designed to measure more in-depth information about the respondents attitude towards the justice system, their knowledge of law, as well as their experiences in relation to the justice system (sample size of 150).

Additionally, case studies were developed on criminal, civil and family cases from the courts. Some lessons from the assessment include the following: \u2022 It was useful in designing questionnaires to give careful consideration to ensure that language issues and wordings of all questionnaires were consistent and accessible. \u2022 Professional questionnaires \u2013 were self-administered and the sample size was lower than anticipated because", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe4aff6a-fe9a-4617-a047-e6c2957ade18": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe4aff6a-fe9a-4617-a047-e6c2957ade18", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sharing Experience in Access to Justice: Engaging with Non-State Justice Systems & Conducting Assessments", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a1327811df40319ca54cc21a2e0283edefafde448c6127e2228b3f202ac13d05"}, "3": {"node_id": "b7e577c5-6891-466c-b877-39d6ba1163fd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "36a0bb82ed161649a5fa3e61a22d8e539cf9810c6e5fc956fd5ce6d3bbde1e5d"}}, "hash": "3918f92a9993d20bd2639152e19f03ffbac2a325ddf69c220aa13c76b3c2b4cf", "text": "of limited capacity \u2013 there are currently no research institutes in the country. \u2022 The period during which the survey was administered coincided with the end of the transition period as stipulated in the Constitution. As a result, it was a challenging context for conducting the A2J assessment, yet also provided opportunities for transformative results since the survey would provide a baseline for the government to see the picture of the justice situation on the ground. Access to Justice Assessments: Designing the Research Framework \u2013 Mongolia The Access to Justice Needs Assessment conducted in 2005 was based on a very broad terms of reference that examined the capacity needs of duty-bearers and rights-holders. The assessment was conducted by a local consultant and one of the key challenges was in translating the terminology into the Mongolian language and context. The assessment contributed to the programming decision to focus on the establishment of Legal Aid Centres (LAC). The current access to justice project in Mongolia seeks to build on the Legal Aid Centres with the intention to expand the national legal aid system (including legal clinics, paralegals, etc.). Other interventions include: \u2022 Draft Gender Equality Law and activities on gender based violence including a one stop service centre, men\u2019s counselling and behaviour change sessions; \u2022 Draft Victims and Witness Protection Law; \u2022 Promoting rights of people with disabilities; and \u2022 Support to the Universal Period Review. For Mongolia, it is important to explore the linkages between the access to justice work with the legal empowerment of the poor (LEP) work and the work on human rights and the Universal Periodic Review. Some questions raised during the discussions included the following: Is \u201cLegal Empowerment of the Poor\u201d part of \u201cAccess to Justice\u201d, or is \u201cAccess to Justice\u201d part of \u201cLegal Empowerment of the Poor\u201d? Or are they just different approaches to the same problem and can sometimes overlap? Legal Empowerment Perspectives Assessments conducted at the ground level can incorporate a legal empowerment component whereby participants in the assessment are encouraged to use the opportunity to deliberate on justice and to use the results of the assessment to advocate for better service provision. The example of participatory action research conducted by the Open Society Institute in Sudan, where assessments are done also to stimulate action is one such example. Participatory action research can have the effect of being catalytic in terms of mobilizing communities by bringing them together to present the findings of the data and initiating a dialogue on the critical access to justice issues raised by the research. By engaging in dialogue with the community it is possible to ensure that the final product of the research contains both the objectives of the project but also the objectives of the community. Participatory action research approaches have also been used with paralegals in Sierra Leone. It should be remembered that often times in the assessment processes, the best results could be the unanticipated ones. In conclusion, assessments, while useful for UNDP programmes, can also have a larger effect of influencing policies or stimulating change and empowering communities by providing a platform for people voice their opinions. In certain cases, there may be trade-offs involved between methodology and results. Finally, it is critical to ensure ownership of the assessment by national stakeholders, particularly the government. Assessments can have a larger effect of influencing policies or stimulating change and empowering communities by providing \u201ca platform for people voice their opinions \u201d PART\ufeffII:\ufeffCONDUCTING\ufeffACCESS\ufeffTO\ufeffJUSTICE\ufeffASSESSMENTS\ufeff 36 How to make it Happen: Conducting the Assessment Research and Consultation in the Context of Legal Pluralism: the Case of Cambodia and Timor-Leste The assessments in Cambodia and in Timor-Leste was initiated to support ongoing policy reform on justice. In Cambodia, there was a requirement from the Council for Legal and Judicial Reform for a \u2018survey\u2019 for policy development on alternative dispute resolutsion (ADR). In Timor-Leste, support was needed to draft legislation on \u2018traditional justice\u2019. Rationales guiding the assessment were based on prior knowledge of lack of legal awareness and the weaknesses of the formal justice system in Timor Leste.

It is essential to remember that an assessment and consultation process can be a political process \u2013 a means of giving voice to people who may otherwise be marginalized, a means of participating in decisions that will affect their lives. There has to be political ownership (political condition) where there is buy in from the national body in charge and social networks. Allies such as the UN and donors can support this political process and consultation. The assessment also provides an opportunity for systemization through national awareness-raising on the issue. It is expected that the final outcome will be that policy development and drafting of legislation regarding justice reforms will be done drawing on the results of the assessment. The key objectives of the consultations include: \u2022 To collect information from supply and demand sides and on specific human rights issues; \u2022 To inform people about the legal framework and their rights; \u2022 To empower disadvantaged people in order to participate; and \u2022 To create room for discussion around common values and alternative solutions. Societal demand for justice is comprised of social needs related to conflicts, human rights violations and abuses of power. It is important to capture the actual demand for justice (current problems and conflicts filed to authorities) and the potential demand, i.e. problems that people have not filed to any authority due to lack of awareness or lack of institutional availability.

Further development (policy development and legislation drafting); and 8. Consultation. In Timor-Leste, given the weak penetration of the formal justice system, the Government approached UNDP for support in drafting legislation that would recognise non- state justice systems. The UNDP Justice System Programme and the Traditional Justice Sub-working group of UNMIT proposed a process of consultation on access to justice, customary law and local justice in order to elaborate guidelines for policy development and draft legislation. A process of consultation is critical in order ensure that the legislation responds to the reality of the country and the needs and demands of the population. The consultation process included: 1. Field trips and interviews (October 2008); 2. Decentralised workshops; 3. Focus/Group consultation (with women, justice actors, Human rights organizations); and 4. National consultation. The consultations focused on providing people information on their rights. It then sought to identify the main social problems and conflicts (the demand of justice) and the main responses available (the supply). It also gathered perceptions on the responses by the justice system (customary authorities, police, Directorate of lands and property, mediators, courts).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee0f63b7-7b3f-4b89-85b2-c3fa14f4c7b9": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee0f63b7-7b3f-4b89-85b2-c3fa14f4c7b9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sharing Experience in Access to Justice: Engaging with Non-State Justice Systems & Conducting Assessments", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fa834ddec671199d1cd365bce059aef4b3bdccf8b9257baa6d6cf672c515d186"}, "2": {"node_id": "5abb3bd3-e7fa-4852-b092-66b8f363075e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "df2d4c474e1828a7c56000018a2bbb0d4890361ddb1f7fd2961b18fe8f3d8dd9"}}, "hash": "34c6cd2fe31d50758416c68537c9861132afc106e56c82faaf62ea74f6fda1b1", "text": "The consultation also facilitated a discussion on customary law in relation to human rights and encouraged participants to suggest proposals for the recognition of customary law and the establishment of local justice.

Application of simplified proceedings and delivery in local languages Including the perspectives of the poor and disadvantaged in Access to Justice Assessments \u2013 What can country-led governance assessments offer? The Governance Assessment programme is a 5 year programme (2008\u20132012) which includes country, regional and global activities. There is a programme budget of $9.75 million (60% of budget to fund country level activities: LDCs are priority beneficiaries) and is executed by the UNDP Oslo Governance Centre and overseen by a UNDP programme management board and an external advisory committee. Country-led governance assessments are initiated, implemented and sustained by national actors. Key factors are: \u2022 National ownership \u2022 National capacity development \u2022 Alignment to national policy In the Asia Pacific region, support has been provided to Bhutan via the Support the Gross National Happiness Commission in applying the Gross National Happiness Index in the planning exercise; in Indonesia by assisting local authorities to monitor progress in 33 provinces using the nationally developed Indonesian Democracy Index; and in Mongolia through promoting democratic governance and human rights by assisting parliament in gauging progress on Millennium Development Goal 9. The governance assessments seek to incorporate the perspectives of the poor and disadvantaged through the process (who is included in conducting the assessment) and the methodology (gender-sensitive and pro-poor governance indicators). One of the goals of the process is to strengthen accountability. Prerequisites for accountability include: 1. Answerability \u2013 require someone to justify what they are doing 2. Enforceability \u2013 something must be present to enforce the relationship 3. Transparency \u2013 access to information It is important to consider how the assessment can strengthen this at the country level. In terms of access to justice, governance assessments can be seen as a means of oversight. Do you start at the political or technical issues? \u2022 Technical issues can include: \u2013 How big should the sample size be? \u2013 Should we use both de jure and de facto indicators? \u2013 Which normative principles should we select? \u2022 Political questions can include: \u2013 Who are the change agents on the ground? \u2013 What are the formal and informal incentive structures for reform? \u2013 Which actors have self-interest in pushing this agenda? Some issues to keep in mind include: \u2022 Civil society may be overrepresented in urban areas, and dominated by men \u2022 Parliaments may be weak It may be necessary to adapt the research methodology to address these constraints. The indicators identified for governance assessments can be revealing about access to justice issues. The following are examples of indicators that have been used in governance assessments that could usefully inform justice programming in a particular context. Gender-sensitive indicators: \u2022 Disaggregated by sex \u2013 Are men and women equally aware of their rights to seek redress through the justice system? \u2022 Specific to or targeted toward female or male sex \u2013 What legal aid is specifically made available to women?", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3661fafe-7b51-458a-ad1e-a28f84e76fb8": {"__data__": {"id_": "3661fafe-7b51-458a-ad1e-a28f84e76fb8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sharing Experience in Access to Justice: Engaging with Non-State Justice Systems & Conducting Assessments", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6fa2614f1f78fd6a20cf8ddfa199782cd1d1e3bd885e638baf8c8e7e2ab4c2b3"}, "2": {"node_id": "fd40b9b8-1dc7-4253-8d7b-c1eee86acab8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b2d5ea444388bbc7d507f4b8cfbbb2739479ff9f2f6e12beb47f5c8a1f4b80e7"}}, "hash": "6c03666c37c7c6cee5004441ab09cca6b7a634deba798f7b1bef26f317bfef68", "text": "\u2022 \u201cImplicitly gendered\u201d \u2013 No reference to sex, however an issue that is of particular relevance to females or males, i.e. the number of reported domestic violence cases prosecuted in courts Pro-poor Indicators: \u2022 Disaggregated by poverty status \u2013 Ratio of use of legal aid among people of low income compared to people", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6aa3113c-e50b-47eb-ac05-a79998f096e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "6aa3113c-e50b-47eb-ac05-a79998f096e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sharing Experience in Access to Justice: Engaging with Non-State Justice Systems & Conducting Assessments", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0abcb87d21192f24ada9e073600cb141aee9169c57fcac26e439048062b1b1d0"}, "3": {"node_id": "4cc7c8be-228a-46ac-bb03-58a257d42910", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b2cbcc78e6e7776afa2892b67e6f533efa3b2a0a05a605fbc361fe1b92692c5"}}, "hash": "f7058cf359528f77fa9343ce0d530bf1ae597b96d5f686b84ab6f14267f04415", "text": "of medium or high income \u2022 Specific to the poor \u2013 Number of cases brought to trial that are initiated by poor households \u2022 Implicitly pro-poor \u2013 Coverage of local courts in rural areas \u2022 Chosen by the poor \u2013 Availability of free legal aid PART\ufeffII:\ufeffCONDUCTING\ufeffACCESS\ufeffTO\ufeffJUSTICE\ufeffASSESSMENTS\ufeff\ufeff 39 It can be revealing to combine disaggregate indicators to make it more pro-poor and gender-sensitive.

Access to Justice Assessment in Vietnam The 2003 baseline survey entitled \u2018Access to Justice in Vietnam from People\u2019s Perspective\u2019 included 98 questions related to, variously, awareness of legal rights and knowledge of where to claim them; access to legal information and institutions to protect their rights; and confidence and trust in the legal system \u2013 that it will be fair and effective. One thousand direct interviews were carried out in six provinces (urban, rural and mountainous) with the survey results disaggregated by compulsory criteria (occupation, gender and ethnicity) and non-compulsory criteria (income, education and age). In 2010, the survey was conducted again in the same location with the same questionnaire and methodology except for 14 extra questions added relating to changes of interviewee\u2019s perception in the last five years, and additional considerations for vulnerable groups. The methodology of the survey was primarily focused on the quantitative, gathering data on numbers of people with particular opinions. The survey was focused on disadvantageous groups while still surveying \u2018professional\u2019, urban perspectives. \u2022 65% interviewees were from the \u201cworking class\u201d (farmers, workers and those without permanent jobs); and \u2022 35% interviewees are civil servants, businessmen and professionals. This methodology was used for several reasons: \u2022 The same methodology needed to be used to monitor the progress from the 2003 baseline. \u2022 The survey was already lengthy at 98 questions and it was thought that this was sufficient to measure potential changes the way people access justice and their perceptions of the process. \u2022 Perception based assessments are rare in Viet Nam and this method of conducting access to justice assessments was the first of its kind in the country. Advantages of using this methodology include: \u2022 Direct interviews help secure the independence and privacy of the survey while still facilitating open discussions between surveyors and individual interviewees. \u2022 Broad coverage of the questionnaire helps provide comparative assessments of access to justice regarding: different legal institutions, different geographical areas, different social groups, and differences in people\u2019s perception over the years. \u2022 Update surveys help determine a linkage between socio-economic changes and those in access to justice. \u2022 Interviewing \u201cusers\u201d (but not \u201cservice providers\u201d) helps identify differences between the Government\u2019s assessment and people\u2019s perception of operations of individual legal institutions. \u2022 Survey results help identify issues and areas of concern for further exploration in other projects. Although at this stage the results of the assessment have not been used by the government, the media published them and was able to generate the attention of the public on key justice issues. The new public administration index being developed in Vietnam also includes justice components. Access to Justice Assessment, Sri Lanka 2008, UNOPS The access to justice assessment in Sri Lanka was not able to be successfully completed. The challenges of working in a conflict environment, particularly when asking seemingly sensitive questions about justice and human rights, are significant. Primary objectives of the survey in Sri Lanka included: \u2022 To understand which officials / agencies people approach to find remedies for their legal problems; \u2022 Document alternative or more informal structures and systems that individuals invoke to redress their problems; \u2022 To understand people\u2019s perceptions and understanding of the institutions of the formal legal system (i.e. legal aid, courts and mediation boards); \u2022 To identify legal problems commonly faced by people at the local level; \u2022 To identify legal problems commonly faced by the more vulnerable persons in society; and \u2022 Identify particular problems and discriminatory practices that individuals face as they attempt to obtain assistance from institutions within the formal justice system. The assessment included both qualitative and quantitative components.

Strategic sampling was also conducted focusing on families with members in remand, families with members abducted, persons born in India. The assessment was also attentive to multiple identities, for example: widow, IDP, Tamil, who has a son in remand. In terms of the research design, a review was conducted of secondary literature produced by scholars and activists on legal problems faced by minority communities and IDPs in Sri Lanka. Regional experiences were also examined and interview protocols from the experiences in Nepal and Cambodia were also drawn on. Several consultations were held with UNDP staff and inter-agency meetings to discuss the draft questionnaire and to incorporate further information requirements. The refined draft of the questionnaire was presented to Ministry of Constitutional Affairs and Ministry of Legal Affairs for review. The questionnaire was then presented and discussed at four regional inception workshops in order to get feedback and comments from human rights activists, lawyers, government officials were incorporated. The overall sample was done in 22 of 25 Districts (excluding Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu). 3,858 households island wide (2470 completed) were sampled including 68% in the North and East and Estate Sector and 32% elsewhere. Proportional sampling by ethnicity in all 22 districts (9.5% Indian/Estate Tamils, 25% Sinhalese, 26% Muslim, 30% Sri Lankan Tamil, 9.5% \u2018vulnerable\u2019. As much as possible, the sample was split 50% men/women. At least 33% of all of the DS Divisions in every district targeted (based on secondary data on demographics, income levels and poverty, conflict and displacement history). District Level sample sizes included 225 interviews in each district in the North and East and estate sector, 200 interviews in border districts (Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa), and 100\u2013150 in other districts. The sample sizes were based primarily on the 2007 census data on ethnicity (proportional sampling by district) E.g. Ampara (70 Sinhala; 40 Tamils; 95 Muslim; 20 other); Batticaloa (160 Tamils; 50 Muslims; 15 other); Vavuniya (16 Sinhala, 193 Tamil; 16 Muslims) Households were found through \u201cpurposive random\u201d sampling targeting low income to low-middle income areas/households (proxy indicators). Over-sampling took place in the North, East and Estate Sector as the access to justice project wanted a strategic focus on minority groups and on conflict-affected areas, including areas recently-recaptured from the LTTE by Sri Lankan Armed Forces. In terms of implementing the survey, the first step was to translate the questionnaires and train the enumerators (12 enumerators were chosen, both male and female and from all the main ethnic groups). Pre-tests were conducted in three districts over the course of four days and included all the main ethnic groups as well as estate workers. The questionnaire was then modified based on pre-test findings and a second round of training for the enumerators was held on the final questionnaire. Work plans were finalized for the field work and training was done on how to select households for the field interviews. Data Collection was done on Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), which are small hand-held computers.

Judicial reform is a national priority. Access to Justice by Poor and Disadvantaged People was an assessment supported by a partnership between National Judicial Academy (NJA), Department of Justice and UNDP. The objective, among other things, was to get reliable data on disadvantaged people\u2019s access to justice through formal courts, to be used in policy development and corrective action. The assessment was focused on women, children, elderly, disabled persons and tribal people. Research Methods and questions to be addressed were developed through workshops conducted by NJA. The UNDP Pilot Project \u2013 Strengthened Access to Justice in India (SAJI) was established to carry out a justice sector diagnosis, identify entry points and support innovative small pilots to identify good initiatives for replication. Through this project a mapping of the informal and criminal justice systems was conducted. The mapping of the informal justice system was undertaken by the Kurukshetra University, National Centre for Advocacy Studies along with Institute for Para- Legal Studies, and National Law University, Bhopal. The mapping of the criminal justice system was conducted by Multiple Action Research Group, Public Concern for Governance Trust, and Mahila Chetna Manch. Some key findings include: \u2022 Severe lack of legal knowledge; \u2022 Limited access to legal services available; \u2022 Physical access to justice sector institutions, especially formal justice systems (police, prisons, prosecution and courts) is limited due to distance and costs; and \u2022 Vulnerable groups are reluctant to access the formal system (particularly women) as the procedures to access them are too complex and are not comprehensible for those who are illiterate. The assessment focussed on both the supply and demand side and worked at the local level. It sought to build on and strengthen partnerships with state actors and civil society for improved access to justice. The assessments reviewed the mandate of the justice institutions/stakeholders vis- \u00e0-vis the marginalized people and tried to bring out the gaps and needs so that the project can better target capacity development interventions. In terms of scope, the assessment reviewed: \u2022 State Legal Services Authorities; \u2022 State Judicial Academies; \u2022 Marginalized People; \u2022 Civil Society Organisations and other Intermediaries; \u2022 Existing legal awareness and empowerment material; and \u2022 Laws, policies and institutional structures informed through action research and studies. In terms of methodology, secondary literature survey, surveys, interviews, FGDs (formal and semi-formal), case studies, review meetings and experience sharing workshops were used. The survey was meant to be a baseline survey targeting people belonging to the marginalized sections of the society, CSOs and other intermediaries, Duty bearers. National and state level consultations to assess priorities of the stakeholders were The Access to Justice Practitioner\u2019s Guide can be useful in setting some of the parameters for developing an access to justice assessment.

The assessment can have an impact on many levels. By involving the justice institutions in the assessment and trying to capture their perspective, there is an increased ownership over the results of the assessment. Interventions such as capacity development strategies suggested to the Legal Services Authorities or training for judges through State Judicial Academies on laws and issues relating to marginalized people are more likely to be adopted. The assessment also helps identify innovative and replicable projects on legal aid, empowerment and awareness. It also helps to bring to the notice of the government, lacunae within legislations and legal provisions which are adversely affecting the rights and entitlements of the vulnerable sections.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "85aa9d78-2b34-43c0-ae08-1568f879f7ba": {"__data__": {"id_": "85aa9d78-2b34-43c0-ae08-1568f879f7ba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sharing Experience in Access to Justice: Engaging with Non-State Justice Systems & Conducting Assessments", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f285e8666dfdb5ecf1bc04d8343bfbddc47b67070f9a5d047be62795e13ccd4f"}, "2": {"node_id": "4dff741c-0a95-421d-b294-fa5a7e9a8f00", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3ffe00512a8caa6dac50702b9f2544ca87e49ec20714eb6a476963f0a7657b0e"}}, "hash": "83a229445f792b8d38db8673eb215cc8bb02db3856a1dba320ec8f470b5bc074", "text": "Bringing together different stakeholders \u2013 judiciary, government departments and civil society \u2013 on the complex issues of access to justice is a challenging task.

A key lesson from the assessment includes the need to focus in a much sharper way on the mechanisms and processes of exclusion operating at all stages within the justice system from filing of complaints and recording of statements to investigation, court proceedings, delivery of judgements and implementation of court orders. Documenting these processes can be a first step to advocacy for understanding and sensitisation of personnel at all levels of the justice system. It is very important to learn from the experiences of the Global South and to document and share information on processes so that we can learn from each other (e.g. process of engagement with national institutions of justice that are not open to review). Identifying Recommendations and Guidelines on Developing Access to Justice Assessments Some Considerations for future assessments 1. Guidelines and scope of assessment \u2022 Start with realistic objectives that are commensurate with resources; \u2022 Think through and remind oneself of the reasons and the target beneficiary (i.e. why and for whom the assessment is being done); \u2022 Be sensitive to the internal political context Discussions were held in three working groups which sought to identify some general guidelines and recommendations on designing and conducting access to justice assessments. Scope of assessments Who conducts assessments Conducting assessments What do we explore? What does the HRBA offer to conduct assessments? Whose access to justice? Selecting groups to serve Aims of assessments \u2013 programs, projects, policy formulation and reform, to ensure State accountability Different types of designs for different aims and objectives Layers of partnerships Government Involvement \u2013 too little? Too much External Consultants Local and external teams together Involving the community-community researchers, paralegals (issues of neutrality, limitations on probing, investment of time and money) Time needed for assessment Constraints and gaps in capturing realities Qualitative and quantitative methods Different tools Taking findings back to sites for validations Selecting categories of people to ensure inclusion Participatory approach PART\ufeffII:\ufeffCONDUCTING\ufeffACCESS\ufeffTO\ufeffJUSTICE\ufeffASSESSMENTS\ufeff\ufeff 43 \u2022 Choose and clarify objectives based on people\u2019s priorities as identified by NGOs, government or public survey and feasibility upon given time-frame; and \u2022 Recognise that assessments can be incredibly important as an indication that the project responds to the community needs rather than donor priorities. In many cases people consider it wrong that projects are developed according to availability of funds determined by donors. 2. Maximize partnership with government to minimize consequences, while considering: \u2022 Country\u2019s specific context; \u2022 Governments endorsement as a way to ensure use of data; \u2022 Identification of a partner/champion in the government that can implement results; and \u2022 Participatory approach as key principle: building local capacities while doing the assessment. 3. Use of methodology to capture realities by following a general rule \u2013 involve local people \u2022 Ensure a good translator for a successful involvement of the community in the assessment process; and \u2022 Engage additional actors in the assessment who can assist with more effective dissemination of assessment results, such as journalists and documentary filmmakers. 4. Focus on the quality rather than the quantity of the research sample 5. Avoid making generalisations and ensure that the assessment is developed and designed based on local realities \u2022 Avoid using the term toolkit in developing a guide to access to justice assessments. The attempt to capture a set of best practices can obscure specificities. It will also be difficult to develop a universal approach and guideline. \u2022 Instead, review assessments in the region with specific case studies of various assessments. The case studies can provide a rich and contextual discussion of key issues such as how to define objectives, ensure ownership, develop appropriate targets, tailor to the local context, analyse pros and cons of particular approaches, and engage in partnership building. 6. Use creative and innovative tools and channels \u2022 For example, the use of PDAs for data collection, or Oral Wiki to access information. It would be useful to identify innovative tools and feature them for future assessments. \u2022 Media can be strong partners in sharing the results of the assessment. In some cases partnership with the media may be frowned upon by the government, while in others, sharing information on the results of the assessment with the media may be a means of encouraging public pressure on critical issues \u2022 Storytelling and conversational approach to talking about experiences when interviewing people and feeding them into the findings can be useful than going through a survey.

Developing Partnerships Strategic Partnership Considerations in Access to Justice Assessment: The Asia Foundation\u2019s Experience The Asia Foundation is committed to supporting access to justice assessments as they are seen as a strategic program planning tools. The Asia Foundation often uses a combination of qualitative and quantitative methodologies and emphasizes robust empirical research \u2013 with a particular focus on refining understanding of the connection between access to justice, governance reform, poverty reduction: legal empowerment. A critical element of the assessments is also local capacity development. It is also important to not just think about how an assessment is conducted but also to place findings and recommendations in the public domain Discussions in this session were informed by presentations by the following: Nicholas Booth, UNDP Vietnam.

Case studies were conducted by carrying out interviews with more than 200 respondents and 13 Focus Group Discussions engaging more or less 150 participants comprising of: community members, law enforcers, corruption suspects and their legal advisors, promoting actors and mass media. The data collection was conducted through the following methods: a) review on related documents such as media coverage, NGO documentation and legal documents; b) in-depth interview and Focus Group Discussion. Partners for the study included \u2018Local Players\u2019 (NGOs, local anti-corruption coalition) in terms of designing, field work, analytical step, dissemination and the Attorney General Office for the data analysis and dissemination. Study on Non-State Justice Systems \u2013 The 2004\u20132008 Study on Non-State Justice systems aimed to document the working of non-state justice at the village level, with a particular focus on social inclusion and the perspective of the marginalized to understand the dynamics of change and how to translate them into a framework that embraces the strengths and addresses some of the shortcomings of non-state justice mechanism. It drew on 34 ethnographic case studies collected from 5 provinces over an 18 months period and survey data from Governance and Decentralization Survey. In addition, the data sources included comparative studies to research informal justice in Bangladesh and the Philippines. Data collected from the research locations by the J4P team in cooperation with researchers from local NGOs and universities. In total, 452 people were interviewed and 343 attended verification workshops across the five provinces. There were 2 key partners for this research: Supreme Court and Local NGO/Universities. The Supreme Court participated in almost all stages of the research including field works and analytical works. The partnership with local NGOs/Universities was developed mainly during the field work and dissemination. Partnerships matter because they: \u2022 Maximize the impact \u2013 the aim of developing partnership for the research with government and civil society organization is to have a better access of influencing the policy; \u2022 Create a network in carried out the recommendation and follow up action; \u2022 Increase research capacity of local actors; and \u2022 Ensure the do-able recommendation and follow up action. The local government corruption study was successful in impacting at the national level and contributed to the development of i) Anti-corruption strategy for National Community Empowerment Program (2007); ii) \u2018Zero tolerance for corruption\u2019 (2010); iii) National Strategy of Access to Justice (2009); iv) Government program of Mediation and Community Legal Empowerment (2008) in disadvantaged and conflict areas. However, the impact at the local level was insignificant. The Non-State Justice System study contributed to the development of joint programs of Non-State Justice Systems in 5 provinces and the National Strategy of Access to Justice (2009). At the local level, Non-State Justice Systems working groups were established in 5 provinces. There are several reasons to engage with others stakeholders in conducting an access to justice research. The reasons will provide guidance the \u2018how\u2019 and \u2018when\u2019 questions in developing partnerships.

Involving a wide range of partners also help make sure the sustainability or resources to carried out the findings/ recommendation forward. Methodological reasons for developing partnerships include to develop a new methodology/analytical framework.

It is difficult to derive at a uniform system of data analysis and distilling of specific findings and conclusions from the vast amount of information gathered. There were several different tools used in some of the assessments including conflict analysis, institutional analysis, service analysis, dispute resolution analysis, perception analysis, needs analysis. In analysis of data and information, the value of assessments is in the linking of such analysis to the rationale and background of each assessment, thereby providing direct links to questions, issues, challenges and obstacles identified in the background of and rationale for each individual assessment.

Lessons from Implementing the Access to Justice Assessment in Sri Lanka \u2013 Data Collection and Findings The implementation challenges facing the access to justice assessment in Sri Lanka need to be contextualized. It was conducted in an ethnically-charged civil war environment with a militarized government regime. Given the environment there was a high degree of suspicion and caution about strangers and the safety of the assessment team, particularly the Tamil enumerators, needed to be considered. In some cases, the assessment raised expectations from the UN and in others there was a complete ignorance of the UN. The complexity and length of the questionnaire as well as the complex sampling also posed significant challenges and the absence of reliable census data/secondary data during research design didn\u2019t make the process easier. Survey fatigue where the people may have undergone sampling in other surveys was also a challenge that needed to be dealt with. Access to justice must be considered relationally \u2013 in terms of one\u2019s physical location (e.g. living in the capital Colombo versus the conflict-affected district), gender, social status (e.g. married versus being widowed or being displaced by the conflict), political party affiliation, ethnicity, and income. All of these factors can influence the extent to which a citizen can obtain the assistance that s/he is due from the country\u2019s formal justice institutions. Discussions in this session were informed by presentations by the following: Maria Bermudez, UNDP Timor Leste. Moderator. Ramani Jayasundere, UNDP APRC Access to Justice Assessments Consultant.

From Crisis to Crisis Governance and Rule of Law Assessments, Pakistan Lack of clear rational at the beginning of the assessment can result in some conclusions and recommendations that are more \u2018generic\u2019. This can also be due to insufficiently formulated background or weakness in the analytical framework in \u201cthe design or the analysis of the findings. \u201d PART\ufeffII:\ufeffCONDUCTING\ufeffACCESS\ufeffTO\ufeffJUSTICE\ufeffASSESSMENTS\ufeff 50 Notions and understandings of what is just and who defines what is just is a sensitive issue in a politicised environment, therefore, the research method and methodology must allow people to speak about their experiences in a safe environment and with confidence that their testimonies will be kept confidential. Additional factors that affected the findings of the assessment were the use of the \u2018do not wish to answer\u2019 option and confusion over what is the law and what was thought ought to be the law. Given the conflict context, fear also played a large role on what and how much people were willing to say. They were often afraid to state negative aspects of people in power, e.g. the police, which raises questions on the reliability of some of the responses. The use of purposive sampling (forgoing the ability to be random, in the pursuit of analytical depth and logistical considerations) may have influenced the outcome and findings of the study significantly. For example, there is an artificial increase of certain numbers of people of a particular ethnicity within DS divisions for analytical and logistical reasons. It should also be noted that while the study was conducted at a household-level, they were essentially the views of the particularly person spoken to within the household, therefore it may have differed from others in the family. Regarding the data collected, it was disaggregated by sex, ethnicity, DS Division, status such as an internally displaced person (IDP), returnee, estate workers, landowners, and education level of respondent. Cross tabulations were done where necessary or seemingly interesting to establish correlations.

However, there were still several challenges in analyzing the data and identifying findings. For example, while open-ended questions can be useful, it becomes challenging to codify them. Also, the quantitative data needs to be interpreted in light of the qualitative data and vice-versa in order to have a holistic understanding of the situation. In addition, age and language may have influenced the findings: 1) Since Bahasa Indonesia was not the first language for most of the respondents (only for 22% of the respondents), misunderstandings could have been made in data collection; 2) As young people under the age of 16 were excluded from the sample, their views were not captured in the assessment. In terms of verification of qualitative data, it is important to conduct monitoring visits throughout the field research. For this assessment, verification missions were conducted to randomly selected villages in each province upon completion of research, provincial seminars with key stakeholders and a peer review was completed. It is quite a challenge to structure the analysis when there is over 2000 pages of qualitative data from provincial reports, plus survey data. There is always a tension between depth and breadth, and the need for follow- up research. Also, it is a challenge to figure out how to disaggregate the survey data \u2013 By province, by district, by gender, but not by \u2018disadvantaged\u2019 or \u2018non-disadvantaged\u2019. There is also the difficulty of assessing real capacity gaps of formal justice actors (e.g. courts, police). A key question is \u2013 if the final report can\u2019t effectively make use of all of the data, how can it safely be made available to others? Finally, in crafting realistic recommendations it is important get input from the field and the provincial teams while dealing with resource shortages. At the end, are recommendations really that important or is the data the most important part.

\u2022 2010 Malakand Rule of Law (baseline) \u2013 Stabilization of a Crisis Zone; \u2022 2009\u201310 Government PCNA \u2013 Larger Recovery and Stability; and \u2022 2010 Government Post Floods Damage Needs and Recovery of the Marginalised Poor. The 2009 Government\u2019s Conflict Early Recovery Initial Needs Assessment (CERINA) \u2013 Rehabilitation of Conflict- Affected IDPs used several means for data collection including: \u2022 Data collected data from primary sources through a survey of 500 households; \u2022 Qualitative data gathered through interviews and several FGDs in IDP camps; \u2022 key informant interviews; and \u2022 Secondary data. The 2010 Stabilization of a Crisis Zone baseline study focused on Assessing Rule of Law, Peace and Security in Malakand, NWFP. The study examined the state of the infrastructure, level of training of justice sector staff, quality of judicial decisions, quality of evidence collected by the Police, timelines to gather and analyse evidence, capacity analysis of personnel (including gender related data), citizen-law enforcement relations, state of the jirga system, and the state of legal services available. The study identified a significant public trust deficit where \u2013 90% paid bribes; in legal procedures involving judicial authorities, 78% paid bribes; in land administration 92%. It also found only 24% percent of respondents said that they \u201cCompletely agree\u201d or \u201cAgree\u201d; whereas 55% stated that they \u201cMostly disagree\u201d or \u201cCompletely disagree\u201d to the statement \u201cCivil servants take into consideration the opinion of people like me when deciding.\u201d Another finding was that there is popular support in pockets of Malakand division for the Taliban since they promise quick justice. The baseline study helped in identifying critical priority areas for Rule of Law support such as: \u2022 Capacity of courts to provide effective and timely justice services; \u2022 Access to justice, legal aid and representation; \u2022 Public safety and security; \u2022 Formal \u2013 Informal justice debate; \u2022 Policy shifts required; and \u2022 Non-court grievance redress \u2013 Legal aid. The 2009\u201310 Government Post-Conflict Needs Assess- ment comprised of four phases: (a) Pre-Assessment, (b) Assessment, (c) Finalisation and (d) Validation. The Pre-Assessment Phase focused on capturing the voices of affected communities through consultations that a) sought the opinions of a wide range of interlocutors affected by the crisis on the reasons that it developed and on the potential solutions for resolving it; and b) sought wider views across civil society and the Pakistani Administration on the drivers and solutions of the crisis. The Strategic Objectives of the PCNA were to: \u2022 Enhance responsiveness and effectiveness of the State to restore citizen trust; \u2022 Stimulate Employment and Livelihood Opportunities; \u2022 Ensure Provision of Basic Services; and \u2022 Foster Reconciliation and Counter Extremism. The process ensured that mixed sector teams that included government and multilateral agency were mobilised to undertake assessments in nine sectors (including governance and security). These teams assessed the main issues that drive crisis within each sector, and identified peace building measures In finalizing the assessment, findings were shared with the affected population, opinion-making stakeholders, Jirga members and parliamentarians to validate the findings. This study faced many challenges since many areas were still in active crisis. It was also important to keep in mind that the PCNA is a peace building strategy, not International development agencies often conduct assessments for their own programming. Ownership, being cyclical and fluid, depends on the individuals and those in power and that\u2019s why the principle for the national and \u201csub-national ownership as gateway is valid. \u201d PART\ufeffII:\ufeffCONDUCTING\ufeffACCESS\ufeffTO\ufeffJUSTICE\ufeffASSESSMENTS\ufeff\ufeff 53 as a development plan.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "435d3e23-1182-42f8-a389-6884a9366c31": {"__data__": {"id_": "435d3e23-1182-42f8-a389-6884a9366c31", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sharing Experience in Access to Justice: Engaging with Non-State Justice Systems & Conducting Assessments", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "66fd7d421ed20ae37e81450ca4df87af365ca3b27940ee23307a0261bf864288"}, "2": {"node_id": "42a7c515-7ed2-4649-91d9-86b4e157851e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bb44f194e2c448677614ea5471a3d68dfcf428526eff4f35d0e17500dd9f7826"}}, "hash": "8e6b8fb588de1932a45e5a052088d074dac19865abf7267b19e6d710397c143f", "text": "Peace building is transformative and the ability of the government and communities to engage in behaviour change is a significant challenge.

The assessment adopted a citizen focus looking at issues such as land rights (e.g. of tenants and sharecroppers), dispute resolution, identity and legal rights, voices of the marginalised (e.g. communities living in riverbeds). It also sought to examine citizen-state engagement looking at issues around formal dispute resolution, grievance redress, transparency in reconstruction, law enforcement, and public safety. Based on the assessment, a recovery framework was developed which included: 1. Building sub-national capacities; 2. Ensuring that public safety; 3. Securing citizen entitlements and rights; and 4. Enhancing transparency & community oversight. From all these assessments, some critical lessons can be drawn. First, it is crucial to have national and sub-national ownership of the assessment not only in conducting the assessment but also take forward the findings and recommendations. Timeliness is another issue, including unrealistic deadlines for conducting assessments which may compromise on the quality. When conducting assessments, particularly in difficult and complex situations such as conflict, it is important to have a flexible approach and tools as well as inventive methodologies. It is essential to link the assessment to policy in order to ensure that policies are developed based on the realities and findings from the assessments. Finally, one of the biggest challenges is donor coordination \u2013 which is very necessary in conducting assessments and developing policies. How can it make a difference: Advocacy and Impact on Policy and Programming Exclusive government ownership could weaken power of local customary authority. Ownership depends on the change that is aimed for as the objective of the assessment. If the goal is to have the government or any other stakeholder committed to a certain \u201cobjective, then they have to be on aboard. \u201d Discussions in this session were informed by presentations by the following: R.

This assessment was born out of the increasing recognition that access to justice was a necessary condition for peace and development, especially in poor and post-conflict settings, and was specifically aimed to inform the design of future projects on access to justice to be implemented by UNDP-BAPPENAS. The assessment consisted of over 700 interviews, 200 focus group discussions (FGDs) and surveys of nearly 5,000 vulnerable and marginalized persons. It included an examination of the difficulties they experienced in accessing justice; a review of the justice-oriented services available to them; and their justice-related priorities. The Assessment Report identified a list of priority justice issues (e.g. access to government services and assistance; ownership and management of land and natural resources; gender violence and discrimination, etc.), the challenges impeding access to justice in the context of these issues, as well as recommended methodologies to address them. Out of the findings of this assessment, the Legal Empowerment and Assistance for the Disadvantaged (LEAD) Project (2007\u201311) was launched by UNDP- BAPPENAS, with the overall aim to increase access to justice, especially with regard to the most vulnerable and marginalized groups, through the combination of a civil society grant-making system and policy advocacy. Findings of the assessment informed the objectives, priorities, strategies and architecture of the LEAD Project, and also shaped its four thematic sectors: (1) Land and Natural Resources, (2) Justice and Gender, (3) Local Governance (e.g. minimum service standards for health and education), and (4) Legal Aid Services. Due to limited availability of funding, the project was implemented in three of the five assessment provinces, namely North Maluku, Central Sulawesi and Southeast Sulawesi. Having the extensive assessment underlying the LEAD Project design assisted in the promotion of and resource mobilization for the LEAD project from the donors, UNDP, as well as the government and the civil society. Based on the assessment finding that community legal awareness remained low in target areas, the LEAD Project at the grassroots level was designed to raise legal/human rights awareness and empower people/communities to demand their rights realization from responsible authorities. Furthermore, in line with the recommendation of the assessment to provide community-based legal aid and other legal services through the civil society, the Project funded and strengthened civil society organizations (CSOs) and community paralegals so that the vulnerable and marginalized would be able to obtain legal assistance when they needed it. The LEAD Project also supported the provision of pro-bono legal services. At the macro level, the LEAD Project supported national and subnational justice sector reform efforts dedicated to improving access to justice, in line with the assessment\u2019s recommendation. With this design, the LEAD Project has successfully increased access to justice in Indonesia over the past four years. At the local level, LEAD\u2019s interventions, particularly through grant-making to CSOs, have made it possible to mobilize community-based paralegals to assist the poor; increase the legal awareness and legal capacity of marginalized and disadvantaged communities; improve local government services through the development of minimum service standards; enhance the system of Integrated Services for Women and Children; and establish joint complaint handling mechanisms for land and natural resource disputes and grievances. At the national level, the LEAD Project provided policy advice and technical support to the Government of Indonesia in the participatory development of the National Strategy on Access to Justice, which involved consultations with over 600 stakeholders from all 33 provinces.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a1f96774-73e6-4b32-b907-2d599a3b4a30": {"__data__": {"id_": "a1f96774-73e6-4b32-b907-2d599a3b4a30", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sharing Experience in Access to Justice: Engaging with Non-State Justice Systems & Conducting Assessments", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "746060ba445883061d1c9da9c3883fdef22a7110d1a029aecced9ffc2b237aaf"}, "2": {"node_id": "4bfef79a-514f-4240-9772-670864e98e1d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "965d824eb6e497a7861e6b6423ff2228d0d9315a8af0c1d2c0d945220578f4e9"}}, "hash": "b893d88160dfb08ad5937eb3cbf409676dc95b76ddaa3a2835e050d6b69b0871", "text": "The Strategy was launched in 2009, and has been integrated into the National Mid-Term Development Plan for 2010\u2013 2014 as well as Presidential Instruction No. 3/2010 on Equitable Development.

With this development of the National Strategy, many Access to justice assessments require considerable resources in terms of time, money, and human resources.

As a result, \u201caccess to justice\u201d became a mainstreamed language and became the subject of large-scale development cooperation as well in the spirit of national ownership and support to national priorities and policies. Access to Justice Assessment in Aceh (2006\u20137) The people of Aceh suffered a 30-year-long conflict and the 2004 tsunami, which together killed more than 200,000 people and devastated the lives of another million. In response, UNDP Indonesia with BAPPENAS conducted a comprehensive Access to Justice Assessment in Aceh between 2006 and 2007 and found a range of challenges that constrained the ability of formal and informal justice providers to handle grievances effectively. According to the assessment, a majority of Acehnese preferred the informal justice mechanisms available in their communities over the formal justice system to resolve their disputes. At the same time, the informal justice system had various challenges, such as lack of knowledge and capacity of the informal justice leaders, absence of guidelines and common standards, discrimination against women and other vulnerable groups, ambiguity in jurisdictional divisions with the formal system, and insufficient accountability safeguards. Therefore, the assessment recommended engaging with the informal justice system in Aceh to improve the quality of justice delivered to people in the communities. Based on these findings, UNDP Indonesia implemented the \u201cAdat (customary or informal) Justice Enhancement Component\u201d as part of the Aceh Justice Project (2007\u201311) in partnership with the Aceh Customary Council (MAA). The project developed and distributed the Informal Justice Guidelines, and trained thousands of informal justice practitioners (including some 500 female leaders) on these guidelines and case management. The Guidelines and trainings have clarified the jurisdiction, processes, and actors of the informal justice system while fostering respect for human rights principles in culturally sensitive ways. For UNDP and BAPPENAS, working to improve the informal justice systems is not intended to diminish the importance of the formal justice systems. Rather, it has been carried out based on recognition \u2013 as confirmed by the assessment \u2013 that most people in Aceh preferred and used this system, and thus we could not increase access to justice in the target areas without improving the informal justice system. Indeed, the Access to Justice Assessment in Aceh played a critical role in developing an innovative and successful programme on informal justice in Aceh that was supported by strong ownership from the local institutions and communities. Conclusion and Recommendations Access to justice assessments require considerable resources in terms of time, money, and human resources. However, in the Indonesia experience, these assessments are worth the costs and can make lasting contributions when supported by the host government and directly linked to the programme/project development. It has been almost 7 years since the initial assessment, and impressive, country-wide progress with regards to access to justice has been made. There is now a National Strategy on Access to Justice and many other similar programmes sponsored not only by UNDP but other development agencies. Based on the experiences, best practices, and lessons learned from the LEAD Project and the Aceh Justice Project, UNDP and BAPPENAS are currently preparing to launch a new umbrella project on access to justice under the name of Strengthening Access to Justice in Indonesia (SAJI). During the development of this new project, the final reports of the two initial access to justice assessments were revisited, and new staff in the UNDP offices continue to refer to these initial studies for contextual understanding of the situation in Indonesia. The findings from these assessments continue to contribute to UNDP\u2019s knowledge sharing and project development. At the same time, it is regrettable that the incredible amount of qualitative data and real life stories that emerged during the research processes were merely reduced to a paper-form final report which faced the inevitable constraints of editing and simplification.

This transition period poses challenges for all branches of the government. The Access to Justice Assessment in Maldives is expected to: \u2022 Provide baseline information on public confidence in the justice system; \u2022 Provide insights into citizen\u2019s awareness of the justice system and to access to justice; \u2022 Identify the knowledge base of duty bearers; \u2022 Identify the challenges and obstacles faced by duty bearers; \u2022 Provide information related to legal and rights awareness to survey communities; \u2022 Serve as an avenue for policy discussions, sensitization and recommendations for informing policy, access to justice and justice sector reform. Preliminary results of the assessment will be available shortly. In the meantime, experiences in conducting the survey have shown that there is a need for: \u2022 Increased understanding and involvement of government actors in the assessment; \u2022 Awareness-raising programme for the public; \u2022 Capacity development of institutions to design appropriate modalities of service provision for rights- holders; to pay a greater attention to women\u2019s issues; and to establish new programmes such as legal aid; \u2022 Training of duty-bearers; and \u2022 Increased coordination among various institutions involved in the assessment. Furthermore, the experiences thus far in the Maldives shows that future planning and implementation of an access to justice assessment should not comprise the principles of equality and non-discrimination and should further incorporate experiences of people from various socio-economic backgrounds and seek greater public outreach as well as better coordination and cooperation among the actors. The experience from the assessment demonstrates the importance of government\u2019s role in enhancing access to justice and points to the need for greater government involvement in the access to justice assessment, so that the programme that results from the assessment can go beyond UNDP and donor organizations, and be mainstreamed into a national plan of action. Access to Justice Assessments and the Reality of Programming in Cambodia After the access to justice assessment in Cambodia, the initial access to justice programme was supposed to involve: 1. Human rights database development; 2. Support to Official Gazette; 3. Publication of Judicial Decisions; and 4. Promoting alternative dispute resolution. Initial implementation design was as shown on the top of the next page. However, due to various challenges including the lack of ownership and commitment from the government, the programme ended up being able to undertake only the last component, namely \u201cpromoting alternative dispute resolution.\u201d As a result, programme for the period of 2007 to 2010 had to be re-formulated to implement the following activities: \u2022 Establishment and capacity development of \u201cCommune Dispute Resolution Committees\u201d; \u2022 Establishment of legal resources centres; \u2022 Legal aid and representation, with a focus on women and indigenous people; \u2022 Village discussions on domestic violence issues; \u2022 Advocacy for the recognition of indigenous people\u2019s rights and customary law; and \u2022 Convening of \u201cPeace Table Forums\u201d, which is a dialogue between traditional leaders and local government authorities on matters of community access to justice With this new design, the programme implementation structure also had to be revised as shown opposite. The project made good results on the ground for the beneficiaries. Nonetheless, it suffered from various challenges such as government ownership, conflicting interests of implementing partners, high staff turnover, power dynamics among stakeholders, differences between the objectives of the government and those of development partner, as well as sustainability of results. It shows that while access to justice assessments can provide a good basis of programming, the realities of programming and implementation are inevitably influenced by the local dynamics. The experience from the assessment demonstrates the importance of national partners to be involved in the assessment so that results from the assessment can go beyond UNDP and donor organizations, and be \u201cmainstreamed into a national plan of action.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ca1393c-b6ca-4661-aa8e-3c7bfea72f91": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ca1393c-b6ca-4661-aa8e-3c7bfea72f91", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sharing Experience in Access to Justice: Engaging with Non-State Justice Systems & Conducting Assessments", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1aa5ac2eaf471da33b91d6ed32bb859ee493578e13817fdd1dafbe0073e9547e"}, "2": {"node_id": "361e9ea1-4e4b-493d-bd8f-a4304b5c2f64", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d16cd43a15a3ba9abfb9ba9d01dbff1de2b65437c1ebe8ba44704f831f4e5fec"}}, "hash": "d3062b756ef79b16e3362147b41b06d61881ebf78b4586f33982dfb1096f6883", "text": "\u201d PART\ufeffII:\ufeffCONDUCTING\ufeffACCESS\ufeffTO\ufeffJUSTICE\ufeffASSESSMENTS\ufeff\ufeff 57 Project Executive Group PCB/CLJR, UNDP, Supreme Court, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Interior, Reps of CLJR, NALDR, CAR, OG and PMU National Project Director PMU Project Group Manager Rights Awareness", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1e91cd12-dee1-4e10-aa09-36e60604fe0b": {"__data__": {"id_": "1e91cd12-dee1-4e10-aa09-36e60604fe0b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sharing Experience in Access to Justice: Engaging with Non-State Justice Systems & Conducting Assessments", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8e78927eb061ec0ffc5a4cddd57508e4a6d20f8ba193972798a73336f0794515"}, "3": {"node_id": "dda15d24-e86d-4d6b-ae2b-d3a1b0842d93", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "614ac0d79f68eb6e203faa0d4467b26fac66a0ce64e9a59bd1c55b05aab57a86"}}, "hash": "2433601dca65be3f405e508ea340f4f4ba3646e901813cd624f6ca302e8dd0c9", "text": "PMU Project Group Manager ADR Ministries of Justice and Interior Project Group Manager Judicial Decisions Supreme Court Project Group Manager Official Gazette Council of Ministers Project Group Assistant PMU Project Group Assistant Council of Ministers Project Group Assistant Supreme Court Project Group Assistant Minister of Justice Project Manager UNDP Program Assistant UNDP Project Assurance UNDP Project Executive Group ADR Project Board Chair: H.E.

It uses the law and legal resources to protect and assert rights and undertakes advocacy for policy reforms. ALG members\u2019 operations cover a wide area of concerns involving justice issues of the marginalized sectors of the Filipino society, including: \u2022 Women; \u2022 Workers (domestic and migrant); \u2022 Farmers; \u2022 Fishermen; \u2022 Children; \u2022 Urban Poor (informal settlers); \u2022 Indigenous Peoples; \u2022 Muslim communities; \u2022 Persons Living with HIV/AIDS; and \u2022 Persons with Disabilities. For these target groups, the ALG members undertake various activities such as: \u2022 Legal education &paralegal development; \u2022 Advocacy for policy reform; \u2022 Direct legal services and test case litigation; and \u2022 Research and publications. The Access to Justice Assessment in the Philippines (2007\u20132008) was undertaken as part of the Justice Reform Initiatives Support Project (2003\u20132008) in partnership between the ALG and the Philippine Supreme Court. With funding support provided by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) through the National Judicial Institute (NJI) of Canada, the study was conducted by the Social Weather Stations (SWS), which is Philippine\u2019s leading research institute on subjects of quality of life, public opinion, and governance. Findings of the access to justice assessment in the Philippines were presented to various forums including: \u2022 JURIS Research and Technical Studies Committee; \u2022 ALG General Assembly; \u2022 JURIS Project Steering Committee, chaired by the Chief Justice; and \u2022 Donors\u2019 Forum on the Impact of Social Justice and Human Rights Legal Programs on Poverty Alleviation, Good Governance and other Development Goals. The study was also published and widely disseminated in hard copies, CD format, as well as through the ALG website. The access to justice study showed capacity gaps, rather than just problems and needs, and confirmed the value of legal education programs and litigation support to strategic cases for the poor and the marginalized. As such, the access to justice study has contributed to ALG\u2019s endeavors on a number of issues, such as: 1) Identification of justice problems, not only in terms of court systems and judicial processes, but also real cost issues and lack of capacities of the poor; 2) Legal empowerment and paralegal development activities; and 3) Capacity development for access to justice. Furthermore, the access to justice study contributed to ALG\u2019s programming in the upcoming years. For example, ALG now manages the Environmental Defense Program (EnDefense), which provides funding support to community-led litigation activities for the protection of the environment. Overall, the assessment has contributed not only to the work of ALG in the Philippines but also to similar organisations working on the access to justice issues in other parts of the world as well.

Break into working groups: In each working group identify a facilitator and a rapporteur. Based on the sessions today identify recommendations and lessons that should be included as part of the guidelines and tools being developed for access to justice assessments for designing and conducting assessments. Some Considerations: 1. What does it mean to take a Human Rights-Based Approach to Access to Justice Assessments? 2. How can we use the HRBA principles of participation and inclusion, equality and non-discrimination, accountability in designing and implementing the A2J assessments? 3. How do we ensure that the A2J assessment captures the challenges facing the poor and disadvantaged in accessing justice \u2013 women, children, minority groups, and other marginalized populations? 4. What are some of the critical elements to consider in designing the assessment and developing the methodology \u2013 e.g. user voices and perceptions rather than an institutional approach? 5. What are critical factors to keep in mind when implementing the questionnaires/focus group discussions i.e. research team, target groups, language, etc.? 6. Which institutions need to be involved in A2J assessments? Are local capacities being built through the assessment? 17:15\u201317:30 End of Day 1 Day 2: Friday, 8 October 2010 8:30\u20139:00 Registration Session IV: Working Group I 9:00\u201310:15 Session Objective: To identify recommendations on developing guidelines for access to justice assessments.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b832ac70-a954-4897-85ec-d47a0782e056": {"__data__": {"id_": "b832ac70-a954-4897-85ec-d47a0782e056", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sharing Experience in Access to Justice: Engaging with Non-State Justice Systems & Conducting Assessments", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "807e9b34f115dbda8b52b003b3ed6146d0dc4ab8fd6c74d1a0c651c868ff8543"}, "2": {"node_id": "5f99475c-abe3-4526-bb75-beca788206de", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sharing-experience-access-justice-engaging-non-state-justice-systems-conducting-assessments", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c7525187cf63cfcd65393e9009007dd3ee580e9d347a34fa0d1150396b4240f3"}}, "hash": "790e533747d0ea0549dfe7656fbc176721977f0499d0bd8f3f949d8fc813bff8", "text": "Break into 3 working groups: In each working group identify a facilitator and a rapporteur.

In the documentation of experiences and programmes1 that incorporated HRBAs in several Asia-Pacific countries between the years 2004-2005, it was found that various forms of social audits have been successfully employed to enlist duty bearer accountability and in claiming entitlements. In diverse situations relating to the State\u2019s obligations in regard to policy planning/implementation, service providers\u2019 responsibilities in relation to delivery of services, or in securing meso (middle)-level duty bearers\u2019 accountability towards their stakeholders, it has been observed that social audits have been effectively deployed under various names and to varying effect. Some of the Lessons Learned Project (LLP) case studies that explicitly recorded the use of social audits are: the right to food and the campaign under the right to information in India2; the strategies adopted by Action Aid Nepal (AAN) to empower dalits3 to mobilize against discrimination and exploitation;4 the role of media organisations in the Philippines in developing capacities to empower rights holders to claim rights;5 and the strategies used by Javanese farmers in Indonesia to analyze and influence local budgetary allocations.6 In this note, the attempt to analyze the use of social audits from the HRBA perspective includes setting boundaries on the definitions of social audits; offering a framework for categorization of different kinds of social audits; and then", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c50c3768-8609-4b9d-9fe3-1508e6aabf74": {"__data__": {"id_": "c50c3768-8609-4b9d-9fe3-1508e6aabf74", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/social-audits-strengthening-accountability", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Social Audits for Strengthening Accountability", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/social-audits-strengthening-accountability", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "43ccade2b24b352fd2ca2cba6414a622d38c7e7f1fdb4b1e3781fe0e86ad65ea"}, "3": {"node_id": "caca0235-48c1-4d95-83da-d2abccfb59aa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/social-audits-strengthening-accountability", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4db9c2239c76fa205af0dc07939827ff40c6b806eb2fe708d54ac03bab864385"}}, "hash": "1ffb178bbea6af68b2fa61493d204598ea8a183b79780374ed2e60d5273eaa32", "text": "applying them via some illustrations and examples.

II u Definitions and Locating Social Audits Within the Human Rights-Based Paradigm A scan of available literature suggests that the definitions of social audits are diffuse and broad. Many interventions have been variously called social audits. It is more appropriate, therefore, to view social audits as a continuum that ranges over several techniques or methodologies. At one end of the continuum we find that global practices such as the Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys (PETS)7 in Tanzania, Citizens\u2019 Report Cards in India and the Philippines,8 Community Score Cards in Kenya and the Gambia, social audits conducted under the Right to Information Campaign in India,9 participatory audits in the Philippines,10 and budgetary audits conducted by Javanese farmers in Indonesia11 are all loosely and interchangeably called social audits. At the other end, a more limited set of characteristics is on view, wherein social auditing is posited as similar to financial auditing, except that \u201cit is about [an audit of].. everything else that an organisation does apart from handling money.\u201d In a way, \u201cthe social auditor is a \u201ccritical friend\u201d (ideally an outsider) who periodically checks the books and asks probing questions to help the organisation reflect systematically on the effectiveness of its internal operations as well as its broad external impact.\u201d12 Other definitions are available: The Northern Ireland Co-operative Development Agency (NICDA) terms social auditing as \u201ca process which enables organisations and agencies to assess and demonstrate their social, community and environmental benefits and limitations. It is a way to measure the extent to which an organisation lives up to the shared values and objectives it has committed itself to promote.\u201d13 Similarly, the New Economics Development Foundation (NEF) defines social auditing as \u201ca process whereby an organisation can account for its social performance, report on and improve that performance.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "caca0235-48c1-4d95-83da-d2abccfb59aa": {"__data__": {"id_": "caca0235-48c1-4d95-83da-d2abccfb59aa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/social-audits-strengthening-accountability", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Social Audits for Strengthening Accountability", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/social-audits-strengthening-accountability", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "43ccade2b24b352fd2ca2cba6414a622d38c7e7f1fdb4b1e3781fe0e86ad65ea"}, "2": {"node_id": "c50c3768-8609-4b9d-9fe3-1508e6aabf74", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/social-audits-strengthening-accountability", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1ffb178bbea6af68b2fa61493d204598ea8a183b79780374ed2e60d5273eaa32"}}, "hash": "4db9c2239c76fa205af0dc07939827ff40c6b806eb2fe708d54ac03bab864385", "text": "It assesses the social impact and ethical behavior of an organisation in relation to its aims and those of its stakeholders\u201d 14 These definitions resonate with the form of audits undertaken by AAN, as documented under an LLP case study via the Regenerated Frerian Literacy through Empowerment Community Technique (REFLECT) to periodically review and evaluate its programmes and end results jointly by all stakeholders on a regular basis.15 What can be reconciled from this large spectrum of definitions is that social auditing as a process is firmly rooted in a framework of values, ethics and focus on the community.16 In other words, there is a strong human rights-focused component to social auditing; it is not simply technical auditing of the nature conducted by public sector agencies or audit bodies. There is, rather, a more intrinsic link to HRBAs. Audits are not only assessments of performance (outputs), but also of the integrity of the process that leads to the performance and the impact of such performance (outcomes). In that sense, audits can be used through a lens of rights and applied to test the integrity of a given process through, particularly, the lens of the rights holders. 3 Definitions and Locating Social Audits Within the Human Rights-Based Paradigm However, later in this note, we will also demonstrate", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6498cf95-6d98-49f4-ac52-b4efae33b439": {"__data__": {"id_": "6498cf95-6d98-49f4-ac52-b4efae33b439", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/social-audits-strengthening-accountability", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Social Audits for Strengthening Accountability", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/social-audits-strengthening-accountability", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4c00c34746eb8ea4a9e1aae652889db24afec30203c154f30cc09383ecb81035"}, "3": {"node_id": "c6d04bb2-214a-4589-80b6-785dd825b2b5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/social-audits-strengthening-accountability", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aeeb530d9ca39dd6e741bd17657516fb635f62a433762dc0356e5829b2b6ccfd"}}, "hash": "04f9533a359037b8b76025d36c8cab0e6b91574ea2ecff575c5b7afb38e0ab43", "text": "that audits are not only relevant from the point of view of the demand for rights and services; the \u2018supply side\u2019 is equally deserving of the practitioner\u2019s attention. It will also be evident in the course of this note that roles of \u2018auditor\u2019 and \u2018auditee\u2019 can change or overlap based on the nature of the audit being conducted (i.e. by whom and on whom/what). It is worth re-stating how rights holders and duty bearers stack up in the context of social audits because of the relative nature of their positions. For example, while a municipal council is a duty bearer in relation to the community that it services, it is a rights holder (a citizen/client) in relation to the lawmakers/policymakers in that it looks to the latter for mandates, guidance and financial allocations. Below is a more detailed description of rights holders and duty bearers in the context of social audits: g Rights holders (the demand side) \u2013 primarily citizens/clients (consisting of civil society members that include communities). However, the demand side can also extend to include meso-level duty bearers such as civil society organisations (CSOs), non-governmental organisations (NGOs), international non- governmental organisations (INGOs), donors and multilateral agencies. Also included are primary-level duty bearers such as service providers (the public sector and other frontline organisations consisting of, for instance, government departments, municipal/other local councils, quasi-governmental agencies such as Supreme Audit Institutions {SAIs} and human rights commissions), and also the State (policy makers/politicians) in soliciting accountability and transparency, and; g Duty bearers (the supply side) \u2013 primarily the State and service providers, but this group can also include citizens/clients and meso-level duty bearers such as CSOs, NGOs, INGOs, donors and multilateral agencies \u2013 based on the nature of audits being conducted \u2013 in responding via resultant appropriate mechanisms. It goes without saying that many globally-acclaimed instances of social audits have been undertaken mainly due to pressure from rights holders in influencing policy planning and resultant policy implementation, especially as this relates to the securing of effective and efficient delivery of services. Influencing policy planning and implementation via audits is related primarily to delivery of obligations in terms of adequate budgetary allocations and associated disbursements and use (since the manner in which a budget is planned and implemented has consequences on the poor in a society) and in claiming entitlements such as access to information that are an outcome of legislative frameworks. One final comment is necessary on the use of social audits as building blocks in HRBAs. Social audits represent the application of standard accounting procedures (rooted firmly in the science of accounting) applied within a strong value and ethical premise, including application of the core HRBA principles of access and participation for increased transparency and accountability. In this regard, by applying a normative, value-based overlay on a technocratic process such as an audit that would ideally only be used by service providers and the State, social audits bring two distinct domains of accountability \u2013 hard numbers and \u2018soft\u2019 values \u2013 closer. Furthermore, the use of standard financial techniques gives credibility to the normative assessment. This makes them worthy of further enquiry. 4 Social Audits for Strengthening Accountability: Building Blocks for Human Rights-Based Programming Box 1: Social Audits and Human Rights-Based Approaches \u2013 The Accountability Dimension Accountability can be defined as being answerable and responsible for one\u2019s actions and decisions. Under an HRBA framework, the concept of accountability refers to stakeholders being answerable and responsible for performing their duties and fulfilling responsibilities/obligations. Duty bearers are accountable for fulfilling obligations as they relate to, for instance, public sector delivery, financial allocations, provision of speedy and fair justice remedies for all without any discrimination and abiding by frameworks as stipulated in international treaties and conventions that a country has signed and ratified. At the same time, rights holders are also accountable for ensuring that there exist universal basic human rights standards that they abide by when realizing various individual rights that are sanctioned by a country\u2019s government \u2013 the right to bear arms for self-defense being a case in point.

While conventionally they are understood to be conducted largely in the process of claiming various entitlements from service providers and the State, for these to be analyzed under a comprehensive HRBA framework, social audits should go beyond a simple linear chain to involve accountability flows in both directions that encompass multiple stakeholders. In other words, social audits are not simply linear, unidirectional chains of citizens/clients conducting audits on the State by way of accountability for performance and delivery of obligations. There is a more complex set of causalities and workflow processes in operation, and there is also a degree of relativism in who the auditor and auditee are. To illustrate, this note uses the World Development Report (WDR) 2004: Making Services Work for Poor People17 as a guiding framework for its relevant application to social audits. Diagram 1: Multiple Stakeholders in an Accountability Framework (adapted from WDR 2004) 17 World Bank (WB). World Development Report 2004: Making Services Work for Poor People. Washington D.C.: World Bank, 2004. The premise is that a compact of accountability contains various stakeholders \u2013 the State, the service providers and the citizens/clients. An additional dimension of this loop is created when a State relies on external resources for delivering services to its citizens/clients. In this case, there is a component of accountability to donor country legislative bodies and taxpayers (the latter is, however, not the focus of this note.) This accountability compact is depicted in Diagram 1 above. The accountability compact, then, is the citizen holding the State and service providers accountable through both the A and B channels. The State (policy makers/politicians) Citizens/Clients Service Providers (public sector/other frontline agencies) External Stakeholders (donors) Legislative Bodies Tax Payers A C B D 6 Social Audits for Strengthening Accountability: Building Blocks for Human Rights-Based Programming If we use the above accountability framework in the context of social audits, we find that most social audits are a uni-directional \u2018bottom-up\u2019 process that are initiated and/or conducted by citizens/clients in claiming policy entitlements from the State and service delivery of service providers. So, audits mostly get conducted along channels A and B in one direction (see Diagram 2 below).

Though this system broke down in the latter part of the decade - primarily because it relied on the support of one bureaucrat, who was transferred - it allowed even illiterate women to monitor services on behalf of poor citizens.20 In the above instances (and other analogous instances recorded in Section IV of this note), the citizen initiates and applies the accountability cycle onto the State and service providers. 7 Applying Social Audits Under a Framework of Accountability: the Human Rights-Based Perspective 21 To access the APREGS website, visit: http://www.nrega.ap.gov.in.

However, social audits also demonstrate a different dynamic \u2013 one where the State and service providers invite audits on themselves, lending a bi-directional character to channels A and B above. Such bi-directional accountability that connects the State and service providers to the citizens/clients and vice versa, and which delineates power and accountability among both levels of stakeholders (providing each their rights as well as responsibilities and each their place and role), forms the basis of looking at social audits as a tool that can help secure accountability under an HRBA framework. This underlying principle justifies the initiation of and/ or conduct of audits, along channels A and B in the reverse direction (see Diagram 3 below). Diagram 3: Bi-Directional Accountability via Audits Initiated/Conducted by the State and Service Providers The State (policy makers/politicians) Citizens/Clients Service Providers (public sector/other frontline agencies) A B There are emerging instances of such State and service provider-initiated and/or conducted audits, for example, in initiatives introduced by the state governments of Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Karnataka in India, and by related service provider agencies in other countries (see Box 2 for more illustrations). In the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, the Andhra Pradesh Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (APREGS) has become an accountability and transparency model that marks a paradigm shift in how wage employment programmes (where corruption was the norm) have traditionally been implemented.21 The state government has put forward an e-framework under the Right to Information Act wherein all records \u2013 from preparation of estimates to the completion of work by the employees \u2013 are maintained in an exhaustive website and can be accessed at the click of a mouse. Every eligible worker (there is a poverty line limit) who is enlisted is entitled to 100 days of work. By effectively tracking the movement of funds spent under the APREGS in 13,000 villages in 13 of the 23 districts in the state, the programme ensures that contractors and vested interests cannot hijack the scheme. Monitoring by the community (the gram sabhas)22 in the form of social audits has begun and has been extended in phases to all village panchayats 23 Other state governments \u2013 notably, Kerala and Karnataka \u2013 are also initiating various forms of social audits that hinge on such accountability frameworks. 8 Social Audits for Strengthening Accountability: Building Blocks for Human Rights-Based Programming Box 2: State and Service Provider-led Audits Improve Duty Bearer Accountability to Citizens/Clients \u2013 Some Global Examples Asia: In South Korea, the Board of Audit and Inspection (BAI) introduced the Citizens\u2019 Audit Request System in July 2001 under the provisions of the Anti-Corruption Act.

A Citizens Audit Request Screening Committee, established within the BAI, decides for or against a request. For those requests that are approved, the BAI conducts audits and notifies requesting parties of the results. To address civil petitions that citizens lodge against executive government agencies, the BAI has established a Civil Petitions Reception function.

The first PETS, undertaken in Uganda, focused on tracking leakage or diversion of funds that were intended for primary schools. Between 1991 and 1995, it was found that, on average, only 13 percent of the annual per-student grant reached the primary schools. That meant that 87 percent of the funds were misappropriated/used by district officials for purposes not directly related to education. While larger schools and schools with pupils from wealthier families benefited disproportionally from the annual per student grants, the smaller and poorer schools received no funds. Less than half the schools received any funds at all. The findings prompted authorities to embark on a number of initiatives to enhance transparency and to increase accountability. When the school survey was replicated in 1999, they found a dramatic rise in the proportion of funds received \u2013 the schools had received more than 90 percent of the capitation grant. 25 The first PETS in Tanzania conducted by Price Waterhouse Coopers (PWC) in 1999 was jointly commissioned by the Tanzanian Government and the UK Department for International Development (DfID). It is known as one of the most comprehensive audits, and the one that most resembles the Ugandan studies. The study covered all sources of central-level funds and supplies as well as resources collected at the district level and service centers that focused on the education and health sectors. Budgeting and accounting mechanisms were analyzed at the level of district and service centers. Though the sample of districts and service delivery units was not representative, the study provides valuable insights into the budget process and local structures of accountability. Several other PETS have been conducted since then, including one in 2001 to ensure that the national budgets followed the pro-poor priorities set by the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). Another \u2013 the \u201cPrimary School Pilot\u201d PETS \u2013 was delivered to the World Bank in June 2003.26 Ghana also used PETS in 2000 to evaluate actual spending and appraise leakage of funds in transfer from government through districts to service facilities in the basic education and primary health care sector. They have been successful in initiating an inter-ministerial collaboration and have been able to evaluate frontline expenditures and service delivery; however, they have not been so effective in leakage reduction.27 Latin America: In Brazil, in the city of Porto Alegre, the City Hall created an innovative and revolutionary system to formulate and follow-up the municipal budget.

Such enabling conditions could be policy legislation, such as is the case with the Right to Information Act in India, the Freedom on Information Law in Mexico and the Law of Popular Participation in Bolivia, as well as via decentralization policy frameworks that allow citizens/clients to, among other things, analyze and monitor budgets. Cases of how these frameworks facilitate and provide for the State and service providers to be held accountable by the citizens/clients are illustrated in Section IV. Channel C (see Diagram 4 below) demonstrates the relative positions of duty bearers and rights holders. For instance, a judge is a duty bearer who is obligated to ensure that court rulings are free and impartial; on the other hand, the same judge is a rights holder (as a citizen/client) who is entitled to receive free and impartial judgments on claims that s/he files as a citizen in a court, or other services s/he expects from service providers. Thus, Channel C also needs to be strengthened to secure accountability in both directions \u2013 for both the State and service providers could be a duty bearer or a rights holder \u2013 based on the audits that need to be conducted and on who is situated where in the accountability loop. However, though we find instances of accountability that flow from the service providers to the State with audits being conducted by the State to monitor effective delivery of public service goods \u2013 the Ugandan and Tanzanian PETS being good instances of such audits conducted by the State on service providers (see Box 2) \u2013 we find relatively fewer instances of audits that are being conducted by service providers on soliciting the State\u2019s accountability (those conducted by, say, municipal councils on the State\u2019s obligations). While decentralization frameworks provide the arena for service providers \u2013 local government officials, for instance, to monitor and assess whether appropriate matching budgets have been made available to them to allow them to undertake corresponding service delivery to their clients (the citizens) \u2013 there have been few instances of such audits actually being undertaken to assess whether the State has provided adequate budgetary allocations. Hence, the accountability flow from the State to the service providers needs to be strengthened. This remains the big gap in social auditing. Is this an academic question? The answer is \u201cno\u201d. The most graphic lack of accountability in the C channel is in the way decentralized finances work. The LLP interviewees (and others) that are local-level service providers \u2013 such as municipal mayors, local water and sanitation officials, and many such others \u2013 constantly face a problem of inadequate financial allocations despite the fact that in most cases, they are mandated to make plans, submit budgets, consult stakeholders, etc. While they are required to account to their immediate clients \u2013 the citizens \u2013 there is little accountability on the part of the \u2018managers of the economy\u2019 \u2013 policy makers, politicians, etc. \u2013 as to why adequate finances are not available to the service delivery agents that operate under them. This is also not an academic discussion because often managers of the economy/polity make allocational trade-off decisions based on considerations of political expediency rather than on sound logic, rationale or the discharging of obligations that could lead to rights realization. In an ultimate sense, of course, if the polity is democratic, there is the possibility of being voted out of power; but beyond that, there is little bi-directionality in Channel C. 10 Social Audits for Strengthening Accountability: Building Blocks for Human Rights-Based Programming 30 Refer to footnote no. 7. 31 Refer to footnote no. 8. Diagram 4: Bi-Directional Accountability Via Audits Initiated/Conducted by the State on Service Providers and Vice Versa The State (policy makers/politicians) Service Providers (public sector/other frontline agencies) C Finally, it is also worth noting that social audits have largely remained confined to the loop of national accountability. However, quite a few are in fact inspired by the loop of a larger external accountability chain such as the one fostered by donors, who are in turn accountable to their legislatures, and who are then accountable to their taxpayers (the citizens/clients). Donors are rightfully stakeholders in initiating such audits under this framework by virtue of providing technical assistance and funding support \u2013 the PETS in Uganda and Tanzania30 or the support provided by the Ford Foundation to initiate the Bangalore Report Cards on Pro-Poor Services (discussed elsewhere in this note)31 being cases in point.

What are the entry points that meso-level duty bearers, including CSOs, NGOs, INGOs, donor and multilateral agencies, can employ to successfully undertake audits that can harness bi-directional multi- stakeholder accountability? These will be discussed in Section V. 11 Social Audits Under the Lessons Learned Project: Some Examples 32 Refer to footnote no. 7. 33 Refer to footnote no. 2 and 5, respectively. IV u Social Audits Under the Lessons Learned Project: Some Examples The accountability framework discussed in the previous section consists of multiple stakeholders (the State, service providers and citizens/clients) and demonstrates the need to have accountability flow in multiple directions for it to be based on an HRBA framework. How do social audits fare when interrogated under the above framework? The LLP finds a relatively small sub-set of this accountability framework at work in the case of social audits. This consists of three main elements \u2013 who commissions the audit, who conducts it and on whom it is conducted. This is captured in the following cube: On whom it is conducted Who commissions/facilitates Who conducts Each of the LLP cases and the other instances detailed elsewhere in this note can be located as one or as a combination of the three axes of the cube, with a degree of diffusion between the axes. So, to illustrate from the Tanzanian PETS example,32 the location of the PETS on the cube on all three levels will be: g Who conducts: NGOs and other CSOs g On whom is it conducted: On the service providers g Who commissions/facilitates: An international agency (acting through the Government) While undertaking an analysis of the categorization based on the above, this section will use instances not only from the LLP case studies; it will also utilize, en passant, other globally available examples. The cases documented indicate typology under three sets of questions: i) Who conducts the audit \u2013 As has been analyzed in Section III, audits are mostly a uni-directional \u201cbottom- up\u201d process, wherein citizens/clients participate in conducting audits to bring to notice, to access or to improve transparency and accountability in respect of policy implementation (including allocating and spending under public budgets) and on delivery of public services. Instances of such audits have been recorded in two LLP case studies33 wherein audits have been conducted by citizens in India and the Philippines to implement and access the right to information and to provide evidence on issues relating to corruption and the lack of information from related service providers when executing public welfare projects (see Box 3). 12 Social Audits for Strengthening Accountability: Building Blocks for Human Rights-Based Programming 34 Public hearings 35 Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI). 2007. \u201cState Level RTI: Rajasthan.\u201d Accessed at: http://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/programs/ai/rti/india/states/rajasthan.htm#mkss 36 Transparency International (TI). 2000. \u201cFirst Ever TI Integrity Awards Go to People of Courage in Morocco, the Phillipines, Sri Lanka, and Argentina.

Though many villagers were illiterate, through face-to-face public hearings, they could scrutinize complex and detailed accounts, question their representatives and make them answerable on the basis of hard evidence.35 In the Philippines, a civil society group \u2013 the Concerned Citizens of Abra for Good Governance (CCAGG) \u2013 conducted the first-ever participatory audit of a local government unit. Based in the Abra province in the Cordillera region in northern Philippines, members of this organisation came together from the ranks of students, professionals, housewives, priests, church workers and government employees in 1987 when an article appeared in a local newspaper boasting of 20 successful government infrastructure projects in the region. The organisation\u2019s first investigation in 1987 of these projects exposed the \u201cuncompleted\u201d nature of the projects of the Department of Public Works and Highways, which resulted in the suspension of 11 government engineers who were found guilty of dishonesty and misconduct. Since then, this non-profit, non-partisan civic organisation of more than 1,000 members has been monitoring public spending in Abra, where, despite considerable public funds being channeled into this poor province, very few concrete results can be seen. Today, the group\u2019s assessment reports have become vital in the release of government funding for public projects.36 Another example of such citizen/client -conducted audits (that were not within the purview of the LLP cases, but which could serve as worthy examples to this section) include the Citizens\u2019 Report Cards on Pro-Poor Services that assess the performance of selected government services (basic health, electricity, elementary education, housing, potable water, food distribution and so on) based on client experience. First conducted in the early 90\u2019s in Bangalore under the banner of the Public Affairs Centre (a small citizens\u2019 group) in the southern Indian state of Karnataka, the initiative subsequently spread across the state and several other large cities. The results provide valuable insights into the constraints citizens face in accessing public services, their views about the quality and adequacy of services, and the responsiveness of public officials. The reports also provide information about how the various services may be better tailored to citizens\u2019 needs, in general, and to the poor, in particular. It is expected that service providers take the Report Card findings into consideration while adjusting their programmes to improve service delivery.37 The success of citizens in holding service providers\u2019 delivery mechanisms to account through the Citizens\u2019 Report Cards system has now spread beyond Asia to African countries, covering Kenya, Uganda, Mozambique, South Africa38 and Zanzibar.39 13 Social Audits Under the Lessons Learned Project: Some Examples 38 \u201cSouth Africa: Citizen Report Cards to Improve Service Delivery,\u201d A Preliminary Outline, Monitoring and Impact Evaluation Conference, The Presidency and The WB, June 19-23, 2006.

Detailed survey manuals accompany such questionnaires. What is of interest is that such tools have been used by poor and vulnerable people \u2013 who are the most affected and who have been trained to use them \u2013 to monitor outcomes, and at times, in collaboration with a duty bearer (in this case, the Indian Supreme Court). The first such exercise was undertaken immediately after the Supreme Court ordered state governments to ensure that all PDS shops were open and functioning properly in July 2001. A field survey was undertaken shortly thereafter by Campaign members to check the extent to which the policy had been implemented. In the case of monitoring of the Mid-Day Meal Scheme (MDMS) \u2013 a nationwide school feeding voucher system which entitles children in government-run schools to consume one free cooked meal a day \u2013 a regular system of auditing the provision of such a daily meal (though not used nationwide) in the schools has been developed and is being used. For instance, in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh, one of the Campaign member organisations \u2013 Bharat Gyan Vigyan Samiti (BGVS) \u2013 is trying to ensure regular monitoring of the MDMS by using a simple questionnaire. Such a system entails a visit to the local primary school without prior announcement and enquiring about the mid-day meal from the teachers. The monitoring is done at the time the mid-day meal is served and the process is observed to ensure whether the food served has passed through several quality-control measures. All these questions are included in the simple questionnaire that the monitor fills during the visit.43 In the same manner, a simple questionnaire has been prepared to monitor the performance of another food security programme \u2013 the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) \u2013 by organisations associated with the Campaign. Questionnaires are available in several languages to make it more user-friendly. 14 Social Audits for Strengthening Accountability: Building Blocks for Human Rights-Based Programming 44 Refer to footnote no. 4. 45 \u201cParticipatory Assessments: A Mapping of Methods,\u201d paper by Upala Devi Banerjee, Human Rights Strengthening Programme (HURIST), UNDP, New York, USA, June 2004. 46 Refer to footnote no. 2. 47 Paper by Vivek Ramkumar, \u201cExpanding Collaborations between SAIs and Civil Society\u201d in International Journal of Government Auditing.

Accessed at http://www.ciet.org/en/documents/projects/200621012547.asp Audits can also be conducted on soliciting meso-level duty bearers\u2019 accountability (since NGO/CSO/INGO/ donor/ multilateral agencies roles can interchangeably be that of a rights holder or a duty bearer under a HRBA framework, based on the audits being conducted). Therefore, by extension, under such a framework that solicits bi-directional accountability, this also comprises some measure of audit of not just public officials but also organisational staff performances. Hence, in the case of audits conducted by CSOs and NGOs on their own performances, the LLP review of AAN\u2019s strategies in Nepal observed that AAN conducted audits on its own performances/results and capacitated community members to participate in these exercises. Such a process revealed that stakeholder accountability and transparency were solicited and instant feedback and opinion for immediate action could be taken.44 Globally, AA has developed the Accountability, Learning and Planning System (ALPS) to strengthen the organisation\u2019s main accountability, which is to the poor and marginalized, and with their local partners with whom they work. ALPS seek to put this principle into practice through actions that reflect that the priorities and perspectives of poor people should inform the decisions that the organisation and their partners make at all levels.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "20f498ae-9bed-4320-8a2b-7d0a785f1f45": {"__data__": {"id_": "20f498ae-9bed-4320-8a2b-7d0a785f1f45", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/social-audits-strengthening-accountability", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Social Audits for Strengthening Accountability", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/social-audits-strengthening-accountability", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5cc0f468ebc5f765fd91874d7acefb818eedbdadb157eb1a02a007b7ed0f0918"}, "2": {"node_id": "10c90d7c-3a29-4ec7-a2ed-499f9eab1e21", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/social-audits-strengthening-accountability", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "49b79c3c671b2eca1122afa87c26102230a414ceff9ad37fbeb0d4605258f0c4"}}, "hash": "6dadf8b93e989218c663786bb4f148f704259dbcea87fdafa020bea32a357bec", "text": "This system has replaced the organisation\u2019s standard annual country reports with an annual participatory review reflection process (PRRP).

The passing of the Right to Information Act, coupled with the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts that legislate the devolution of power and resources to the local levels via the decentralization framework has opened the way for transparency in administration from the state to the panchayat level The gram sabha members \u2013 who have been given the \u201cwatchdog\u201d role by these Acts \u2013 can monitor the functioning of panchayat elected representatives and government functionaries and can, among other things, audit their annual statement of accounts.

In Mexico, Fundar \u2013 a research and advocacy organisation \u2013 used the national Freedom of Information Law to obtain accounting records from the Ministry of Health.47 In Pakistan, the government introduced devolution in 2001 through its National Reconstruction Bureau (NRB). Among other things, it provides for the establishment of Citizen Community Boards, set up by members of the public with a remit to monitor service provision and projects and to undertake their own projects with a 20 percent contribution from the public and 80 percent from the relevant local government. These Boards conduct social audits to check whether devolution reforms are having the desired effect and provide guidance to fine-tune the process for increased effectiveness. A 2002 national social audit was undertaken to solicit household views and experiences on the access and quality of key public services and local government. This national audit will, over the five years of 2004-2009, be repeated in alternate years to track progress under devolution and to inform policy.48 15 Social Audits Under the Lessons Learned Project: Some Examples 49 Lopes, C. and Theisohn, T., \u201cBolivia: Citizens Exercise their Right to be Involved in the Aid System\u201d in Ownership, Leadership and Transformation: Can We Do Better for Capacity Development?

A highly developed and capacitated civil society. Similarly, in Bolivia, the Law of Popular Participation on decentralization devolved basic governance down to the local (municipal) level while at the same time providing for close monitoring by citizens\u2019 vigilance groups. These groups can call for local audits to monitor spending by these municipal councils and, upon detecting corruption, can report it to the national executive, which, in turn, passes it to a special committee of the Senate. At the same time, under the first government-conducted National Dialogue in 1998 to which civil society stakeholders were invited, one of the four working groups in the Dialogue dealt with justice and institutionalism, and found that corruption was a major factor plaguing public sector delivery and performance. Henceforth, the Office of the Vice President launched the National Integrity Plan and a Campaign against Corruption, involving all these sectors/ stakeholders.49 g Secondly, under a bi-directional accountability framework, a receptive and transparent State apparatus (or service providers themselves) initiate and facilitate audits. Or, the citizens/clients \u2013 in other words, a highly developed civil society \u2013 initiate and then facilitate audits. In the first instance, though none of the LLP case studies document any instances of State and service provider-initiated or facilitated audits, a review of global literature does point to such audits (see Box 2 and other instances recorded elsewhere in this note) being undertaken.

Such instances have also been aptly demonstrated in the LLP case studies in India on the right to food and the right to information, the Philippines case study and the Indonesia case study.51 In the LLP recorded case study in Java, Indonesia, a series of well-targeted advocacy and lobbying campaigns forced the local officials to invite members of one district-level NGO \u2013 Jaringan Organisasi Non Per, Merintah Pendamping Petani Se-Java (JARNOP PP) \u2013 and one district-level CSO \u2013 Farmers Forum for Information and Communication (FKIP) \u2013 to participate in the district and parliamentary hearing sessions and audit some policy budget drafts proposed by the local government. Through such participation in the Klaten District Development Budget Plan and the Klaten District Government Development Budget, the farmers imposed pressure on the government to increase funding in the District Annual Budget Plan for the agricultural and irrigation sectors by 10 percent. Earlier, the budgetary allocation for the agricultural sector comprised 20 percent of the overall budget; the process of participatory budgeting led this allocation to comprise 30 percent of the overall budget. Thus, these audit hearings served as a vital space for policy makers and farmers to interface, discuss and dialogue and, ultimately, to influence budgetary increases in allocation for farmers\u2019 needs. 16 Social Audits for Strengthening Accountability: Building Blocks for Human Rights-Based Programming 16 Social Audits for Strengthening Accountability: Building Blocks for Human Rights-Based Programming V u Challenges and Resultant Entry Points for Human Rights\u2013Based Programming The previous section and the illustrations therein give us a useful typology to categorize audits under a bi- directional and multi-stakeholder accountability framework. Roles and responsibilities are diffuse and broad, and can intersect based on the nature of the audit being conducted under such a HRBA framework. However, social audits \u2013 if they are to be conducted under this framework as the examples illustrate \u2013 do require a certain set of capacities/skills to initiate, facilitate and conduct. Conversely, as the examples again illustrate, lack of such capacities/skills can pose challenges in the conduct of audits. These are listed as follows: g Primary among these skills is the degree of facility with numbers/data and, in the first place, an availability of such data For these audits to remain \u2018social\u2019 and truly participatory in character, there is a presumption that the citizens/clients or their representatives have the ability to read numbers and to participate in interviews. However, such abilities are often not present on the ground. These constraints have been well documented in the budget monitoring initiatives in South Africa and Brazil,52 as well as in the LLP case studies. g The lack of reasonably accurate numbers at the macro level is the most intractable capacity constraint and challenge because many countries lack hard data at the level of sectoral budgetary allocations either by accident or by design UNDP\u2019s agenda of localizing the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has consistently thrown up the lack of statistical capacities as one of the major binding constraints. Limitations in availability of data often mean that it is not possible to analyze each line item in the budget for its allocation on and spending in various sectors as they relate to the poor (especially on women and children, as has been analyzed from the experiences of gender and children\u2019s budget monitoring and influencing initiatives in South Africa, Brazil53 and from the LLP case studies). g Related to this issue is the capacity constraint in terms of experience and skills (or lack of) in initiating, facilitating and conducting audits by auditors themselves A report conducted by the Clean Clothes Campaign (CCC) on assessing whether social audit is an effective tool to monitor working conditions in factories producing garments and sports shoes for export found that these audits fell short of detecting violations in relation to workers\u2019 rights, mainly due to the fact that these audits were conducted by staff from global firms who were unskilled and inexperienced.54 g Finally, even in cases where there are enabling legal and policy frameworks in place to enable citizen/ client and local government participation in audits, apathy and lack of motivation and interest hinder the conduct of audits These factors are further exacerbated by the existence of self-interest, prevalence of inequities and capture of audit processes by the local elite Bi-directional accountability mechanisms can be seriously undermined in such instances. For all these reasons, development programming makes it necessary to identify some entry points that", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e4b278d5-5ca0-4413-91f4-24b45798406c": {"__data__": {"id_": "e4b278d5-5ca0-4413-91f4-24b45798406c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/social-audits-strengthening-accountability", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Social Audits for Strengthening Accountability", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/social-audits-strengthening-accountability", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "23e46f9992420271b68f7f80fcdece6152ba5687d7622bd225a9eb6da4613076"}, "3": {"node_id": "b04f47fa-9934-4aab-a857-aefc619093ec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/social-audits-strengthening-accountability", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "848f8834e24adc73901c0bf8f7754cc4a7062ce627a86149c17906f9e77bfca1"}}, "hash": "4d4e1b30472a4765667c857ce1ea114ad4e332fa1658c88f44670c7945faaea9", "text": "would enable the utilization of social audits from an HRBA perspective in order to solicit bi-directional and multi- stakeholder accountability: 52 Refer to footnotes nos. 19 and 28. 53 Refer to footnotes nos. 19 and 28. 54 The report \u2013 Looking for a Quick Fix: How Weak Social Auditing is Keeping Workers in Sweatshops \u2013 concentrates on Bangladesh, India, China, Indonesia, Pakistan, Morocco, Kenya and Romania. To download a full copy of the report, visit: http://www.cleanclothes.org/publications/quick_fix.htm 17 Background to the Note 17 Challenges and Resultant Entry Points for Human Rights-Based Programming i) Supporting key enablers and agents: A study of the accountability framework in Section III has indicated that ideally, accountability is bi-directional in both upward and downward flows. The analysis revealed that there are enablers (laws and policies) and agents (NGOs, CSOs, INGOs or, increasingly, the State and service providers, themselves) initiating and facilitating this bi-directional accountability. Hence, supporting the enablers and the agents to conduct multi-stakeholder audits and ensure bi-directional accountability is key. Other agents such as elites in local communities (the village head, the tribal chief, etc) also need to be co-opted and capacitated so that elite capture of audit processes are minimized. The role of external actors as defined along Channel D in the framework in Section III is crucial in this context. DfID\u2019s role in supporting the Tanzanian PETS provides some pointers on how external actors can support bi-directional accountability mechanisms.55 ii) Strengthening statistical capacities: The second entry point is that of investing in the strengthening of statistical capacities to analyze and process data on the part of service providers and citizens/clients. Hence, the draft \u201cUNDP India Country Programme\u201d for the years 2008-2012 highlights capacity development of both local district officials and elected officials in panchayats to undertake social audits as key. This will ensure that not only adequate monitoring and accountability of public services delivery is undertaken, but also that qualitative data is provided which facilitates the participation of particularly disadvantaged groups in livelihood promotion activities. Similarly, the National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB) in the Philippines recognizes and supports the Community-Based Monitoring System (CBMS) as a tool for strengthening the statistical system at the local level in order to generate statistics for monitoring and evaluation of local development plans, including the progress of the local governments in attaining the MDGs. Some other countries in Asia and Africa are also following this example.56 Such capacity development will need to focus on communities going beyond the use of and reliance on NGOs or other agents as intermediaries. The RKS Mumbai example of the breakdown in monitoring of the public distribution system due to reliance on an external agent is telling and needs to be avoided.57 iii) Buttressing accountability levels of service providers: A third entry point is fostering change in service- providing agencies so that they inculcate a culture of accountability to citizens/clients. The organisational \u2018re-engineering\u2019 that is required may need such strategies as: a) regular forums to meet with stakeholders (instances being the hearings initiated in Java, the National Dialogue process in Bolivia and the forums held under the South African Women\u2019s Budget Initiative and the Porto Alegre Participatory Budget initiative);58 b) a published calendar of when information will be released; and c) using information and communication technologies (ICTs) for optimal reach (see next paragraph). In a more fundamental way, the very need to publish these figures in the public domain due to policy legislation like the various laws on access to information as a right can potentially spur service providers to actually record some data or develop collaborations with other stakeholders; this has been demonstrated in the examples from Andhra Pradesh in India, Bolivia and Pakistan.59 iv) Strengthening Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs): The role of ICTs needs to be seriously considered if social audits are to become part of a regular compact of information exchange between State and citizen. While wall-magazine type conventional social audit reports remain useful, these can become episodic and have limited scope of geographical spread because they are often produced via localized agents such as NGOs/CSOs/INGOs. So where such agents are not present or incapable, there is a danger that social audits remain unviable.

An unresponsive media can have a negative impact on any campaign or advocacy work. Conversely, it is of no coincidence that the media have been vital in providing access to information and in evoking strong citizen support that ultimately pressures service providers and the State to deliver on their obligations. In the MKSS example from India or in the experiences with the Citizens\u2019 Report Cards initiatives in India and the Philippines, it was seen that the media helped in developing public support and advocacy for the cause. Such an entry point needs to be supported and nurtured. Similarly, in Uganda, when the PETS was first conducted, a newspaper campaign initiated by the Ugandan Government to boost citizens/clients\u2019 ability to track the diversion of school funds revealed that such diversion was reduced dramatically from 80 percent in 1995 to less than 20 percent in 2001. There was a strong correlation between a head teacher\u2019s knowledge about the grant programme, proximity to the nearest newspaper outlet and resultant reduction in capture of school funds. Such public access to information that the media helps provide is a powerful deterrent to capture at the local level.61 61 Paper by R. Reinikka and J.

It provides UNDP Country Offices and other partners in Asia-Pacific with policy-oriented research, analysis and advocacy from a human development perspective on themes of relevance. We also undertake capacity development and policy advisory services to Country Offices in the region on human development. The Programme\u2019s main objectives are to improve national and regional capacities on human development. In line with its mandate, APRI organised its third regional training workshop on Human Development called \u201cSome Challenges in Human Development: Concepts, Measures, Analysis, Reporting and Advocacy\u201d in Colombo, Sri Lanka from September 27-29, 2005.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b2a6b69-dbec-4b23-828d-290d177d654b": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b2a6b69-dbec-4b23-828d-290d177d654b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/some-challenges-human-development-concepts-measures-analysis-reporting-and-advocacy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Some challenges in Human Development: Concepts, Measures, Analysis, Reporting and Advocacy", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/some-challenges-human-development-concepts-measures-analysis-reporting-and-advocacy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8addb93988822a34874933e472151ae353eb6be595b65e67e1c884fb154b1000"}, "2": {"node_id": "09da7dc4-16b8-41aa-84e0-1d5ef6e9bca6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/some-challenges-human-development-concepts-measures-analysis-reporting-and-advocacy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "500fb7e247cee64e70da258429f1d3581514e801c0ef09ac2e021e39dbe23f6a"}}, "hash": "6faeb4899d81c50b3906b0854d0df392d4c696a571330f92d2e34fff02033c09", "text": "The objectives of the workshop included the following: \u2022 Strengthening the understanding of human development: theory, applications, strengths and limitations; \u2022 Strengthening skills in mapping and measuring human development indicators and indices, including their strengths and limitations; \u2022 Stressing the need for HDRs to draw upon and feed into UNDP\u2019s work to ensure that opportunities to embed programmes in human development are not lost; \u2022 Developing skills in analysing a theme from the human development perspective; \u2022 Sharing CO experiences and lessons: best practices and pitfalls; \u2022 Strengthening the capacity to manage NHDRs: preparation, process and follow-up; and \u2022 Strengthening the capacity for communication, advocacy, dissemination and strategy. The workshop was attended by more than 50 participants from 18 countries, UNDP offices, civil society, the media and the academia. There were 11 sessions during this three-day workshop where resource persons and participants made technical presentations and shared experiences on human development including poverty, gender and other Millennium Development Goals. The presentations were followed by rich floor discussions.

Human development (HD) involves broadening people\u2019s choices so that they can develop their full potential and lead productive, creative lives according to their capabilities and interests. Fundamental to enlarging these choices is the process of building human capabilities, including those relating to a healthy life, access to resources needed for a decent standard of living and the ability to participate in the life of the community. The human development approach contributes to UNDP\u2019s mission to help people build better lives and find solutions to global and national developmental challenges through knowledge and experience sharing. UNDP works towards promoting human development through its five practice areas: democratic governance, poverty reduction, crisis prevention and recovery, energy and environment, and HIV/AIDS. As UNDP\u2019s signature advocacy tool, HDRs have contributed to redefining the approach to development. According to UNDP Administrator Kemal Dervis, HDRs have also helped in \u201cbuilding strong bridges between the donor community and activist civil society.\u201d One of the key objectives of the Asia Pacific RHDR Initiative (APRI), which is based in the Regional Centre in Colombo (RCC) and is part of the Poverty Practice, is to support capacity strengthening on human development and the preparation of National HDRs (NHDRs). The response to previous capacity development workshops has been encouraging, providing impetus and foundation for a yearly workshop on the subject. The workshop was attended by more than 50 participants representing 18 countries, UNDP office, civil society, media and the academia. A list of participants is available in Annexure III. 1.1 objectives To strengthen the understanding of human development, the objectives of the workshop included the following: \u2022 Strengthening the understanding of human development: theory, applications, strengths and limitations \u2022 Strengthening skills in mapping and measuring human development: indicators and indices, including their strengths and limitations \u2022 Stressing the need for HDRs to draw upon and feed into UNDP\u2019s work to ensure that opportunities to embed programmes in human development are not lost \u2022 Developing skills in analysing a theme from the human development perspective \u2022 Sharing CO experiences and lessons: best practices and pitfalls \u2022 Strengthening the capacity to manage NHDRs: preparation, process and follow-up \u2022 Strengthening the capacity for communication, advocacy, dissemination and strategy 8 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3rd HD Capacity Development Workshop, Colombo, 27-29 September 2005 APRI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo (www.undprcc.lk) Contact : asiapacific.hdrmdg@undp.org 9 Day one \u2013 tuesday, 27 September 2005 2.0 inaugural Session Facilitator: Bharat krishnan The workshop was opened by Minh Pham, Regional Manager of the UNDP-RCC.

This approach focussed on increasing incomes through efficient, labour-intensive production, reducing poverty through provision of public services and ensuring participation. The Basic Needs Approach is the foundation upon which the \u201cCapabilities Approach\u201d is based. The Capabilities Approach eventually replaced the Basic Needs Approach and is the philosophy underpinning of the human development perspective. The concept of human development arose as a reaction to and critique of mainstream economics and its positivistic nature. In positive economics, human action is driven by the desire to maximize utility or satisfaction. By definition, positive economics is not about norms, and the normative is not central to mainstream economics. The Capabilities Approach, made famous by economist- philosopher Amartya Sen and philosopher Martha Nussbaum, provided a normative foundation for economic and development analysis. The notion of HDRs and the impact of the HD paradigm also need clarification. Some of the aspects of this process are: \u2022 Impact of HDI ranking on competition within each region or sub-region, and the effects of \u2018naming and shaming\u2019 \u2022 Spread of the capabilities approach through the emergence of NHDRs and regional HDRs \u2022 Overall impact of the concept During the course some issues and concerns were raised as to: \u2022 Are rights and capabilities synonymous? The Capabilities Approach is generally wider than the human rights approach. The former has philosophical foundations. The 2000 HDR tries to integrate the two notions. \u2022 Capabilities approach provides the philosophical foundation for human development. \u2022 The HD approach could be seen as an open-ended approach. \u2022 Is there a right to capabilities? The session ended with the last question as food for thought. 11 Session ii 2.2 human Development: mapping and measurement (a) indicators and indexing anuradha rajivan, programme Coordinator, apri/mDgi and advisor, unDp-rCC Issues surrounding indicators and indexing of human development were discussed. Human development is not directly measurable. It is measured using social and economic indicators. Indexing issues arise at three levels: \u2022 Conceptual level. Choice of dimensions: Do the three dimensions (long and healthy life, knowledge and a decent standard of living) capture the concept adequately? Some aspects of human development cannot be measured. Any index (aggregate) is a summary; its positive side is that it provides a single number, which is easy to use and interpret, while its negative side is that it eliminates information. Thematic indices can possibly be prepared (e.g., ICT for HD in the 2005 Asia Pacific Regional HDR) with local specifications. \u2022 Data and measurement level. Data constraints like availability, reliability, quality and differences in definitions among countries also contribute to measurement and comparability issues. Definitions of data need to be better harmonized for comparisons. Quantification may not be the best method to capture various aspects of socio-cultural dimensions. \u2022 Aggregation level. HDI combines variables measured in different units. HDI also aggregates various stock and flow variables and is not strictly comparable with GDP. Despite its shortcomings, HDI is considered a useful indicator to capture the human condition in a geographic area (like a country or sub-national unit, such as a state or province) for a particular period of time (usually a year), just as GDP captures the economic condition. It boils down data into one number to make comparisons easy. It can be modified for a particular country or theme to factor in local characteristics or needs. In a nutshell, the following three points can be concluded: \u2022 HDI is admittedly a crude summary number, but with high advocacy potential, and is able to challenge the other crude but widely used aggregate, GDP per capita. \u2022 HDI has captured the attention of policy makers, media and NGOs and has expanded the debate to focus on the wider human condition. \u2022 Most importantly, HDI has helped move the development lens from an economic growth- centric perspective to a human development-centred perspective. (b) Strengths and weaknesses of gDi and gem ramesh gampat, programme Specialist, apri/mDgi The strengths and weaknesses of gender indices like Gender Development Index (GDI) and Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM) were examined through various opinions including opinions about changing them.

The technical discussion conducted by HDRO aimed to: \u2022 Determine how GDI and GEM have been used for advocacy, analysis and monitoring activities; \u2022 Review the extent of their impact on policy discussions; \u2022 Gauge development professionals\u2019 understanding of how to calculate and interpret the results of these composite measures; and \u2022 Explore ways of updating and refining GDI and GEM. A few participants favoured a change, while others did not want any change. No conclusion was reached, though there were useful suggestions to include more variables, some of which are listed below: \u2022 Institutions in which men and women participate, such as trade unions, co-op societies and micro-credit banks \u2022 A measure of inequality \u2022 A measure of poverty \u2022 Unemployment rate \u2022 Weighted average of agricultural and non-agricultural wage rate \u2022 Having choices and taking control of one\u2019s life, rather than what choice one makes The interactive floor discussions covered the following topics: \u2022 Data verification issues Is there any mechanism by which data gets verified in HDRs? Also, do the key parameters take account of the various human development related declarations? HDRs tend to use data from official sources which sometimes are outdated. In multi-country reports, data often relates to two or three years prior to the date of release. \u2022 Inequality issues HDI does not take into account inequalities in income distribution (unlike GDI and GEM, which consider gender inequalities). Also, HDI, GDI and GEM do not include Gini coefficients. Variations could be made for countries, like including additional factors to take care of local ground realities. Additions have to be balanced by keeping the index simple. \u2022 Role of qualitative research Quantitative analysis can be supplemented by qualitative examination of issues to go beyond what data capture. \u2022 Longevity Higher longevity may not always be desirable. It drains the economy, if old people live too long (the cost issue is an economic perspective, not a human development one). So the relevance of long life as a positive value need to be seen from all angles. 13 \u2022 Importance of economic growth Higher economic growth is essential to create incomes with potential for poverty reduction. Composition and the pattern of economic growth continue to be important for human development. \u2022 Effectiveness of HDI It is useful as a policy advocacy tool. \u2022 Need to improve quality of data Studies have tried to adjust HDI for income inequalities. Instead of adding more variables to HDI, the quality of data needs to be improved. \u2022 Women\u2019s work and income This is not captured adequately by national accounts statistics. Apart from unpaid and non- market work being left out and under-reported, in a globalized world with increasing economic integration, many exported items get manufactured in households and in the informal sector by women. \u2022 Focus on data It was recommended that UNDP focus more on supporting the improvement of official statistics and data at the country level. 14 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3rd HD Capacity Development Workshop, Colombo, 27-29 September 2005 APRI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo (www.undprcc.lk) Contact : asiapacific.hdrmdg@undp.org Session iii 2.3 Calculating and indexing hD anuradha rajivan \u2013 apri/mDgi (a) Calculating hDi: indexing exercise A presentation about the steps in the indexing process, particularly concepts and steps in calculating HDI was made.

The limitation of income as an exclusive measure of development becomes evident as we recognize that many choices do not depend upon income. The HDI has become a flagship summary measure to represent HD achievements of a particular geographical area over a given period of time, normally a year. It captures three dimensions: \u2022 A long and healthy life \u2022 Knowledge \u2022 A decent standard of living Principles in Indexing Any indexing is a simple process of aggregating individual variables to obtain a summary measure. Since individual indicators are expressed in different units of measurement, they first need to be made scale-free before indexing. All indicators must be made unidirectional (i.e., all increases are good, or vice versa, say by using reciprocals where necessary). The scale-free values are then given desired weights before completing the aggregation. 15 Calculating HDI: Step 1 Obtain actual data for relevant variables for the dimensions to be covered Step 2 \u2022 Convert dimension indicators into unit-free values to facilitate aggregation through construction of dimension indices: \u2022 Identify goalposts for each indicator; this means the maximum and minimum value for each indicator \u2022 Calculate dimension indices: \uf0a7 Dimension Index = (actual value \u2013 minimum value) / (maximum value \u2013 minimum value) \u2022 Dimension 1: Long and healthy life; life expectancy at birth is used to measure this \u2022 Dimension 2: Knowledge; measured by two components, adult literacy rate and combined gross enrolment ratio \uf0a7 Education Index = 2/3 (adult literacy index) + 1/3 (gross enrolment index) \u2022 Dimension 3: Standard of living; measured by GDP per capita (PPP $) Step 3 Final aggregation of the scale-free dimension indices to obtain HDI Table 1 \u2013 Three steps of calculating HDI HDI Indexing Exercise Participants were given an HDI indexing exercise in which they (a) calculated HDI for three imaginary countries, (b) ranked the countries according to the HDI value obtained and (c) based on the HDI index, indicated whether these countries would be among the high, medium or low HD countries. To facilitate calculations, indicator values for demography, income, education, health and environment were provided. This exercise was fully completed by 31 participants. The participants enthusiastically did the exercise. Some felt that although they knew the theoretical formula for calculating HDI, they never actually did it in practice. The answer sheets were then exchanged, and participants evaluated each others\u2019 work based on the solutions provided.

Example: Some questions for analysing the theme of \u201cEmployment\u201d from a human development perspective \u2022 What are the links between employment/unemployment on the one hand and health and nutrition security on the other? Do the effects vary between adult workers and child workers? \u2022 Do the nature of employment and conditions of employment influence health? \u2022 How does employment status influence the ability to access knowledge? \u2022 Do the effects vary between adult workers and child workers? What about female workers? \u2022 How are employment situations linked to productivity and income? \u2022 Are there differences between short- and long-term effects (investing in education and training could postpone incomes but allow higher incomes at a later date)? \u2022 Does employment reduce poverty, and if so, how? \u2022 Are the effects the same for all sections of the population (e.g., children)? \u2022 How are wages relevant in assessing links between employment and poverty? \u2022 Do the linkages between employment and poverty have different implications for women and men? \u2022 Does the employment situation influence how empowered a person feels? \u2022 Is there a difference in the voice an employed and unemployed person has in society, and does employment determine whether their concerns are heard? \u2022 Does employment influence social status and dignity? In what ways? Are there differences within and outside the family? What are the similarities and differences that men and women face? The human development perspective can also be applied to specific groups, e.g. indigenous peoples. We can break down information under the following categories to examine implications of a development theme from a human development perspective: 19 2 This presentation is also available as a publication by the same title produced by APRI, UNDP-RCC, September 2005. \u2022 Sustainability \u2022 Equity \u2022 Empowerment \u2022 Productivity Using the Millennium Development Goals as an analytical tool also helps. For example, the following questions can be asked: \u2022 How and to what extent are the goals, targets and indicators affected? \u2022 Are there reverse linkages, i.e., do better human development conditions influence the achievement of the MDGs? Examining a Theme from an HD Perspective \u2022 This is a short tool to facilitate exploring a theme from an HD perspective. It can be modified to customise the theme under consideration, inserting local specifications and priorities. \u2022 It helps focus thinking and identify possible causes, consequences and indicators. \u2022 It has a column on governance to facilitate flagging policies to address particular challenges. hD DimenSion (capturing sustainability, equity, empowerment, productivity aspects) Causes, Consequences (positive and negative) possible indicators governance: policies, Strategies at the national, regional, and global levels 1 Long, healthy life and nutrition security 2 Access to knowledge 3 Productivity, growth 4 Poverty reduction, employment, equity oriented growth 5 Gender 6 Empowerment, right to participate, human rights and freedom 7 Sustainability \u2013 environmental, intergenerational Table 3 - Table for Examining a Theme from an HD Perspective 20 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3rd HD Capacity Development Workshop, Colombo, 27-29 September 2005 APRI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo (www.undprcc.lk) Contact : asiapacific.hdrmdg@undp.org (b) hiv/aiDS and human development Catlin wiesen, advisor, hiv/aiDS, unDp-BDp The alarming statistics on the spread of HIV across the world and the challenge it poses for the world, especially poor countries of Africa and Asia were presented and summarized.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc2d6912-b9e9-43ab-8c02-4aa508947c9d": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc2d6912-b9e9-43ab-8c02-4aa508947c9d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/some-challenges-human-development-concepts-measures-analysis-reporting-and-advocacy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Some challenges in Human Development: Concepts, Measures, Analysis, Reporting and Advocacy", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/some-challenges-human-development-concepts-measures-analysis-reporting-and-advocacy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ff94835dc3fba1c401584985ddd116ecbedee4f272848b2298a78fcdb4900d78"}, "2": {"node_id": "b2c1561f-464f-4582-b971-031e52d175f9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/some-challenges-human-development-concepts-measures-analysis-reporting-and-advocacy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6c0e8d4cb316674b9e87351e2d1f1bf6fb4467a3cee31debc8586b7ceeec680a"}}, "hash": "52c83da44e57a0fe6b2d361ba2aa087264807f0b75f1e2b7936342de6985aab3", "text": "hiv/aiDS and human Development: more than a health issue - Every minute, one person in Asia dies of an AIDS-related illness. - In the 1 hour we talk, there will be 600 new infections, all preventable through human actions. - Every 6 seconds, someone becomes HIV positive. - 60% of teachers in Zambia are HIV positive. - 30-35% of HIV-positive women are in Asia.

Therefore it requires a variety of responses to address these different aspects. Most responses so far have focused on health aspects. While this is important, it is also necessary to put into place responses that address the social, cultural and economic factors at the community and societal level that fuel the pandemic and its effects on the human condition of the affected population. It was pointed out that in 1991 more than 80% of new infections were through commercial sex workers. However, a successful condom campaign has reduced this to 15%. Tools and instruments of UNDP have a major role in advocating shifts in responses. The MDG report in Thailand can be used as a best practice case. During the floor discussions, several issues and concerns were voiced. Participants agreed that HIV/AIDS has adverse consequences for human development. \u2022 It was felt that the issue of controlling the spread of this disease was not just about prevention (i.e., condom use, not sharing syringes, etc.). For example, in South Asia, women are often not in a strong bargaining position and the capacity of women to negotiate the use of condoms is highly limited and poses a serious constraint. It is difficult for a commercial sex worker to demand that her client use a condom when he refuses. Similarly, it is seen as irregular or a disrespect for a wife to demand that her husband use condoms. Is the school system geared to address this issue through sex education? The consequences of single-sex schools was also questioned. \u2022 Role of TRIPS: The lack of support from GFTAM and WTO in formulations of medicines and the use of TRIPS as a basis for undermining the right of people to access drugs have serious consequences. Some of the gains from intellectual property are threatened by free- trade agreements. So, developing countries need to carefully weigh their options. \u2022 Do we need to concentrate on changing people's lifestyles or focus on managing the disease? Seen through a human development lens, we need to go beyond prevention of the disease and concentrate on lifestyle and the choices that people exercise. \u2022 Women are more vulnerable to AIDS due to biological reasons. \u2022 Silent spread of the disease: The most dangerous aspect of AIDS is that it spreads silently over a period of time. For example, though Mongolia has a low HIV prevalence rate, it is in a dangerous position since it has a high HIV risk rate. \u2022 Property ownership is one way to increase the say of women. In India, we\u2019ve seen that women are less prone to violence by a factor of 60 if they own property. 22 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3rd HD Capacity Development Workshop, Colombo, 27-29 September 2005 APRI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo (www.undprcc.lk) Contact : asiapacific.hdrmdg@undp.org Session v 3.2 Cross-Cutting issue: gender and human Development roohi metcalfe, programme Specialist, apgmp, unDp-rCB The presentation discussed the importance of gender mainstreaming in the development process.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b73ff3e5-be3b-4e0a-a675-f72e86b31a0f": {"__data__": {"id_": "b73ff3e5-be3b-4e0a-a675-f72e86b31a0f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/some-challenges-human-development-concepts-measures-analysis-reporting-and-advocacy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Some challenges in Human Development: Concepts, Measures, Analysis, Reporting and Advocacy", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/some-challenges-human-development-concepts-measures-analysis-reporting-and-advocacy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "33f559bc4b506e2a1afb560ead76083dc9c7e2d3cbc39027049c6a49f6257a43"}, "2": {"node_id": "6cc911d6-3d3c-4967-aada-2fa790ecb000", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/some-challenges-human-development-concepts-measures-analysis-reporting-and-advocacy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e4edd34d76b3193e81b997a19e5d286fea177297ab930eff5e198ddf5447d415"}}, "hash": "dc430321e426ee16d77a6259daefeb84aa868556f67939e4d01b7b32c37682b4", "text": "Gender mainstreaming calls for positive action at different levels: \u2022 Policy level: to ensure that the issue of gender equality becomes a visible and central concern in programming and planning \u2022 Programme level: to ensure that all energy interventions create opportunities for women\u2019s empowerment and facilitate gender equality \u2022 Organizational level: to ensure that space and opportunities for learning, growth and contributing to organizational goals are created equally for women and men at all", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "86caef32-43c1-451e-bf81-a1f69fa8251c": {"__data__": {"id_": "86caef32-43c1-451e-bf81-a1f69fa8251c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/some-challenges-human-development-concepts-measures-analysis-reporting-and-advocacy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Some challenges in Human Development: Concepts, Measures, Analysis, Reporting and Advocacy", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/some-challenges-human-development-concepts-measures-analysis-reporting-and-advocacy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9a58d93a8d4eae09f3094344ad15d78d4068debfce1e4a484076eb5887d49508"}}, "hash": "9a58d93a8d4eae09f3094344ad15d78d4068debfce1e4a484076eb5887d49508", "text": "levels Gender indicators are standards to measure changes in the status and role of women and men, based on the progress towards gender equality and equity. Two powerful gender indicators are GDI and GEM. Gender Development Index (GDI) adjusts average achievement to reflect the inequalities between women and men. The Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM) focuses on women\u2019s opportunities rather than capabilities. It captures gender inequalities in political participation and decision-making power (% share of seats in parliament), economic participation and decision- making power (% in employment (a) legislators and senior officials, (b) professional and technical positions), and power over economic resources (estimated earned income). The successful steps taken by the Ministry of Finance in Pakistan in the area of Gender Responsive Budgeting was also discussed where all key ministries in Pakistan now have gender initiatives. Strongly emphasis was made on the need to look at gender issues beyond empowering women. There is an equal need to sensitize men so that they can be partners in promoting the cause of equality for women. Participants wanted to know how they could undertake the process of gender responsive budgeting in their own countries. These were some issues raised during floor discussions and certain clarifications were sought on: \u2022 Clarity on definition of participation \u2022 How gender could be used as an analytical tool \u2022 Role of UNIFEM and UNDP: To what extent do the projects of the two programmes coincide and overlap? UNIFEM has done a lot of work in the area of gender. It would be useful to collate information on similar programs. \u2022 Political debates on gender issues: Representation of women in parliament does not ensure that women\u2019s issues are debated and discussed. Is there a need to look beyond political participation and concentrate on capacity building at the household level? \u2022 Social audit can be used as a tool to rate results of gender education. Data is important to justify interventions. \u2022 Political commitment is imperative in the process of gender mainstreaming. 23 \u2022 Best practices in gender: Questions were raised about best practices to integrate gender into HDRs. At the same time, it was felt that there cannot be any best practices in an issue like gender as it is subjective and deeply rooted in culture and traditions. So, countries need to look at specific interventions depending on the circumstances. \u2022 Gender is a cross-cutting issue \u2013 problems need to be addressed in a multi-dimensional manner to make concrete policy options. \u2022 A female participant raised the question of the extent to which gender can be discussed/ pursued. She felt that women in some developed countries were forgoing their traditional roles for careers. For example, women were starting families at a late age or not having families at all. Would this be considered gender equality? The presenter said that it was ultimately a question of women's choices and the need for society to recognize and respect these choices. This was followed by a launch of the document: En Route to Equality.

For this, outreach, communication, marketing and monitoring results are important. It was in this context that presentations were made by journalists. (a) pamela philipose, Journalist, the indian express The presentation was on the important role of the media in society. It provides the vital link in a democratic process through which people acquire information, form opinions and respond as members of a nation. In the context of HDRs, the process tends to wind down very rapidly once the report is released. Though HDRs continue to be an important source of information for academics, economists, social activists and policy makers, it does not get much attention in the media after its release. She felt that this was not encouraging, as HDRs are \u201cTake Action\u201d reports rather than just \u201cTake Note\u201d reports. So the question is: Can HDRs be used more effectively in post-release advocacy, dissemination and follow-up? Based on observation and experience, steps in distinct phases need to be taken: \u2022 First phase: necessary to have \u201cbuild up\u201d material \u2022 Second phase: need to increase news alerts and use simple language in the report \u2022 Third phase (usually neglected): Most post-launch initiatives focus on generating opinion among experts. There is scope for expanding the interaction with the media by linking HDRs to emerging themes. \u2022 Outreach programs, like taking HDRs to schools and colleges, are an excellent way to keep the themes alive and give more story ideas to the media. \u2022 Final note: Media organizations are not the monolithic edifice they appear to be from the outside. They function at various levels, and this should be recognized by all. (b) manori wijesekera, regional programme officer, tve-ap Writing articles as \u201cstories\u201d in capturing the attention of the media and the need to put across clear and concise messages is important. These stories need to be realistic and not always lumped with MDGs. They shouldn\u2019t be promoting an agenda. Journalists often don\u2019t want to be seen as being on the side of development agencies. Tabloids are the best way to put across ideas. A good story has the following elements: news, truth and interest. Keep the story simple, avoiding jargon and acronyms. The use of metaphors from popular culture and localised information also attracts attention. The following are some suggestions to make HDRs more attractive: \u2022 Make a video capturing the highlights of HDRs (A short film developed by TVE on the MDGs was shown.) \u2022 Put a human face to huge amounts of statistics \u2022 Personalize stories by putting names to characters to spread messages \u2022 Present the audience with not only problems but also solutions \u2022 Bring macro data close to individuals, families and communities 26 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3rd HD Capacity Development Workshop, Colombo, 27-29 September 2005 APRI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo (www.undprcc.lk) Contact : asiapacific.hdrmdg@undp.org example: Global Village If we shrink Earth\u2019s population to a village of precisely 100 people, with all existing human ratios remaining unchanged, it would look like this: \u2022 57 Asians \u2022 21 Europeans \u2022 14 from Americas and Australia \u2022 8 Africans \u2022 52 female and 48 males \u2022 70 non-white and 30 white (c) S. pannerselvan, Director, panos institute, Sri lanka A set of considerations for UNDP that are needed to be borne in mind when engaging with the media to publicize HDRs was presented.

This includes the use of strong graphics to reinforce the text \u2013 tables, pie-charts, maps, bar charts, line graphics, diagrams, text boxes and chapter dividers. \u2022 Interactive technologies: How to add value. These include web-based options, interactive databases and data animation.

Examples include 1993, 1995 and 1996 HDRs. 2. Nationally and locally relevant themes: NHDRs should cover themes that are important locally after careful selection and examination of issues.

Need to put money into data collection: UNDP should fund data collection to ensure quality and periodicity. (b) Bhutan Country experience ilona leskinen, unDp, Bhutan The distinguishing features of the Bhutanese NHDR was presented. The country\u2019s first NHDR, \u201cgross national happiness and human Development,\u201d was published in 2000. This was the first time in the world that the concept of happiness was included as an indicator of HD. Though this seems to be an empty concept, there are attempts to make it operational. The second HDR was on youth and employment and was very effective. An index of health was introduced in the report, and this led to the banning of tobacco in the country. In the interactive session after this presentation, participants questioned the relevance and scope of including \u201chappiness\u201d in the HD index. Several issues and concerns were raised: \u2022 Stability of concept: How do you measure happiness? This would vary at different periods of time and many times during a day. \u2022 Localized indicators: Countries should be encouraged to include concepts relevant to them in the calculation of human development. \u2022 Poverty Line in Bhutan: The presenter pointed out that UNDP was criticised for defining poverty in 2001. This changed the self-perception of the people. Bhutan\u2019s ideology is to not tie development with income levels. Poverty was officially recognized in Bhutan in 2001. \u2022 HDRs should give choices to the government. \u2022 The role of democracy in bringing out HDRs and in promoting freedom of expression through these reports was questioned. 33 \u2022 Though the reports are written along one main theme, they need to present a holistic picture of development and all indicators of development need to be looked at. \u2022 The single theme should be explained in the first chapter. This should be finalized after discussions with the government, NGOs, stakeholders and academicians. There should be a conceptual chapter that would outline complexities and inter-linkages. \u2022 Non-democracy does not necessarily rule out good policies. For example, China is promoting a coordinated policy in five areas. The HDR process in China has been participatory. 34 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3rd HD Capacity Development Workshop, Colombo, 27-29 September 2005 APRI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo (www.undprcc.lk) Contact : asiapacific.hdrmdg@undp.org Session iX 4.2 good practices in ownership and independence of analysis (a) Sharmila kurukulasuriya National ownership is attained through a process that draws on national and regional actors and capabilities throughout the preparation, yielding a product firmly grounded in the country\u2019s past and existing development plans.

(c) myanmar experience Sharing hla phyu Chit, programme Specialist, pro-poor policies, unDp-rCC Some important aspects and facts on Myanmar\u2019s human development were presented and discussed. \u2022 Data: Scarcity of reliable data \u2022 Sensitivities: UNDP\u2019s mandate in Myanmar started in 1993. It works at the grassroots levels. There are no capacity building projects. There is no help from the government in the preparation of HDRs. \u2022 Ownership: In preparing HDRs, the government is not involved at any level. Mostly, UNDP has used its own data or private survey data. \u2022 Message: The most important message is that of human rights, which has been a taboo subject until now. \u2022 HDRs have not been officially launched but privately distributed. The floor discussions after this session raised some concerns and questions: \u2022 The choice of national consultant vs. international consultant depends on the capacity of individual countries and that is true with Myanmar. Preferably, consultants should be national as they would be aptly able to capture domestic problems. \u2022 MDGR vs. HDR: MDGRs are annual documents and contain more factual description. HDRs are shorter and meant for advocacy purposes. MDGRs need to cover data on all 48 indicators. HDRs, on the other hand, are more analytical and mainly theme-based. \u2022 It was noted that Myanmar and the Philippines are two extreme examples. In the latter, all standard methods of HDRs have been followed, while in Myanmar, no corporate policies were followed. While best practices can be listed, countries need to adopt their own methods, keeping in view socio-economic circumstances. \u2022 Impact of HDRs in Pakistan has been impressive. For example, government has set up a National Commission for HD. It collects data for health and education. The Prime Minister of Pakistan has made it mandatory for each minister to come up with an indicator for each ministry. In 2005, provincial development forums started. \u2022 Government of India has also laid out India Development Goals in its 10th Plan. These are more optimistic than MDGs. \u2022 Are the concepts of ownership and independence consistent, and how do they affect advocacy? \u2022 HDRs are not necessarily grounded in national development plans, but it is important to use HDRs to analyse the concerns and priorities of the country. 36 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3rd HD Capacity Development Workshop, Colombo, 27-29 September 2005 APRI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo (www.undprcc.lk) Contact : asiapacific.hdrmdg@undp.org lunch Session pro-poor macroeconomic policies - relevance for human Development t. palanivel, policy Coordinator and advisor, pro-poor policies, unDp-rCC Macroeconomic policies in human development are extremely important. The policies have direct and indirect impact on HD. Governments can use instruments of monetary and fiscal policies to bring out improvements in quality of life. Though these policies can be used to attain development goals, they may not be sufficient, and the need for targeted policy interventions may arise. The results of an initial study by the Regional Programme on the Macroeconomics of Poverty Reduction were presented. The program was launched in 2002 to offer practical policy options and develop national capacity for \u2018pro-poor\u2019 growth. It has been endorsed by 19 Asia-Pacific countries. The programme has, so far, prepared and published seven country case studies. Regional syntheses are being finalized on six major macroeconomic policies. The main findings of the study are the following: \u2022 On balance, macroeconomic policies do not seem to have been pro-poor in Asia and the Pacific. \u2022 Key macroeconomic determinants of pro-poor growth in Asia-Pacific are employment generation, agricultural growth and export growth. \u2022 Stronger pro-poor macroeconomic policies are needed to achieve MDGs, especially in South Asia. \u2022 Given a low inflation rate, there is scope now for expansionary fiscal policies in the form of higher public investment, expansionary monetary policies to sustain the recent fall in interest rates, and exchange rate policies to prevent real appreciation of currency.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d305e9bc-3e3a-4061-ba13-249b37606c50": {"__data__": {"id_": "d305e9bc-3e3a-4061-ba13-249b37606c50", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/some-challenges-human-development-concepts-measures-analysis-reporting-and-advocacy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Some challenges in Human Development: Concepts, Measures, Analysis, Reporting and Advocacy", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/some-challenges-human-development-concepts-measures-analysis-reporting-and-advocacy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "90e1acffa9aa4d9e7cbf082f4d0c6bc16cfd2c6f578132e26de5fdb60e7ea6c1"}, "2": {"node_id": "77895028-6c9e-4b3b-8005-ccf86c82dca9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/some-challenges-human-development-concepts-measures-analysis-reporting-and-advocacy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a21f1ea7ec429780efcdaf09c96b6debfc34b28a112eb769cae113c796e8b671"}}, "hash": "6579f046df65d3004e6d29d249dc48c67a1655ec09a440524c0c785dab27e52f", "text": "\u2022 Agricultural growth can be increased through diversification into labour-intensive, high- value crops, improved marketing and storage facilities and better rural credit access for small and marginal farmers. \u2022 Employment opportunities can be increased through promotion of SMEs, improved credit access for self-employed entrepreneurs, and strong labour laws (minimum wages) and social security systems. 37 Session X 4.3 national human Development reports \u2013 impact and Follow-up Chair: manoj Basnyat, unDp-rCC (a) nhDr preparation, impact and Follow-up Sharmila kurukulauriya HDRs have been instrumental in bringing about changes in development practices and outlooks.

Some of the effects of HDR recommendations across countries include: \u2022 Civil society campaigns established \u2022 HD curricula adopted \u2022 Increased donor funding targeting human development priorities \u2022 Prominent media coverage on human development issues \u2022 Institutional reforms \u2022 Demand for human development data \u2022 Budget allocations prioritise HD initiatives \u2022 National policies revised to reflect the needs of the poorest \u2022 What are some inspirational examples? Some of the best examples of HDRs in terms of inspirational messages and impacts are the following: \u2022 Increased demand for HD: The impact of Afghanistan HDR 2004, \u201cSecurity with a Human Face,\u201d was the accumulation of a statistical database and creation of infrastructure. Jordan HDR 2004, \u201cBuilding Sustainable Livelihoods,\u201d led to the targeted support of Zarqa Governorate, the poorest urban area in the country. \u2022 Budget allocations to prioritize HD initiatives: Egypt HDR 2003, \u201cLocal Participatory Development,\u201d and Argentina HDR 2002, \u201cContributions to HD,\u201d have led to higher allocations for health and education. \u2022 National policies/strategies were revised to reflect the needs of the poor, as seen with Tanzania HDR 2002, \u201cPoverty and HD,\u201d and Zimbabwe HDR 2003. \u2022 How can we assess the impact of HDRs? The following measures can be used as gauges: \u2022 Identify indicators of success in reaching the target audience. \u2022 Develop a method to survey feedback from the target audience. \u2022 Devise a matrix to record information and the impact of the HDR. \u2022 Monitor the HDR\u2019s influence on policies, plans, budget allocations, curricula, etc. \u2022 Convene six- and 12-month review meetings. 38 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3rd HD Capacity Development Workshop, Colombo, 27-29 September 2005 APRI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo (www.undprcc.lk) Contact : asiapacific.hdrmdg@undp.org (b) mongolia experience Sharing naranchimeg nanjid, purvee Byambadorj and ms. ganghuywag uyanga, economist, programme officer, unDp mongolia. Mongolia saw a rapid and radical shift from a planned economy to an open-market economy in Mongolia in 1990, and this had adverse consequences on income inequalities. The government has followed rapid industrialization, and large quantities of aid have come in from Japan, the U.S. and Germany. These countries have had a strong influence on the domestic policies of Mongolia. Many policies of development have been charted out, but economic growth has been given the highest priority at all costs. The main strengths and weaknesses in Mongolia are the following: Strengths: \u2022 Democracy and growing participation \u2022 High level of education \u2022 No gender discrimination (but gender-related problems) Weaknesses \u2022 Jobless, futureless, rootless, ruthless growth \u2022 Poverty \u2022 Vulnerability \u2022 Inequalities and disparities \u2022 Lack of sustainability HD Course: An HD course manual has been developed to sensitize people and give them an opportunity to learn about various aspects of HD. The main vision in setting this up was to build long-term and in-depth capacity for policy making from the Human Development perspective and ensure genuine integration of economic, social and environmentally sound development concerns.

Process: The HDR was prepared jointly by the UN and the Planning and Budget Organization (PBO) within the government. It was a participatory exercise that also included NGOs, civil society and academia. Approach: The preparation of the HDR was a participatory and inclusive process. Groups developed, and work was assigned to each of them. International consultants were recruited to finalize the product. The launch and dissemination, including a seminar, was conducted by PBO. Impact: The report had tremendous impact and made significant gains in spreading HD awareness: \u2022 It was widely distributed and accepted. \u2022 The report enabled identification of new areas for UNDP support. \u2022 It inaugurated a new public interest in HD concepts, analysis and approach; training workshops on HDI were conducted in universities, the government and NGO communities. \u2022 The report\u2019s findings enabled the establishment of a poverty alleviation unit within UNDP Iran and the launch of Area-Based Development Program. Lessons: Some important lessons were learnt from the preparation of HDRs: \u2022 An independent institution needs to be established (Human Development Centre). \u2022 UNDP should maintain a visible and solid coordinating role in the development of NHDR. \u2022 While NHDR should encourage inclusiveness, the process should not be commissioned to the government. 40 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3rd HD Capacity Development Workshop, Colombo, 27-29 September 2005 APRI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo (www.undprcc.lk) Contact : asiapacific.hdrmdg@undp.org \u2022 The project should be closely monitored. \u2022 Transparency and accountability should be encouraged. Though the first HDR was a success, Iran has not been able to bring out the second one and the process has been stalled for the last four years due to lack of interest and change in management. The participant from Iran sought suggestions from the floor regarding steps that could be taken to move ahead. (b) multiple reporting: hDrs, mDgrs and prSps Sriram pande, arr-poverty, unDp nepal In many countries, there are various agencies that bring out reports. HDRs, MDGRs and government plans are a few such examples. Instead of many reports, it would be better to have one consolidated report. However, each report has its own relevance. HDI is used in Nepal to allocate resources at the district level. HDRs are also an important reference in the preparation of government plans. Similarly, NHDRs chart progress and identify challenges that confront the economy. Different reports have opened space for participation. This has put pivotal issues in the centre stage, leading to debates. Finally, though each of these reports has its significance and adds value, the reports should ultimately all converge. The session was rich in terms of the varying country experiences that were presented by participants. This showed the immense popularity and acceptance of HDRs across countries. Human development is now an accepted goal of any development plan. The floor discussions raised some questions and concerns: \u2022 Public-private partnership: UNDP India has worked on a program with the Tata Group in the area of livelihood. The corporate house had a model of development and approached the UNDP India office for assistance on human development indicators. The business-expense model worked at three levels: systems level, people level and program level. This shows the crucial role the private sector can play in the sphere of development. National and international agencies should have a more open approach towards the private sector. \u2022 In Mongolia, the private sector has grown from 0% to 75% in a decade. However, some wondered whether too much attention was paid to the private sector. \u2022 Seasonality effect on poverty: Responding to the observation of changed poverty ratios in Mongolia due to changing seasons, some wondered what the ratios were like. Participants also enquired about the effect of harsh winters on infant-mortality and child-mortality rates. The presenter clarified that consumption increased in winters, so poverty was not as severe. Mortality rates were higher for areas that were far off from hospitals. \u2022 \u201cAll Countries have Bihar\u201d: It was pointed out that all countries have areas that continuously lag behind in development indicators.

Development Workshop, Colombo, 27-29 September 2005 APRI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo (www.undprcc.lk) Contact : asiapacific.hdrmdg@undp.org 4.5 Concluding session Facilitator: ms. anuradha rajivan Feedbacks from participants were sought, though a feedback form, to suggest ways in which the workshop could be improved in future. Participants were also requested to suggest possible themes for the next RHDR and to enumerate the priorities and challenges that confront the region. This was followed by a short film produced by UNDP and UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific. The film, \u201cVoices of the LDCs of Asia and the Pacific,\u201d was about the problems and constraints in the LDCs of the region. Asia-Pacific has 14 LDCs. The film showcased the lives of the millions of poor people in these countries. It drew attention to the possible effects of the abolition of textile quotas on these LDCs. It also emphasized the need for South-South Cooperation. The main message for the international community was to pay special attention to the poor LDCs in this dynamic region. The Deputy Regional Manager thanked everyone for their enthusiastic participation and encouraging response and also gave credit to all those who worked behind the scenes to make the workshop a success. Evaluation, Feedback and Future Directions The last part of the concluding session was devoted to seek participants\u2019 feedback on ways to improve focus areas of APRI for the coming year. Participants filled in evaluation forms and were asked to provide information on what they learnt from the workshop and what they contributed to it. Critical Development Themes The participants named the following areas as critical themes relevant to their respective countries: \u2022 Power and oil issues \u2022 Landlocked area problems \u2022 Transition process to market economy \u2022 Political issues like conflict, corruption and lack of freedom \u2022 Poverty and inequality \u2022 Water supply and sanitation issues \u2022 Environment issues themes for apri APRI supports the preparation of Regional HDRs and policy briefs. Participants suggested the following areas of focus: \u2022 Resources like water \u2022 Issues relating to women and the less advantaged, like empowerment issues \u2022 Cross-border issues of migration \u2022 Political issues like corruption and conflict \u2022 Environment and sanitation issues \u2022 Micro-credit \u2022 Health issues of HIV/AIDS \u2022 Communications 45 Learning from the Workshop Most participants felt that the workshop was an enriching and highly educational platform. The most interesting parts of the workshop were the following: \u2022 HDI indexing exercise: Useful explanation of the concept of human development. The HDI calculation exercise was thought to be most useful. This was the first time the majority of participants actually calculated HDI. \u2022 The session on the concepts of GDI and GEM were also appreciated by most. \u2022 Country experience sharing sessions provided a good learning opportunity for the participants. Workshop Evaluation The participants were asked to rate sessions and the overall workshop on a scale from 1 to 5, 1 being the worst and 5 being the best. The following chart shows the average ratings for the sessions: Average Ratings 4 4 5 4.5 3 3 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 HD Concept Mapping & Measurement HDI exercise Analysis from HD lens Gender in HD Good practices in advocacy Presentation Ownership & dissemination NHDR & follow up Multiple reporting Experience sharing Short films OVERALL Sessions Ratings Figure 1 \u2013 Workshop evaluation results Participants felt that their understanding of human development was clearer.

Context Since the inception of the first global HDR in 1990, the human development approach has increasingly become the overarching framework for all UNDP activities. Human development involves enlarging people\u2019s choices so that they can develop their full potential and lead productive, creative lives according to their capabilities and interests. Fundamental to enlarging these choices is the process of building human capabilities, including those relating to a healthy life, access to resources needed for a decent standard of living and the ability to participate in the life of the community. The human development approach contributes to UNDP\u2019s mission to help people build better lives and find solutions to global and national developmental challenges through knowledge and experience. UNDP works towards promoting human development through its five practice areas: democratic governance, poverty reduction, crisis prevention and recovery, energy and environment, and HIV/AIDS. As UNDP\u2019s signature advocacy tools, HDRs have contributed to redefining the approach to development. According to UNDP Administrator Kemal Dervis, HDRs have also helped in \u201cbuilding strong bridges between the donor community and activist civil society.\u201d 50 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3rd HD Capacity Development Workshop, Colombo, 27-29 September 2005 APRI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo (www.undprcc.lk) Contact : asiapacific.hdrmdg@undp.org One of the key objectives of the Asia Pacific RHDR Initiative (APRI), which is based in the Regional Centre in Colombo (RCC) and is part of the Poverty Practice, is to support capacity strengthening on human development and the preparation of National HDRs (NHDRs). The response to previous capacity development workshops has been very encouraging, providing impetus for a yearly workshop on the subject. 2. objectives of the hD Capacity Development workshop The Asia Pacific RHDR Initiative (APRI), a regional programme in the MDG-HDR Cluster, plans to hold this HD capacity development workshop for UNDP country offices in the region, government officials and research institutions. The objectives of the workshop include the following: \u2022 Strengthening the understanding of human development: theory, applications and limitations \u2022 Strengthening skills in mapping and measuring human development: indicators and indices, including their strengths and limitations \u2022 Case study: how HDRs can draw upon and feed into UNDP's other programme work (e.g. Thailand) to ensure that opportunities are not lost \u2022 Sharing experiences and lessons: best practices and pitfalls to avoid (from Country Office experience) \u2022 Strengthening the capacity to manage NHDRs: preparation, process and follow-up \u2022 Strengthening the capacity for communication, advocacy, dissemination and a media strategy 3. previous hD Capacity Development workshops The first regional workshop, organized by APRI, \u201cPotentials and Challenges in Human Development Reporting: Operationalising Regional and National HDRs in Policies and Programmes,\u201d was held between 24-26 September 2003 in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Thirty participants attended it from 15 UNDP country offices in Asia and the Pacific: Afghanistan, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, East Timor, Republic of Korea, Laos, Malaysia, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Philippines, Samoa, Sri Lanka and Thailand. Other participants included government representatives from three countries, Bhutan, Cambodia and Sri Lanka, as well as representatives from research institutions involved in the production of HDRs from Samoa, Republic of Korea and Sri Lanka.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3bacff66-2b86-400e-8de4-f968c3faaf5e": {"__data__": {"id_": "3bacff66-2b86-400e-8de4-f968c3faaf5e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/some-challenges-human-development-concepts-measures-analysis-reporting-and-advocacy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Some challenges in Human Development: Concepts, Measures, Analysis, Reporting and Advocacy", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/some-challenges-human-development-concepts-measures-analysis-reporting-and-advocacy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4d82ef3a466adb2e4848f95a83bc50493938e32246c5fbab2fa33635eac33874"}, "2": {"node_id": "ae504800-adb3-489d-a2c9-3c0cec2d7377", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/some-challenges-human-development-concepts-measures-analysis-reporting-and-advocacy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f8ba6c7d68ef2f498e74fe9273463c84a8ce54460a36404e2d41592165233e68"}}, "hash": "e71679cece3a0a8f4aabd9ceaf91eb5b3b4cef7190cfba1e7d5142a2a224600a", "text": "A multi-disciplinary team of resource persons from the RBAP, the Human Development Report Office in New York, Sub-Regional Resource Facility (SURF) Kathmandu, UNDP\u2019s Oslo Governance Centre, UNDP Colombia and other experts served as resource persons for the workshop.

Over the years, both National and Regional HDRs have developed niches in their respective domains. While National HDRs reflect specific country contexts, priorities and aspirations, Regional HDRs go beyond national boundaries to 51 highlight multi-country, regional issues and/or issues that are too sensitive to be addressed at the national level. While both types of reports address emerging concerns, national reports have an inherently stronger \u201cownership,\u201d while regional reports have relatively stronger \u201cindependence.\u201d What makes these HDRs distinct from the other documents is that they are a culmination of inclusive, stakeholder-based consultations that help to build consensus among parties with vested interest in the issues. These HDRs thus have a strong advocacy potential. Realising the importance of a participatory and inclusive process, this aspect has been included as one of the basic principles of UNDP Corporate Policy on NHDRs. Though regional and national HDRs are different in their choice of themes, address different issues and have overlapping stakeholders, the basic principles common to both are the following: \u2022 Independence of analysis \u2022 Quality of analysis \u2022 Participatory and inclusive preparation \u2022 Flexibility and creativity in presentation \u2022 Sustained follow-up About 475 national and sub-national HDRs and 24 regional HDRs have been produced across the globe since 1990. However, the challenge of conforming to the above principles still remains. Each HDR is based on a different set-up, addresses different themes and uses different tools for analysis. Some of these HDRs have lived up to these principles and are remembered as a landmark in the field of human development. Others, despite the most sincere efforts, have not been able to match these standards. The challenge is thus to make each HDR unique and effective without compromising the basic principles. 5. third hD Capacity Development workshop, 27-29 September 2005 This workshop has been designed for the staff of UNDP Country Offices, national institutions, government representatives and national researchers who are actively involved in the preparation of NHDRs, and often take the lead, with UNDP supporting the process. It will draw upon the experience gained and valuable feedback received from the previous workshops and inputs from participants. The theme for this workshop is \u201cSome Challenges in Human Development: Concepts, Measures, Analysis, Reporting and Advocacy.\u201d Specifically, the workshop will address the following areas: \u2022 HD Concepts \u2022 Brief history of the evolution of development thinking \u2022 Human development \u2013 what it is and what it is not \u2022 The value-added that the HD perspective brings \u2022 Experience sharing \u2022 HD Measures \u2022 Other measures of development: strength and weaknesses \u2022 Measures of HD and other associated measures developed by UNDP (e.g.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6331c6a9-193c-4701-bd1a-d8a94b19ee1e": {"__data__": {"id_": "6331c6a9-193c-4701-bd1a-d8a94b19ee1e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/some-challenges-human-development-concepts-measures-analysis-reporting-and-advocacy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Some challenges in Human Development: Concepts, Measures, Analysis, Reporting and Advocacy", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/some-challenges-human-development-concepts-measures-analysis-reporting-and-advocacy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "833d4e02048362819ca6803a02b9e74bef37ebcbc5081fe50aeadf021a0fe492"}, "2": {"node_id": "e2c08b2b-06c1-4d3e-b5ad-a79a9ef9ded7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/some-challenges-human-development-concepts-measures-analysis-reporting-and-advocacy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "974bbcacc6eea0f54972c37769a55e0d8a154164365a73206951837a550cb548"}}, "hash": "df17158f72822e4b57fccd7680b98bedd811e0b604694630625f2d9ad299e790", "text": "HDI, HPI, GDI, GEM ICT for HD) \u2013 strengths and weaknesses \u2022 Indicators and indexing 52 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3rd HD Capacity Development Workshop, Colombo, 27-29 September 2005 APRI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo (www.undprcc.lk) Contact : asiapacific.hdrmdg@undp.org \u2022 Data related issues \u2022 Exercises \u2022 Experience sharing \u2022 HD Analysis \u2022 Analysing a theme from a human development perspective \u2013 contrasting the study of a theme as an issue versus examining it from a human development lens \u2022 Thematic analysis \u2013 HIV/AIDS (and possibly another issue as identified on the spot by participants) \u2022 Incorporating cross cutting issues \u2013 gender \u2022 Experience sharing \u2022 HDR Process and Reporting (including issues of complementarity versus overlap with MDGRs) \u2022 Principles and steps in NHDR preparation, including how to decide on a theme \u2022 Specific \u201chow to do\u201d sessions \u2022 Sharing perspectives of other stakeholders, such as governments and academic institutions \u2022 Illustrations of successful HD reporting \u2022 Presentations by UNDP Country Offices on past NHDRs and lessons learned from them \u2022 Stocktaking of the HDRs experience and the way forward \u2022 NHDRs and MDGRs \u2013 distinction, overlap and complementarity \u2022 Experience sharing \u2022 Advocacy and Dissemination \u2022 Illustrations of successful advocacy work \u2022 Identifying key partners in the advocacy and dissemination processes \u2022 Development of a model dissemination plan \u2022 Brainstorming of creative dissemination plans \u2022 Developing follow-up strategy for HDRs \u2022 Experience sharing 53 anneXure 2 agenDa regional centre in colombo 3rd regional Capacity development workshop Some Challenges in human Development: Concepts, measures, analysis reporting and advocacy 27-29 September 2005 Venue: Colombo Plaza Hotel time Day 1: tuesday, 27 September 2005 0900-09:30 Registration 0930 \u2013 1015 inaugural Session icebreaker/ participants\u2019 introduction opening address : Minh H.

In order to do this, the strategic review examines Thailand\u2019s development policy, the institutions in place to implement that policy and also the financing that is available for its implementation. 1) Policy Analysis The Royal Thai Government has two overarching statements of national policy: the Policy Statement of the Council of Ministers and the 11th National Economic and Social Development Plan. Both of these documents outline a number of areas where international cooperation will be used to meet Thailand\u2019s own development needs, including infrastructure, trade, green growth, foreign policy, security and human capital development. At the sector level, a number of ministries and agencies have also developed strategies on how international cooperation can contribute towards the achievement of their specific sector policy objectives. TICA has also developed a draft strategic framework on how international cooperation strategies can be used to more effectively contribute to development. Many of the strategies outlined are in keeping with latest international thinking on effective development cooperation. Bilaterally, it stresses that its support for development should be demand-led and based on principles of partnership.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5650d1d9-9e30-41fe-8bee-ca7011a6130c": {"__data__": {"id_": "5650d1d9-9e30-41fe-8bee-ca7011a6130c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategic-review-thailands-international-development-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strategic Review of Thailand\u2019s International Development Cooperation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategic-review-thailands-international-development-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "63264808665471a33d35a74ec7825d92da0a79f11d09313ad918f5af9f479f4b"}, "2": {"node_id": "2df7e737-c601-4235-baae-b8752edf4094", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategic-review-thailands-international-development-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "59cae1bdc466726a5d400968de12f7623abe3368b377058bc378e0d2ba103e4e"}}, "hash": "bcfb92f8ce156a04f6a529647220bcb36ef9045d11ffe71c2602d164d84cbdd0", "text": "Reference is made to the Paris Declaration on Effective Aid.

It is also important that Thailand comes to common agreement on the parameters of how it wishes to define its contribution to development. Although views differ on what constitutes \u2018international development cooperation\u2019 in Thailand, it is often understood in relatively narrow terms as aid that is provided to support countries less wealthy than Thailand. By focusing only on initiatives eligible to be recorded as aid, there is a risk that the government overlooks other international cooperation strategies that do not necessarily require the transfer of resources, but can serve to achieve its objectives on international development. This might include 5 influencing policy in partner countries based on Thailand\u2019s own knowledge of development, building regional consensus on development issues or facilitating knowledge exchange. Given Thailand\u2019s likely financial constraints in providing aid, these may be relatively cost effective alternatives to influencing international development. Thailand also risks underestimating its contribution to development in the region by understanding international development cooperation solely in terms of the size of aid provided. Both the public and private sectors in Thailand are already playing a significant role in the region\u2019s development through a much broader range of mechanisms, both financial (e.g. foreign investment and remittance flows) and non-financial (e.g. removal of tariffs for LDC imports) 2) Institutional Arrangements for Working with External Partners Bilateral Cooperation. Demands for Thailand\u2019s bilateral support emerge from a wide range of institutions. While this multi-layered relationship can potentially be a great strength in building strong relationships, there are very real risks that if support is uncoordinated that demands for cooperation may not be aligned to Thailand\u2019s capacity to effectively provide such support. Where support is uncoordinated, there is also a risk that the number of projects and areas of cooperation proliferates. Effective bilateral technical cooperation also depends upon long-term strategic engagement and planning. While for certain countries, technical cooperation might reasonably serve primarily as a tool of diplomacy, for key strategic partners there should be clear strategies in place as to how technical cooperation will meet the capacity needs of partners. Cooperation frameworks for policy advocacy. Cooperation frameworks are seen as an opportunity for Thailand to advocate and foster consensus on certain policy goals. As part of the ASEAN cooperation framework, for example, agreements will be put in place on trade liberalization policy, on financial integration and the movement of labour. At the international level, the Thai government is working closely with UNESCO in the education sector to promote \u2018Education for All\u2019 initiative. The effective use of cooperation framework depends upon having clearly articulated policy positions in line with the domestic policy agenda. Cooperation frameworks for knowledge exchange. Thailand is actively seeking to promote itself as a regional knowledge hub. If these ambitions are to gain support and recognition in an international development context, there is a need to understand what might be some of the skills and knowledge gaps constraining development in the region; what existing mechanism are in place to support regional knowledge exchange; where Thailand has the capacity, personnel and facilities to fill those gaps; what the international development community has learnt about effective peer-to-peer learning. International Organisations. Increasingly Thailand is partnering with international organisations in triangular frameworks to supplement the financial contributions of these organisations with its technical know-how and knowledge to share on its development successes and challenges. There are a number of examples of where Thailand is actively promoting its own goals for regional development and leveraging the resources of international organisations (both financial and technical) to support the achievements of these goals. At present, such initiatives are isolated and so there is a need to share learning of how such initiatives can be set up effectively. As demand for triangular cooperation grows, there may be 6 benefits in the government reviewing the strategic alignment of partners with Thailand\u2019s own international development objectives. Domestic Partnerships. Strengthening partnerships between government and other domestic stakeholders is viewed by the government as a key strategy to promote development. There are a number of existing examples where government has partnered with domestic organisations, for example national NGOs or private consultancy firms, to effectively promote its development cooperation agenda. Domestic development partners may also have specific skills that leave them better placed to provide technical support than the government.

This could be done through a new committee or building it into the mandate of an existing committee. Coordination of development finance and technical cooperation. At a country level, Thailand is not currently able to present and overall package of support being provided for development. By improving the exchange of information between NEDA, EXIM bank and TICA of planned aid commitments, the government would be better placed to present a unified package of support to country partners. Inter-ministerial Coordination. There is a recognition that international cooperation could be made considerably more effective by ensuring that the efforts of individual departments within ministries are better coordinated. The Ministry of Public Health has set up a committee on international cooperation with Directors General present from each department that could serve as a useful model. This type of committee have been used as a means to integrate strategies, share information and identify where greater value can be added through department working together. These committees are supported by bureaus for international cooperation acting as a secretariat. Recording Official Development Assistance (ODA). There is a perception within line agencies that existing reporting on ODA is primarily for external stakeholders rather than to inform government development policy. This impression is reinforced by the difficulty ministries face in accessing timely information. There is also a lack of clarity and agreement on what should be recorded as ODA. Focusing information management solely on financial contributions has the potential to underestimate Thailand\u2019s contribution to technical cooperation; as much of the support that Thailand provides for development cooperation is not directly financed by the Thai government. Further, the size of financing of activities does not necessarily equate to the impact those activities have and so consideration should be given recording outputs as well as inputs. The processes for recording ODA could also be clarified both between ministries and within ministries. Development Cooperation Learning and Knowledge Management. From the interviews conducted, it is clear that much experiential knowledge of international development cooperation exist, but no formal mechanisms with which to record and share that knowledge are available. 7 Monitoring and Evaluation. Similarly, TICA\u2019s strategic framework has emphasised the importance of putting in place monitoring and evaluation systems. While some monitoring systems are in place for investment projects financed through concessional loans, no formal mechanisms exist for the systematic capture of evaluation of technical cooperation programmes. 3) Financing Analysis Official Development Assistance (ODA) as a percentage of GDP is low and declining: in 2012, it was recorded as THB1.1 billion (USD37 million equivalent) which is approximately 0.01% of GDP. As a proportion, this is lower than certain middle-income countries (for example China and India), but consistent or higher than others (for example Malaysia, Argentina and Chile). In 2011, 42% was channelled towards international organisations, 31% for concessional loans and grants for infrastructure projects and 26% for technical cooperation. Support for technical cooperation crosses a wide number of sectors, but a larger share is utilized in social sectors with education, health and social development combined accounting for 48% of the technical cooperation funds. Lao PDR has received the largest share of bilateral funds as a result of continued support from NEDA for infrastructure projects. Foreign direct investment and remittance flows to Thailand\u2019s neighbours are considerably greater than ODA. As of 2011, Lao, Cambodia, Myanmar and Viet Nam received an estimated USD1,898 million in foreign direct investment, USD 394 million in remittance flows and USD 21 million in ODA. Government policies that affect the size and quality of foreign investment can influence foreign job creation and government revenues. Labour and migration policies that affect remittance flows can also affect household incomes in recipient countries. The national budget supports international development cooperation both through investments it provides to institutions such as NEDA and TICA responsible for administering a large part of the government\u2019s ODA, although there is no dedicated programme in the budget on \u2018international development cooperation as such\u2019. However, the budget does have a number of strategic priorities such as mobilizing foreign policy and international relations, the promotion of ASEAN integration and promoting regional transport and information connectivity, where domestic investments are part of efforts to support regional and international development with mutual benefits for both Thailand and its partners. 4) Key Recommendations Recommendations for setting the overall strategic direction of development cooperation \uf0b7 It is recommended that the Thai government develops a master-plan that articulates a common, government position on what its objectives are in the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "12298b50-5f4f-4a44-ad16-53c452ab79f7": {"__data__": {"id_": "12298b50-5f4f-4a44-ad16-53c452ab79f7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategic-review-thailands-international-development-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strategic Review of Thailand\u2019s International Development Cooperation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategic-review-thailands-international-development-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9a75b8f2a98ae017d9c1990afc2e2e392f091725c16e4aa3cb62bed7d023ca9c"}}, "hash": "9a75b8f2a98ae017d9c1990afc2e2e392f091725c16e4aa3cb62bed7d023ca9c", "text": "field of international development \uf0b7 Parameters should be agreed on what tools it wishes to consider with regard to the achievement of the goals set out in the master plan. Consideration should be given to looking beyond aid instruments. 8 \uf0b7 The master-plan should serve as a guide to support the prioritisation of technical cooperation in fewer, larger programmes. \uf0b7 The master-plan should then act as basis for o Developing sector-based strategic plans in key priority sectors o Developing country strategies for priority countries that outline opportunities where Thailand\u2019s own international development strategy is aligned to country needs. o Reviewing the alignment of international and domestic partners and Thailand\u2019s own strategy to identify priority partners for supporting the achievement of the development goals. \uf0b7 A situation analysis could also be undertaken that reviews how Thailand\u2019s ambitions to be a knowledge hub could address specific sector and country development priorities and the potential partners to support those ambitions. Recommendations for institutional structures and coordination \uf0b7 Consideration should be given to forming a cross-ministerial grouping to oversee the development and implementation of a cross-government international development policy. This could involve creating a new commission or building into the mandates of existing relevant committees (e.g. the Economic and Technical Cooperation Committee). \uf0b7 Large ministries would also benefit from similar commissions in order to support inter-ministerial policy coordination. \uf0b7 At a country-level, mechanisms could be put in place to better coordinate country strategies and plans for key partners. \uf0b7 If TICA is to ensure that proposed technical cooperation is aligned with the strategic priorities of ministries, then consideration should be given to identifying certain sector focal points who can liaise with relevant agencies. Recommendations for organisational capabilities and capacity There are a number of systems improvements that could be put in place relatively easily that would support improved effectiveness of existing programming. These include: Information management \uf0b7 Information should be exchanged on planned support for development cooperation from key agencies (e.g. NEDA, OHEC) as well as recording ODA retrospectively. This would lead to improved coordination and also enable Thailand to present a full package of coordinated support to partners. \uf0b7 The information received from ministries should be organized in such a way that it shows cross- government support for technical cooperation in sector-based and country-based reports to better communicate internally and with partners a \u2018whole-of-government\u2019 approach to development cooperation. 9 \uf0b7 Clear guidance should be developed on those activities that should be recorded in the database on development cooperation. This guidance should encourage recording more comprehensive information on the cooperation activities undertaken including triangular cooperation arrangements financed by third parties. \uf0b7 Focal points for information management should be identified in each ministry and a small number of specialists identified in TICA to support and train focal points on recording information. Monitoring and Evaluation \uf0b7 It would be useful to develop an annual report that reviews the progress of major technical- cooperation projects against a number of agreed metrics (with country partners) that could then be used in conjunction with the development of future plans and strategies. \uf0b7 Thailand should conduct some evaluations of its flagship technical cooperation programmes including, for example, the scholarship programme. \uf0b7 Thailand should invite its priority partners to provide feedback on its overall country contributions at formally recorded annual review meetings. Knowledge management and training \uf0b7 Much of the knowledge that the government has on development cooperation is not formally captured. It would be useful to put in formal structures to capture information on: o Latest international development trends, o The development needs of specific countries, o Guidelines on good practise for both bilateral and triangular cooperation \uf0b7 Thailand should proactively use its international partners to support it to address its existing skills gaps in technical cooperation 10 1. Introduction 1.1 Setting the Scene Thailand has a relatively successful track record of development. As of 2011, the country reached Upper Middle Income Status with GNI almost doubling and considerable reductions in poverty levels over the previous ten years.1 Although, Thailand continues to face some development challenges of its own, the Royal Thai Government has for a number of years been working to strengthen its support for international development. In particular, Thailand has a track-record of actively promoting the socio-economic development of the neighbouring \u201cCLMV\u201d countries (Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Viet Nam) and technical cooperation has also extended to both the wider region and beyond. In order to administer this support, in 2004, a Royal Decree was promulgated to establish the Thailand International Development Cooperation Agency (TICA) under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to promote international development cooperation between", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1152319c-0ce8-409c-a4de-3838d0f439cc": {"__data__": {"id_": "1152319c-0ce8-409c-a4de-3838d0f439cc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategic-review-thailands-international-development-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strategic Review of Thailand\u2019s International Development Cooperation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategic-review-thailands-international-development-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2a27b173c1f0ded5d31c4ea6cdbbccfd6732910713daa962680960d6f1cca2d7"}, "3": {"node_id": "c4db93a0-13e2-40c8-93f2-d8d23e32b952", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategic-review-thailands-international-development-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c55922bd94c9173646c9cba4e90d29a7d0336dd3cb681ff24a31a1ed38a61a16"}}, "hash": "7b4af910ccc6d40fb44fb38a77a4bf0272dc20b5cc0327418a8441b12143cd60", "text": "Thailand and its partners. In 2005 the Neighbouring Countries Economic Development Cooperation Agency (NEDA) was also established as an independent public body responsible for financing investment projects in neighbouring countries. The environment in which Thailand is offering support for international development has changed markedly since the establishment of these organisations. The \u201cCLMV\u201d countries to which Thailand has traditionally provided financial and technical support are rapidly growing. Although there are still large income differentials with these countries, incomes with Thailand are slowly converging. These countries are graduating from lower-income country (LICs) to middle income country (MICs) status and are increasingly looking to reduce their dependence on traditional aid financing. They have significantly greater choice for accessing financing and technical support than would have been the case even ten years ago. The development challenges these countries are facing is also evolving with significant drops in absolute poverty levels, but often growing inequality, environmental pressures and continued challenges in job creation. The rapidly changing needs of Thailand\u2019s partners require that the government re- evaluates the relevance of its contributions to their development. The onset of the ASEAN Economic Community in 2015 will also see much closer political and economic integration in the region, bringing with it both development opportunities and risks. Traditional models of development cooperation that characterize rich countries providing resources to poor countries are seemingly less relevant to Thailand, who is positioned as a middle income country in a regional grouping with neighbours as diverse as Singapore and Myanmar. Thailand\u2019s policies on trade, investment, regional governance, technology, migration, defence and the environment will influence not only Thailand\u2019s development but also that of its regional partners. Threats to development including public health crises, environmental pressures, economic crises or security threats will often require trans-national responses.2 1 http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2011/08/02/thailand-now-upper-middle-income-economy 2 See for example the Centre for Global Development\u2019s Commitment to Development Index that looks at how a range of policies affect countries beyond their borders http://international.cgdev.org/publication/commitment- development-index-2012 11 Increasingly, Thailand\u2019s contribution to development will not just be judged by the aid that it provides, but also how its policies help or impede addressing issues that cross national borders. The international landscape for development is also changing. Emerging donors are developing their own distinctive approaches to development that do not conform to traditional models. Traditional distinctions made between aid and other forms of commercial finance are viewed as redundant in this framework with commercial investment, grants and technical support often being \u2018bundled\u2019 in a single package of support.3 There is also growing appreciation of the value of south-south cooperation in human capital development: it is clear that countries value the practical experience of learning from countries, which have recently faced many of the same development challenges. Increasingly, many of the most pressing development challenges, such as climate change and tax evasion, are also recognised as global problems that require global responses. Many traditional bilateral donors and international organisations are being forced to re-evaluate their roles in this changing landscape. As international organisations reconsider their operations and approaches in the region, the demands on Thailand for technical cooperation and support are likely to grow. Without prioritisation, Thailand\u2019s own capacity to provide such assistance will become even more stretched. 1.2 Objective and methodology Given these trends, this strategic review offers a timely opportunity for the Thai government to reassess what Thailand\u2019s role on international development might be, as a middle-income country in a fast growing and changing region and how it can most effectively play that role. In order to do this, the analysis looks at five key research questions: \uf0b7 How is Thailand\u2019s approach to international development defined? \uf0b7 How is Thailand\u2019s policy on international development articulated in its policy framework? \uf0b7 How can Thailand work more effectively with external partners to better serve the development needs of partner countries and Thailand? \uf0b7 How can Thailand improve the internal institutional mechanisms for coordination, management of information and monitoring and evaluation of development cooperation? \uf0b7 Is Thailand\u2019s development financing guided by existing policy and institutional responsibilities? The research for this report is based on a combination of sources including: 1. A series of interviews and discussions held with personnel from the Royal Thai Government (see Annex 1) 2.

For many years, the predominant focus of multilateral agencies and traditional bilateral donors has been on poverty reduction and the related achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. In order to achieve these objectives, these agencies have predominantly focused on the role of aid and how it can be used more effectively to achieve targeted goals (see for example the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness). Many emerging donors are bringing their own distinctive approaches to development, both in terms of the motivation underpinning cooperation and also the tools of cooperation being used. For example, given its ongoing development needs, China recognizes as its primary responsibility to contribute to the development of its own population. The Government\u2019s White Paper on Development articulates first how they will use domestic and foreign policy to achieve their development goals, and second how its approach to cooperation will lead to mutual development benefits and prosperity of other countries.4 China also focuses on a different set of instruments to achieve its goals. While many traditional donors have focused on the role of Official Development Assistance, the Chinese government would see commercially motivated market-based loans, technical support and grant money as an overall package of development cooperation. In this paradigm, terminology such as \u2018ODA\u2019 and even \u2018international development cooperation\u2019 would be deemed largely foreign concepts. These different perspectives on development are also reflected in the national institutional structures that oversee development. In China, where policy for international development is rooted in the national development strategy, overall oversight for development policy and financing is with the State Council, the highest policy authority. Given the strategy is focused primarily on supporting mutual growth and investment; development financing is largely administered by the Ministry of Commerce. This is in contrast to the United States and Australia for example, where development policy is administered by USAID and AusAID respectively whose names clearly suggest a strong focus on aid. Defining Thailand\u2019s own Development Model The draft strategic framework on International Development Cooperation of TICA (in keeping with its institutional alignment to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) is predominantly focused on technical cooperation and aligned to goals on strengthening international relations. For example, the vision stresses the importance of international recognition from working as an effective development partner. The framework emphasizes an approach to development that looks in broad terms at how the 4 For example \u201cChina should develop itself through upholding world peace and contribute to world peace through its own development. It should achieve development with its own efforts and by carrying out reform and innovation; at the same time, it should open itself to the outside and learn from other countries. It should seek mutual benefit and common development with other countries in keeping with the trend of economic globalization, and it should work together with other countries to build a harmonious world of durable peace and common prosperity. This is a path of scientific, independent, open, peaceful, cooperative and common development\u201d (http://english.gov.cn/official/2011-09/06/content_1941354.htm) 13 government can use international cooperation strategies to promote mutual benefits for Thailand and other parties. The framework, for example, refers to Thailand\u2019s potential role as a knowledge hub as well as a \u2018problem solver\u2019 for regional and international problems. It also stresses principles of horizontality and working with partners, rather than in terms of donor and recipient. For most parties interviewed in Thailand, international development cooperation was perceived in more narrow terms about providing technical assistance to improve social welfare in countries less wealthy than Thailand. \u2018International development cooperation\u2019 (IDC) was perceived by many as distinct from \u2018international cooperation\u2019 (IC) with IDC understood as benefitting poorer countries, while IC is understood to be about using international relations to promote benefits for Thailand. As such, during research, it was suggested by certain actors that they had resources available for promoting international cooperation, but not international development cooperation, which was deemed the responsibility of TICA. In contrast to the approach taken by China, for example, economic cooperation, is seen as enhancing Thailand\u2019s economic prospects, but is not perceived as \u2018development\u2019 cooperation. Development is understood predominantly as a charitable transaction. The involvement of the private sector in development would be understood in terms of its corporate social responsibility, rather than its potential to create jobs through market-based foreign direct investment. Similarly, EXIM Bank, who support Thai companies to invest in neighbouring developing countries are not considered as part of Thailand\u2019s development model unlike in China or Korea.

At present in Thailand, it seems there is not a consistent understanding of the objectives of what development cooperation might be and how it should be defined. Given this lack of clarity, it would be useful for Thailand to develop a comprehensive master-plan on international development that articulates clearly Thailand\u2019s own distinctive model of how it is supporting international development and the benefits for both Thailand and partners. This should aim to provide a unified view that draws from existing overlapping strategies for economic cooperation, international cooperation and international development cooperation. While there are some emerging characteristic features of Thailand\u2019s approach (e.g. strengthening regional connectivity, positioning itself as a regional hub of learning etc.) more could be done to clearly outline why international development matters for Thailand and how it tends to support it. 15 3. Policy Analysis 3.1 Overarching Government Policies The Royal Thai Government has two overarching statements of policy, from which all government strategies are drawn: the 11th National Economic and Social Development Plan prepared by the National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) and the Policy Statement of the Council of Ministers that is developed by the Office of the Prime Minister. These are considered in turn. a) The 11th National Economic and Social Development Plan Thailand\u2019s own approach to development influences the development of other countries: most markedly that of its immediate neighbours, but also countries in the wider ASEAN region and beyond. Thailand\u2019s planned approach to national development is most recently articulated in the 11th National Social and Economic Development Plan (NESDP), which runs from 2012-2016. The development plan is based on six strategic pillars: o Creating the just society o Developing a lifelong learning society. o Strengthening of the agricultural sector and security of food and energy. o Restructuring the economy toward quality growth and sustainability. o Creating regional connectivity for social and economic stability. o Managing natural resources and the environment toward sustainability. Most obviously, the strategic pillar for the creation of regional connectivity is outward looking and has implications for both the development of Thailand, but also its neighbours in the region. Strategies for improving regional cooperation cut across a wide range of sectors (see Box 1) Box 1: Strategic pillars for improved connectivity require cooperation across a number of sectors Cooperation on infrastructure networks \uf0b7 Develop connectivity in transport and logistics systems under regional cooperation frameworks. Cooperation on trade and investment \uf0b7 Develop investment bases by improving competitiveness in the region. \uf0b7 Accelerate utilization of free trade agreements currently in effect. \uf0b7 Use Thailand as a business base for foreign investors in the Asian region Cooperation on green growth \uf0b7 Promote constructive international cooperation to support economic growth in ethical and sustainable ways Cooperation on international governance 16 \uf0b7 Constructively engage in regional and international cooperation frameworks to provide alternatives in foreign policies in the international arena. \uf0b7 Support non-profit international organisations for regional development. \uf0b7 Strengthen domestic development partners at the community level. Cooperation on human capital development \uf0b7 Prepare for the ASEAN Economic Community by developing human resources in all economic sectors. Cooperation on international security, disaster management and public health \uf0b7 Contribute to the international community\u2019s efforts to improve the quality of life by fighting against terrorism, international crimes, drug trafficking, natural disasters and epidemics. Cooperation on migration \uf0b7 Create economic regional partnerships regarding human capital development and labour migration However, other strategic pillars in the 11th NESDP that are less evidently outward looking also have implications beyond Thailand\u2019s borders. A key component of Thailand\u2019s planned restructuring of its economy is to \u2018utilize science, technology, innovation and creativity\u2019. One example that is cited is that \u2018it is necessary to improve productivity in the agricultural sector and to enhance value creation through innovation and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "14286cc3-1601-41f9-bc26-9beca33fd7fb": {"__data__": {"id_": "14286cc3-1601-41f9-bc26-9beca33fd7fb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategic-review-thailands-international-development-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strategic Review of Thailand\u2019s International Development Cooperation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategic-review-thailands-international-development-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b26300c0201beed439391b54747033ef8fa8b77d5df7f5fe269ff337a472a20e"}, "3": {"node_id": "9c6321cf-a236-4251-8015-a1adc41458b6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategic-review-thailands-international-development-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9df9041e2fe6f051cd35d6727ce083a7eaabd0a829240dde82f11c9ba8315a83"}}, "hash": "af58ba0764de3a9886e480853dda2199dba4c051fcc2a9c9dc0f2253f01703ed", "text": "green production processes\u2019. Productivity gains and technological improvements in agriculture can affect both prices of agricultural products and agricultural processes outside of Thailand. In addition, Thailand\u2019s approach to \u2018managing natural resources and the environment toward sustainability\u2019 can also affect the lives of the poorest in both the region and beyond. If Thailand is able to successfully implement its strategy to \u2018shift the development paradigm and redirect the country to a low carbon and environmentally friendly economy\u2019 then Thailand\u2019s contribution to climate change to which the world\u2019s poorest are particularly vulnerable will be less marked. How Thailand uses its natural resources also affects regional environmental public goods, like the Mekong, and those whose livelihoods depend on these resources. a) The Policy Statement of the Council of Ministers The way in which Thailand cooperates with other countries, regional communities and international organisations affects Thailand\u2019s development and international development. An abridged version of Thailand\u2019s policy on Foreign Affairs and International Economic Cooperation is outlined in Box 2. 17 Box 2: Abridged version of Thailand\u2019s Foreign Policy as articulated in the Policy Statement to the National Assembly http://www.mfa.go.th/main/en/policy/9868-Foreign-Policy.html 1) Expedite the promotion and development of relations with neighbouring countries by enhancing cooperation between the public sector, private sector, people and the mass media in order to cultivate mutual understanding and instil closeness among all sectors which will lead to expanded cooperation in the areas of economics, trade, investment, tourism promotion, transportation 2) Create unity and promote cooperation among ASEAN countries in order to realize the goal of creating an ASEAN Community by 2015 in the economic, socio-cultural and security areas. 3) Take on a creative role and promote the national interest in international organisations to address all transnational issues that affect human security. 4) Strengthen cooperation and strategic partnership with countries, groups of countries and international organisations that play important roles in global affairs in order to boost confidence in Thailand, 5) Encourage people-to-people contacts with foreign countries, as well as promote a positive image and technical assistance with developing countries so that people, governments and the international community will have positive attitudes toward the Thai people and Thailand. 6) Promote public awareness and understanding of border issues and global changes that affect Thailand so as to forge consensus in the formulation and implementation of foreign policy. 7) Support \u2018People Diplomacy\u2019 to safeguard the interests of Thai nationals, 8) Utilize regional connectivity within the ASEAN region and sub-regions in order to expand the economic base in terms of production and investment, 9) Coordinate the work of government agencies overseas in order to carry out foreign affairs efficiently, effectively and with high quality. 10) Promote close cooperation with Muslim countries and Islamic international organisations to create a correct understanding that Thailand is working on resolving the issue of the Southern Border Provinces, At the heart of Thailand\u2019s International Cooperation policy is a wish to increase Thailand\u2019s international standing in order to be better placed to meet the development needs of Thai society. For example, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs articulates its vision as: To serve as a leading organisation in enhancing Thailand\u2019s capacity to have a dignified international status, by playing an honourable and active role, in the field of political stability and security, economic and social development, and ensuring that Thai society can best benefit from globalization.5 In addition, there are also a number of policy objectives in the government\u2019s stated economic policy that also emphasize the mutual benefits of closer economic integration. Relevant policy strategies are outlined in Box 3. 5 http://www.mfa.go.th/main/en/policy/9867-Vision-&-Mission.html 18 Box 3: Examples of economic cooperation strategies that have development benefits beyond Thailand\u2019s borders 3.2.5 Encourage expansion of Thai entrepreneurs\u2019 investment in neighbouring countries that are able to supply labour and factors of production to bring forth economic prosperity for Thailand and the region. 3.2.8 Promote and expand integration in the areas of economics, trade, investment and finance to enhance mutual benefits under cooperative frameworks and international trade agreements 3.3.4 Expedite the establishment of Special Economic Development Zones in areas with high potential, with particular attention given to border provinces, in order to promote trade, marketing, investment, employment and sourcing of raw materials from neighbouring countries, making full use of ASEAN\u2019s regional connectivity.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c6321cf-a236-4251-8015-a1adc41458b6": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c6321cf-a236-4251-8015-a1adc41458b6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategic-review-thailands-international-development-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strategic Review of Thailand\u2019s International Development Cooperation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategic-review-thailands-international-development-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b26300c0201beed439391b54747033ef8fa8b77d5df7f5fe269ff337a472a20e"}, "2": {"node_id": "14286cc3-1601-41f9-bc26-9beca33fd7fb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategic-review-thailands-international-development-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "af58ba0764de3a9886e480853dda2199dba4c051fcc2a9c9dc0f2253f01703ed"}}, "hash": "9df9041e2fe6f051cd35d6727ce083a7eaabd0a829240dde82f11c9ba8315a83", "text": "3.2 International Cooperation Strategies At the sector level, a number of public bodies are articulating how international cooperation strategies can contribute towards the achievement of the policy objectives set out in high-level overarching government policy documents.

One way the BOT is doing this is through actively promoting the presence of Thailand\u2019s commercial banking sector in the region. The main objectives of the Bank\u2019s assistance are to support Thai banks in opening branches overseas, to ensure policy compatibilities, and to support the co-development of the financial sector in neighbouring countries. These initiatives have clear benefits for Thailand, but also can potentially support financial inclusion. The BOT is also working with the Ministry of Finance to support Thailand\u2019s neighbours to access Thailand\u2019s capital markets. For example, Lao PDR issued bonds worth THB1.5bn to institutional investors in Thai capital markets for the first time in May 2013. While this initiative supports the development of Thailand\u2019s domestic bond market, it also provides a channel to intermediate regional savings for regional investments. The Ministry of Education is another good example of a line ministry with a clear direction on international cooperation. The Office of Higher Education Commission (OHEC) aims to provide \u2018internationalization\u2019 and \u2018regionalization\u2019 to Thailand\u2019s higher education. OHEC has a strong emphasis on building an \u2018educational hub\u2019 in ASEAN and is pursuing an active role in international cooperation with other ASEAN countries to exchange and share knowledge about higher education quality and standards. The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOAC) has also prepared an international cooperation strategy with a view to supporting the achievement of Thailand\u2019s goal to be promoted \u2018as the Kitchen of the World\u2019 both in terms of agricultural products it produces. The strategy came as a result of extensive consultation with various stakeholders, including strong involvement from the private sector. The vision of the strategy is to build confidence of Thai food and agricultural products and support international cooperation on agriculture for sustainable results. Under this vision, the MOAC highlights as one of their key strategies to develop strong international cooperation practices with other countries and international organisations. It also aims to support the exchange of knowledge and technical expertise between countries. 19 Common to all of these cooperation strategies are clear linkages to the national policy goals outlined in the overarching policy statements. Not all of these cooperation strategies will necessarily be of benefit to Thailand\u2019s development partners. There are however areas within these strategies where there are key areas of common interest and mutual benefits. For example, Lao\u2019s issuance of Thai Baht denominated debt has enabled the Lao government to diversify its debt holdings, while enabling Thailand to deepen its domestic bond market. The work of the Ministry of Education to promote Thailand as an educational hub also has clear potential benefits in terms of the development of human capital in the region. 3.3 Strategic Framework for \u2018International Development Cooperation\u2019 a) TICA\u2019s strategic framework for technical cooperation TICA has developed a draft strategic framework for \u2018international development cooperation\u2019. In line with its institutional responsibilities, the framework focuses specifically on technical cooperation and how it can be used to build capacity in other countries. Many of the strategies outlined are in keeping with latest international thinking on effective development cooperation. Bilaterally, it stresses that its support for development should be demand-led and based on principles of partnership; reference is also made to the principles of the Paris Declaration on Effective Aid. Multilaterally, it outlines Thailand\u2019s to serve as a regional knowledge hub and work as a problem solver to tackle regional and global problems. Thailand has also many partnerships agreements in place with other bilateral donors and multilateral organisation with whom Thailand is working on triangular cooperation arrangements. The strategy notes that a key motivation for international development cooperation is to build Thailand\u2019s recognition on the international stage. This is consistent with high-level foreign policy, where technical assistance is viewed primarily in terms of the diplomatic benefits it can convey: [To] promote a positive image and technical assistance with developing countries so that people, governments and the international community will have positive attitudes toward the Thai people and Thailand (Policy 7.5) While soft diplomacy is an understandable objective of technical cooperation, shared by many donors, it does mean that technical assistance is not necessarily targeted to those who most need the support. The strategic framework recognizes that past cooperation has tended to focus on building the capabilities of public servants, but not necessarily local farmers for example. The strategic framework also notes that technical cooperation is not necessarily well-integrated with sector policies. Cooperation is seemingly often not targeted to meet national specific sector-based strategic goals such as addressing specific regional skills gaps that impede the Thai labour market; reducing risks of communicable diseases that cross borders; or promoting", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a52acb22-9ea9-4e0b-977f-1813e2b1e0b0": {"__data__": {"id_": "a52acb22-9ea9-4e0b-977f-1813e2b1e0b0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategic-review-thailands-international-development-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strategic Review of Thailand\u2019s International Development Cooperation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategic-review-thailands-international-development-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9a4fa4f9acde496ace93a563b16f494408cf1f4270f24506a7bf7dbc03ef00fd"}}, "hash": "9a4fa4f9acde496ace93a563b16f494408cf1f4270f24506a7bf7dbc03ef00fd", "text": "the interchange of academic knowledge within the ASEAN region. Where cooperation is not integrated with sector policy objectives, there is a risk of weak ownership of implementing agencies in line ministries, who feel that such activities are not part of their core mandate. 20 b) Strategy on the Provision of Grants and Loans for economic cooperation The provision of development finance is primarily seen as a tool to promote economic cooperation with Thailand\u2019s neighbours. It is largely perceived as being separate to the technical cooperation that Thailand provides. Thailand\u2019s development finance contributions have primarily focused on supporting the development of transport infrastructure in Thailand\u2019s neighbouring countries through the provision of concessional loans administered by NEDA. Support is targeted to those projects that strengthen connectivity with Thailand and its neighbours. Increasingly, NEDA is looking to finance projects that link Thailand and its neighbouring countries to the wider Asian region through strengthening regional transport corridors. EXIM Bank has also been involved in the intermittent financing of strategic infrastructure projects in the region. In 2008, they provided a loan to support financing of the construction of the Nam Theun II dam in Lao PDR. A substantial part of the electricity (995MW) generated through this plant is being exported to the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) as part of a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) signed in 2003. Under the agreement the Lao Government will earn $80m in the first 25 years.6 Focusing the provision of development finance on infrastructure development is in keeping with a traditionally East-Asian approach to development financing. Japanese and Korean aid agencies have historically focused relatively more of their ODA on infrastructure sectors than bilateral aid agencies in Europe and the US. Similarly, China has focused much of its development cooperation on supporting the development of large-scale infrastructure projects. 3.4 Conclusions and recommendations Thailand has a clear high-level policy and a growing number of strategies at ministerial level on how international cooperation can meet Thailand\u2019s own goals on socio-economic development. It also has strategy documents in place that look at how technical cooperation and aid-finance can be used more effectively. There is not, however, at present an overarching policy on international development which articulates Thailand\u2019s goals in terms of the gains to socio-economic development of other countries. Thailand\u2019s development cooperation is likely to be more effective if there are clear goals that can guide ongoing engagement, both at a whole-of-government level and the sector level. As has been discussed, different actors have different views on how they can best meet the interests of their partners and the interests of their citizens through their engagement in international development. There would be benefit in articulating Thailand\u2019s own primary objectives. 6 http://www.power-technology.com/projects/namtheun2 21 \uf0b7 It is therefore recommended that master-plan be developed that clearly articulates the logic of what Thailand is trying to achieve in terms of international development and the range of tools that it is using to achieve those goals. Such a policy should draw from Thailand\u2019s own view and understanding of the priorities and complexities of development. As government experts on the preparation of national development plans, the expertise of NESDB would be of great value here in thinking through how Thailand can support the development trajectory of other countries. \uf0b7 It is also clear that the primary mandate of government agencies is to meet the needs of Thai citizens. Thailand\u2019s support for development stands most chance of success when there is an alignment of high-level policy, the strategic plans of ministries and the needs of Thailand\u2019s partners (be they countries, regions or third-party donors). \uf0b7 As a middle income country with its own development challenges and financing constraints, the Thai government may also wish to review how it can influence and articulate its contribution to development in broader terms, including the full breadth of cooperation work that is being done to support the development of other countries. This might include influencing policy in partner countries based on Thailand\u2019s own knowledge of development, building regional consensus on development issues or facilitating knowledge exchange. There are risks that if government-wide development is seen only in narrow terms of its contributions to official development assistance; it overlooks other areas where Thailand is making potentially more substantive contributions to development. 22 4. Analysis of Institutional Arrangements for Working with External Partners 4.1 Bilateral Cooperation A key potential strength of Thailand\u2019s bilateral support to its partner countries is that it is predominantly \u2018demand-led\u2019 and can be supported as part of long-term strategic partnerships. This often contrasts with the approach of traditional development partners, where capacity-building initiatives may be \u2018conditionality based\u2019.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9a7940ca-40c4-4c77-ad35-97c5bd8f183b": {"__data__": {"id_": "9a7940ca-40c4-4c77-ad35-97c5bd8f183b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategic-review-thailands-international-development-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strategic Review of Thailand\u2019s International Development Cooperation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategic-review-thailands-international-development-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "de2b7ccd822b7c82690fe7238b044e40d85cfedd985aa858eae2afb8930cdf3f"}}, "hash": "de2b7ccd822b7c82690fe7238b044e40d85cfedd985aa858eae2afb8930cdf3f", "text": "In this case, development agencies would diagnose weak capacity and insist on improvements to be measured on an annual basis as a condition of other support.7 Demands for Thailand\u2019s bilateral support emerge from a wide range of institutions. These include: \uf0b7 The Office of Prime Minister \uf0b7 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and diplomatic offices \uf0b7 TICA and frameworks for technical cooperation \uf0b7 NEDA \uf0b7 Direct Ministry to Ministry dialogue at the ministerial level (e.g. exchange between Health Ministers) \uf0b7 Direct dialogue at the departmental level (e.g. exchange between disease control department) This multi-layered relationship can potentially be a great strength in building strong relationships. High- level cooperation is essential if partner countries are to foster consensus on political issues. The Thai government is more likely to be seen as a valued partner in providing technical know-how if it can forge linkages between technical experts across a whole range of relevant areas. Thailand can also offer the government different tools to support their development, including finance through concessional loans for infrastructure, but also the exchange of technical know-how and human resources. However, there are also very real risks that if support is uncoordinated that demands for cooperation may not be aligned to Thailand\u2019s capacity to effectively provide such support. During interviews, a number of examples were reported where \u2018technical experts\u2019 have been provided to support partner countries, but do not necessarily posses the necessary language or diplomatic skills to effectively communicate in a foreign setting. Thailand, like all governments, also has areas where it is well-placed to provide assistance and guidance and those where it is less able to. Where support is uncoordinated, there is also a risk that the number of projects and areas of cooperation proliferates. One of the key findings of international evaluations on aid effectiveness is that smaller numbers of larger projects will tend to have greater impact than a large number of small projects. Effective bilateral technical cooperation also depends upon long-term strategic engagement and planning. While technical cooperation should be responsive to the demands of partner countries, a large part of the assistance offered seems to be one-off activities agreed on an ad-hoc basis. Often activities are designed as an indicator of friendship rather based on a robust analysis of how Thailand could address 7 Welham et al. (2013) 23 a key capacity need of a partner country over a sustained period. Bilateral strategies should ideally be forward-looking, with medium-term strategic plans agreed on how identified capacity constraints can be addressed through technical cooperation. 4.2 Regional and International Cooperation Frameworks Thailand is an active participant in a number of cooperation frameworks: \uf0b7 At the sub-regional level (e.g. Greater Mekong Sub-region, Indonesia-Malaysia Growth Triangle) \uf0b7 At the regional level (e.g. ASEAN) and \uf0b7 At the international level (e.g. United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) The strategic opportunities presented by international cooperation frameworks are recognized in Thailand\u2019s foreign policy and the NESDP. In particular, cooperation frameworks are seen as an opportunity for Thailand to advocate and foster consensus on certain policy goals. The NESDP, for example, particularly stresses the importance of international cooperation frameworks in supporting a sustainable development agenda: Agreements under regional environmental cooperation frameworks should adhere to the promotion of green production, consumption and services that lead to reduction of green house gas (GHG) emission. During research interviews, a number of examples were also provided of where Thailand is using international cooperation frameworks at the sector level to advocate for key strategic policy priorities. In the education sector, the Thai government is working closely with UNESCO and the UN to promote Education for All. It is also actively participating in the formulation of post-2015 goals in the education sector to replace the MDGs. In the health sector, there have also been examples of the Thai government advocating and advising on the path towards provision of universal health coverage. The forthcoming establishment of the ASEAN economic community in 2015 also allows great scope for Thailand to pursue its policy objectives on enhancing regional economic connectivity. As part of the overall cooperation framework, agreements will be put in place for example on trade policy, on financial integration and the movement of labour. In addition to supporting policy advocacy, regional cooperation frameworks are also being utilized as a means for promoting knowledge exchange and the movement of people and ideas in the ASEAN region. Much of this investment has been inwardly focused: there have been large increases in budgets for programmes that support Thais in better understanding regional opportunities. Although this might not be defined as ODA as such, the development of language skills", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "158802b5-fc18-4e9c-be0e-f75fdb7c5a90": {"__data__": {"id_": "158802b5-fc18-4e9c-be0e-f75fdb7c5a90", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategic-review-thailands-international-development-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strategic Review of Thailand\u2019s International Development Cooperation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategic-review-thailands-international-development-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d8fca309a8382822653f6c9108a091ed7eb17d5b56de3c08ade122090e497c67"}}, "hash": "d8fca309a8382822653f6c9108a091ed7eb17d5b56de3c08ade122090e497c67", "text": "and regional awareness are necessary if Thailand is to build business to business and people to people contact with regional partners. Thailand is actively seeking to promote itself as a regional knowledge hub. The Fiscal Policy Office is for example facilitating work in conjunction with the Asian Development Bank and UN-ESCAP to support 24 Thailand\u2019s Fiscal Policy Research Institute, to build country capabilities in serving as a regional centre for offering macroeconomic training. If these ambitions are to gain support and recognition in an international development context, it would be useful to link these ambitions to specific regional development challenges. Further understanding is therefore required on where there is demand regionally to address specific skills constraints, whether Thailand is well placed to address them and how this would link to Thailand\u2019s own development priorities. 4.3 International Organisations The government\u2019s foreign policy states as an objective that the government should \u2018take on a creative role and promote the national interest in international organisations, specifically at the United Nations and regional organisations\u2019. Further, a proposed strategy under the 11th NESDP is to support non-profit international organisations to further the government\u2019s agenda on regional development. Thailand is advantageously placed in this regards with many UN agencies and International NGOs choosing to base their regional operations in Bangkok. Thailand has long-standing evolving relationships with these organisations and bilateral donors. Increasingly, Thailand is partnering with international organisations in triangular frameworks to supplement the financial contributions of these organisations with its technical know-how and knowledge on its development successes and challenges. Such relationships exist across a whole range of ministries and institutions. There are a number of examples of where Thailand is actively promoting its own goals for regional development and leveraging the resources of international organisations (both financial and technical) to support the achievements of these goals. During the interviews there were a number of examples of this type of behaviour emerging: 1. Promotion of regional economic integration. One of the two key strategic pillars of the ADB\u2019s new Thailand country partnership strategy is to support the government in its agenda of regional integration. This is being done through support for the sharing of Thailand\u2019s development experiences and knowledge and sub-regional economic cooperation programmes. 2. Prevention of communicable disease in the sub-regions. With Thailand graduating to upper- middle-income country status, Thailand is no longer eligible for receipt of Global Fund resources. Give the propensity for communicable diseases to cross borders, there is a strong case to tackle this issue at the regional level. The Global Fund therefore agreed to the Ministry of Public Health\u2019s proposal for a regional grant, the first of its kind. These examples are seemingly however the exception at present rather than the rule. Many of the arrangements with international organisations in Thailand seem predominantly to be aimed at building mutual good-will. Often the international organisations will set the agenda of cooperation and Thailand will be a largely passive partner. A further challenge of this type of arrangement is the increased complexity in aligning the interests of both providers and recipient. Additional complexity may also be 25 created in terms of coordination of support. 8 There may then be benefit in undertaking a review of those organizations whose interests are strategically aligned with Thailand\u2019s own. These need not be the only organizations with whom Thailand enters into agreements, but these could be engagements where efforts could be prioritised. 4.4 Partnerships with Domestic Stakeholders Strengthening partnerships between government and other domestic stakeholders is viewed by the government as a key strategy to promote development. One of the stated strategies of the government\u2019s foreign policy is to \u2018Expedite the promotion and development of relations with neighbouring countries by enhancing cooperation between the public sector, private sector, people and the mass media\u2019. The NESDP XI suggests the government should \u2018strengthen domestic development partners at the community level\u2019. TICA also note in the 2008-2012 strategic plan that the government should as a priority \u2018support the role of public sector/private sector and civil society groups for IDC\u2019. There are a number of existing examples where government has partnered with domestic organisations to effectively promote its development cooperation agenda. A key sector where this has taken place has been in education where partnerships have been formed between academic institutions in the ASEAN region. This type of partnership can help to forge the type of long-term relationship that underpins effective knowledge exchange. Domestic development partners may also have specific skills that leave them better placed to provide technical support than the government. For example, while government staff may have specific technical skills they may not have experience", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "81e88a27-5273-4202-b1ad-b376ac5b04d6": {"__data__": {"id_": "81e88a27-5273-4202-b1ad-b376ac5b04d6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategic-review-thailands-international-development-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strategic Review of Thailand\u2019s International Development Cooperation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategic-review-thailands-international-development-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "87ebe4bf9ca8edaa8356ef8cbcde1dd51545262d5e938a3b934566c1d21fb85f"}}, "hash": "87ebe4bf9ca8edaa8356ef8cbcde1dd51545262d5e938a3b934566c1d21fb85f", "text": "in teaching or training. Identifying relevant partner institutions with dedicated capacity to provide training may leave government better placed to respond to ad-hoc training requests. This is the model being followed by the Ministry of Finance with the Fiscal Policy Research Institute. NEDA, EXIM Bank and the Bank of Thailand are examples of organisations that are actively working with the Thai private sector to promote the interests of Thai firms through cooperation agreements. For example, loans provided by EXIM Bank and NEDA require that investment projects are undertaken by Thai firms. The Bank of Thailand is also working with its commercial banking sector and other central banks in the region to ensure that standards of compliance are consistent across borders thereby facilitating the entrance of Thai banks to other markets in the region. In addition, the Ministry of Agriculture is actively seeking inputs from the private sector in order to formulate their international cooperation strategy as they recognize the growing role of the private sector in marketing agricultural products in the international market. Using partners to support programme implementation also helps to free up time of staff to focus more on strategic issues and less on administration. During research interviews, it was apparent that a large part of the time of staff working on international cooperation is currently dedicated to the administration of programmes. It was reported, for example, that considerable time is spent fielding calls on 8 See for example Cabral and Weinstock (2010) who note similar challenges in the Brazilian context 26 arrangements for the payments of per diems on scholarship and training programmes. Processing requests for visas for visitors from other countries was also reported to be a lengthy and time-consuming procedure. TICA noted that when responsibility for implementation of a university partnership programme was delegated to the Khon Kaen University, the demand on TICA staff for programme administration was greatly reduced. Many other countries contract out implementation of development projects to NGOs and consultancy firms, who may have stronger links to communities or particular expertise in project implementation or training than the government is unable to provide. At present, Thailand predominantly looks to the government to provide the human resources for implementation of programmes. There is a significant consulting industry and NGO presence in Bangkok, of both international and Thai organisations, that could potentially take on responsibility for certain aspects of international cooperation projects. 4.5 Recommendations: \uf0b7 The Thai government may wish to consider the development of bilateral country strategies for those countries that are seen to be priorities as development partners. The development of such strategies would provide a useful framework through which Thailand could review the whole package of support being offered to a country over a period of three to five years. A good entry point for strategizing future country support is to document the support that has been provided in recent years and to reflect in tandem with country partners as to whether it has been appropriately targeted. There may also be scope to rationalize the number of projects and interventions being undertaken in order to focus resources on fewer, better funded projects thereby minimising administrative costs for both parties. Annex 3 shows for example information collected on all the recorded capacity building activities that were undertaken in Myanmar in 2011. Information could be similarly organized for other key bilateral partners in order to comprehensively review existing programmes. \uf0b7 Greater awareness is also required of Thailand\u2019s own capacity to provide effective technical support and policy guidance. At the moment, Thailand\u2019s strengths are identified by TICA at the sector level (e.g. the proposed focus in health, education, agriculture and rural development). However, within sectors there will be particular departments or focus areas where Thailand is better placed to offer assistance than others. Dialogue is required between line ministries and TICA to identify where Thailand has the capacity to make positive contributions to development through technical cooperation. \uf0b7 Effective use of international cooperation frameworks for policy advocacy also depends upon Thailand having clearly articulated policy positions in place. These policy positions need to demonstrate domestic commitment to goals on which they are seeking consensus as well as the rationale for partners to support such positions. 27 \uf0b7 In order for Thailand to present a more coordinated and coherent policy position to bilateral, regional and international partners; roles, responsibilities and internal arrangements for coordination need to be clarified more comprehensively (these are looked at further in the next section). \uf0b7 As part of a master-plan, there could be benefit in undertaking a stakeholder analysis of international and domestic partners to review whether their", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ae0507a-964f-453e-8177-b3af51987e05": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ae0507a-964f-453e-8177-b3af51987e05", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategic-review-thailands-international-development-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strategic Review of Thailand\u2019s International Development Cooperation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategic-review-thailands-international-development-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a631110fee6a60f7be7d288a728f7aad1c5792824ace674660bdd20be93a111e"}}, "hash": "a631110fee6a60f7be7d288a728f7aad1c5792824ace674660bdd20be93a111e", "text": "interests are aligned to Thailand\u2019s own goals for development cooperation. International Organisations could be grouped into those where the government wishes to deepen cooperation for specific strategic policy interests and those where cooperation is maintained largely for diplomatic purposes. \uf0b7 There is scope to extend the type of domestic partnership model used in higher education to other sectors. For example, the UK has developed a number of health links between UK medical institutions and counterparts in developing countries. There may be scope for similar linkages between hospitals in the region so that nurses and doctors can exchange and impart knowledge. Government may wish to review the contracting out of implementation of certain programmes to other domestic partners including NGOs or the private sector, where it is felt they have a comparative advantage. \uf0b7 It can see from the cases of EXIM Bank, Bank of Thailand and Ministry of Agriculture, cooperation between the ministries and the private sector contribute to a mutual understanding and learning about development cooperation. It raises the awareness for development issues and needs for the private sector, while it also provide public administrations with a better understanding of the needs of the private sector and more knowledge about important management aspects which the private sector has more expertise. Thus, public-private alliances should be encouraged to play a stronger role in development cooperation, in order to achieve a common set of development objectives for both the public and private sectors. \uf0b7 A situation analysis could be undertaken that reviews how Thailand could address development gaps through playing the role of a \u2018knowledge hub\u2019. This would involve setting out what might be some of the skills and knowledge gaps constraining development in the region; what existing mechanism are in place to support regional knowledge exchange; where Thailand has the capacity, personnel and facilities to fill those gaps and what the international development community has learnt about effective peer-to-peer learning. 28 5. Institutional Analysis 5.1 Coordination of Thailand\u2019s Development Cooperation The previous sections have put forward three key reasons why Thailand might wish to attempt to better coordinate its approach to development: 1. Integrated policy-making and implementation. By drawing together knowledge of government policy priorities and country development needs, mutual benefits can be identified for development cooperation thereby strengthening joint-ownership of development cooperation. 2. Working effectively with partners. In order to maximize the impacts of Thailand\u2019s bilateral support, while minimizing administrative costs, Thailand should be coordinating its interactions with its key partners. 3. Improved public relations and soft diplomacy. By drawing together information and evaluation of the various elements of Thailand\u2019s contributions to development, the government will be better placed to represent itself both internationally as an active development partner as well as explaining clearly to domestic constituents the rationale for government engagement in development. a) Existing roles and responsibilities If one takes a broad view of \u2018international development cooperation\u2019 then it can be seen that a range of institutions are involved in the planning and implementation of policy. At an overarching level, the Office of the Prime Minister sets out the overall direction of government policy that guides the government approach to international and economic cooperation. The NESDB also has a key role in policy development, given their responsibility for preparing the NESDP, as well as bespoke policy research on major issues such as ASEAN integration. The Bureau of Budget (who report to the Office of the Prime Minister) is responsible for preparing the government budget. Additional resources are allocated to the strategic priorities highlighted in the high- level government policy developed by the Office of the Prime Minister. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is responsible for the preparation and implementation of the government\u2019s foreign policy. The Ministry is predominantly organized along country and regional lines and so is well placed to advise on country-specific and region-specific issues. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also houses the Department of International Organisations, who manage a large proportion of the contributions to International Organisations that constitutes a significant proportion of Thailand\u2019s overall Official Development Assistance (over 40% in 2011) TICA has been designated as the focal point for managing \u2018International Development Cooperation\u2019. In practise, its primary responsibilities are to act as the primary agency for administering technical cooperation with developing countries. In regional cooperation frameworks, TICA is also tasked with leading on elements of human capital development. The current institutional structure of TICA is such that is split between a Development Cooperation Bureau that is broken down along regional lines and a 29 Partnership Bureau that is split between multilateral organisations and bilateral organisations. At present, the organisation does not", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "436fdcde-590a-49ae-9632-7a1debc468e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "436fdcde-590a-49ae-9632-7a1debc468e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategic-review-thailands-international-development-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strategic Review of Thailand\u2019s International Development Cooperation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategic-review-thailands-international-development-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d3a04a7e37155597efbc5be07e7ee6112d6ba4f6084f60df5377cc54b843e153"}}, "hash": "d3a04a7e37155597efbc5be07e7ee6112d6ba4f6084f60df5377cc54b843e153", "text": "have any officers responsible for specialising in certain sectors. This may explain the concerns raised by sector ministries during the course of interviews that TICA had insufficient understanding of the strategic priorities and capacities of line ministries. The Ministry of Finance plays a central role in coordinating government policy on international economic cooperation. In particular the Fiscal Policy Office and within it the Bureau of International Economic Policy are responsible for guiding policy on international economic issues such as trade policy and international finance. Responsibility for liaising with the multilateral development banks also resides in this office. Prior to 2005, the Ministry of Finance also directly administered the Neighbouring Economic Development Fund. This was then replaced by NEDA, an independent public organisation in 2005. The operations of NEDA are overseen by a Board of Directors with representatives from the Ministry of Finance (Fiscal Policy Office and International Economic Cooperation), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, NESDB and independent economists and academics. Although NEDA\u2019s primary responsibilities are to provide development finance, it also offers technical support in areas such as debt repayment, trade facilitation and infrastructure development. While there are clear linkages between the work of NEDA and TICA, communication is largely limited to providing data for the ODA reports prepared by TICA. It was recognized during interviews that on occasions there is duplication of efforts between the organisations. In certain years, EXIM Bank has been the single largest contributor of finance eligible to be recorded as ODA. That said EXIM Bank does not see itself as an international development institution, given its focus on promoting the commercial interests of Thai exporters and investors. This perception reflects a fairly common view across government that (i) development is charitable rather than commercial and (ii) that economic cooperation and development cooperation are distinct. For many Asian donors (Korea and China for example), the EXIM Bank are a crucial partner in presenting an overall package of assistance to support country development. Most line ministries have offices in place to support and coordinate a ministerial approach to international cooperation. These agencies serve as useful focal points for supporting international cooperation programmes with other government agencies, international organisations and domestic partners. For the most part, these agencies play a support function through the management of information and linking up departments with opportunities for cooperation. Responsibility for implementation of technical cooperation is largely under the remit of individual departments or offices (e.g. in the health sector, the Department of Disease Control, Medical Services, Food and Drug Administration etc.). 30 b) Existing Cross-Agency Committees At present, there is no single committee responsible for overseeing the coordination of policy on development between different ministries. However, there are a number of structures in place that are relevant to this agenda: \uf0b7 The International Economic Policy Committee is chaired by the Prime Minister and makes a number of decisions relevant to an agenda of pursuing mutual growth and investment. At the most recent meeting, for example, it was agreed that duty-free, and quota-free (DFQF) market access be granted to the least developed countries with the Ministry of Commerce assigned to implement the scheme.9 \uf0b7 NEDA has in place a Board of Governors that oversee the appraisal and review of the investment projects financed by NEDA. \uf0b7 There is a National Committee for Foreign Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister with representation at ministerial level that has been inactive in recent times (although there are plans for it to be reconvened later this year). \uf0b7 There is also a Committee for Economic and Technical Cooperation with representation of Permanent Secretaries that also has not met in recent years. During interviews, a number of ministries acknowledged that international cooperation could be made considerably more effective by coordinating the efforts of individual departments within ministries. For example, the Ministry of Public Health reported examples of separate check points at borders for food safety and disease control even though responsibilities all fall under the same ministry. To address these coordination challenges, the Ministry of Public Health recently set up a committee on international cooperation with Director Generals represented from each department. This committee has been used as a means to integrate strategies, share information and identify where greater value can be added through departments working together. They are supported by the International Health Bureau acting as a secretariat (see Figure 2). 9 http://www.noodls.com/view/D2CA781095B164AE4E7804C3775E1B1A96236714 31 Figure 2: Structure to Coordinate International Cooperation within the Ministry of Health Recommendations \uf0b7 At the highest level, the development and endorsement of an international development policy and ongoing review of its implementation would seem to require contributions from a", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a990236c-0657-4592-94c9-bbf3449706a4": {"__data__": {"id_": "a990236c-0657-4592-94c9-bbf3449706a4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategic-review-thailands-international-development-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strategic Review of Thailand\u2019s International Development Cooperation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategic-review-thailands-international-development-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "79fb4109e393ef7ebda3f877ed4a69b6572b2ebbf28b35324d76019d36e23d2c"}}, "hash": "79fb4109e393ef7ebda3f877ed4a69b6572b2ebbf28b35324d76019d36e23d2c", "text": "number of agencies across government. The specific approach and representation of such a commission policy partly depends on Thailand\u2019s agreed development model that outlines what development policy is trying to achieve and the primary tools with which to achieve it. There are however a number of possible options for such a commission: Option 1: To create a new committee dedicated to this particular goal; or Option 2: To restructure the existing National Foreign Policy Committee; or Ministerial Committee for International Cooperation International Bureau Implementing Department 1 Implementing Department 2 Implementing Department 3 Administrative Coordination Policy and Strategy Coordination Secretariat 32 Option 3: To restructure the existing Economic and Technical Cooperation Committee. \uf0b7 A broad view of development cooperation would require that membership of such a committee would include representation from both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and TICA and the Ministry of Finance and NEDA to help bridge issues of economic cooperation and international relations. This committee should also include representatives of those sectors, where it is agreed that Thailand should prioritise its development support. \uf0b7 At a country-level, mechanisms could be put in place to better coordinate country strategies and plans for key partners. This could involve country-based Embassy staff, country-based TICA representatives, representation from NEDA and also potentially the Ministry of Finance to report on any economic cooperation initiatives. \uf0b7 If TICA is to ensure that proposed technical cooperation is aligned with the strategic priorities of ministries, then consideration should be given to identifying certain sector focal points who can liaise with relevant agencies. Given the level of resources in TICA, initially priority could be given to identifying specialists in two to three priority sectors (such as Health, Agriculture and Education). Focal points should also be identified at NEDA and TICA who are responsible for sharing information with each other on their respective plans to ensure that programming is coordinated. 5.2 Information Management TICA has been collecting information on the ODA that the Thai government provides for a number of years. In order to collate information on ODA, TICA circulates annually a letter and accompanying form requesting relevant agencies to submit information on support provided in the previous year. Information is collected on the name of the project, the type of support (i.e. grant, loan or contribution to international organisation), and the recipient of support (i.e. the country). Box 3: What is ODA? The OECD-DAC first defined ODA in 1969 as a means of providing a standardized measure of OECD country aid commitments. The OECD defines ODA as follows: Official development assistance is defined as those flows to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients and to multilateral development institutions which are: i. provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and ii. Each transaction of which: 33 a) is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and b) is concessional in character The benefits of recording ODA to TICA are currently unclear to many parties interviewed during the research. There is a perception within the government that existing reporting on ODA is primarily for external stakeholders rather than to inform government development policy. This impression is reinforced by the difficulty ministries face in accessing timely information. The most recent statistics available on ODA flows on TICA\u2019s website is from 2011, even though TICA has received information on ODA flows up to 2012. The publication of ODA figures is typically delayed until TICA feels they have received from ministries comprehensive and reliable information. A common complaint from ministries is that there is a lack of clarity on what should be recorded as ODA. This issue has also been raised at meetings of the UNJT-IC. The advice of international organisations has also been sought as to what might be an appropriate definition of ODA. While there is scope to clarify the definitional issue, reporting also seems to be influenced by perceptions of whether it is worth recording. For example, where ministries host government to government training workshops, many do not see the value in recording the financial contributions for hosting such a meeting, given the small sums involved and the administrative costs in isolating all these expenditure items across large government ministries. Focusing information management solely on financial contributions also has the potential to underestimate Thailand\u2019s contribution to technical cooperation. For a start, much of the support that Thailand provides for technical cooperation is not directly financed by the Thai government. At the ministry level, a large part of Thailand\u2019s technical cooperation is financed by third-party international organisations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9a45f3ce-84ae-4665-a955-1c48309b7c62": {"__data__": {"id_": "9a45f3ce-84ae-4665-a955-1c48309b7c62", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategic-review-thailands-international-development-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strategic Review of Thailand\u2019s International Development Cooperation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategic-review-thailands-international-development-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ffe0a9c71b86a206a69cc593f8b140b455c7d817409d61de80fa44c6627fd03a"}}, "hash": "ffe0a9c71b86a206a69cc593f8b140b455c7d817409d61de80fa44c6627fd03a", "text": "These types of activities currently go unrecorded in ministerial submissions on ODA, as the ministries themselves are making no direct financial contributions. The size of financing of activities does not necessarily equate to the impact those activities have. Given Thailand\u2019s focus on supporting human capital development in the region, reporting solely on the costs of such activities may underestimate their value. Rather, it would be of value to get a better understanding of some of the long-term outputs of the cooperation that Thailand has offered. Information management is also not yet being used as a tool to support planning. ODA reporting is currently done retrospectively on actual financing or technical cooperation that has been provided. Many countries record both planned ODA commitments as well as actual disbursements to help both donor and recipient countries to plan their programmes of assistance. Information management is also not as yet widely seen as a tool for learning and improving the development cooperation offered. Over a number of years, the government will have accumulated considerable knowledge on country partners, international development trends, sample training programmes, project reports and evaluation. At present, there are seemingly no formal mechanisms to capture this information and synthesize the findings to support learning in the government. 34 Process for the recording of ODA could also be improved upon both between ministries and TICA, but also within ministries. It was suggested by agencies that responsibilities for reporting were often unclear with international cooperation bureaus within ministries and also implementing departments unsure as to who should be recording information and what should be reported. Recommendations: \uf0b7 Information on ODA should be viewed as a tool for government to analyze and make more effective its own development cooperation, rather than as a requirement for reporting to international organisations. In order to do this, TICA should make information on development cooperation more easily and readily available. Consideration should be given to developing a simple, password protected online database that could be used for both accessing and updating information on development cooperation directly by different focal points for the line ministries. \uf0b7 The information received from ministries should be organized in such a way that it shows cross- government support for technical cooperation in sector-based and country-based reports. \uf0b7 Clear guidance should be developed on those activities that should be recorded in the database on development cooperation. This guidance should encourage recording more comprehensive information on the cooperation activities undertaken including triangular cooperation arrangements financed by third parties. Where information is available for outputs from activities, this information should also be reported. Consideration should be given to providing a threshold under which the financial contributions of activities do not need to be recorded (e.g. THB 300,000). \uf0b7 Focal points for information management should be identified in each ministry and a small number of specialists identified in TICA to support and train focal points on recording information. TICA and NEDA should also designate focal points for the exchange of information on both planned activities as well as activities that have already been completed in order to facilitate the preparation of annual plans for bilateral support. \uf0b7 To encourage evaluation and learning, ministries and TICA should strengthen its knowledge management practices and put structures in place to centralize records of training programmes that have been completed, any project reports or evaluations as well as relevant documents on international trends or evaluations. 5.3 Monitoring and Evaluation 35 Recent years have seen a much greater focus on results of development cooperation amongst traditional donors. Given the fiscal constraints faced in many developed countries, aid budgets are increasingly under threat and governments are being challenged to demonstrate the impacts of aid provided and that value for money is being achieved with the resources used. As such aid is often closely linked to short-term targets that aim to measure progress. A number of tools are being used to evaluate the impact and effectiveness of aid including peer reviews of development cooperation are common amongst OECD donors, value for money audits, programme evaluation, as well as quite technical randomized control trials. TICA\u2019s strategic framework has also emphasized the importance of putting in place monitoring and evaluation systems. A useful starting point would be to identify what should be monitored and evaluated. At present, macro-level evaluation of the overall strength of Thailand\u2019s development cooperation is difficult given that there is not a unified framework against which the success of Thailand\u2019s cooperation can be judged. In the development of the master-plan, it would be useful to identify a number of metrics that could be to monitor Thailand\u2019s contribution to development.

Collating information on the support that has been provided by Thailand to key partners and seeking their viewpoints on what has worked well and what has worked less well would be of value. In a spirit of \u2018horizontality\u2019 there could be potential to agree upon two or three metrics against which Thailand and the respective partners would be measured. Processes for the evaluation of large technical cooperation initiatives could be strengthened. When NEDA provides concessional financing for the development of infrastructure, processes are in place for project appraisal and evaluation. NEDA is also responsible for reporting to the board on the progress of projects. Current processes for the evaluation of technical cooperation projects are less rigorous. This is due to a number of reasons: first, the sums involved in any single project are typically much smaller; secondly, the benefits of projects are more difficult to measure than the physical progress of a road construction project or an airport; thirdly, the sheer volume of technical cooperation projects undertaken by the government is much greater. Nevertheless, there are certain recurring large projects like the government scholarship programme that merit more robust monitoring and evaluation. It is also clear that committees and processes often do exist to systematically collate information on technical cooperation programmes. At present, however, there is seemingly no systematic feedback mechanism to use information and learning to inform future policy and programmes. Recommendations \uf0b7 A number of metrics should be identified against which Thailand\u2019s development cooperation can be monitored at a macro-level (at present, only the total amount of ODA is monitored). This might include at a high level certain outcome indicators in partner countries (e.g. employment levels, financial inclusion rates, human development indicators etc.); as well as output indicators (e.g. the kilometres of road built, the number of people trained, cooperation frameworks agreed etc.). 36 \uf0b7 Thailand should invite its priority partners to provide feedback on its overall country contributions in formally recorded and published annual review meetings. This would give the opportunity to revise and reorganize Thailand\u2019s development support, as well as identifying Thailand\u2019s strengths and weaknesses through a comprehensive feedback system. \uf0b7 Thailand should conduct some evaluations of its flagship technical cooperation programmes including, for example, the scholarship programme. \uf0b7 It would be useful to develop an annual report that reviews the progress of major technical- cooperation projects against a number of agreed metrics that could then be used in conjunction with the development of future plans and strategies. \uf0b7 This type of monitoring report could be used as a way of communicating to the public about the government\u2019s work on international development cooperation and the benefits for both Thailand and its partners. Communicating impacts and results would be a key accountability mechanism to the Thai public and also to Thailand\u2019s partners. 5.4 Development of Organisational Capabilities and Staff Development For TICA to become the experts in government on the design and implementation of technical cooperation to support human capital development, TICA needs to develop the capabilities to advising ministries on areas such as: \uf0b7 Latest international development trends, \uf0b7 The development needs of specific countries, \uf0b7 Guidelines on good practise for both bilateral and triangular cooperation In order to play this role, there is a need to lessen the current administrative responsibilities that constitute much of their overall work. Ideally, less time would be spent on \u2018turning the wheel\u2019 on long- standing programmes and more time dedicated to thinking through how Thailand\u2019s capabilities can be best channelled to supporting specific identified needs on a sustained basis. If TICA is to assist the government to develop integrated sector-based strategies for development cooperation, then consideration should be given to identifying certain sector focal points who can liaise with sector ministries. Some skills and training may be needed to give officers a foundation of understanding in their \u2018specialized\u2019 sector. Further, if technical cooperation programmes are to gain higher-level ownership within TICA\u2019s parent ministry, (the Ministry of Foreign Affairs), then there would be benefit in aiming to promote greater interchange of personnel and ideas between TICA and other departments in the Ministry. The provision of effective technical assistance does not depend only on \u2018experts\u2019 having the necessary technical skills.

Many ministries therefore suggested that TICA should play a role in providing training for these skills. There are however limitations to what can be achieved through short- term training.

Ideally, some minimum language skills might therefore be identified as a pre-requisite for undertaking technical missions unless facilities for translation are available. There may also be benefit in working with one of Thailand\u2019s partners on development of monitoring and evaluation criteria and skills. It might be possible, for example, to use a number of triangular projects that Thailand is involved in as a basis for developing M&E criteria for future bilateral projects. For example, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now planning to pursue a triangular project with JICA to implement development projects in Africa, utilizing JICA\u2019s findings and Thailand\u2019s specialized skills in various areas. As a framework is developed for the project, some generic guidelines for monitoring and evaluation could be developed in tandem. 38 6. Financing Analysis Historically, national contributions to development have predominantly been assessed by looking at the amount of aid provided, as a percentage of gross national income. While this is a useful measure, it is not the only relevant financing information when analysing development. This is demonstrated by the growing interest at the OECD in a broader range of \u2018development finance\u2019 flows. Further, as has been discussed, the provision of aid is just one policy tool that the Thai government has with which it can influence development. This analysis then: 1. Reviews the size and composition of the official development assistance that is being provided 2. Provides a comparison of ODA and other external finance flows to Thailand\u2019s key development partners 3. Looks at how the national budget is being used to promote Thailand\u2019s goals on international cooperation for development 6.1 Official Development Assistance TICA has been collating information on official development assistance for a number of years now and has records of ODA flows dating back to 1997. It has been suggested elsewhere that the figures compiled by TICA under-estimate the total amount of ODA as a result of ministries omitting technical cooperation activities that would be eligible for recording as ODA.10 Although it was evident during interviews that not all funds provided for training activities across the whole of government were being captured, activities were excluded mainly as result of being deemed too small to make it worthwhile to record. Even if ministerial contributions to technical cooperation were being underestimated by as much as 100%; they constitute a relatively small part of the overall figures for ODA and so would not greatly impact the overall figures. The ODA figures presented here exclude contributions from EXIM Bank. EXIM Bank has made large contributions in the past to infrastructure projects in both Lao PDR and Myanmar that are significantly larger than all other sources of ODA combined. For example, in 2008, the EXIM Bank provided THB1.75 billion towards the constructions of Nam Theun II Dam in Lao PDR, THB1.55 billion towards the development of a sugar refinery also in Lao PDR and THB1.03 billion to the Maldives towards hotel construction. These combined loans were double the size of all remaining ODA flows in that year. EXIM Bank continues to provide concessional finance to Thai companies for investments abroad. However, at present these are not systematically reported to TICA, as they are in support for commercial undertakings. Over the period, there has been a decline in the size of ODA provided, resulting primarily from declining loans provided by NEDA. Contributions to International Organisations and grants (including technical cooperation) have remained broadly flat over the period. 10 See for example Burns 2013). 39 Figure 3: Thai ODA, 2007-2012 Source: TICA ODA as a percentage of GDP is low and declining. As of 2012, ODA was recorded as THB1.1billion (USD37m equivalent), which is approximately 0.01% of GDP. By point of comparison, Table 1 shows estimates from 200611 of a number of middle income country contributions.

Figure 4: Proportion of ODA received by partners, 2007-2012 Source: TICA As of 2011, 31% of total ODA was used to provide financial assistance for infrastructure. The financial assistance provided has been concentrated on transport infrastructure and predominantly administered by NEDA. It has also been focused on a relatively small number of projects and provided only to neighbouring countries.

It involves: \uf0b7 A large number of countries (73 countries receive some form of technical assistance from TICA) \uf0b7 A large number of sectors \uf0b7 A large number of institutional players (18 agencies reported undertaking technical cooperation activities) \uf0b7 A large number of projects One of the findings of international research on aid effectiveness has been that fewer, larger projects tend to be more effective than lots of small projects. Many countries are reducing the number of countries that they provide aid to as a result. Denmark, for example, has recently announced it is withdrawing from 11 countries in order it can concentrate its assistance on 15 partner countries.12 The Netherlands is also reducing its assistance to 15 countries from 33. 13 Figure 6 and Figure 8 show that technical cooperation is fairly evenly split across a whole range of sectors at both the whole of government level and TICA. Overall, there is however a focus on the social sectors with 48% of total technical cooperation focused on social development, education and public health combined. Agriculture also receives 11% of technical cooperation expenditure. At a country level, technical cooperation is also split across a range of sectors. In Lao PDR ( Figure 7) the largest share of resources is channelled to education, economic cooperation (e.g. trade, finance, industry etc.) and health (22%, 14% and 11% respectively) support seemingly crosses a whole range of sectors. In Myanmar (Figure 9), the largest shares are to social development, agriculture and education (21%, 18% and 13% respectively). At present, TICA collates information on ODA projects on an institutional basis for each financial year. There would be benefit in TICA arranging the information collected to present reports that focus on specific countries and sectors over a number of years, to give an integrated view of the whole package of support being offered. Examples are provided here for Myanmar and the health sector (see Table 2 and Table 3). These reports show that the current ad-hoc approach to development cooperation means that there is a large amount of change in the support provided from one year to the next. The information provided is also highly disaggregated: individual one-off workshops may take place without necessarily being part of an ongoing strategic programme of support. It can also be seen that in a single sector, recipient governments may be dealing with three or four different counterparts from the Thai government. 12 http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/38/41/47866608.pdf

However, FDI in certain sectors has considerable scope to support job creation. For example, Thailand invested abroad US$312 million in the food, beverage and tobacco sector in 2011, which is typically labour intensive. 14 Further, where investments are made in mining and quarrying or electrical energy, when managed responsibly, those investments can make notable contributions to domestic resource mobilization. Lao PDR, for example, is targeting growing revenues in electrical energy and mining to raise taxation to support national development. Although estimates of remittance flows are unreliable, (particularly to Myanmar where transfers are predominantly made through an informal system called \u2018hundi\u2019 ), it is clear that they are also a substantial source of income for all of Thailand\u2019s neighbouring countries. Policies on migration and labour rights of migrant workers have implications on the availability of migrant labour and also the income that they generate. For example, policies aimed at supporting the regularisation of migrant workers can contribute to increases in wages and remittances for those workers. Further, reforms in the banking sector can also potentially encourage the use of formal channels for remitting income, which may have the potential to increase financial inclusion. Recently Siam Commercial Bank has abolished fees for remitting income to Myanmar with a view to gaining a greater share of remittance flows.

These funds are accessed by a range of sectors and are additional to the ongoing funds that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has historically had to finance ongoing work on international cooperation. Although the focus of this investment is largely internal and not eligible to be recorded as \u2018ODA\u2019 as such, some of the resources spent under this programme will support Thailand in its goals on development cooperation. For example, Thailand\u2019s ambition to set itself up as a \u2018knowledge hub\u2019 would require significant domestic investment in developing and administering appropriate academic programmes. Considerable investment is also focused on partnership and the exchange of ideas in the region. The Commission for Higher Education, for example, notes that funds for reciprocal university exchange programmes between ASEAN countries increased by 160% in the most recent budget from THB 10 million in 2012 to 26 million in 2013, while the funding for exchange programmes for other parts of the world has remained constant. Thailand also contributes to international development through public funds used domestically to promote regional connectivity and integration. Most notably, the government is currently considering borrowing THB 2 trillion for investments in a high-speed rail network with a view to strengthen regional transport connectivity. This would have implications for the costs of moving goods and people around the region. It is worth noting that it is not possible to directly link budget allocations to standardized reporting requirements on ODA. There are financial flows that are eligible to be recorded as ODA flows that would not be found in the budget (for example, concessional loans made by NEDA or EXIM Bank that are not fully financed from the budget). Conclusions and recommendations \uf0b7 Given the relatively small sums involved in technical cooperation, there may be benefit in focusing interventions in fewer sectors and in more sustained programmes. It is unlikely that one-off activities with no follow up will contribute to sustained capacity development. \uf0b7 Organising information on ODA by country and by sector is a useful way to begin to integrate thinking about how to adopt a more coordinated approach to development across government \uf0b7 Government policies that influence investment flows and remittances merit consideration as tools to influence development. \uf0b7 In conjunction with development of a master-plan on development cooperation, consideration could be given to how the budget classification could be used to monitor budgetary allocations to priorities set out in the plan. 47 7. Conclusions and Recommendations A number of recommendations have been made at the end of each of the sections of this paper. These recommendations can be grouped into a number of areas: Recommendations for setting the overall strategic direction of development cooperation These recommendations are possibly the most important, but also the most ambitious and difficult to address. \uf0b7 It is recommended that the Thai government develops a master-plan that articulates a common, government position on what its objectives are in the field of international development \uf0b7 Parameters should be agreed on what tools it wishes to consider with regard to the achievement of the goals set out in the master plan. Consideration should be given to looking beyond aid instruments \uf0b7 The master-plan should serve as a guide to support the prioritisation of technical cooperation in fewer, larger programmes. \uf0b7 The master-plan should then act as basis for o Developing sector-based strategic plans in key priority sectors o Developing country strategies for priority countries that outline opportunities where Thailand\u2019s own international development strategy is aligned to country needs. o Reviewing the alignment of international and domestic partners and Thailand\u2019s own strategy to identify priority partners for supporting the achievement of the development goals. \uf0b7 A situation analysis could also be undertaken that reviews how Thailand\u2019s ambitions to be a knowledge hub could address specific sector and country development priorities and the potential partners to support those ambitions. Recommendations for institutional structures and coordination If the policy recommendations are to be followed institutional structures would need to be put in place to implement such an agenda. \uf0b7 Consideration should be given to forming a cross-ministerial grouping to oversee the development and implementation of a cross-government international development policy. This could involve creating a new commission or building into the mandates of existing relevant committees (e.g. the Economic and Technical Cooperation Committee). \uf0b7 Large ministries would also benefit from similar commissions in order to support inter-ministerial policy coordination. \uf0b7 At a country-level, mechanisms could be put in place to better coordinate country strategies", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3f575af4-47e9-4888-9d08-fc545049aa13": {"__data__": {"id_": "3f575af4-47e9-4888-9d08-fc545049aa13", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategic-review-thailands-international-development-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strategic Review of Thailand\u2019s International Development Cooperation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategic-review-thailands-international-development-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "40444cbe4ac2994da7afab4a58403a4e91ab39a95960a4aeb59c2c20727853ac"}, "3": {"node_id": "cef97dd7-56d3-4e46-8cd3-55c96cc30f23", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategic-review-thailands-international-development-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "858a6ea40c7a53dca000bfa04afa611fc03b12bb42da8be4d71d468205abd2ff"}}, "hash": "9ecef18cc793329c5c3818656549d9b00a9d6182937894c877d29b171bc27874", "text": "and plans for key partners. \uf0b7 If TICA is to ensure that proposed technical cooperation is aligned with the strategic priorities of ministries, then consideration should be given to identifying certain sector focal points who can liaise with relevant agencies. 48 Recommendations for organisational capabilities and capacity There are a number of systems improvements that could be put in place relatively easily that would support improved effectiveness of existing programming. These include: Information management \uf0b7 Information should be exchange on planned support for development cooperation from key agencies (e.g. NEDA, OHEC) as well as recording ODA retrospectively. This would lead to improved coordination and also enable Thailand to present a full package of coordinated support. \uf0b7 The information received from ministries should be organized in such a way that it shows cross- government support for technical cooperation in sector-based and country-based reports to better communicate internally and with partners a \u2018whole-of-government\u2019 approach to development cooperation. \uf0b7 Clear guidance should be developed on those activities that should be recorded in the database on development cooperation. This guidance should encourage recording more comprehensive information on the cooperation activities undertaken including triangular cooperation arrangements financed by third parties. \uf0b7 Focal points for information management should be identified in each ministry and a small number of specialists identified in TICA to support and train focal points on recording information. Monitoring and Evaluation \uf0b7 It would be useful to develop an annual report that reviews the progress of major technical- cooperation projects against a number of agreed metrics (with country partners) that could then be used in conjunction with the development of future plans and strategies. \uf0b7 Thailand should conduct some evaluations of its flagship technical cooperation programmes including, for example, the scholarship programme. \uf0b7 Thailand should invite its priority partners to provide feedback on its overall country contributions at formally recorded annual review meetings. Knowledge management and training \uf0b7 Much of the knowledge that the government has on development cooperation is not formally captured. It would be useful to put in formal structures to capture information on: o Latest international development trends, o The development needs of specific countries, o Guidelines on good practise for both bilateral and triangular cooperation \uf0b7 Thailand should proactively use its international partners to support it to address its existing skills gaps in technical cooperation 49 References Asian Development Bank. 2013.

Nevertheless, they remain fragmented, inadequate and inequitable. While social protection schemes are developed in response to specific country needs and contexts, and are greatly different in terms of scope and sectoral focus, there are areas where countries can learn from one another. One such area pertains to the governance and institutional set-up for effective implementation of social protection, particularly at the local level. Building on the existing partnership between UNDP and UNCDF, the regional analysis on Strengthening the Governance of Social Protection: The Role of Local Government provides an overview of the current situation in the delivery of social protection programmes in some selected countries in Asia. Particular attention has been given to non-contributory social transfers, which are considered to be the main instruments targeted specifically at poor and vulnerable people, and which are financed from general government revenues. Furthermore, it presents an analysis of the present de-jure and de-facto mandates and functions of local governments to deliver different types of social protection programmes. Exploring this linkage brings a new perspective to examine the ways in which de facto local-level involvement can be optimized to make the delivery of social protection more equitable, particularly benefitting the most marginalised and vulnerable. As the local governments already play a significant role, they can provide an institutional framework to ensure that social protection schemes are adapted to different geographical and socio-economic contexts and that disaggregated data are available for evidence-informed decision making and policy-setting. Improving the role of local government in implementing effective social protection is an integral part of the efforts to achieve inclusive growth and development in the Asia-Pacific region. Social protection will inevitably play an important role in the Post-2015 agenda as it is an important redistributive measure that can contribute significantly to addressing issues of rights, equity, sustainability and national ownership. Given the support provided at the local level in many of our partner countries by both UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre (APRC) and UNCDF, through its Regional Office for Asia-Pacific, the two organisations have collaborated in the past few years to initiate the discussions around local governance and social protection. Building on the discussion paper on Local Government and Social Protection: Making Service Delivery Available for the Most Vulnerable1, the current regional analysis highlights some key lessons learned from 7 countries, including Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Mongolia, Nepal and Timor-Leste. These countries were identified based on countries\u2019 expressed self-interest to participate, as well as potential for future programming and technical support opportunities. We hope that the findings will be useful for our national and local partners to formulate and implement programmes that can address their specific challenges related to the effective delivery", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0362453a-0de1-4429-8de4-0ea8e5402e4e": {"__data__": {"id_": "0362453a-0de1-4429-8de4-0ea8e5402e4e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-governance-social-protection-role-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strengthening the Governance of Social Protection: The Role of Local Government", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-governance-social-protection-role-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "495b0d37e1fb0ea13c9870bc7ae72bb204bf8aac48e5c4cf3c1ac74160a142eb"}, "3": {"node_id": "13aea99e-0d1e-435c-978a-baaf504db19a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-governance-social-protection-role-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "34dbb9d445ab7b1f3ba833697c0cf5c94fc5a34ba1bed957725270560cfe68bb"}}, "hash": "00634eb34025a7cdf0842598539428db603441cfa7d974e32c42f374303dc10c", "text": "of social protection at the local level for the marginalised.

The economic and financial crises of the 1990s led to an increased interest in social protection, a trend which continued over the last ten years as a result of the global financial crisis, rising energy and food prices, and heightened risks of climate-related disasters. These global changes coincided with increased levels of inequality both within and across countries, and increased constraints placed upon governments to finance social expenditure while grappling with ageing populations. In spite of this, there have been positive impacts as a result of social protection, as a short-term poverty reduction instrument and as a tool to reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).2 Social protection is a powerful policy instrument for reducing poverty and vulnerability, as well as promoting inclusive growth. Social protection is usually understood to consist of two sets of instruments: 1) social insurance or contributory systems, through which participants acquire a right to transfers to cover situations of ill-health, accident or disability, unemployment and old age; and 2) social assistance systems, based on transfers that are not linked to prior contributions, but are instead financed from the general tax system, to assist low income and vulnerable groups3. Increased focus on the social dimensions of development has prompted more research to be conducted on social protection, which has produced a body of evidence and stimulated debate. Evaluation studies have been conducted, to assess the impact of social protection programmes on the reduction of social and economic vulnerabilities. Design and implementation questions have also received significant attention, as have financial issues4, targeting and conditionality5.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "13aea99e-0d1e-435c-978a-baaf504db19a": {"__data__": {"id_": "13aea99e-0d1e-435c-978a-baaf504db19a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-governance-social-protection-role-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strengthening the Governance of Social Protection: The Role of Local Government", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-governance-social-protection-role-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "495b0d37e1fb0ea13c9870bc7ae72bb204bf8aac48e5c4cf3c1ac74160a142eb"}, "2": {"node_id": "0362453a-0de1-4429-8de4-0ea8e5402e4e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-governance-social-protection-role-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "00634eb34025a7cdf0842598539428db603441cfa7d974e32c42f374303dc10c"}}, "hash": "34dbb9d445ab7b1f3ba833697c0cf5c94fc5a34ba1bed957725270560cfe68bb", "text": "Considerable research has also been undertaken to explore the impact of social protection on other sectors, such as health, education, agriculture, and labour.6 However, issues related to governance, institutional arrangements and social protection have received remarkably little attention to date; those related to local governance, in particular, have largely remained unconsidered. With the scaling up of many programmes from pilots to the national level, more work is needed to improve the governance and institutional dimensions related to the delivery of effective social protection. How programmes are organized, how they are financed, how effective and efficient they are in delivering social protection services, and how administrative capacity is strengthened are important questions. 2 U.N.

Given that local government is generally seen as a major delivery arm of public services, due to its close geographic proximity to beneficiaries, it is also important in the context of social protection programmes. Local government is also often considered to be able to provide services in a relatively efficient and cost-effective way, thereby contributing to the administrative sustainability of service delivery.7 Nevertheless, the role of local government and the extent to which it can fulfil these functions varies greatly in different social and political contexts. Generally, social protection programmes aim to strengthen the \u2018demand side\u2019 of service delivery. Conditional cash transfers, for example, provide benefit payments to recipient households provided that they use public services such as education or health, and so generate increased demand for such services. Unconditional transfers potentially have the same effect, as benefit payments provide recipients with an income supplement that may enable them to enhance their access to public or other services. An increase in demand for public services, generated through social transfers to households, needs to be linked to adequate and improved delivery and supply of services. Given that local government often has a key role to play in ensuring access to and the supply of public services, it must also play a role in delivering social protection. Local government is of specific importance for social protection in two ways: as an implementer of social protection programmes in its own right; and as a coordinator of services across different sectors in order to maximize and strengthen development outcomes. Local government also has a role to play in implementing gender-responsive social protection interventions that account for gender-specific risk and vulnerabilities through beneficiary selection and targeting. This paper provides some insights into this. Purpose of the regional analysis This joint United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) paper aims to build on an earlier discussion paper, \u2018Local Government and Social Protection: Making Service Delivery Available for the Most Vulnerable,\u20198 to examine the role of local government and local governance in the delivery of social protection programmes. This paper looks to extend beyond that initial discussion, to identify key functions and mandates for local governments, and explore areas where local governments could add value to the delivery of social protection programmes. This paper focuses on social assistance systems, and will look at: conditional and unconditional cash and in-kind transfers; public works programmes; and emergency related transfers designed to mitigate shocks such as food, financial, and fuel crises, natural disasters, and/or climate-related risks. It does not intend to contribute to any conceptual debate on general social protection issues, such as universal vs. targeted approaches, conditional vs. unconditional or food vs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "98940d93-40d1-4834-87b8-364b927c86d8": {"__data__": {"id_": "98940d93-40d1-4834-87b8-364b927c86d8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-governance-social-protection-role-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strengthening the Governance of Social Protection: The Role of Local Government", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-governance-social-protection-role-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d93829b8ae0cecadf5b560ccded04a4ea193f2770cec72be7f378c707bdd88e3"}, "2": {"node_id": "6e470769-fff1-4718-b737-cb91b47c4f04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-governance-social-protection-role-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "73d08737905382ad87d1718164b1f6a0a161fbc6a818291f4fef2be2673670fd"}}, "hash": "d509541bdf98fcc72281fb7bea685411173201ede5478bd4bef8d57c1de50725", "text": "targeted approaches, conditional vs. unconditional or food vs. cash transfers, these will only be discussed to the extent to which they influence the governance dynamics of social protection programmes.

Map out current institutional and governance arrangements for the implementation of social protection programmes at the local level; ii. Provide a general assessment of the efficiency and effectiveness of local governments in delivering social protection; and iii. Examine the ways in which de facto local level involvement can be improved to make the delivery of social protection more equitable, so that it benefits the most marginalized and vulnerable. It also aims to identify specific roles local government can play in: i. The delivery of social protection services; and ii. Linking and coordinating social protection services with a range of other public services and programmes across policy sectors and with non-government actors. Clarifying these issues and improving such arrangements may lead to a more holistic delivery of social services with better outcomes and ensure that social protection services are not delivered in isolation. Approach This paper is based on a desk review, and aims to provide an overview of general issues and an examination of social protection programmes in seven countries from across Asia and the Pacific: Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Mongolia, Nepal and Timor-Leste. Documents reviewed included: national social protection and decentralisation strategy papers, operational programme manuals, impact and process evaluation reports, project briefs, progress reports, and key messages delivered by governments, donors and research institutes. In addition, government websites were used in order to better understand local government structures and processes. For conceptual issues, literature consulted included a range of comparative case studies that looked at the role of local government in the delivery of social welfare, both in Western and Central European countries and in the Asia-Pacific Region. In order to complement and triangulate information on programmes, telephone interviews were conducted with UNDP and UNCDF in-country focal points on decentralisation and/or social protection. In some countries, interviews were also conducted with representatives from government and/or donor organizations involved in social protection. A functional matrix was developed, to identify the roles and responsibilities undertaken by different levels of government and non-government partners (development partners, NGOs, civil society) in the delivery of services and the functions of social protection programmes (financing, legal framework, targeting, delivery, etc.). This approach allowed for a systematic assessment of the role of local government in various social protection programmes and comparison across different programme types and countries. This paper is organized into three main sections. The first introduces the concepts of decentralisation and local government, and briefly outlines social protection as a service delivery sector. The second section provides an overview of the role of local government at the frontline of social protection delivery, and discusses context- specific issues that influence the capacity of local government to deliver social protection. Finally, the third section provides a set of recommendations for possible strategic entry points and support options for strengthening local government involvement in the delivery of social protection. This research highlights that, in most countries, social protection programmes are highly fragmented and characterised by poor governance and weak institutional capacity. \u201c \u201c Strengthening the Governance of Social Protection 7 Country and programme selection for review Countries were selected to provide an overview from across the sub-regions of Asia, to account for middle income and least developed countries, varying geographical features and national contexts, to give a broad picture of needs, realities and priorities. The selected countries all have social protection programmes in place, although there is great variance in programme consolidation and coverage. In some countries, social protection programmes have national outreach (for example, in Indonesia, Bangladesh and Nepal); in others, a number of programmes are in a pilot phase, and only cover a small portion of their target group (for example, the Bolsa Da Mae conditional cash transfer programme in Timor-Leste). In each country a maximum of three social protection programmes was selected for review, which resulted in 19 programmes overall.9 This paper focused only on social assistance and non-contributory programmes, including health related transfers (for example, maternity benefits), education related transfers, employment related transfers (for example, public works), emergency related transfers to cope with shocks such as food, financial, and fuel crises, natural disasters, and or climate-related risks. In all, the study included: (i) six cash transfer programmes; (ii) five conditiona
