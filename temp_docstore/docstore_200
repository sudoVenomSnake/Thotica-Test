The specific nature of volunteering makes reporting on the volunteers\u2019 role and contributions, as well as his or her motivations and skills development difficult. (Hirst, 2001). In addition, there is limited research available on the link between different support structures in place for volunteers within volunteer programmes which impact employability (Rochester, 2009).

PAGE 6 ISSUE BRIEF Regional Overview The region of Asia and the Pacific contains more than 60 percent of the world\u2019s total population, including over a billion young people aged 15-29 (UN DESA, 2017). From 1950 to 2010, the region has seen a continuous increase of the youth population leading to a youth bulge phenomenon, where the labor force outnumbers those outside of the working age population (ILO, 2015b). The Challenge of Youth Employment Compared to the other regions of the world, the Asia- Pacific region has one of the lowest unemployment rates with an estimated average of 11 percent in 2017; however, significant sub-regional variation is present. Youth unemployment in the region has grown since 2007, leaving young people 3.8 times more likely to be unemployed than adults (ILO, 2017a). Across Asia, the trends remain mixed, as visible in the graph below. In the Pacific Island countries, youth unemployment remains a big challenge. For example, in Fiji the youth unemployment rate was 18.2 percent in 2016 (Fiji Bureau of Statistics, 2017). The low regional average of youth unemployment is, however, marked by decent work deficits and high levels of informality. In fact, the current labor market reality of Asia and the Pacific has extremely high degrees of informal employment and vulnerable employment. When young people have found access to employment, very often the quality of employment is of concern, with a majority of jobs not qualifying as \u2018decent work\u2019. According to the ILO, decent work encompasses opportunities for employment that are productive and deliver a fair income, security in the workplace and social protection for families, better prospects for personal development and social integration. Furthermore, the position must also ensure freedom for people to express their concerns, organize and participate in the decisions that affect their lives, and equality of opportunity and treatment for all women and men. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), vulnerable and/or informal types of employment are almost an inescapable reality for young people from a low income background. In higher income countries (HICs) temporary and other non-standard forms of employment are becoming the norm (O\u2019Higgins, 2017). There is also a prevalence of part-time work in certain countries (ILO, 2015a). High levels of youth underemployment point to difficulties in securing an adequate place in the labor market, as well as to underutilized productive capacity. Informality in the region covers traditionally own- account workers with or without employees, workers in small unregistered companies, workers contributing to family businesses, and workers not receiving annual leave and/or social security. Informal employment accounts for as much as 85 percent of non-agricultural employment in India and 73 percent in Indonesia (McKinsey & Company, 2015).

The formality of employment is the best indicator for job quality: formality is linked to greater job stability, higher income and access to other benefits, such as pensions and health care (Kring and Breglia, 2015). Young women and men experience different employment patterns than the rest of the population. According to the World Bank, young people face particular difficulties in entering the labor market and are more greatly affected by economic fluctuations (Biavaschi et al., 2012). Most of the region has experienced a transition from agriculture to low- wage industrial production, and via the development of technology and a high-tech industry to a service- based economy (Asian Development Bank, 2015). The labor market continues to face challenges, such as economic slowdown in China, regional rapid population growth, changes within the workplace, skills shortages, and others. This is accompanied by little employment growth predictions for the near future due to the problem of \u2018jobless growth\u2019 of economies across Asia and the Pacific. Across the region, young people are more educated than the adult population but also experience more vulnerability, which can be seen, for example, in teenagers\u2019 concentration in low-quality jobs (ILO, 2014). Despite increasing education rates, a large part of the region\u2019s youth do not have secondary education, including general or quality Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) (Liu, 2013). The entry into employment is further hindered by informal recruitment and challenges during the formal recruitment processes, including a large amount of young people across Asia struggling to provide correct information on recruitment forms (HR in Asia, 2017). In Cambodia, a former volunteer from a wealthier background with schooling in Europe explained her and her friends resort to local headhunters when searching employment, since the hunt for higher paying jobs in the business sector is very difficult without personal contacts to firms and employers in Phnom Penh. Former and current volunteers from Indonesia and Cambodia, both UN Volunteers and volunteers from other organizations or contexts, see their peers struggling to gain employment that qualifies as decent work. The volunteers explained how secondary education is still not available to many young men and women, their families considering it too expensive or even too dangerous.

A volunteer from Indonesia acknowledged her friends struggled to fill in job applications, as this is not taught in school nor university, and their parents are unable to assist with the recruitment processes having changed drastically. Despite increasing education rates on average across the region, education and recruitment remain barriers for young people to entering the labor force. Effects of Youth Unemployment Though the region\u2019s youth unemployment rates are better than those of other parts of the world, it is important to acknowledge the effects of unemployment on young people. Global studies and research suggests unemployment among young people has a negative impact on human and social capital, especially during prolonged unemployment (IAVE, 2013). Some researchers claim prolonged unemployment may permanently impair productive potential and, thus, influence long-term personal development, as well as patterns of employment, pay and unemployment (Matsumoto et al., 2012). High unemployment rates can create or reinforce marginalization within communities, as well as cause the breakup of communities as young people migrate to find work.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9ebcc2dd-87f7-4953-a44d-5be8357d6c08": {"__data__": {"id_": "9ebcc2dd-87f7-4953-a44d-5be8357d6c08", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-volunteerism-and-skills-development-economic-empowerment-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Youth Volunteerism and Skills Development for Economic Empowerment in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-volunteerism-and-skills-development-economic-empowerment-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2cdd1f8c161ceeba63f11a526eee8d91ba3331a159cad60b278c8a3cd8d92e1f"}, "2": {"node_id": "d03ecfc5-1776-483d-adbb-e7620ea942af", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-volunteerism-and-skills-development-economic-empowerment-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "375c05bb33685b1dd65d822486798374bfe66710809a35ae34d2107853d662df"}}, "hash": "24c418732ae09b1c0644ab2de6901041f36431511b505912477cfc2774354a1f", "text": "Unemployment also leads to an increase in the number of young people seeking employment in dangerous or illegal work and can increase the occurrence of social unrest as research links youth unemployment and high risk behaviors as well as social and political turbulence (Matsumoto et al., 2012).

YOUTH VOLUNTEERISM AND ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT PAGE 9 Growth of NEETs, Inactivity and Discouragement The percentage of young people who are neither in employment, nor education and training (NEET) in Asia and the Pacific is 23.3 percent (ILO, 2017a). In Indonesia, for example, over 60 percent of NEETs have a junior secondary level of education and a quarter has at least a senior secondary education (ILO, 2015a). Young women NEET represent the largest portion of this group, but tend to have the same levels of education as young men. The reasons for this phenomenon are culturally driven tendencies as women often perform domestic duties and raise children. Many young people who are inactive and not enrolled in any education have high levels of human capital, encompassing their knowledge, habits, social and personality attributes, which constitute an important amount of lost productivity represented by NEETs. The portion of inactive youth does not appear to be declining over time; rather, it is increasing due to higher more and longer enrollment in school. In many countries in Asia and the Pacific, especially in emerging economies, no career services are featured in formal education or TVET and many youth policies and institutions do not yet address the issue of youth unemployment sufficiently. Nonetheless, governments in the region are becoming increasingly conscious and take more targeted action, for example with the first ASEAN Youth Development Index published in 2017, or at the national level with the 2017-2019 Marshall Islands National Action Plan on Youth Employment for example. \u201cThis is something that is lacking in Indonesia: young people don\u2019t know how to prepare their CV or how to do interviews. These are skills that aren\u2019t taught in school, no communication or organizational skills [are taught], or how to be a team player.\u201d - Melania Niken, Volunteer in child protection PAGE 10 ISSUE BRIEF While industrialized economies in HICs see new forms of digital labor (Graham et al., 2017) and digital talent platforms gain increasing importance (McKinsey & Company, 2015), a large majority of labor markets across Asia and the Pacific still consists of informal and low-skill employment. This section of the Issue Brief examines the skills employers are seeking, both required skills and those not required but which will improve. Current demand of skills Many studies and available data does not provide much insight into local and regional job performance in terms of skills utilization, nor into the perspective of employers on how well their employees utilize their skills and what skill needs should be anticipated for the future (OECD, 2017a). However, the importance of skills anticipation and the issue of skill mismatches is gaining increasing importance in research and policy. The ILO, for example, has undertaken two Labor Demand Enterprise Surveys (LDES) in Nepal and Vietnam. It should be noted, in the Asia-Pacific region, a large portion of jobs come from micro, small and medium enterprises (SMEs). In South-East Asia, SMEs account for over half of all employment. Thus, the role of SMEs as employers and their demand for skills is crucial. Employability consists of employment-related human and social capital, which are the skills and personal attributes considered important by the industry and which graduates must obtain in order to secure employment (Bridgstock, 2009; Holmes, 2013). Thus, a person with high employability is more likely to find employment (Kamerad and Paine, 2014). A distinction is made between hard skills, which are job-specific, technical skills, and soft skills, such as communication, problem solving, teamwork, adaptability, and others. Studies report a trend of mismatched skills in the labor market across the region. Higher unemployment rates among the most educated youth imply a mismatch between education and skills demand in the labor market (NIS and ILO, 2013). There is an increasing focus on making TVET relevant to the socio- economic context and more inclusive.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "479755c4-7fcc-415b-9837-52f8d846882b": {"__data__": {"id_": "479755c4-7fcc-415b-9837-52f8d846882b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-volunteerism-and-skills-development-economic-empowerment-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Youth Volunteerism and Skills Development for Economic Empowerment in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-volunteerism-and-skills-development-economic-empowerment-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e33255cae6acce14c5103553308babfbea1f187371274cdb93fbaa34cbb573d8"}, "2": {"node_id": "3f922401-750c-4949-ba31-cc590ecbacdd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-volunteerism-and-skills-development-economic-empowerment-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "41d260403f1d54ea08b3e322be91ceca100cac339b09343b41e4c79685a72b40"}}, "hash": "9c50a55524b1cc1af10f07b210fe64a2319fb6f3df2ca20aa10e71f9c3a3b466", "text": "Understanding the demand side is of high importance, which requires an examination of the nature of skills demanded by employers and the optimal utilization of those competencies in the workplace (OECD, 2017a).

Results from completed labor demand surveys in the region show employers tend to rate discipline, job-appropriate skills and technical knowledge as the most important for their employees. In Nepal, the two most important characteristics they look for in candidates are education or training and work experience (46.1 percent and 38.4 percent respectively) (ILO, 2014a). Another preference employers in Nepal indicated was to hire adults over the age of 29, further reinforcing the current difficulty young people face when entering the labor market (ILO, 2014a). The Labor Skill Demand YOUTH VOLUNTEERISM AND ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT PAGE 11 As part of the LDEzS in Nepal, local formal employers were also asked about occupations they perceived as opening up in the next two to three years. The majority of questioned enterprises were in manufacturing (72 percent), followed by accommodation and food services (7.8 percent), wholesale and retail trade (6.1 percent) and agriculture, forestry and fishing. The results reveal a very weak demand for highly skilled workers, which is yet another indication graduates in these contexts face poor employment prospects in the immediate future. The occupations perceived to experience the most recruiting in Nepal were precision workers in metal and related materials at 13.1 percent and manufacturing laborers at 11.5 percent (ILO, 2015b). Anticipating future changes to the labor market in the region due to an increase of Information and communications technology (ICT) and technology, a change in skills demand can be foreseen, based on studies from HICs with technologically advanced and economies. The research indicates jobs requiring some ICT skills also require a strong level of complementary skills, such as foundation skills (literacy, numeracy), soft skills (planning and organization) and behavioral skills (communication and teamwork) (IFTF, 2016). Employment that requires advanced ICT skills depends on employees being able to solve problems, learn, adapt, and apply new methods and technologies as well as in- depth technical knowledge. Furthermore, jobs using ICT increasingly require a foreign language, with English becoming a prerequisite in more places of employment in formal employment in HICs. While jobs in the region do not yet feature ICT requirements nearly as often as in technologically advanced regions, some LMICs in Asia and the Pacific are seeing this increase already. It is, however, important to recall this trend tends to be limited to the formal sector, which remains small due to informality predominating many big labor markets in the region. In fact, skill supply and demand vary drastically across the region, making it difficult to provide trends and meaningful assumptions for all of Asia and the Pacific. HICs with industrialized economies have put into place professional skills development programmes, as part of their formal education systems and through specialized training programmes. For example, Australia already uses marked-based mechanisms to steer TVET programmes, with 5,000 registered training organizations delivering nationally recognized courses within an accredited Australian Qualifications Framework. In China, the New Enterprise-based Apprenticeship Program was launched in 2015 to involve employers in the provision of job-related training adapted to their skill needs in joint action with local institutions. Thanks to the close regional ties between countries, governments of LMICs can learn from such programmes, with ample opportunity for bilateral or regional collaboration to close the economic and development gaps throughout the region. In LMICs, many young workers cannot afford to join training programmes or to volunteer since their employment and income needs are immediate in order to support themselves and their family. These circumstances prevent them from of investing in skills development or a prolonged period of employment search to find the best employment opportunity. For example, factory work provides an immediate route to earn money while government training programmes delay earnings by weeks, if not months or years. When facing a choice between low-skill work and skills development, many young people in Asia and the Pacific choose the low-skill labor force (UNV, 2017). When no immediate low-skill employment opportunities are available, many young people All young former and current volunteers interviewed for this study shared their impression and experience that the decisive elements during recruitment are technical skills and professional experience. Employers recruiting high-skill labor might value the mention of appropriate soft skills on a job application, but seemingly do not base their recruitment decisions on them.

Some LMICs are taking action on reducing the skills gap, for example the Philippines with its National Technical Education and Skills Development Plan 2011-2016, which works with secondary and tertiary schooling systems as well as specific training and apprentice programmes in enterprises, communities and provincial training centers. In India, the public- private partnership titled National Skills Development Corporation works to create better training capacities in a variety of occupations (Palanivel, 2016). In Vanuatu, the National Youth Development Policy reforms curricula to better match the skills in demand in the labor market, including integrating ICT skills into the training (ILO, 2016a). Labor Skills Demand in the Future In order to facilitate policy development, the future trends in skills demand have to be anticipated. What are the professional skills employers will require in the near and far future? Firstly, putting skills to better use in the workplace is important for workers, firms and broader society. From the perspective of the employee, a better use of skills is associated with job related well-being (Morrison et al., 2005). Poor use of skills creates job dissatisfaction and can be related to increased turnover (Felstead et al., 2017; Okay-Sommerville and Scholarios, 2013). Secondly, the differences and sub-regional variation across the Asia-Pacific region is of importance here as well. For example, Singapore has experienced impressive economic growth and has a comprehensive workforce training system. In comparison, emerging economies such as Cambodia still see the informal sector dominating the labor market in the near future. In the short-term and foreseeable future, social capital will remain relevant to employment, which includes an individual\u2019s professional contacts, networks, employment leads and social relationships (Spera et al. 2013). As the supply of skills from formal education is failing (Liu, 2013), the gap for non- repetitive cognitive skills will remain. Though today\u2019s labor market of the Asia-Pacific region is not yet dominated by ICT, it is undeniable technology is changing the world of work by job substitution, job creation and job transformation (Cedefop, 2017). Innovation cycles are becoming much faster, and big data, cloud computing, 3D-printing and the platform economy are changing product markets, business models and work, and skill needs. This change does not limit its effects on HICs with industrialized economies only. For example, in 2017, India\u2019s $160 billion IT industry laid off more than 56,000 employees, which some analysts believe was a worse spree than the one during the 2008 financial crisis (Quartz, 2017). CEOs of IT companies themselves stated that digitization and automation brought about a disruption of traditional roles, leading to a reassessment of the capability of companies\u2019 talent pools in order to stay market relevant. The wave of layoffs was targeted at employees from all levels with outdated skills. In the long run, automation is likely to increase the number of jobs for workers with niche skill sets, but lower- level workers will face increased unemployment. Nearly one-third (700,000 people) of the low- skilled workers in India\u2019s IT sector stand to lose their jobs by 2022, but less than 5 percent of Indian tech employees are equipped to handle high-skilled jobs, such as data scientist and data analyst due to a lack of trained talent (Quartz, 2017). Today, the reach of digitalization and automation is greater: in the past, technology replaced mainly routine, low-skilled manual work. Now it can perform non-routine work, such as financial market analyses, surgery and legal searches. Technology is polarizing the labor market, creating high-skilled, well-paid jobs and low-skilled, low-pay jobs, hollowing out the middle of the labor scale. New technology sectors also tend to employ fewer people per company, though the ICT boom has created many new jobs that did not exist before. In 2017, this influenced the garment industry with a number of big factories shutting down in Asia, which is a big part of some of the largest economies in the region.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5cdca5a9-adad-41bc-b63c-e98fd7bece97": {"__data__": {"id_": "5cdca5a9-adad-41bc-b63c-e98fd7bece97", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-volunteerism-and-skills-development-economic-empowerment-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Youth Volunteerism and Skills Development for Economic Empowerment in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-volunteerism-and-skills-development-economic-empowerment-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "09259cd31996dc4821c15a66972345b9c84049837b0a422a2e94abd6bf7f170d"}, "2": {"node_id": "6a629667-ae8d-4954-8a13-37fc38092cfc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-volunteerism-and-skills-development-economic-empowerment-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4916da157558c7fcc3c9c9db392be1003be058ed1a1621d2d5396e4788565161"}}, "hash": "08441c35dc123b92b9060c550fc5c5aa41441befe0aff17ea1abacba812d3691", "text": "The low labor costs in Asia are starting to lose the fight against automation: ILO estimates about YOUTH VOLUNTEERISM AND ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT PAGE 13 56 percent of employment in Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam is at a high risk of being automated in the next decade or two, with clothing and footwear manufacturing jobs among the hardest hit (ILO, 2016b).

The skill forecasts for these contexts suggest that jobs in the future will combine digital with technical, soft and behavioral skills. Jobs expected to decline until 2025 are skilled agricultural workers, crafts and related trades and clerks. Those expected to grow are professionals in business, administration, ICT, science and engineering, requiring more advanced cognitive (literacy, numeracy, foreign languages, problem- solving, learning to learn) and non-cognitive skills (communication, planning, customer service). Technology can perform tasks and rapidly collect and synthesize data but people must decide what the tasks should be and what the data mean. Therefore, required workplace skills will shift to the ability to solve problems and make decisions (IFTF, 2016). Employers will also seek applied knowledge, which is the ability to logically analyse information, as well as people skills that focus on cross-cultural competence, social intelligence and virtual collaboration (IFTF, 2016). Technological change will accelerate skill obsolescence, meaning most future skills adjustment must take place in the workplace during adult life. Entrepreneurship Many current policies and programmes envision entrepreneurship as an option to create employment for young people in Asia and the Pacific. Encouraging youth entrepreneurship and self-employment has many benefits, as young people are able to create decent work opportunities for themselves and others, while contributing to the economic development of their country. In addition, the experience of developing a business can teach an invaluable set of skills to entrepreneurs. In the Asia-Pacific region, entrepreneurship mainly covers SMEs, which account for an average of 96 percent of all enterprises and 62 percent of the national labor forces (ADB, 2014). The vast majority of these SMEs are small businesses and enterprises, as opposed to tech startups. Entrepreneurship is by far no easy option, regardless of whether the business endeavor is a small shop or a tech startup. Young people especially experience difficulty accessing credit due to a lack of credit history. They are also limited by the shortage of savings, strict credit-scoring regulations, long waiting periods and complicated documentation procedures (Schoof, 2006). A volunteer from Indonesia explained her plan to launch her startup project once she got married. She sees marriage, with support from her future spouse, as her enabling environment to start a small business. She commented that, as a young female entrepreneur, she does not feel supported by government policies, nor by the industry and traditional funding mechanisms. Three main groups of skills have been identified to be required by entrepreneurs: technical (including communication, problem solving, technology implementation), business management (including human resources management, marketing, finance, accounting), and personal entrepreneurial skills (self-control and discipline, risk management, leadership) (ICF and Cedefop, 2014). There are an increasing number of initiatives to strengthen the required skill set among young people to encourage entrepreneurship. For example, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Japan and China have started to incorporate trainings as part of their formal education curriculum to promote an increase in soft skills relevant to entrepreneurship.

Volunteerism is one of the oldest and most traditional expressions of human behavior based on reciprocal exchanges and sharing. The perspective on volunteerism has been changing, broadening the understanding of what volunteering is, both formal and informal, and what it means to society. With relationships and their potential to enhance the well-being of individuals and communities at its core, volunteerism is a key component of many civil society organizations, as well as social and political movements. Volunteerism also thrives in education, health, and environmental programmes, and a range of other public and private sector programmes world- wide. In addition to formal voluntary engagements, volunteerism has also been an important element and an integrated component in many cultures and religions. This is particularly common in Asia and the Pacific. The core values of volunteerism are strengthening solidarity, reciprocity, and mutual trust between people, as well as promoting social inclusion and the empowerment of vulnerable people (Leigh et al., 2011). Whether visible or an underlying element, helping the community and others without financial or reward is an integral part of every society. UNV distinguishes four kinds of volunteering: mutual aid or self-help, service to others, participation or civic engagement, and advocacy or campaigning (UNV, 2009).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "808ad57e-adc6-46f0-bdf4-a8e5d500dd44": {"__data__": {"id_": "808ad57e-adc6-46f0-bdf4-a8e5d500dd44", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-volunteerism-and-skills-development-economic-empowerment-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Youth Volunteerism and Skills Development for Economic Empowerment in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-volunteerism-and-skills-development-economic-empowerment-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "46c98935904a5462e49d4b7f1f9e6b7a67fd4d65142b3474cdb96c7f5b242ff6"}, "2": {"node_id": "0cc4f033-7335-42bc-9c89-420335385878", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-volunteerism-and-skills-development-economic-empowerment-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "772735ff3f39473f1f382efda64b4ac0d3d328f84f4d0acfb1af29d6797f8e2d"}}, "hash": "83229c08d7d12c5a09fbcf91dbfed3f19abb69e8e5221302bda069618b487712", "text": "One of the principal elements of volunteerism is the unpaid and non-compulsory nature of the work undertaken for others outside of their own household.

Informal volunteering are non-obligatory unpaid actions undertaken outside a formal organizational context or the volunteers\u2019 household, providing time, help or support for the benefit of other people, a specific cause or society as a whole. (Gavelin et al, 2011) It is important to note survey models tend to use a more narrow definition of volunteer work, oftentimes excluding informal volunteer activities. Surveys often limit the definition of volunteerism, especially in terms of the notion of household, which varies in different cultures. Volunteers seek projects or voluntary work that are in accord with their values (Clary and Snyder, 1991). Research conducted for the Asian region seems to support this theory (Wang and Wu, 2014). The specific reasons for why volunteers in the region Skills Developed through Volunteerism YOUTH VOLUNTEERISM AND ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT PAGE 15 donate their time to voluntary causes can differ, with no evidence-based, primary data available on the entire region. Research suggests that volunteer work often involves a form of social obligation, for example cultural or religious traditions, or expectations from peers or family (ILO, 2011a). Volunteers may also expect benefits for themselves in the future as a form of \u2018investment\u2019 (Prouteau and Wolff, 2006). These benefits might be an increase of social capital, career development, or involving religious beliefs, such as building social good in Buddhist or other faiths and traditions. The volunteers consulted discussed how many tasks completed by young people as part of tradition or community engagement are not labeled volunteerism. For example, supporting events at a youth center, the mosque, church or temple, or engagement in a student association at university is rarely recognized as volunteerism even though they are perfect examples of volunteering as per the common definition. Without the understanding of their community engagement as an engaged citizen the volunteers highlighted many young people most likely do not recognize their social and community engagement as activities and experiences adds value to and/or enhances their skillsets, especially during the search for employment or their career progression. Volunteering Rates in Asia and the Pacific When it comes to volunteering rates, current measurements of volunteering rates produce results with very wide variations. This is in part due to the different questions being asked in surveys, and also due to terminology and definitions, cultural understanding of volunteering and volunteerism, and data sampling. These factors represent big challenges to estimate volunteering rates across different cultural contexts. Nonetheless, data from the Gallup World Poll and the World Values Survey allows an interesting insight into volunteering in Asia and the Pacific. The most recent Gallup World Poll shows strong sub regional variation among the countries across Asia and the Pacific, with some of the lowest and highest rates in the world. Some countries in South Asia and South-East Asia show a remarkable rise in percentages of documented volunteering, with rates in the rest of the region seeming relatively Adapted from Gallup World Poll, 2015 Myanmar Sri Lanka New Zealand Philippines Australia Bhutan Indonesia Malaysia Mongolia Nepal Singapore Japan Rep. of Korea India Hong Kong, China (SAR) Vietnam Thailand Pakistan Bangladesh Afghanistan Cambodia China 50% 48% 45% 42% 40% 38% 38% 37% 34% 27% 27% 26% 21% 17% 15% 14% 14% 12% 10% 9% 9% 5% 21.5% Volunteering Rates in Asia and the Pacific PAGE 16 ISSUE BRIEF stable overall. For example, Sri Lanka sees nearly half of its population volunteer, and Nepal reports over 50 percent for its own population. In terms of participation in volunteering time, Myanmar and Sri Lanka lead the global ranking (CAF, 2015). Very high rates are also reported for India, Indonesia, and the Philippines, where a lot of volunteer work takes place in religious and community contexts. Alternatively, volunteer rates in China captured by the Gallup World Poll seem low with less than 5 percent of surveyed individuals stating they have volunteered in the previous month, placing it at the bottom of world rankings (CAF, 2015). Unfortunately, there is a severe lack of primary data on volunteering rates for the Island Countries in the Pacific. A high regional Pacific average of 36 percent of individuals volunteering is achieved in the results of the Gallup World Poll through responses from Australia and New Zealand. The more recent surveying waves of the World Values Survey did not include questions on volunteer engagement in Asia and the Pacific. The World Values Survey data included questions on voluntary work in the survey wave of 2000-2004, asking participants about the type of organizations they are volunteering for.

In addition to information on volunteering rates for cultural activities, the World Values Survey also provides insight into organizations related to social welfare, sport and recreation, peace movements, political parties, conservation, environmental and animal rights, youth work, health, as well as church organizations and women\u2019s groups. Overall in Asia and the Pacific, volunteer rates are influenced by local culture and traditions of community engagement. Without the appropriate data, it is difficult to assess whether volunteering rates and formats are changing and evolving. Traditionally, volunteering for cultural and religious organizations or related activities is the most common form of volunteering across the Asia-Pacific region (UNV, 2015). Many religious faiths in the region, especially the religions of Buddhism, Islam and Catholicism, consider voluntary work an important element of their religious practice. Faith-based organizations may function as volunteer mobilizers with monks, preachers and elders oftentimes mobilizing people for voluntary action in the community and the place of worship. Sport volunteerism is oftentimes forgotten, but sports associations and activities are massively popular in the Asian-Pacific region, especially among young people. Many governments leverage volunteerism by creating structures and institutional mechanisms for volunteerism to thrive and for it to contribute to national development goals and social inclusion. Frameworks of laws and institutions provide volunteers with opportunities and structures to volunteer within and also enable governments to mobilize and deploy volunteers systematically. Effective volunteer infrastructure at the national level requires a favorable policy and regulatory framework, as well as recognition and promotion of volunteerism and committed national leadership. In Cambodia, for example, the National Youth Development Policy includes promoting volunteerism as a key strategy for youth development. The Cambodian National Youth Action Plan 2016-2018 also sets volunteerism as a priority strategy. China\u2019s new regulation on volunteer services took effect in December 2017 to encourage volunteer activities in China through effective regulatory infrastructure. In addition, a number of countries in Asia-Pacific have state and state-sponsored volunteer programmes or independent programmes supported by the national government for local, national and sometimes international volunteering. Examples for this are the Australian Volunteers International organization and Masyarakat Relawan Indonesia. These programmes train, place and support volunteers in non- government organizations, associations, schools and other institutions. There are also many schools and universities across the region that feature a volunteering component in their curricula, suggesting or even requiring a certain number of volunteer work hours from students before graduation. YOUTH VOLUNTEERISM AND ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT PAGE 17 Corporate social responsibility (CSR) and corporate volunteering has been growing in importance in Asia from a relatively weak position a decade ago (Shakeel, 2015). Corporate volunteering traditionally involves a company giving their staff volunteer opportunities, time and sometimes even incentives to volunteer for a cause of their choice or as part of a CSR policy (Chapple et al, 2014). Volunteerism is also an increasingly common and important element in the work of national and international development organizations, as well as organizations working in humanitarian action on disaster preparedness and response. For these organizations, volunteering is a useful tool to engage communities and build capacity, as well as utilize local knowledge and networks. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, for example, created one of the largest volunteer mobilizing networks with presence in almost all countries of Asia and the Pacific. A more recent form of volunteerism is online volunteering. People volunteering online commit their time and skills over the Internet freely and without financial considerations for a social cause or the benefit of society. This form of volunteering has eliminated the need for volunteerism to be tied to specific times and locations, increasing greatly the freedom and flexibility of volunteer engagement and complementing the outreach and impact of volunteers serving in situ (Leigh et al., 2011). UN Volunteers manages an online volunteering programme, which connects NGOs, governments and UN agencies with online volunteers. In Asia and the Pacific, the most volunteers registered on this platform come from India, China, Australia, Pakistan and Indonesia, possibly indicating easier accessibility in countries where ICT skills are valued for employment or learned as part of formal education.

Most research suggests volunteers develop social capital through voluntary work (ILO, 2011a). Social capital refers to the range of connections on which people draw in their daily lives. These connections are often a manifestation of volunteerism, including membership of informal, local associations and more formalized groups. The concept of social capital encompasses social resources, including networks, social relations and associational memberships based on the trust, mutual understanding and shared values on which people draw when there is a need for cooperation. Social capital relevant to employment includes an individual\u2019s professional contacts, networks, employment leads and social relationships (Spera et al., 2013). Many volunteer programmes and projects also aim to develop human capital, which covers skills, knowledge, ability to labor and good health. In this UNV Communication Specialist speaks to Vietnam Volunteer Information Resource Center volunteers in Hanoi, Vietnam PAGE 18 ISSUE BRIEF context, researchers distinguish again between hard skills and soft skills: Hard skills are job-specific, technical skills, which are often the main criteria for recruitment. Soft skills, also referred to as core skills or portable skills are transferable between jobs. Most of these soft skills are not part of curricula in formal education institutions and cannot be taught in the same manner as technical skills in a classroom. Some depend on personal endowment and need to be learned and exercised in a real life environment in order to be promoted, depending on personal experience and diverse exposure. behavior can be shaped and reinforced as a result of volunteering, encompassing a wide range of qualities from punctuality, work readiness and flexibility, to keeping an open mind and expressing readiness to both learn and teach (Krahn et al., 2002). Furthermore, volunteering also positively influences the civic engagement of volunteers. Youth participation in many countries of the region is challenged by institutionalized, cultural and other forms of adultism (Young & Sazama, 2006; Zeldin et al., 2000). \u2018Adultism\u2019 is a term which encompasses behaviors and attitudes that dismiss young people to the extent of discriminating against them and are based on a bias towards adults (Gong and Wright, 2007). Social capital, gaining experience that contributes to building leadership, becoming resourceful and acquiring a readiness and willingness to learn are driving forces for civic participation, which can be acquired or strengthened by volunteering. Volunteerism has been shown to promote social cohesion, social networks, trust, outreach and participation and in some cases shape social norms. This strengthens community social capital as individuals and societies jointly benefit from face to face interactions among individuals creating common bonds and shared aims through joint engagement in activities, providing benefits beyond employability, namely tolerance, breaking cultural barriers and opening space for civic engagement (Templer and Lawson, 2017). In addition to social and human capital, volunteerism can build physical capital, which includes basic infrastructure such as roads, water and sanitation, irrigation, schools, health posts, energy, tools and equipment. The best example for the value of volunteering in building infrastructure is the response to the April 2015 earthquake in Nepal, where UN Volunteers undertook technical assessments of damaged structures and supervised cash-for- work brigades which cleared and recycled debris. Volunteers also trained and mentored grassroots organizations in the implementation of community- based projects, facilitated the delivery of livelihood assistance to earthquake victims and implemented local disaster risk management initiatives (Budhathoki, 2016). Volunteering can also contribute to developing financial capital, such as savings, credit, income, trade and remittances through community programmes as well as political capital through Volunteering programmes are the ideal context for young women and men to develop and practice these soft skills. Skills development and the process of self- development are also mutually reinforcing (Karajkov, 2013). As part of human capital, volunteering has also been reported to generally increase confidence and self-esteem (Low et al., 2007, Williams et al., 2001, and Newton et al., 2011). Volunteering activities tend to require resourcefulness, equipping volunteers with experience in different environments to use community resources and acquire soft skills such as time management, orientation, handling organizational cultures and adapting to different rules and procedures.

For example, a female volunteer in Sri Lanka found herself volunteering as part of an ICT team working on technology and innovation, a predominantly male field in the local context. Volunteering opened the avenue for her to gain insight in the work environment and she discovered her passion and ambition to build a meaningful career in this field. There is evidence that, through volunteerism, women are challenging traditional places and roles in society and are experiencing greater empowerment beyond the work place. In India, for example, volunteering in social movements has contributed to addressing social and political issues that affect women\u2019s lives, while creating social networks and generating resources that protect and empower fellow women in situations of vulnerability (UNV, 2012). Additionally, when women volunteers and activists raise awareness of such initiatives, they increase and improve the greater public understanding of the importance of gender issues (Bortee, 2011). Some other studies, however, suggest that volunteering itself is subject to the same structural barriers to participation as found in the labor market (IVR, 2004), making it important for volunteer serving organizations to consider gender and inclusiveness priority issues in their programme design. A joint programme between UNDP, UNFPA, UN Women and UN Volunteers named \u2018Partners for Prevention\u2019 revealed in the lessons learned the benefit of the project\u2019s volunteerism approach. By recruiting volunteers from the community as facilitators and having participants design and implement their own community volunteerism projects, the volunteers embraced the notions and behaviors of prevention of violence against women and girls not only during the workshop, but shared what they learned more informally within their families and peer groups. Through volunteerism, the concept became rooted in the community itself due to the individuals and communities embracing, leading and integrating prevention of violence against women and girls into their daily lives (Gevers, A. et al, 2018). A former volunteer from Indonesia reflected on her volunteer assignment with an international organization and explained her empowerment as a young woman is the biggest gain from the experience. In a culture where young people, especially women, tend to remain quiet during meetings and are discouraged from taking initiatives in places of work, she learned to be confident and to speak up in meetings and big events. She says this is a skill that she could not have learned anywhere else and which will serve her for life, especially in her career. PAGE 20 ISSUE BRIEF Studies Linking Volunteerism to Employability Currently, there are no studies isolating and examining the link between volunteerism and enhanced youth employment in the region. Even at the global level very few studies on volunteerism and access to employment exist. Most research projects and programme reports evaluate data sets with small sample sizes usually over shorter periods of time. However, the theme of volunteerism and its effect on employment requires large-scale and long- term studies in order to present convincing evidence without bias or other determining factors. One such study in a different regional context was conducted in the United States in June 2013 by the Corporation for National and Community Service. While from another region, the study is very interesting due to its scientific approach and methodology, with large sample sizes and long periods of surveying. Though the cause-and-effect cannot be established, the results of this study suggest a statistically significant and highly stable association between volunteering and employment. The study found volunteering is associated with a 27 percent increase in odds of finding employment (Spera et al., 2013). Interestingly, the study also found chances of employment for young people is higher when volunteering only once a month, with the rate dropping as the number of volunteer hours per month increased. Without further information the reason for this phenomenon is unclear, though one can hypothesize: Given that young people\u2019s free time tends to be limited due to schooling and work, sacrificing too much personal time to volunteer work could have a negative impact on work commitments. More studies on this, especially in different regional contexts, would be very helpful and interesting. Skills and Capital Developed through Volunteering Despite the lack of evidence-based studies in the Asia-Pacific region, a number of points linking youth volunteerism, skills development and economic empowerment can be deduced based on the analysis of labor skills demand and skills developed through volunteer programmes. Firstly, strategically planned volunteer programmes with enough support for volunteers lead to increased experience and the development of hard skills and usually a Linking Youth Volunteerism, Skills Development and Economic Empowerment YOUTH VOLUNTEERISM AND ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT PAGE 21 wealth of soft", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f7e50a9e-36ae-4798-aff1-ae060e0382e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "f7e50a9e-36ae-4798-aff1-ae060e0382e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-volunteerism-and-skills-development-economic-empowerment-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Youth Volunteerism and Skills Development for Economic Empowerment in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-volunteerism-and-skills-development-economic-empowerment-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8654617e418ee034d2713c8705fde335f7203bf776797855819ad55977344cd3"}}, "hash": "8654617e418ee034d2713c8705fde335f7203bf776797855819ad55977344cd3", "text": "skills. In addition, depending on the volunteer project and environment, volunteering is a useful opportunity for exposure to the world of organized work and new workplaces (IAVE, 2013). For many young people, volunteering can be the first documented work experience, which can be difficult or almost impossible to attain in a context of high youth unemployment (IAVE, 2013). former and current young volunteers indicated in their search for employment in a very competitive market for both low-skill and high-skill jobs, employers seemingly select potential candidates mainly based on technical qualifications and job- specific experience with little emphasis on soft skills during recruitment. The interviewees said it is only at the job interview stage where they can display their soft skills but oftentimes the interview discussions are limited to teamwork and management skills, as opposed to communication, organizing, adaptability, etc. As stated previously, the majority of unemployed young women and men across the region rely on informal networks to search for jobs. In particular, the lack of effectiveness of labor market information processes hinders their access to employment. For example, in Nepal only 9.1 percent of young people found a job through newspaper advertisements, and while 16.3 percent are registered at an unemployment center, only 1 percent found a job this way (Serri\u00e8re, 2014). In this context, the increase of social capital through volunteering can be even more beneficial to young people during their employment search, with volunteerism a useful tool for creating and maintaining useful contacts. A survey in the China Daily showed that, out of 1,044 employers, more than 60 percent prefer a candidate with experience volunteering in the remote Western region of China. Employers said the values they sought in their employees were dedication, integrity and good communication skills usually developed in the volunteering service. A vast majority among these employers who employed former volunteers stated they were satisfied with their performance (China Daily, 2010). The passion and dedication of volunteers seems to translate in this context into a strong and dedicated commitment to a place of employment, which is valued by employers. Additional soft skills acquired during the volunteering experience can set former volunteers apart from those without this type of experience. While the China Daily survey highlights soft skills, research suggests that many employers look mostly for job-related skills and job-specific experience during recruitment. Former volunteers indicated volunteer programmes with the most impact on economic youth empowerment are those which facilitate the development of job-specific technical skills and work experience relating directly to the professional field or position of interest. Many of the \u201cEmployeurs tend to look for someone with experience, so fresh graduates have a tough time [finding a job].

When hiring, organizations and enterprises often prefer to contact a former volunteer rather than looking for a completely new candidate, saving them costs, effort, and time. This process has the benefit of an existing relationship with the former volunteer, which limits the risk of skills underutilization or wrong expectations. Additionally, the exposure to a specific work environment can also be useful for an individual without work experience to test whether it suits their preferences, allowing young people to make more informed training and employment decision, if their context allows it. Other than contributing to enhanced youth employability, volunteerism also helps to overcome gender barriers by providing opportunities for both young men and women to work in non-traditional environments and positions. Volunteering can lower the barrier to \u201ctrying out\u201d activities which do not conform to traditional gender roles, which has been observed to be successful in specific case studies in the region (ILO, 2011b). Moreover, volunteerism can act as a low-cost and productive way to encourage governments and the private sector to try out new models of employment. For example, the Local Governance and Community Development programme in Nepal engaged volunteers for ICT support through UNDP, UNV and the UN Capital Development Fund, building an online government presence in the country. After the volunteer engagement came to an end, the volunteer positions were professionalized into work contracts. In this example of formalized volunteering, new employment positions were created as a result of testing", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5888df64-e764-436f-92fb-a5dd87892dbf": {"__data__": {"id_": "5888df64-e764-436f-92fb-a5dd87892dbf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-volunteerism-and-skills-development-economic-empowerment-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Youth Volunteerism and Skills Development for Economic Empowerment in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-volunteerism-and-skills-development-economic-empowerment-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "82502d7aa576099444056f258c2e74fce1d3effd7a34132659cae640440d71a5"}}, "hash": "82502d7aa576099444056f258c2e74fce1d3effd7a34132659cae640440d71a5", "text": "out a new model or occupation with volunteers. As the CSR sector is increasing, companies also create more employment positions to coordinate volunteer involving programmes. Many of the big companies in Asia and the Pacific in the chocolate, coffee or tobacco industry, for example, have increasingly strong community programmes to mitigate negative effects of farming and resource exploitation, and to move towards increased sustainability. An illustration of such a programme is the Mars Ambassador Programme in Indonesia, which is working on, among others, coral reef rehabilitation in Sulawesi. Hundreds of employees from the region and beyond come to volunteer for this programme every year, helping sustainability and marketing benefits, as well as employee and community engagement. Mars also has a global Mars Volunteer Programme for its employees, with new employment positions for volunteer coordination created in recent years (Willow, 2014). Youth Entrepreneurship The research tends to suggest a link between youth volunteerism and skills development beneficial to young entrepreneurs. As previously explored, youth entrepreneurship faces the constraints of lacking experience, relevant skills and knowledge, as well as poor leadership and management skills, a lack of strategic thinking, teamwork and problem- solving skills. Combined with a lack of support, funding mechanisms and an unfriendly business environments, startups and young businesses tend to have a very high failure rate. In Asia and the Pacific, however, SMEs accounted for an average of 96 percent of all enterprises and 62 percent of the national labor forces (ADB, 2014). The vast majority of these SMEs are small businesses and enterprises. Tech startups are still suffering from high failure rates, with more than 90 percent of startups in India failing in their first five years, for example (IBM, 2017). While SMEs can still be entrepreneurial in their endeavors, many smaller firms and businesses in the region are established out of necessity or are long- established family businesses. Volunteerism cannot directly provide government support or funding mechanisms, but young volunteers can gain valuable experience before starting their own business. Volunteering with different SMEs can be especially useful, providing first hand practical YOUTH VOLUNTEERISM AND ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT PAGE 23 education about all the elements of a business and its day-to-day operations (Karajkov, 2013). The experience can also help young entrepreneurs to gain insight into different types of businesses and sectors, allowing them to make a more informed decision about where to start their own endeavor without the risk of failure and loss of financial investment. It is important to recall here, however, the difference between internships or traineeships and volunteering, which should always be dedicated to a social cause. Volunteers can engage with SMEs for the benefit of the community, carrying out activities that both develop their skill sets and help acquire experience, but also contribute to providing services or building infrastructure for the community. Many young people in Asia and the Pacific engage in unpaid family work on a regular basis, which should be classified as informal employment rather than volunteer work. Though both family work and internships can help young people develop or strengthen important life and professional skills, the motivation compared to volunteerism tends to be very different. Volunteering offers the opportunity for exposure to widely different contexts, as well as a more flexible engagement possible while in school, at university, or whilst already employed. Furthermore, as the current and former volunteers have also testified, volunteering tends to increase confidence and even self-sufficiency, which are skills more difficult to develop in family contexts where there might be less leadership opportunities and exposure to new contexts. Many young people in the region are not yet exposed to tech or ICT work environments. Considering the recent emergence of a larger and stronger startup scene in many countries, such as in Vietnam, India and Singapore, volunteering can be a valuable entry point for young people interested in building their own startups. Though formalized volunteer opportunities in this sector are still limited, an increasing number of interesting projects offer young people insight and experience. For example, private sector partners from the ICT sector such as CISCO and SAP are working with UN Volunteers providing opportunities for ICT trainings and ICT volunteer positions, as well as mentoring and support for a number of volunteer projects that are transitioning into tech and social startups. Less formalized opportunities can include volunteering during events or forms of community engagement. Realistically, these opportunities are currently only available to a minority of the population of young In Thimpu, Bhutan, the only UN Volunteer in the country, together with UNDP Bhutan and in cooperation with the Tarayana Foundation, mobilized local volunteer students from YHS", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ff396a2-fc2e-4541-9d38-e93bf717f27e": {"__data__": {"id_": "6ff396a2-fc2e-4541-9d38-e93bf717f27e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-volunteerism-and-skills-development-economic-empowerment-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Youth Volunteerism and Skills Development for Economic Empowerment in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-volunteerism-and-skills-development-economic-empowerment-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "66e9e55618c2887c3dad7c15a546c940c1020342edd3c782f758774e0080ae11"}}, "hash": "66e9e55618c2887c3dad7c15a546c940c1020342edd3c782f758774e0080ae11", "text": "Tarayana School Club. PAGE 24 ISSUE BRIEF men and women in Asia and Pacific, but an increase of engagements and attempts at reaching marginalized groups and rural areas should be noted. In India, which ranks third globally in terms of number of startups, lack of innovation, lack of skilled workforce, lack of sufficient funding, inadequate formal mentoring, bad business ethics, and a lack of experienced leadership are cited as reasons for failure of the large majority of new startups (IBM, 2017). Volunteering in this sector can build the skills needed, as well as provide mentoring relationships. Young people can gain leadership experience and learn more about good business ethics, which can be reinforced and strengthened by the increased social awareness that oftentimes comes from volunteer experiences, which are beneficial to social inclusion and civic participation. Two Indonesian volunteers transitioning their project into a tech startup explained that the idea came from volunteer engagements which helped them to see the needs of their community. The volunteer experience led to the goal of creating a social startup, not focused on revenue but rather a cause which improves the quality of life of marginalized groups in the community. Their startup \u2018Tune Map\u2019 building a mobile application for visually impaired people which maps the condition of roads and sidewalks in Bandung, Indonesia, making it easier for them to move independently about the city. Many young men and women in the region indicate they depend on family as a major source of investment and encouragement (UNV, 2017). Expanding their social capital through volunteering expands the circle of support to other sources and actors, creating an enabling environment for young entrepreneurs to gain additional support outside their families. With lack of sufficient funding being cited as a major challenge for young companies, an increase of social capital, networks and contacts can be a crucial tool for a young person intend on building their own successful startup endeavor. Job Retention, Career Progression and Motivation Employability itself is not limited to entering the labor market by finding a job; it also encompasses job retention and career progression. It can be argued that soft skills are crucial for job retention and career progression, with communication, leadership and teamwork skills, critical thinking and problem solving, and organizational and self-management skills allowing for increased productivity and continued learning of hard skills \u2018on the job\u2019. Some studies suggest that employability is enhanced directly by strengthening soft skills (OECD, 2017). Especially in the context of informal employment and skills underutilization where there are often no formal training opportunities or further job training for career progression, soft skills and a readiness to learn and teach others can be the key for job retention and progression. The same applies to SMEs, which indicate the lack of skills as the main obstacle for their work. SMEs oftentimes do not have the funds and the time for training staff, with most of the learning done on the job. Furthermore, they often do not possess the capacity to do well-planned recruitment and choose to address the skills gap by working harder rather than working smarter, meaning the recruitment of more employees to make up for a lack of productivity instead of recruiting employees with the most suitable skills (Kitigawa, 2001). The fact that SMEs Recently, more research and studies are exploring the psychology behind successful entrepreneurship. One example of such studies and accompanying theories is the Grit Scale developed by Angela Duckworth, which consists of a survey measuring the grit, or the passion and perseverance for long-term goals, of entrepreneurs (Duckworth & Gross, 2014). Volunteer work in areas of interest of an entrepreneur can increase the score of his or her Grit Scale, indicating more dedication and higher chances at success with their personal business endeavor. The Grit Scale and psychology theory behind it is still somewhat disputed in a complex field requiring more studies. YOUTH VOLUNTEERISM AND ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT PAGE 25 are by far the largest type of employer in the region of Asia and the Pacific emphasizes their importance in the context of youth unemployment. Becoming lifelong learners is beneficial for young people for both low-skill and high-skill labor, as both ends of the labor market spectrum experience changes towards temporary employment that is more prone to vulnerability. In addition, with levels of informality still being drastically high in Asia and the Pacific, transitions to more decent work will take more development over longer periods of time in LMICs. Volunteering in different contexts that lead to more confidence, better communication skills and adaptability, as well as enhanced social capital and better networks in the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68cb8e72-1689-4944-bf30-b470d114433a": {"__data__": {"id_": "68cb8e72-1689-4944-bf30-b470d114433a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-volunteerism-and-skills-development-economic-empowerment-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Youth Volunteerism and Skills Development for Economic Empowerment in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-volunteerism-and-skills-development-economic-empowerment-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d75db9531b5c098be9844549f0c19ea05ded25878b98ab9cbe86eef7539b6c9d"}}, "hash": "d75db9531b5c098be9844549f0c19ea05ded25878b98ab9cbe86eef7539b6c9d", "text": "community and beyond, is highly beneficial to young people seeking employment in LMICs, especially without TVET and other formalized opportunities for skills development. Looking towards the future, a multitude of studies suggest an increasing number of tasks are likely to be automated. It is clear flexibility and readiness to adapt and learn will become crucial for job retention and career progression. Digital skills are changing especially fast with 10 percent of adult workers in the European Union already at high risk of technological skills obsolescence today (Cedefop, 2017). With automation and ICT slowly increasing in the Asia- Pacific labor market, it is crucial for young men and women to invest just as much in soft skills than hard skills to ensure chances at job retention and career progression. Volunteerism is also demonstrated to have an effect on attitudes, behaviors and values, and the psychosocial aspects of individual health. A volunteer occupation creates sense of self-worth and instills self-esteem, increasing well-being. Volunteers report increased motivation and a sense of being of value to others (IAVE, 2013). These effects are beneficial to combat the negative impacts of unemployment. As such, volunteering is a process of ethical learning, allowing not only for skills development but also personal development and growth. The social capital, experience and leadership, resourcefulness and the readiness and willingness to learn continuously that can be acquired through volunteering are elements that compliment employability and economic empowerment. As driving forces for participation, these skills, behaviors and attitudes enable young people in the region to become more actively engaged in political decision-making processes, from the community level to the national level. Young people can become more involved in shaping policies and their country\u2019s economy to provide better opportunities for all. PAGE 26 ISSUE BRIEF As the first section of this Issue Brief exposes, the problem and the solution for youth employment is in the labor market. In order to maximize the gains generated by volunteer programmes and their skills development components, the structural causes of unequal labor market opportunities must be addressed at the level of national labor policies (Peck and Theodore, 2000; Wilton, 2011). The move towards a formalized labor market and economy, away from informal and vulnerable employment, is crucial as formality is linked to greater job stability, higher income and access to other benefits, such as pensions and health care. While the main responsibility for this change lies with national governments, targeted volunteer programmes can increase the civic engagement of communities and populations, providing spaces to contribute to building better policies and capacity. These actions and changes on all sides and from all actors are necessary for the economic empowerment of young men and women in Asia and the Pacific, to enhance employability, reduce barriers to access and anticipate the labor needs of the future. The Issue Brief demonstrates a number of different links between volunteerism, skills development and employability, as well as to the economic empowerment for young people. It gives critical insight into how volunteerism can help young women and men not only to develop important skills that can support the access to the labor market through exposure to work environments and networks but also allows volunteers to acquire attitudes and behaviors increasingly crucial for job retention and career progression. Strategic changes in the labor market and labor policies would maximize the impact of formal volunteer programmes, as well as informal volunteer activities across Asia and the Pacific. On the other hand, a more favorable national policy and regulatory framework, recognition and promotion of volunteerism for peace and development and committed national leadership, provides more effective volunteer infrastructure on the national level, which state programmes, volunteer serving organizations and volunteers themselves can rely on to strengthen the impact of volunteering and enhance skill development of volunteers. Conclusion and Recommendations YOUTH VOLUNTEERISM AND ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT PAGE 27 Key insights revealed for employability \uf0d8It is critical to examine the reality of the current labor market in Asia and the Pacific and anticipate future trends and labor skill demand \uf0d8 \u2022 As a course of action, countries in the region should continue strengthening institutional capacities to build skills that match industry and market needs. This process of producing and building on available labor market and skills intelligence can contribute to achieving a better balance between skill supply and demand to promote economic development through targeted skills investment by the various stakeholders. Skills anticipation can identify current and possible future skill mismatches and inform policy decisions on how to address them. \uf0d8Soft skills with a focus on adaptability and a readiness to develop new skills on a continuous and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0977f69-4873-45ec-8da8-1d25aacd3d2f": {"__data__": {"id_": "b0977f69-4873-45ec-8da8-1d25aacd3d2f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-volunteerism-and-skills-development-economic-empowerment-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Youth Volunteerism and Skills Development for Economic Empowerment in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-volunteerism-and-skills-development-economic-empowerment-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "226a74c0cb624d6c97db66607b0879d0100512ae600704a33f20bf20024c45e2"}}, "hash": "226a74c0cb624d6c97db66607b0879d0100512ae600704a33f20bf20024c45e2", "text": "consistent basis will become increasingly important during all phases of employment \u2022 \uf0d8With the lack of soft skill recognition among employers during recruitment, the continuous increase and improvement of formal education and professional training in the region might change this habit in the future. \u2022 \uf0d8Similarly, with automation replacing low-skill labor and an increase in competitiveness for high-skill labor, becoming lifelong learners will help young people in both LMICs and HICs where labor markets are dominated by informal employment or temporary and part-time positions. \uf0d8More evidence-based studies of high statistical certainty are necessary in order to fully understand the success of volunteering and forms of free labor as a skills development opportunity \u2022 National governments should expand their own citizen surveys and international and national organization can gather more data from their own programming. This data collection should include specific questions on volunteering to provide a more detailed insight into the impact of volunteer work on employability across the region. \u2022 There is a need for more research and studies into other forms of free labor which do not qualify as volunteering, for example child care, housework or work in family businesses. This research can provide insight into other opportunities of skills development, which are a reality for a majority of young people in the region. Volunteering in new environments can break down gender barriers and stereotypes, empowering young people to join new work sectors \u2022 This is of particular importance in countries that see their labor markets dominated by informal employment, where policies to empower women tend to be less effective. It is critical gender dynamics of skills development are considered for young women for more decent employment. Entrepreneurship An enabling environment is required to empower and support young entrepreneurs with their businesses and startups \u2022 Support in education, training, investment and empowerment is critical for young entrepreneurs. There is a need for more appropriate legal frameworks for startups and improved accessibility of information as well as varied financing mechanisms suitable to young men and women \u2022 Without an appropriate legal framework and accessible regulations for licensing businesses, the environment is too challenging for young entrepreneurs to succeed, or for young people to become interested in entrepreneurship. Financing is one of the main reasons of young business endeavors failing, making varied financing mechanisms crucial for entrepreneurship. PAGE 28 ISSUE BRIEF \uf0d8Volunteer projects can build entrepreneurial skill sets to enhance youth entrepreneurship in a market dominated by SMEs \u2022 Recognizing volunteer experience and encouraging more formal volunteer programmes in entrepreneurship contexts can contribute to more socially and community aware projects with better business ethics, as well as more grit and perseverance for long- term goals, leading to increased chances of success of the business endeavor. \u2022 Volunteering provides an opportunity to develop soft skills, especially leadership which is a key characteristic for successful entrepreneurs. High tech startup failure rates can be curbed by volunteers gaining experience, developing mentor relationships, building networks that allow an access to funding, and learning good business ethics \u2022 Volunteer involving organizations can support young entrepreneurs by providing opportunities to gain insight and experience in SMEs and the tech startup sector, as well as helping relevant targeted skills development. \u2022 Research and data should contribute to a discussion on the recognition of skills, which include but aren\u2019t limited to ambition, passion and dedication, in order to determine different ways to evaluate motivation which can be crucial information for small businesses during recruitment of employees. Key insights on volunteerism Volunteer programmes States are recommended to develop and strengthen their national volunteer policy and infrastructure \u2022 An effective national policy and regulatory framework, recognition and promotion of volunteerism for peace and development, and committed national leadership provides a favorable volunteer infrastructure. State programmes, volunteer serving organizations and volunteers themselves benefit from clear structures, regulations and protections, strengthening the impact of volunteering. \uf0d8Volunteer programmes need to become more strategic to allow both hard and soft skills development \u2022 Since employers traditionally select candidates based on their job-specific, technical skills, more volunteer programmes aimed at increasing the economic empowerment of young men and women should facilitate targeted skills development, especially for technical, hard skills. Volunteer certification and recommendations, as well as highlighting the specific skills developed and experience acquired, directly contribute to the enhanced employability of the young volunteers \u2022 In the absence of formal career advisory institutions and programmes, volunteer involving organizations are recommended to support volunteers in their skills and network development, as well as the valorization thereof through certification or other forms of recognition.

Volunteers should be encouraged and empowered to benefit from knowledge sharing and networking opportunities. Training volunteers in relationship-building is beneficial YOUTH VOLUNTEERISM AND ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT PAGE 29 for both the volunteer and the organization, as both benefit from an increase of exposure and a growing network of contacts. Organizations need to recognize gender dynamics and inclusivity behind skill development \u2022 In order to overcome social and societal barriers, volunteer programmes must be designed to be inclusive with outreach and empowerment of young people in marginalized groups or rural areas, as well provide opportunities for young women to gain experience and insight in nontraditional work environments.

Social capital and networks are key to employment, especially in informal settings or when launching an entrepreneurial endeavor. \u2022 This can also be relevant when volunteers anticipate skills required for future employability and match volunteer opportunities accordingly. Young women and men should highlight hard and soft skills and experience acquired during volunteering when seeking employment \u2022 Young volunteers can maximize their chances at finding employment by not only highlighting their volunteer activities, but also the specific hard and soft skills acquired during volunteering, as well as any relevant volunteer experience similar to work experience.

Printed in Thailand A review of challenges and future directions iii T ime-use statistics were first produced in the early 1900s in social surveys reporting on the living conditions of industrial workers. The surveys were looking at the impact of long work hours on working-class families\u2019 capacity for leisure. The goal was to advocate for a reduction in working hours. While the application and objective of time-use statistics have varied ever since, this fundamental information on the work\u2013life balance has remained the core utility. In recent years, time-use surveys and statistics have gained importance among policy- makers for their usefulness in measuring dimensions of gender equality and human well-being. And yet, despite the recognition of their utility, time-use surveys are not yet integrated into national statistical systems, and fewer countries do implement time-use surveys as compared to other household-based surveys. Time-use surveys highlight the unequal distribution of unpaid work between women and men, as well as help to understand the contribution of unpaid work to the national economy. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) place gender equality as a separate goal as well as an accelerator for all other goals. They call for recognizing, reducing, and redistributing unpaid care work as a way to promote gender equality. Much of unpaid work is performed by women, often resulting in unequal social, economic and political opportunities for women. When the data collected are analysed as evidence, it opens up policy dialogues towards a fair distribution of household and care-related tasks between women and men. In October 2013, the 19th International Conference of Labour Statisticians adopted the Resolution concerning statistics of work, employment and labour underutilization, which re-emphasized the importance of time-use surveys in measuring all forms of work, including unpaid work in households. The Resolution referred to time-use surveys as the main source of statistics on participation and time spent in own-use production work and volunteer work for purposes of individual-, household- and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68d461f9-e35e-4e32-8889-55542220b408": {"__data__": {"id_": "68d461f9-e35e-4e32-8889-55542220b408", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Time Use Surveys and Statistics in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8da8e82c25e9aa35e4c3914336718e12db4d8d65353300f01a483915eb81537d"}, "3": {"node_id": "dd791446-46e8-460e-b8e0-814a7b0bc263", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b3c0a788deff99ca0d1cd5e0914b1500909572bf237bc2770ffdefc783c52253"}}, "hash": "7a9201131e869b3d8aaa8f772c82f97be046388db5900ac408b56694da1028f3", "text": "macroeconomic- level analyses. In March 2016, the United Nations Statistical Commission adopted the International Classification of Activities for Time-Use Statistics, adding the link and consistency with the System of National Accounts and with the International Conference of Labour Statisticians framework for statistics of work. Encouraged by the increased relevance of time-use statistics and the continuing challenges to their systemic collection, the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) commissioned a review of time- Foreword iv Time-use surveys and statistics in Asia and the Pacific use surveys in Asia and the Pacific, including an update of the impediments to greater implementation by countries. The review, which was carried out in 2015 and 2016, covered the literature available at that time, and the analysis covered the statistical system of most of the UN member States in the region. This summary joint report was prepared in 2017 to highlight achievements that need to be reinforced and the methodological issues that hamper the wide collection and analysis of time-use statistics, as well as issues related to the capacity of practitioners and policy-makers to collect and utilize such statistics. The report will with no doubt contribute to the ongoing methodological work on time- use statistics by the United Nations and the ILO and the development of guidelines for implementing the 19th Resolution on work statistics. The featured initiatives on how to tackle these issues should be particularly useful. It is our hope that this report will not only help increase much greater awareness among policy-makers and the statistical community in Asia and the Pacific on the importance of time-use statistics but that it ultimately leads to the increased production of harmonized time-use statistics, which can help monitor progress towards achievement of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.

These are activities within the Production Boundary of the System of National Accounts (SNA)1 as well as outside that parameter but within the General Production Boundary2 and those that are personal and non-delegable.3 Time-use statistics are quantitative summaries of time allocation by men and women. As the United Nations Statistical Commission described in its 1979 report, Status of Work on Time-Use Statistics, time-use surveys provide social, demographic and related economic data not otherwise obtainable on human activity. Time-use statistics have three major components: (i) information on major socioeconomic characteristics of households and individuals (for whom data are collected) through a background schedule or through the main schedule (if a time-use survey is a module in a broader survey); (ii) time spent by individuals on SNA and non-SNA activities and personal services; and (iii) the context in which activities are carried out.4 This survey technique opens up immense opportunities for understanding critical concerns of an economy and society. Time-use statistics were first produced in the early 1900s in social surveys reporting on the living conditions of working-class families. The objective was to estimate the long working days and short leisure time of industrial workers, which was a concern of organized labour groups that wanted to advocate for a reduction in working hours. Over the past decades, time-use surveys have travelled a long journey in terms of their objectives, methods, analysis and use. Initially, the data illuminated lifestyles and living conditions of industrial and agricultural workers; in the 1960s and 1970s, the data were used in planning for transportation and for social policies and by broadcasting companies to understand how people spend their leisure time and to thus better organize their programming. As newer uses of the data were discovered, along came newer analytical tools. Since the mid-1970s and the rise of the women\u2019s movement, the data have been useful in understanding gender-based inequalities, in estimating the contribution of women\u2019s unpaid work to national well-being and in designing policies for women\u2019s empowerment. The data are also used to understand concerns related to the work\u2013life balance, older persons, child development, persons with disabilities, education, health and nutrition. And the data are used to complement labour force estimates, particularly for informal employment and subsistence work, and for understanding issues related to poverty, including time poverty, unemployment, underemployment and human development. 1 These constitute the activities included in national income accounts. 2 Non-SNA activities are not included in national accounts but are covered under the General Production Boundary and cover all delegable production of services not covered under the national income accounts.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b688a062-ad50-4a56-ad69-82bfaee0314b": {"__data__": {"id_": "b688a062-ad50-4a56-ad69-82bfaee0314b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Time Use Surveys and Statistics in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7a62a46a3304ce0848450c67983998a5afed5edadd9c0beaf4595335f7488571"}, "2": {"node_id": "3fbc4fdc-e672-4278-8930-b5e3915bc041", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fc0c3b64cb7488a41dc01e791f14d4971bc91c1fef294bf9f58efac862ab136c"}}, "hash": "8f14efa9340224f3c73c84345b5fe7b9bc7a95edf50989087b58c3dc8338da5e", "text": "3 Personal services cannot be delegated to others, such as sleeping and watching television. 4 The context variables in time-use statistics usually refer to the location where an activity took place (where), the presence of other people when the activity took place (with whom), the beneficiary, person or", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ceedc426-988b-4a57-b83c-a3b5b26e9d44": {"__data__": {"id_": "ceedc426-988b-4a57-b83c-a3b5b26e9d44", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Time Use Surveys and Statistics in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "48778346b8aa1cb8a141c5d633245e2b7bebe56bfefb67761af8b2a0dee8b19c"}, "3": {"node_id": "9f62ac6d-e186-4c60-a6d6-8fed69942dea", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "96e8df661e6e0d40aba280cf531069545ad5fe9d059e95a22a67fe500787e8e5"}}, "hash": "dc9bd9861d34c9552f1851128db0b2c8ea00af4a8e3a5f8f7464a7ae49826226", "text": "institution of the activity (for whom the activity was carried out) and the motivation of the activity (whether the activity was paid or unpaid). A review of challenges and future directions 3 More recently, scholars find the data useful for understanding the total economy that constitutes paid (SNA) and unpaid (non-SNA) work. In short, time-use surveys provide a rich database on a range of socioeconomic concerns in developed and developing countries. For developing and emerging countries today, time-use statistics are becoming an important tool to not only address development-related concerns but also the multiple dimensions of gender-based inequalities and the socioeconomic life of people. It is now well accepted that time-use statistics have a range of uses: They give visibility to all forms of work, remunerated and non-remunerated; provide visibility to the care economy by enabling estimates of paid and unpaid care work; help improve estimates of employment and understand its characteristics and cast light on informal jobs that may be scattered and/or sporadic in nature; aid the measure of socioeconomic change by describing variations in levels or types of paid and unpaid work and how such work is shared among different socioeconomic groups and over time; illuminate the nature of poverty and human well-being; explain the dynamics of intra-household sharing and gender inequalities; enable the valuation of unpaid non-SNA work and estimates of total well-being; and provide a more complete picture of the total economy (consisting of paid and unpaid work). This richness is invaluable for macroeconomic policy-making and monitoring. This last function has emerged as an important use only recently, now that there is realization that paid and unpaid work are closely interlinked with each other and that macroeconomic policies need to be formulated and monitored for their impact on unpaid work. In short, time-use statistics are critical for designing policies for inclusive growth. Despite the multitude of functions, the concepts and methods for conducting time- use surveys, especially for developing and emerging countries, are not harmonized or integrated into national statistical systems. Although many developed countries have their mainstreamed time-use survey into their national statistical system and harmonized their concepts and methods, their model is not always suitable to developing countries due to specific constraints and objectives. The developing and emerging countries have established their own methods and adapted activity classifications from the guidance produced by the United Nations,5 the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA)6 and the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP).7 A few of them have also attempted to use the guidelines from Eurostat (the statistical office of the European Union). The United Nations guidebook deals with five components for conducting time-use surveys: (i) planning and organizing; (ii) design specifications \u2013 types of time-use 5 See United Nations: Guide to producing statistics on time use: Measuring paid and unpaid work (New York, Statistics Division, 2005). 6 See ECA: Time use studies, national accounts and national budget (Addis Ababa, 2003). 7 See ESCAP: Guidebook on integrating paid and unpaid work into national policies (Bangkok, 2003). 4 Time-use surveys and statistics in Asia and the Pacific surveys, background questionnaires, sampling and survey instruments; (iii) collecting and processing data; (iv) classification of time-use activities; and (v) dissemination of data. The detailed discussions in the guidebook are extremely useful, despite the limitation that the background schedule, context variables and classifications recommended need modifying due to recent developments: The guidebook is no longer relevant for implementing the Resolution of Work Statistics adopted in 2013 by the 19th International Conference of Labour Statisticians, ICLS). The ECA publication is good for general discussions and guidelines but is incomplete because it does not cover how to conduct a time-use survey (types, objectives, background questionnaire, sampling, data collection methods, content variables, classification and analysis of the data). The ESCAP guidebook has five modules, only two of which deal with conducting time-use surveys. Even though it discusses integration of unpaid work into national polices and valuation, it is not practical as a guidebook due to the absence of methods on surveying. Essentially, these international guides have not harmonized the methods and classification for time-use surveys.

This argument, however, is unacceptable because: (i) like labour force and national income estimates, time-use data should be comparable across countries for understanding global conditions and designing global policies; and (ii) it is necessary to produce quality data using standardized concepts and methods, which should be harmonized. This does not preclude flexibility in the methods to allow countries to incorporate their specific concerns and needs within a globally accepted framework (as is the case with other surveys). Standardized and harmonized concepts and methods for national time-use surveys also do not preclude small-scale time-use surveys conducted by social scientists or private researchers to study sector-, region- and issue-specific concerns.

This includes the websites of the national statistics offices (NSOs) of those countries, the websites of other global agencies that store time-use data, such as the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) and the Centre for Time Use Research, as well as the international organizations that have sponsored time-use surveys, such as the World Bank (the Living Standards Measurement Study, or LSMS), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO studies under the Righting the Wrongs programme to give visibility to women\u2019s work in agriculture and promote them in decision-making), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and UN Women. In addition, the analysis drew from numerous research reviews (Hirway, 2010; UNDP, 2010 and 2008; Budlender, 2007) and other papers (refer to the references list at the end of this paper). Although the review accessed a large number of sources, there are still no much information on some countries, such as Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam. Of the 193 member countries of the United Nations,9 about 130 of them have conducted at least one (small or big) time-use survey to date (2015). This is a positive development because it reflects the wide reach of the technique. However, far fewer countries have conducted such a survey nationally, i.e. only about some 40 countries worldwide (in 2015). Time-use surveys were generally introduced into the Global North (United States, Canada, parts of Europe, parts of East Asia and Australia) during the second half of the twentieth century (a little earlier in some countries). But not all of them have mainstreamed the practice within their national statistical system. According to Mrkic (2006), eight countries had not conducted a time-use survey before 1990 (Estonia, Greece, Ireland, Republic of Korea, Lithuania, Luxembourg, New Zealand and Slovakia). Nearly all countries of the Global North have now such a survey. Of the countries in the Global Republic (Africa, Latin America, developing Asia, including the Middle East), the situation is quite different. Of the 54 countries of the African Union, around 30 countries, or 57 per cent, have carried out at least one time-use survey; of the 44 member countries of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, 18\u201320 countries, or 42\u201345 per cent, have conducted at least one survey. If one considers all countries in Asia and the Pacific region, 24 of the 53 countries reviewed have conducted at least one time-use survey. The Asian-Pacific countries in this review are highly heterogeneous in terms of their time-use surveys. On one extreme, the four developed countries (Australia, Japan, 9 Independent sovereign countries in the world. 8 Time-use surveys and statistics in Asia and the Pacific Republic of Korea and New Zealand) have mainstreamed a time-use survey within their national statistical system.

On the other extreme, seven countries (Afghanistan, Brunei Darussalam, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Myanmar, Palau and Singapore) have never conducted a time-use survey. Between these extremes, 24 developing and emerging countries (out of 31) have conducted at least one time-use survey (small or big), but many of them have not mainstreamed their time-use surveying (see Annex I for a review of the varying levels of practice). Of those 24 countries, nine (Fiji, Kiribati, Malaysia, Papua Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Island, Sri Lanka and Vanuatu) have only conducted small-scale surveys covering households in a few villages or an urban centre. The NSO in Philippines piloted a survey in 2000 and the Islamic Republic of Iran conducted two surveys covering only urban areas; however, both countries have never carried out a national survey.

A review of challenges and future directions 9 Survey or Household Income and Expenditure Survey. There are only six developing and emerging countries in the region that have conducted national or large time-use surveys using 24-hour time diaries. Of them, Bangladesh, China and India have only done so with a pilot survey. But they are included here in the category of national surveys because each covered a large part of the country. It is interesting that of those six countries, only Mongolia and Thailand have conducted more than one survey: Mongolia has conducted four national time-use surveys (most recently in 2015), and Thailand has conducted four national time-use surveys. In other words, only two countries have mainstreamed this type of survey within their national statistical system. Of the 10 countries that have conducted national modular time-use surveys, only three have mainstreamed the practice into their national statistical system: the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Timor-Leste and Viet Nam have each conducted three to four time-use surveys. 1.1 Time-use surveys in developed countries Australia, Japan, Republic of Korea and New Zealand have each mainstreamed time- use surveys within their national statistical system. Because this paper focuses on developing and emerging countries in the region, there is no in-depth discussion on the time-use surveys in developed countries. These countries conduct a national and stand-alone time-use survey regularly, at an interval of four to six years. Australia is a pioneer in time-use studies. The first time-use survey in Australia was conducted in 1976 by the Australian National University. It followed the famous method of Szalai10 in two urban centres in Australia. This survey was systematic in the sense that randomly selected respondents (one from each selected household aged between 18 and 69 years) filled in two 24-hour time diaries along with details of simultaneous activities and context variables (with whom, location, mode of transport) and an elaborate background questionnaire.

These surveys are annual as well as longitudinal, focusing on specific socioeconomic issues of Australian society. One commonality is that they were conducted systematically, with sound concepts and methods that led to sound time-use data. Japan: Time-use surveys have followed a different pattern in Japan. Two parallel streams of surveys have been conducted to date: (i) time-use surveys carried out by the Broadcasting and Cultural Research Centre of NHK, the national broadcasting (and telecasting) company and (ii) time-use surveys conducted by the Statistical Bureau. NHK conducted its first time-use survey in 1960\u201361 and thereafter every five years from 1970 onwards. The Statistical Bureau conducted its first national survey in 1981 and every five years thereafter. In addition, the Tokyo Institute of Technology at Hiroshima University conducted a survey in 1972 and 1991; and the Institute of Research of Household Economics conducted a time-use survey in 1993\u201394. Both categories of the time-use surveys in Japan used 24-hour time diaries and followed the major steps of the established method used in the developed world. For example, the 2005 NHK survey (i) used 24-hour self-reported time diaries with 15-minute time slots and collected data on two consecutive days,11 (ii) covered a large sample (12,600 persons) and (iii) developed a list of activities (28). The data, however, were collected for one week only (October 2005). An interesting part of the NHK surveys is that they have regularly updated the activity classification as the context changed. The objectives of the NHK surveys are to \u201cinvestigate how Japanese people spend their time on different activities\u201d for use in planning their broadcasting or telecasting programmes and in understanding the cultural dimensions of the population. The time-use surveys by the Statistical Bureau collected comprehensive data on the actual state of daily life not covered by economic statistics. They covered leisure activities and unpaid work of women and valued this work in satellite accounts and produced data that are internationally comparable. The period of the surveys used to be one week but shifted to two diary days in 2006. Respondents (aged 10 years and older from selected households) filled in two diary days. The activities were classified in 20 major groups. The sample of the survey included 200,000 persons from 80,000 households. 11 These days are selected based on a random method. A review of challenges and future directions 11 Republic of Korea: The Republic of Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) followed the Japanese NHK model in conducting time-use surveys. The main purpose was to collect information on people\u2019s media use, leisure activities and overall lifestyles. The first survey was conducted in 1981 and was followed by regular surveys at three- to five-year intervals until 2000. Three self-reported 24-hour time diaries were collected from each individual (aged 10 years or older) from randomly selected households. The 2000 time-use survey by KBS, for example, was conducted in October, covered 1,160 persons and collected 3,500 time diaries with 15-minute time slots. There was a turning point in the time-use surveying in 1999 when the Korean Statistical Institute conducted a national survey covering 17,000 sample households and 46,109 respondents (aged 10 years and older). The Statistical Institute has since conducted a survey at an interval of five years. The objectives of these surveys are broad: (i) estimate quality of life, (ii) estimate time spent on unpaid work and value it in satellite accounts, (iii) formulate public policies on labour, welfare, gender, education and transportation and (iv) produce internationally comparable data. Under these national time-use surveys (1999 onwards), data were collected for two diary days from respondents. They used an elaborate background questionnaire to collect detailed information on the selected households and individuals.

An investigator visited them first to fill in the background questionnaire (for households and for individuals) and to hand out the time diary form and then returned to collect the completed diary. The survey looked to assess the work\u2013 life balance, estimate time spent on care and voluntary work, understand economic transformations and to value unpaid work performed by men and women. The context variables were (i) location, (ii) with whom and (iii) paid and unpaid work. The developed countries have designed more or less a standard method (including time-use activity classification) for conducting time-use surveys, with some minor 12 Time-use surveys and statistics in Asia and the Pacific variations.12 The details highlighted here describe the major characteristics \u2013 the objectives, sampling method, data collection method, classification system, and context variables. The data are supposed to be of standard quality and are comparable across the developed countries. The data also have been used by researchers in analysing several socioeconomic concerns and have had various uses. 1.2 Time-use surveys in the developing and emerging countries The discussions below concern countries that have conducted time-use survey at any time in the past, including with small scale surveys. The 24 developing and emerging countries that have conducted time-use surveys can be divided into two broad categories: the countries that have conducted only small-scale surveys and the countries that have conducted national surveys. The countries with national time-use surveys are also of two types: countries that have conducted surveys as a module of a larger national survey and countries that conducted a stand-alone survey using a 24- hour time diary for data collection. Countries with only small-scale time-use surveys It is useful to understand the nature of these surveys and see why countries have not conducted any national survey and whether they want to conduct one. Many of these countries are island countries in the Pacific (Fiji, Kiribati, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu) as well as Indonesia and Sri Lanka. Brunei Darussalam, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Myanmar, Palau and Singapore have not conducted any time-use survey, while Cook Islands is the only country (among the developing and emerging countries) to have carried out a national modular time-use survey. Leaving out the more prosperous nations of Brunei Darussalam and Singapore, some of the island countries have populations with low levels of literacy and different perceptions of time, which render existing time-use survey approaches unsuitable. The NSO in Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Philippines and Tuvalu has conducted only a pilot survey or a small survey. The time-use researchers, including anthropologists, in these countries had a variety of objectives for the surveys. They were primarily interested in understanding and measuring inequalities in the burden of work borne by men and women and the consequent fewer opportunities in life for women. Some of them also wanted to give visibility to women\u2019s work, mainly informal work, subsistence work, household upkeep and care, including care provided to chronically ill HIV-positive patients. The FAO conducted small time-use surveys under its Righting the Wrongs programme13 that 12 These variations relate to the grouping of activities and three-digit activity lists. 13 his project was undertaken by the FAO in many developing countries where agriculture is predominant. A review of challenges and future directions 13 aimed at giving visibility to women\u2019s work in agriculture and allied activities to promote women\u2019s role in decision-making and their overall empowerment. The Tourism Department in Fiji conducted a time-use survey in 2003 to assess the burden of work on women and to see how women could be involved in the growth of tourism. A small time-use survey was conducted in Vanuatu using the participatory rapid appraisal method to create awareness of the unequal sharing of work by men and women and to prepare a daily \u201cgender calendar\u201d to highlight the gender gaps. Kiribati conducted a small time-use survey to obtain \u201ca snapshot of the day\u201d and to see whether and how women could help in forestry and nursery promotion. A variety of methods were used in these surveys.

Some researchers used community-based surveys through participatory rapid appraisals, including focus group discussions. Other methods involved: (i) non-participant observation (under which use of time was observed from a distance), (ii) random observation, (iii) community discussion (community meets and comes to a conclusion on sharing of work by men and women), (iv) a stylized activity list, with which respondents are asked about the time they generally spend on each item (sometimes they included a reference period, such as one week or one day) and (v) a 24-hour time diary, usually with a time slot of one to three hours. The FAO time-use surveys wanted to test eight methods of data collection: rapid appraisal by checklist, interview questionnaire, participant observation, non-participant observation, group feedback analysis, group discussion using a checklist, 24-hour self- reported time diary and 24-hour recall. They concluded that the best method involves men observing men and women observing women. The Philippines piloted a time-use survey in 2000 that covered one rural and one urban area, long after academic researchers had conducted small-scale surveys in 1975, 1976 and 1977. White (1983) conducted a small survey in Indonesia in 1972\u201373 and 1977\u201378 to estimate gender inequalities in the time spent on paid and unpaid work. Although the reference was one year, the sample was small, consisting of 80\u2013100 households (see Annex I for details). The Government then piloted a time-use survey in rural areas (100 villages) in 1998\u201399 and later in urban areas (five municipalities) in 2004 and in 2005 (four urban centres). A 24-hour time diary was filled in by respondents aged 15 or older in selected households. Because literacy is low in Indonesia, only people who could read were asked to fill in the one- to three-hour time diary. In Malaysia, a small modular time-use survey was conducted by the Ministry of Women, Family and Community Development in 1990\u201391, in collaboration with the 14 Time-use surveys and statistics in Asia and the Pacific FAO and other United Nations agencies. It was conducted during the agricultural season, and stylized questions were asked. The Ministry followed with another survey in 2003 that covered 15,000 households and 32,000 persons. Unfortunately, not much information was available on this exercise. It appears from different records that a few small-scale time-use surveys were conducted in Sri Lanka, although there was no use of context variables, collection of data on simultaneous activities or systematic activity classification. According to UNSD records, a small-scale time-use survey was conducted in Viet Nam. In addition, modular surveys (along with the national LSMS) were conducted in 1992, 1997, 2002 and in 2004. The Statistical Centre (NSO) in the Islamic Republic of Iran conducted two small time-use surveys in selected urban centres in 2008 and 2009. The 2009 survey was spread over two periods: December 2008\u2013March 2009 and June\u2013September 2009. These pilot surveys had small coverage because the researchers thought that rural respondents would not be able to fill in a time diary. Although the surveys followed established methods \u2013 background questionnaire, 24-hour self-reported time diary with 15-minute time slots and use of activity groups (15), only the literate population was targeted. The NSO of Tuvalu conducted a pilot time-use survey in 2003 as a part of its Social and Wellbeing Survey under a Participatory Monitoring and Evaluation Project to measure the impact of the Island Development Trust on the quality of life in the islands over a six-year period. Along with household and individual characteristics, time-use data were collected from selected household members (aged 18\u201382 years) for the week prior to the survey. There is no doubt that small-scale surveys, including anthropological surveys, are useful. They provide valuable insights into the dynamics of gender inequalities, help address local socioeconomic and cultural issues and are useful in creating awareness among communities and for policy advocacy. Nonetheless, given the variety of concepts and methods used, their results are not comparable with each other. Also, they cannot be considered representative of their respective country and thus cannot be used for national policy-making.

This was the case even when the time slots are of one to three hours. Ironmonger observed that in several island countries, time does not make much sense to people (UNDP, 2005). Some experts attribute the hesitation by many developing countries to conduct national time-use surveys to several issues: (i) statistical offices and policy-makers do not appreciate the utility of time-use data in addressing socioeconomic concerns; (ii) they do not have the required capacity to collect, process, analyse and use the data; (iii) the funds required for these surveys are not available; (iv) the data collected frequently have serious quality limitations; and (v) standardized and harmonized concepts and methods, including activity classification at the global level, for conducting the survey are not available (UNDP, 2004; Corner, 2003; Hirway, 2003; Budlender, 2003). Countries with national time-use surveys Most of the countries that have conducted national time-use surveys started with a small-scale exercise carried out by private researchers, including anthropologists (from the 1970s through the 1990s), that covered a small number of villages, households and/or one or two urban centres. These surveys used a variety of methods and activity classifications and investigated specific issues, sectors or regions. Though most of these countries also faced the type of constraints cited above for small-scale surveys, they somehow transitioned into conducting national time-use surveys: Bangladesh from 1974 onwards, India from 1976 onwards, Indonesia from 1972 onwards, Nepal from 1977 onwards, Thailand from 1990 onwards, Mongolia from 2000 onwards and Malaysia from 1972. The 24 countries that have conducted national surveys experienced several constraints while using the 24-hour time diary (described previously). They became resourceful in their alternative approaches: (i) linking the use of time to major common events (such as office time, school time and timings of TV or radio programmes) to help respondents recall activity, (ii) using bigger time slots (a 30-minute to a one-hour time slot) to fill in time diaries and (iii) asking respondents to report the time spent on a list of activities (stylized questions). Being predominantly agricultural, these countries need seasonal data on time use to reflect seasonal variations. This being typically expensive to manage, many countries have done a single-day or period survey, but in doing so failed to provide seasonal variations in people\u2019s use of time. NSO staff and policy-makers in these countries also grappled with the lack of adequate funds, lack of expertise and poor appreciation of the utility of time-use data. However, their experiences with the small time-use surveys as well as the influence of global 16 Time-use surveys and statistics in Asia and the Pacific literature and outside consultants contributed towards improving awareness about the importance of national surveys. The 1995 Human Development Report, the global women\u2019s conference in Beijing in 1995 and its Platform for Action declaration as well as the United Nations\u2019 SNA 1993 release were a major source of motivation for these countries to forge ahead with time-consuming and expensive national time-use surveys.14 Financial as well as technical support from international organizations and donor agencies helped, although the result was not always ideal. As donor agencies frequently tried to minimize costs by covering a large number of countries under these surveys, many governments faced difficult trade-offs and ended up making several \u201cpragmatic\u201d compromises in sample size (reduced), coverage, survey design (avoiding seasons) and data collection methods (simple and short list of activities) \u2013 these compromises and short cuts are discussed further on. 14 These vents were followed by number of countries conducting time-use surveys in the developing world.

For example, the World Bank funded such surveys as a part of the LSMS in Nepal, Timor-Leste and Viet Nam. UNDP promoted such surveys in Malaysia (within the Labour Force Survey), Cambodia (within the Socioeconomic Survey), Cook Islands (within the Household Income and Expenditure Survey) and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (within the Consumption and Expenditure Survey). The ILO also supported a modular time-use survey with the Labour Force Survey in Nepal in 1998\u201399. LSMS and modular time-use surveys: The LSMS was established by the World Bank in 1980 to explore ways of improving the type and quality of household data collected by developing country governments. The goal of the LSMS is to foster the use of household data as the basis for policy-making. The World Bank has conducted an LSMS in about 40 countries in the developing world. Because time-use data are critical for understanding the living standards, the LSMS frequently uses a module that collects time-use data of men and women in selected households. The details of the activity list used in a country depend on the specific needs of that country. The NSO in Viet Nam, for example, has conducted five LSMS versions (1992, 1997, 2002, 2004 and 2010) in collaboration with the World Bank. These surveys collected data from selected household members (older than 15) using stylized questions. Unfortunately, not many details on these surveys were accessible.15 Timor-Leste conducted an LSMS in 2001 and 2007 (concluding in 2008 due to internal conflict), with a time-use survey module in both (Timor-Leste Survey of 15 One major issue for this paper was access to information on time-use studies in several countries. Despite trying all possible sources of information, we could not get information for a few countries. A review of challenges and future directions 19 Living Standards). The survey collected limited data on respondents\u2019 use of time, however. Other global organizations and modular time-use surveys: The UNDP approach in time-use surveys aims at giving visibility to women\u2019s unpaid work and to gender inequalities in the time spent by men and women on paid and unpaid work. It also collects information on how people spend their leisure time. UNDP has frequently used funds from the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency to promote modular surveys. The idea is to reduce the cost of conducting a time-use survey so that it can be adopted in many more countries. Cook Islands conducted a time-use survey in 1998 as a module of its national Household Income and Expenditure Survey, which was conducted by its NSO under the UNDP Poverty Strategies Initiative Trust Fund. The national survey, which provided major indicators of the economic health of the nation and well-being of its people, covered 15 per cent of households. The reference period was one week, and the respondents (older than 15) were asked for details on their use of time in the week prior to the survey. The activity list included ten groups.16 The survey did not collect data on simultaneous activities and did not use any context variables. The National Statistical Commission conducted the first national modular time-use survey in Kyrgyzstan in 2005 and the second in 2010. The Government then decided to continue the survey every five years. In Malaysia the Ministry of Women conducted a national time-use survey in August\u2013 September 2014 (with financial and technical support from UNDP) to assess women\u2019s burden of work and to recommend ways of raising the workforce participation rate of women in the labour market to boost economic growth (Ministry of Women and UNDP, 2014). The study was undertaken as a module of the national Labour Force Survey and covered 2,640 women aged 20\u201360 years who reported how much time they spent on listed activities during the 24 hours prior to the survey.17 The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic conducted its first national Expenditure and Consumption Survey in 1992 and has repeated it every five years. It includes a module to collect information on the use of time by men and women in the sample households. Bhutan initiated a time-use survey in 2006 to estimate people\u2019s happiness in their unique Gross National Happiness index.

Nepal also started with small-scale time-use surveys in the 1970s (and continued through the 1980s and to 1992 and 1993\u201394). It then launched a national modular time-use survey (by the NSO) in 1996 with the LSMS. In 1998\u201399, the NSO switched it to a module of the national Labour Force Survey (helped by the International Labour Organization, ILO). It continued with a modular survey in the Labour Force Survey in 2003 and 2008. The data on time use was collected using stylized questions. Nepal was one of the first countries in the developing world to conduct systematic but small scale time-use surveys. Meena Acharya, a well-known Nepali feminist economist, conducted them in the 1980s and developed a classification of activities that valued unpaid work (based on guidelines from the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women, or INSTRAW). Cambodia conducted its first time-use survey in 2004 as a module of the national Socioeconomic Survey, which was carried out from November 2003 to January 2005. It is the only country that has ever employed a modular time-use survey using 24-hour self-reported time diaries and collecting information on the activity taking most time during each period of half hour. The activity list included six major groups and other details. The survey, however, experienced several limitations (discussed further on). 2.2 National independent surveys As noted previously, six countries (Bangladesh, China, India, Mongolia, Pakistan and Thailand) have conducted surveys using 24-hour time diaries. Of them, Bangladesh, China and India conducted large surveys with a representative sample and are thus treated here as national surveys. They also have expressed intent to conduct national time-use surveys in the near future (see Annex V for details). The National Bureau of Statistics in China piloted a time-use survey in two provinces (Yunnan and Zhejiang) in 2005. The respondents provided two 24-hour self-reported time diaries on different activities divided into seven groups. The National Bureau of Statistics followed with a larger survey in May 2008 that covered ten cities and rural areas and collected information on simultaneous activities using context variables through a 24-hour time diary for the month. After researchers conducted two small time-use surveys in the 1970s, the Government of Bangladesh launched a national Labour Force Survey in 1984\u201385, and then again in 1990\u201391, both of which included a small time-use module. The Bureau of Statistics, however, did not consider the data good enough for publication. Dhaka University, with A review of challenges and future directions 21 18 These methods are rapid appraisal by checklist, diary method, interview questionnaire, participant observation, non- participant observation, 24-hour recall, group discussion, group feedback analysis. assistance from the Canadian International Development Research Centre, conducted a small time-use survey (1,000 households) using anthropological methods (observation methods) to collect data on the distribution of expenditure by household members. In 2012, the Bureau of Statistics piloted a survey using a 24-hour time diary that was filled in by interviewers. The first time-use survey in Pakistan was small but carried out from 1986 to 1989 by the International Food Policy Research Institute in collaboration with the Government, and funded by the United States Agency for International Development. The study covered 800 households in 44 villages, with the objective of informing policies related to food security and food management. As previously noted, the FAO conducted a small time-use survey in Pakistan in 1990\u201391 to try out eight collection methods.18 The latest iteration was a national, stand-alone time-use survey conducted throughout most of 2007 by the Federal Bureau of Statistics that covered almost the entire country (97 per cent of the population) to assess seasonal changes. India has a history of researchers conducting small-scale time-use surveys (1976\u201377, 1980, 1987 and 1990\u201391). In 1990\u201391, the FAO also carried out a small survey under its Righting the Wrongs programme.

Such a survey was conducted in China in1995, in India (in two states) in 1997 and in Nepal in 1996 and in 2003. Such modular surveys were conducted in Viet Nam in 1992, 1997, 2002 and in 2004. Mongolia and Thailand are the only two countries among the emerging and developing countries in the region that have mainstreamed time-use surveys as stand-alone exercises. In Mongolia, the first time-use survey (a pilot) was conducted in 2000. Supported by UNDP, it used a 24-hour self-reported time diary. The ensuing Statistical Law of 2004 required a national time-use survey every four years. Surveys were conducted in 2007, 2011, and 2015. The survey improved over the years with the expansion of the reference period and number of people covered. The survey is conducted throughout the year \u2013 in March, June, September and December. Regular reports are published with preliminary (tables) analysis in local language (see Annex V for details). Thailand\u2019s first time-use survey was conducted in 1990\u201391 under the FAO Righting the Wrongs programme. Then in 2000\u201301, the NSO conducted the first national 22 Time-use surveys and statistics in Asia and the Pacific stand-alone time-use survey. It has been repeated every three to four years since (in 2004, 2009 and 2014\u201315). There has been continuous improvement in the content and coverage: (i) the 2001 and 2004 surveys were conducted in August, the 2009 survey covered three months (June\u2013August), while the following ones covered a full year (such as July 2014\u2013June 2015); (ii) the sample size increased; (iii) the classification became more detailed \u2013 the latest survey had a five-digit classification; (iv) the time slot was reduced to 5 minutes in the time diary; and (v) the minimum age (at 10 years) was reduced to 6 years in the 2014\u201315 survey. One person was selected from each household to fill in the time diary. The NSO publishes systematic reports on the data. 2.3 Concerns relating to modular time-use surveys There is ongoing debate on modular versus stand-alone time-use surveys. As explained initially, a modular time-use survey is a dependent survey \u2013 a part (module) of a major survey. There are frequent arguments on the advantages: It is less costly when compared with a stand-alone survey because information is collected as replies to a list of questions and not through a 24-hour time diary; it is easy to conduct because it needs less effort in data collection and analysis; and it is easy to institutionalize because it is typically conducted with a regular national survey. In contrast, a stand- alone survey has relatively high start-up costs, and it is not easy to institutionalize. Because it is conducted every four to seven years, the survey operations are irregular and that makes it difficult to accumulate and absorb knowledge and experience to achieve efficient and reliable survey results. It also limits the opportunity to develop independent technical and field staff in time-use methods. Many countries thus favour a modular time-use survey. But a modular survey may have limited scope for data collection. A time-use modular survey cannot be very large because it is only a component of a national survey. Also, the module tends to collect information that is related to the main survey. The collected information may not be adequate to understand the use of time by men and women in a comprehensive manner. Yet, 24-hour time diaries can be modular and attached to a Labour Force Survey or other general household survey. In this case, the diary is applied to persons who are in the sample at a designated wave or quarter, often through a follow-up visit. Most modular time-use surveys collect data by asking stylized questions. Investigators present a list of activities and ask respondents to report how much time they spent on each of those activities during the reference day (the previous day) or the reference week. It is usually a short or slightly long list of activities of specific interest, because it would be difficult to manage something more exhaustive and check that the total time adds up to 24 hours (oversights can occur; for instance, respondents usually do not keep total time in mind when replying).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "178ab270-204f-4e3e-9e84-fefe6ab9c7be": {"__data__": {"id_": "178ab270-204f-4e3e-9e84-fefe6ab9c7be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Time Use Surveys and Statistics in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4eb72577cf6a0f3ac3cd1863ac0747fc6e006a5222ce0bf1cb07ce5102b98736"}, "2": {"node_id": "5b20f0ba-99c1-4572-a72e-3d4acecb59a1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d3017c548468eb660d9bbfb9e48e8997feaadce70e5e1f9dec20f90e15736eb4"}}, "hash": "6d46574dcd32d027ba3dab26496a8173fb75669cc22d7ad8796d0a8565f62b02", "text": "Post-survey reviews from Madagascar and A review of challenges and future directions 23 19 See United Nations: Guide to producing statistics on time use: Measuring paid and unpaid work (New York, Statistics Division, 2005); See ECA: Time use studies, national accounts and national budget (Addis Ababa, 2003); See ESCAP: Guidebook on integrating paid and unpaid work into national policies (Bangkok, 2003).

Additionally, this method does not give information on total use of time in a 24-hour period. Doubts emerged in the literature over the quality of data collected through stylized questions. The UNSD (2005) Guide to Producing Statistics on Time Use19, for example, noted that stylized questions tend to produce results with a high degree of error. For instance, respondents find it difficult to report the time spent on intermittent or scattered activities. Kalton (in United Nations, 2005) as well as Bonke (2002) compared the performance of both methods (time diaries based on one-day recall and stylized questions) and found errors clearly emerging from stylized questions. The errors related not only to problems of recall but also to the social desirability of activities. Additionally, respondents tend to underreport the time spent on activities that are less important or less desirable and overreport the time on activities of more importance or desirability. Kalton (2005) noted that errors vary across socioeconomic groups, while Bonke (2002) found that the gap in the results of both methods was larger for women than for men. The surveys review identified several other problems: Stylized questions do not provide the time of day when an activity was performed. Time-use data on simultaneous activities cannot be accurately collected because respondents are not able to identify separately all these activities or the precise time spent on them. It is also not easy to use context variables efficiently. Respondents find it difficult to respond to context variables, such as for whom and with whom for each episode while responding to stylized questions. And finally, recall can be a serious problem with stylized questions when the reference period is more than one day. A one-week reference period in the time-use surveys in Nepal and Papua New Guinea, for example, was characterized as seriously problematic because it affected the quality of the data due to rough approximations of time spent. If a time diary is used in a modular survey in a single visit, it becomes difficult for investigators and respondents to shift to a different method of data collection at the end of the main survey. The quality of data is likely to be less than satisfactory. Organizing a follow-up and stand-alone time-use survey after the main survey is conducted is recommended (India has opted for this approach). In short, the 2005 UNSD guidebook recommends that for good-quality national time- use data, NSOs should use stand-alone surveys that employ time diaries \u2013 filled in by any reliable method. 24 Time-use surveys and statistics in Asia and the Pacific Objectives of national time-use surveys 3 A review of challenges and future directions 25 A nnex II presents objectives of the time-use surveys in the 37 countries covered in this paper. There are clear differences between developed and developing countries. In developed countries, where it is assumed that Labour Force Surveys provide reliable estimates, time-use data are regarded as useful in estimating non-SNA work, valuing unpaid work in satellite accounts and in understanding a number of socioeconomic issues, such as gender inequalities, transportation, balancing family and work, loneliness of older persons and social capital. One major objective of time-use surveys in the four developed countries covered here was to collect information on how people spend their time on different activities. Other objectives that seemed to be particularly important beginning in the 1990s related to gender inequalities \u2013 \u201cto analyse gender inequalities\u201d, \u201cto estimate time spent by men and women on care\u201d20, including child care; and compiling satellite accounts of unpaid work in monetary terms to estimate women\u2019s contribution to the economy. In Japan and the Republic of Korea, the time-use survey was conducted by a broadcasting company (NHK in Japan and KBS in the Republic of Korea). These companies were mainly interested in collecting data on how people spend leisure time and in knowing more about the socio-cultural lives of people. The NSOs shifted the focus of time-use survey on estimating gender inequalities and measuring contribution of unpaid work to national well-being in the late 1990s and onwards. Other objectives in these countries related to social concerns, such as the work\u2013life balance, how men and women spend their leisure time and lifestyles, as well as socioeconomic concerns related to ageing (how older persons spend their time), health, child care, environment issues, traffic and transportation policy. Objectives related to poverty, the informal sector or employment were essentially absent. A common objective of the national time-use surveys in the developing and emerging countries was to improve estimates of paid", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f0c4a51e-6a3a-4218-9580-46d1bac3a13b": {"__data__": {"id_": "f0c4a51e-6a3a-4218-9580-46d1bac3a13b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Time Use Surveys and Statistics in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d058c0111d8ea0c600959a2640dbb4aa2a93dbd88bf8cba4ced212283f6c28ed"}}, "hash": "d058c0111d8ea0c600959a2640dbb4aa2a93dbd88bf8cba4ced212283f6c28ed", "text": "work or SNA work, particularly in informal and subsistence work. Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia and Mongolia expressed this as collecting information on participation and time spent on agriculture and allied activities, handicrafts and collection of water and fuelwood or information on how individuals in rural areas spend their time. But Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Thailand aimed at getting improved estimates of workforce or getting detailed information on paid and unpaid work of men and women or to get reliable estimates on labour inputs in an economy. China articulated it as a measure of women\u2019s unremunerated work, while Viet Nam sought reliable data on living standards. Several countries (China, India, Pakistan, Philippines and Thailand) also had compiling satellite accounts of unpaid work as an objective. Many countries had secondary objectives. China also sought to measure the quality of life. Malaysia also wanted to test eight methods of time-use data collection to see which 20 Centre for Time Use Research: https://www.timeuse.org/ . 26 Time-use surveys and statistics in Asia and the Pacific method gives the most accurate data on women\u2019s agrarian labour;21 Mongolia wanted to study household patterns and change; Thailand wanted to understand people\u2019s participation in cultural- and custom-related activities and to produce internationally comparable data (see Annex II). In short, the focus on getting improved estimates of all forms of work, improved estimates of employment and working time and measures gender inequalities as well as valuation of unpaid work were much in line with the major needs of these countries. There was also a realization that the conventional Labour Force Surveys were not adequately capturing the size and characteristics of the prevailing informal and subsistence work. 21 These methods are rapid appraisal by checklist, diary method, interview questionnaire, participant observation, non- participant observation 24-hour recall, group discussion and group feedback analysis. A review of challenges and future directions 27 Background questionnaire4 28 Time-use surveys and statistics in Asia and the Pacific T here are two types of background questionnaires used in national time-use surveys: In the modular format, the main survey is treated as the background schedule, while a background questionnaire for a stand-alone survey is specifically designed, keeping in mind the objectives of the survey. For the modular format, the background schedule is determined by the objectives of the main survey (such as the Living Standards Measurement Survey, the Labour Force Survey, the Household Income and Expenditure Survey or any other household survey), which may not accommodate the objectives of the time-use survey. For example, a time-use module in a Labour Force Survey will have different background data from a module in an Income and Expenditure Survey. Thus, the subject of the main survey is likely to restrict the analysis of the time-use data. A Labour Force Survey may not help in compiling household satellite accounts or estimate the care economy; or a Household Income and Expenditure Survey may not provide the required data on estimating informal and subsistence employment. The selection of the main survey to latch on the time-use survey module needs to be done carefully. Also, to design another elaborate background questionnaire for the time-use module would be impractical. In general, modular surveys are weak in designing background information for facilitating analysis of the time-use data. This then puts a restriction on the use of the data. In the case of stand-alone time-use surveys, there is good scope for collecting the required data on households and individuals. All developed countries have a long tradition of collecting background information for selected households and for selected individuals. Household information includes major characteristics, such as place of residence (province and city or village and rural or urban), size and composition, race and social groups, total income and sometimes source of income and house conditions; and the individual questionnaire covers age, sex, marital status, occupation, education, health status (if sick), details of employment (industry and occupation status) if any and income earned. Whether the background questionnaire of a national time-use survey is adequate to meet the objectives of the survey is an important question. The background schedule of a time-use survey must be sensitive to the objectives of the survey. It is an important component of a time-use survey because the data is usually analysed with reference to the information collected in the background schedule.

The background questionnaires of the time-use surveys in Bangladesh, China, India, Mongolia, Pakistan and Thailand have collected rich information on household and individual characteristics. The Chinese time-use survey collected individual information on age, sex, marital status, occupation, education, income earned and distance between home and the workplace. The official report, which presented tables based on the data, used those variables. One problem with the Chinese time-use survey was that the report and the data did not use all the data collected on households and individuals. The background questionnaire also had general questions about the nature of the day (too busy, normal, etc). The time-use surveys in Mongolia also included more or less the same details in the background schedules. For employment, however, they used details like occupation, employment status, unemployment and part-time employment. In Thailand\u2019s time-use surveys, the background questionnaire collected the usual information on selected households. The individual questionnaire covered relationship with the household head, age, sex, marital status, religion, employment status, occupation and industry in which the person was working. The background questionnaires in India were elaborate. The household questionnaire included questions on head of household, size and composition of household, social group (religion and caste), average monthly consumption expenditure and per capita monthly consumption expenditure, household assets, land owned and operated, housing, main industry (code) and main occupation (code) of the household and whether there was any disabled person in the household. The individual questionnaire included questions on age, sex, marital status, education, relation with the household head, usual activity status (principle and subsidiary), industry and enterprise status and participation in decision-making. The survey also asked general questions on the type of day (normal or atypical and week day or weekend day) and the nature of the questionnaire (easy, difficult, etc.). Pakistan used an elaborate background questionnaire (five to six pages). The information on the selected households included head of household, the respondent (name and sex), household income by source and the main source of income; consumption, savings, investments; housing conditions (earthquake affected, kutcha, pucca); sources of energy for cooking, lighting and heating; use of firewood and distance to the source; source of water supply and distance to the source; access to transportation facility (distance); access to major government services (distance); number of children in the household (aged 0\u20137 years and 8\u201318 years), who does household work and so on. The individual questionnaire was also elaborate and covered information on age, sex, education, marital status, children in the household and a number of employment issues. These questions included whether the person 30 Time-use surveys and statistics in Asia and the Pacific had worked at least one hour in the previous week, whether they had work or a job in general, employment status (whether the person was unemployed, looking for work or available for work), income earned, designation and details of the enterprise where they were working, such as nature of the establishment, whether it files accounts, employs regular workers and the number of workers employed. Interestingly, the questionnaire also included questions like (i) whether the person used a watch or has a clock, (ii) whether the day of the interview was normal or not and (iii) how the person is feeling about their time use \u2013 are they too busy? The Bangladesh time-use survey also had an elaborate background questionnaire. The household information collected included head of household, source of energy for light and for cooking, source of water supply, participation in selected household occupations (livestock, poultry, dairy, horticulture, small and cottage industry and pisci- culture), occupation assets owned and main and other sources of income.

There appears to be large variations across countries in the way they have designed the background questionnaire. On one hand, there is China and Mongolia, which collected the details usually collected in any household survey; while on the other hand, there is Pakistan, which designed an elaborate background questionnaire. Overall, none of the background questionnaires reviewed for this paper seemed adequate to provide information to meet the objectives of the respective surveys for the following possible reasons. \u2022 None of the background schedules helped in understanding the care economy in their respective country because none collected data on the need for care in the household (presence of someone disabled, chronically sick person, older person needing care and children by age group22), and how it was organized at the household level, such as who provides care: household women, other household members, elder child, government support, the market or NGO groups. Hence, it was difficult to understand the total care needed at the household and macro levels and how it was shared at the household level and at the macro level by different agencies. \u2022 Similarly, household upkeep requires data on the technology used, such as cooking (fuel and stove used), washing, cleaning and shopping.23 This information helps in 22 The nature of child care depends on the age of children, thus ages of children are necessary. 23 Because the time needed depends on the technology used, this information helps in identifying drudgery of household work. A review of challenges and future directions 31 assessing the drudgery component of this work. Also, information on how this work is shared within the household and between household members and hired workers will help in assessing the sharing of burden of work. While Pakistan has collected some of the data (not all), other countries have missed this data. \u2022 For valuation of unpaid work, the background questionnaires need to collect data on the value of assets along with ownership by sex. Although data on assets were collected by a few countries, the asset ownership was missing from all questionnaires. \u2022 Collection of data on employment, such as occupation, industry, employment status, number of jobs done, wages earned, whether the person has worked for at least one hour in the previous seven days or whether the person has looked for work or is available for work are important data. But there was no provision to get this information from the additional work that was captured through the details of the time use of respondents. Also, in the case of multiple jobs, there was no way to link that information with the time use of the respondent. In short, there is need to give more attention to designing the background questionnaire. The usual details for households and individuals generally are not sufficient. It appears that there was a poor appreciation of the potential of this schedule to enrich the time-use data. 32 Time-use surveys and statistics in Asia and the Pacific Sampling under time-use surveys 5 A review of challenges and future directions 33 S ampling under time-use surveys includes sampling of households and household members as well as sampling of time \u2013 number of days per selected household members and the period of the year (the reference period). 5.1 Sampling of households and members with stand-alone time-use surveys The basic issues for sampling for a time-use survey are the same as faced by any household-based survey, except that the sample size is usually smaller than the other national surveys because they are more time consuming and more expensive. Sometimes, as previously pointed out, NSOs and researchers reduce the sample size of a time-use survey to an unacceptable level. This tends to raise sampling errors and limits the possibility for disaggregated analysis. Both factors tend to reduce the utility of the data. The size of a sample for time-use surveys is thus an important issue. There are certain factors that must be considered when determining the number of households for a time-use survey: It is important that the household sample is drawn systematically using multi-stage stratified random sampling techniques. A geographical cluster approach is doable to reduce sampling errors as well as keeping the sample size manageable. It is important, however, to draw a sufficiently large sample to have more than enough numbers to analyse the small cells. The issue of sample size is also tied to the issue of minimizing field costs. A cluster design approach that geographically concentrates field work will save on travel and administration costs.

The sample size of a time-use survey can be expanded with least cost by (i) increasing the number of persons in the survey and (ii) increasing the number of days of each person selected for the survey. Selecting all members of a sample household (older than a certain age) is a useful strategy. Selecting more than one day per person is definitely another way of enlarging the sample size. An important sample design decision is whether to include all members of a sample household (reference population). Several countries have used the one member (Thailand) or two members (Pakistan) chosen randomly approach. However, there are important advantages in selecting all eligible members (older than a minimum age) in the sample. First, it helps in estimating the distribution of tasks across a household \u2013 the larger the household, the more options for variation in the performance of different tasks across members. Second, it provides more detail of the power and task dynamics within a household. Third, it helps in unpacking the intra-household dynamics by assessing how those dynamics work. An additional reason for selecting multiple persons per household is cost-efficiency. Most population surveys are based 34 Time-use surveys and statistics in Asia and the Pacific on household samples, and it is generally less expensive to collect the survey data from a sample of persons clustered in a smaller number of households than to spread the sample over a larger number of households. From that perspective, the most efficient design is the one that minimizes the sampling errors of the survey estimates for a given budget. To determine an efficient design therefore requires an evaluation of the effects on sampling error of clustering the sample of persons within households. This evaluation involves both the effect of weighting for unequal selection probabilities and the effect of cluster homogeneity. Another factor to consider in determining the numbers of persons to be selected from sampled households is that of household response burden. When data on time use are collected on all adult household members for example, the burden of interviewing all of them may be perceived as excessive on the household. This perception may then lead to unacceptable levels of non-response. Household response burden is particularly high with large households and when all persons are selected per household. Methods should be devised to reduce this burden on households and individuals household members. One common point that emerged in all the national time-use surveys was that the sampling was done using multi-stage stratified random sampling \u2013 the sample of households was selected systematically. The size of the sample, however, varied from country to country, depending on the size of the country or the size of the population of that country, the coverage of the survey and the sampling techniques used. For example, the Bangladesh survey had 378 households and the Indonesian pilot survey had 360 households, while the large surveys used a larger sample: The Cambodian survey covered 15,000 households, the Chinese survey covered 37,142 households (for selected provinces), the Pakistan survey targeted 196,000 households, the last Thai survey had 27,000 households and the Indian pilot survey had 18,600 households (in six states). All of them used variations of multi-stage stratified random sampling method. The minimum age for eligible respondents varied from 5 years in Nepal, Timor-Leste and Cambodia to 15 years in China, Cook Islands, Indonesia and Malaysia. India kept it at 6 years, while the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Pakistan and Thailand used 10 years. Mongolia kept it at 12 years. Some countries set a maximum age also \u2013 China used 74 as the age limit for respondents, while Malaysia used 64 years. The countries interested in studying problems of children\u2019s time use, including child labour, reduced the minimum age. Even though time diaries were reported by the respondent, a parent or any older household member was allowed to help when it was a child respondent.24 The uneven coverage of minimum and maximum ages likely created problems in cross- country comparability of data. 24 For example, several countries have allowed adults to refer to each other while responding to time-use diary.

Similarly, Kyrgyzstan selected from the persons who were at home when the investigators visited the household. In both cases, there were problems of comparability of the data with other countries due to the different definition of household. 5.2 Time sampling with stand-alone surveys Sampling of time for which the data are collected needs to be representative of the total time of sampled households. Two decisions are important here for selecting a representative time sample: How many diary days should be sampled per household member? And what should be the reference period of the survey, for example, for how many months should the data on time use be collected? The simplest design is to collect time-use data for a single day for each sampled person. This approach avoids problems of collecting data for many days, and it places the least burden on selected persons. The UNSD Guide to Producing Statistics on Time Use, the ECE guidelines25 as well as the European Union guidelines on time-use surveys26 recommend selecting two diary days for each person: one week day and the other weekly variant day (could be a weekend day), because these two days represent the time use of persons fairly satisfactorily. Most countries followed this pattern. It is important to maintain randomness in the selection. The selection of four days per person enables two weekdays, one Saturday and one Sunday to be chosen (where this weekly pattern is the norm). It will also cut down the costs. From these four days, a synthetic week estimate could be constructed. Survey designers should consider the minimum number of representations of a particular day of the week and select the sample to produce tolerable standard errors, given specific analytical objectives (Bittman, 2000). Ideally, a time-use survey should represent a full 12-month period. Failing that, a purposive selection of a \u201crepresentative\u201d set of, say, two, three or four individual months may be used or, if resource constraints so dictate, the data collection could be confined to a single \u201ctypical\u201d time period. Whatever the chosen period, within that period, the day or days for which each respondent reports time use should be specified and chosen by a random selection procedure. 25 See ECE: Guidelines for harmonizing time-use surveys (Geneva, October 2013). 26 See EUROSTAT: Harmonised European time use surveys; 2008 guidelines (European Communities, 2009). 36 Time-use surveys and statistics in Asia and the Pacific Countries differ in the number of persons per household selected for collecting time- use data. In the countries covered here, China and Thailand collected time-use data for one person per household, while Pakistan chose two persons, and the other countries selected all eligible persons (older than a certain age). The countries also differed in the number of days covered: Bangladesh, Cambodia and China used one diary day per person, while India,27 Mongolia, Pakistan and Thailand used two diary days per person. The two days usually included one week day and a weekly variant day. Mongolia grouped the days of a week into three groups and selected days in a manner that each day had an equal probability of being selected. Several modular surveys selected more than one day \u2013 usually the seven days prior to the survey. Nepal collected data for the previous day, previous seven days and the previous one month. 5.3 Sampling in multi-purpose or modular surveys Sampling for two combined household surveys \u2013 the main survey and the time-use survey \u2013 raises several issues. One major concern is whether it is possible to create an efficient dual-purpose sampling design in which the objectives of the time dimension are properly represented. Because this sampling typically reflects the objectives of the larger survey, it will help if the time-use module has matching objectives. Apart from time-use surveys, few household surveys require that data be collected for specific days. Thus, the need to represent the time dimension appropriately in a design that combines a time-use survey with another survey requires a modification in the data-collection procedures so that it represents the criteria that would be used by the other survey if it were a stand-alone exercise. Because the modification will almost certainly impose restrictions on the timing of interviews, it may lead to a lower response rate for the combined survey than would be achieved if the other survey was conducted alone. This factor needs to be taken into account when a combined survey is considered. A time-use survey will most readily fit with another survey that involves spreading data collection over time.

The main concern here is the response burden. The response burden in such surveys is often substantial, so that when combined with the high burden of a time-use survey, the overall load may become excessive. The main complexity of sample design in time-use surveys is encountered when incorporating the time dimension. Most household surveys collect data that relate to a specific point or period of time (cross-sectional data) or that are assumed to change 27 In India, instructions were given to find out whether the day selected was an atypical day and, if yes, the interviewers were asked to select another day deemed more typical. A review of challenges and future directions 37 little over the time period of data collection. In time-use surveys, however, the estimates of interest are not for the activities that people engage in during a particular day or week but for a longer period of time, typically a year. Because people\u2019s activities can vary markedly by day of the week and season of the year, time-use surveys need to ensure that the sample design provides a suitable representation of the time period for which estimates are required. Should a modular time-use survey cover all days of the year or all seasons of the year? One basic option is to conduct the survey on a periodic or continuous basis over the entire year and to spread the total sample of households over each survey period. The ideal design of data collection over a 12-month period gives representation to the time dimension throughout the period. In many countries, a fieldwork plan can be developed to satisfy this requirement, for instance, spreading the interviews evenly over 12 months, both nationally and at subnational levels. However, such a design is not always possible. When it is not, the aim should be to approximate the ideal to the extent possible. In practice, the number of time periods selected is generally small, say, from two to four, and is chosen by purposive selection: data collection may cover a few separate months, chosen carefully to be \u201crepresentative\u201d and accounting for seasonality (thus spread over the year). Within the chosen months, the sample can then be spread across weeks and across days of the week. An alternative is to take a sample of time periods, such as weeks or months, and concentrate the data collection in those periods. The more periods that can be covered, the better. Choice of periods that are representative on average of the full 12 months is the point here. Whether the sample is spread across a full year or concentrated in certain periods, it is important to select days by probability method to avoid selection bias. Interviewers or respondents might choose days that are convenient for them \u2013 for instance, days when the respondent is at home. Such choices may lead to distorted estimates of time use. Probability sampling of days theoretically guarantees time-use estimates that are free of selection bias but only if the data are collected for the specified sample days. Every effort should be made to respect specified days. Constraints posed by limited resources or the use of a multi-purpose survey may restrict a time-use survey to a single period of one or two months. Interpreting the resulting estimates as typical of time-use patterns over a year is then not possible. Another option would be to conduct a single-period survey and acknowledge the analytical limitations of such an approach. 38 Time-use surveys and statistics in Asia and the Pacific 5.4 Long-term time use \u2013 Selecting seven diary days Researchers such as Gershuny (IATUR, 2012), argue that selecting two diary days does not capture the long-term time behaviour of people because there are likely to be several variations that may not be captured. For example, there are weekly variations in the use of time due to the many activities organized in the week cycle. A seven- day diary can give a fuller picture of a person\u2019s activity pattern during a week. In the context of flexible timings in the labour market, these variations could be significant for workers also. Some workers may perform different work on different days \u2013 some work for two to three days of the week, or small entrepreneurs may buy raw materials or sell products on market days. Although two days\u2019 time sample represents the overall behaviour of the labour force or a population, the data are not good enough for unit-level analysis. Seven-day time diaries allow unit-level analysis.

The developed countries usually employ self-reported 24-hour time diaries with a 10-minute time slot for collecting information on how people spend their time. Many of the developing and emerging countries need to work out their strategy for data collection carefully, because literacy levels could be low and in certain remote areas people may not use time pieces or watches to report their exact time use, which would make accurate data collection a difficult task. As discussed earlier, several methods of time-use data collection have been used for small surveys. In national surveys, however, the method options decline due to the large sample size. The participatory rapid appraisal method or the community-based method are not feasible. Instead, there are three methods available for large time-use surveys: (i) observation, (ii) stylized questions and (iii) the 24-hour time diary. 6.1 Observation In this method, a person is appointed to observe and accurately record another person\u2019s use of time. There are two types of approaches: With the participating observation method, a researcher, usually an anthropologist, observes and records time use and tries to understand this use of time by participating in the life of the respondents. With non-participating observation, a researcher observes and records use of time by the respondents, and there is no direct involvement of the person being observed. Practitioners regard the observation method as successful for local community empowerment and change. The main advantage is that the person whose activities are recorded does not have to read or write or have a Western concept of time. But there are several problems with this method: First, continuous observation tends to make respondents self-conscious and leads them to behave differently. Second, an investigator may find it difficult to observe the entire household; if an investigator must observe only one person, a full-time investigator will be needed for each respondent, which may be costly. In a large survey, this method will not be practical. A researcher can train local volunteers to assist and who are supervised by educated volunteers (Mulik and Werner, 2002) or who use a literate younger member of the household to help with observations (Waring, 2006). One alternative is to do random observations, for example, coming back every hour to see what the person is doing. This method allows one researcher to monitor more than one person in a day. But it gives an incomplete picture of activities and is not considered reliable (Sillitoe, 2006). Observation is the least used method. A review of challenges and future directions 41 6.2 Stylized questions Stylized questions are asked mainly in a modular time-use survey. In this approach, respondents report their time use by answering questions related to listed activities. These questions are about the time they spend on each of the activities during the reference day (usually the previous day), the reference week or even a month (as in the case of Nepal). This list can be short, with activities of specific interest, or a long list covering all activities. It is difficult to manage an exhaustive list and check that the total time adds up to 24 hours because respondents\u2019 replies tend to ignore total time. Also, when simultaneous activities are included, it becomes impossible to keep the total time to 24 hours. In practice, thus, a short or a slightly long list but not an exhaustive list is used. In all the modular surveys reviewed for this analysis, the list varied between nine and 90 activities. The limitations of this method were discussed previously (see Section 2.3). But because it is a less expensive and easy method, it is used by many developing and emerging countries. INSTRAW (1995, p. 89), however, rated this method as having low validity, reliability and flexibility, however. There are several versions of this method: (i) Activity log: The person whose activities are being studied is asked to write down on a questionnaire each time they do a particular activity. For example, during the next three days, each time the respondent prepares any food or gets or prepares", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c50b9136-b78f-4862-9e61-8555e7b66def": {"__data__": {"id_": "c50b9136-b78f-4862-9e61-8555e7b66def", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Time Use Surveys and Statistics in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "350fd3042672b2c0cd1b00ac896796453e31ea1b28bb069be96ea5a16fad2177"}}, "hash": "350fd3042672b2c0cd1b00ac896796453e31ea1b28bb069be96ea5a16fad2177", "text": "a drink, they are required to provide the following information: time started, time ended and purpose (morning meal, midday meal, etc.). This method assumes that the person is literate and that they have a watch or clock. It also assumes that the person is motivated enough to remember and write down each time they do the activity. It requires much attention from the respondent and thus has a high drop-out rate. There is no much ways for checking for answers\u2019 accuracy. (ii) Stylized activity list: This method would usually be part of a questionnaire or constitute a questionnaire on its own. It involves a question such as the following, with a block in which the person can write the number of hours and minutes for each activity: What does your actual day look like? How many hours per day do you usually spend on the following activities?28 Ideally, the question should be asked separately for weekdays and weekends because the activities and the time spent on them likely differs. Same as with the activity log, there is no way of checking for answers unless the researcher is certain that the activities listed cover every possible action. Another problem with this method is that as the activity list grows longer to include all possibilities, the fatigue level 28 For example, housework and related errands, child care, occupation (including travel to work and secondary work), training, education, handiwork, repairs in the home or with the car, garden work, television, video, hobbies and other free-time activities. 42 Time-use surveys and statistics in Asia and the Pacific of respondents and researchers grows. Such a list may prompt recall, but it is hard to get the balance right for every situation. INSTRAW (1995) rated this method the same as the activity log \u2013 low reliability, validity and flexibility. (iii) Time activity matrix: This method is similar to the stylized list in that it has an activity list, but it adds a list of time periods as well. \u201cIn the case of an INSTRAW29 study, they have listed the activities on the top (Y axis), and the column below (X axis) collects data on the time spent on the activities (INSTRAW, 1995).\u201d30 The periods could be 10 minutes for a detailed subdivision or one hour for a much cruder division. The person recording the activities marks off in each row which activity was carried out. There must be at least one activity for every time period. This method helps the respondent to remember what they were doing. By insisting on a least one activity for every time period, it produces a comprehensive record. It does not avoid the conceptual problem, whereby the respondent must be able to classify each of their activities according to the categories provided. It assumes that the person is able to remember all the activities undertaken and assigns them to a category. Both a good memory and good calculation skills are needed. These three versions do not deal with simultaneous activity at all. Use of context variables is also avoided. And as noted earlier, there are problems with accuracy and reliability of the data. 6.3 24-hour time diaries With this approach, a 24-hour time diary is designed for each respondent, who is expected to fill in fairly detailed information on how they spent their time during the previous 24 hours. In countries in which respondents are literate, the diaries are self- reported, with information provided in a 10-minute (or 5-minute) time slot. When literacy is inadequate, face-to-face interviews are organized, and the interviewer fills in a diary on how the person spent their previous 24 hours. Self-reported time diaries are completed in different ways: filled in the next day, at the end of the day (in the evening), continuously as activities are performed or frequently during the day of the diary. This latter approach is considered better than the others. Among the countries that conducted stand-alone time-use surveys, China and Thailand31 used self-reported diaries, while Mongolia and Pakistan used such a diary for the literate population and conducted face-to-face interviews for persons with low literacy. Indonesia used time diaries only with literate persons for self-reporting. 29 UN International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women. 30 Please see INSTRAW: Time-use surveys in developing countries (Santo Domingo, 1995). 31 In Thailand, the literacy level is high \u2013 at nearly 100 per cent, whereas in China, a pictorial diary was also used when respondents were not literate.

This method avoids many of the problems of the stylized questions. However, the role of the interviewers is critical because they have to get the right response. The design of the survey manual, intensive training of interviewers and strong follow-up are essential (Hirway, 2003). The interviewer must establish good rapport with respondents and get their replies without asking any leading question. The interviewer must collect the right data without any bias. Interviewers have to get the timing of the activities when the respondents do not wear a watch or use a clock. One important limitation of face-to-face recall diary is that it needs a larger time slot \u2013 a half hour or, in some cases, one hour. Bangladesh, India, Mongolia and Pakistan used a half hour (when conducting face-to-face interviews), while Indonesia used two to three hours. Larger time slots imply a smaller number of episode (an episode is an event or an activity carried out during a time slot) reporting (usually three episodes are reported) and fewer details of the time use. The time-use data therefore tend to be approximations rather than accurate estimates. In Pakistan, each half hour reflected three activities and the time recorded for each activity was 10 minutes.32 Also, by recording the time-use chronologically through a face-to-face interview, recall can be a problem because a respondent may not remember the exact time spent on different activities. It is desirable that a time diary is filled in only by the respondent (to get reliable information). If it is filled in by an interviewer, nobody else should be present to help the respondent (except in the case of children (older than a fixed age). This rule is frequently not followed. For example, the Pakistan time-use survey report in 2007 noted that time diaries were filled in with \u201cmutual help\u201d. 6.4 Light diary and full diary With the light diary approach, surveys provide a predetermined list of activities and ask the respondent to choose from them while filling in the diary (light diary). But some countries do not provide a list and instead ask respondents to describe their activities. Codes to these activities are assigned later on by the investigators (full diary). The full-diary approach appears to give better results because there is no pressure on the respondent to select an activity from a list. However, a full diary requires more work for coders and analysts and is costly. If the analysts and interviewers are trained to do this task, a full diary would be the better choice. 32 In the case of the time-use survey (2007) in Pakistan, the time slot was 30 minutes. The time spent on an activity was derived by dividing 30 minutes by the number of activities conducted during the 30 minutes. This was too simplistic an approach to collect data. 44 Time-use surveys and statistics in Asia and the Pacific Seven countries that conducted modular time-use surveys used activity lists ranging from nine to 90 activities. Among the six countries that used a 24-hour time diary, China, Mongolia and Thailand used self-reported time diaries. Pakistan used self-reported time diaries for urban people and a one-day recall diary for the remainder of respondents. The other countries used only one-day recall diaries filled in by interviewers. The time slot for self-reported diaries was 10 minutes, and 30 minutes for the others. 6.5 Recall for one day and one week Although one-day recall may be acceptable, recall for one week is not likely to be reliable. The countries that collected time-use data for the week prior to the survey tended to compromise on the quality of data. Collection of data by recording the use of time chronologically through a face-to-face interview also is not always satisfactory. Respondents may not remember the exact time spent on different activities. Again, intensive training for interviewers, a carefully designed instruction manual, supervision and strong follow-up are critical. 6.6 Methods for sampling days \u2013 Field operations It is important to link the sample design and the design of field operations. The methods for sampling days distinguish between time-use surveys that employ interviewers in the primary sampling units (PSUs) for the duration of the data collection period and other surveys. Time-use surveys using resident interviewers: The simplest situation in which the time-use survey is to be carried out relies on a resident in each PSU who can conduct interviews throughout a 12-month period. For example, if 56 households are sampled in a PSU and all household members are to report their time use for the same", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "38dcd4f7-8bc0-4d59-bd28-da35571ae77d": {"__data__": {"id_": "38dcd4f7-8bc0-4d59-bd28-da35571ae77d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Time Use Surveys and Statistics in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2f13d3fc7e61b865878bc28ab634c123f49cc32955d344a16c1116baa65183af"}}, "hash": "2f13d3fc7e61b865878bc28ab634c123f49cc32955d344a16c1116baa65183af", "text": "sampled day: Each day is to have an equal probability of selection (the sample design does not require a larger than proportionate sample of, for example, weekends). To achieve a good balance of the sample of days, the days can be stratified by day of the week and by quarter of the year. Thus, within each quarter, two Mondays, two Tuesdays etc. would be randomly sampled and then randomly allocated to the sampled households in the PSU. Further refinement of this stratification is possible. For instance, one of the 13 weeks in each quarter could be selected at random to be duplicated, thus creating 14 weeks. Then, the 14 weeks could be divided into two half quarters of seven weeks each, with each of the seven days of the week randomly allocated to one of the seven weeks in A review of challenges and future directions 45 the half quarter. Thus, each week of the year is represented once, with one week per quarter represented twice, and each day of the week represented in each half quarter. In general, schemes of this type can be fashioned to provide a sample of days of the week that are evenly spread across all the weeks of the year. By this means, a better representation of the time dimension is achieved than would occur with an uncontrolled random selection of sampled days. This approach can be extended to multiple days per sampled person. However, there are additional considerations relating to how the days for a sampled person should be distributed within the 12-month period. When time-use data are collected for several days by means of \u201cleave behind\u201d diaries, it is economical to have respondents complete their diary for consecutive days. For example, in a design in which 20 households are sampled in each enumeration area, the households might be divided into five groups with four households each. Household members in group A could then be asked to complete diaries for Friday and Saturday; those in group B could refer to Sunday and Monday; those in group C could refer to Tuesday and Wednesday; those in group D could use Thursday and Friday; and those in group E could focus on Saturday and Sunday. In this way, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays would be sampled twice as often as the other days. Time-use surveys using travelling interviewers: Conducting the survey using teams of travelling interviewers is a more difficult fieldwork set-up, whereby each team visits selected PSUs, listing the households in each and selecting a sample from the list. They carry out the interviews in the selected households and move on to the next PSU in their allotted set. In these circumstances, the sample of days in a PSU cannot be spread across the year. Many developing countries use this format because they depend on trained travelling interviewers. However, an annual spread can be obtained by collecting data for different periods from different PSUs. Various schemes that suit the fieldwork\u2019s operational constraints can be developed. The following describes some examples of general approaches. A time-use survey designed to collect data for a single day for each sample person: For simplicity sake, suppose that a team of interviewers collects data relating to seven consecutive days in each PSU, with a sample of 56 households per unit. With an even distribution of days of the week for the sample, time-use data would be collected for each day from the eligible persons in eight sample households, with a random allocation of days to households. The annual spread of the sample could then be achieved by assigning different PSUs to different weeks. This assignment needs to be carefully balanced across the sampled PSUs to avoid, for instance, PSUs of particular types (for example, PSUs in certain regions or rural PSUs) being represented only in certain parts of the year. As an illustration, the 52-week time period can be divided into 13 periods of four weeks, with the sampled PSUs systematically allocated to these periods and the PSUs for a given four-week period systematically allocated 46 Time-use surveys and statistics in Asia and the Pacific to the weeks. The systematic allocation from sorted lists of sampled PSUs provides a balance of the characteristics used in the ordering by month and week. This general approach can be applied when the survey is restricted to a shorter period of time. Collecting time-use data for multiple days for each sample person: This approach is generally difficult operationally when teams of travelling interviewers are used. It may be preferable to restrict the number of sampled days to one or two.

In short, designing a suitable approach for data collection, given the constraints of developing countries, is a major challenge. The developing countries in this review encountered several problems in generating good-quality time-use data. The time- diary approach \u2013 self-reported or recorded through interviewers \u2013 is definitely a better approach of data collection for time-use surveys. It engenders more reliable results, provides comprehensive information on time use and is amenable to the use of context variables and to simultaneous activities. Although its initial costs are high, the costs decline substantially after it is institutionalized. A review of challenges and future directions 47 Collecting data on simultaneous activities 7 48 Time-use surveys and statistics in Asia and the Pacific C ontext variables and simultaneous activities are critical components of a time diary because they provide additional information about activities. Information on simultaneous activities is particularly important, especially in developing countries where people who are poor and women perform more than one activity at a time. Data on simultaneous activities helps to improve the estimates of both paid and unpaid work. This is because it adds or does not miss the time spent on work that is part of any simultaneous activity. Simultaneous activities are likely to generate time stress when both (or all) the activities performed simultaneously involve (hard) work. For example, if a woman cooks and simultaneously attends to livestock, it could be strenuous. Such work can be useful in estimating time poverty. On the other hand, if a man watches TV and has his lunch along with it, it could be relaxing. It is therefore necessary to analyse and address simultaneous activities by the nature of the activities. This data are also useful when designing interventions for reducing time stress of people who are poor, particularly poor women. It is not easy to collect this data, however, because it requires special efforts (people do not provide this information easily). Respondents on their own do not always report their simultaneous activities, even when there is a column in the diary. A researcher must make effort in a face-to-face interview (the interviewer must ask the question specifically, and even repeat the question) as must respondents in self-reported time diaries (specific instructions on reporting simultaneous activities need to be given and checked while collecting time diaries). It is also not easy to analyse the data because good analytical tools are needed. Usually the activities performed simultaneously are divided into primary and secondary types, and total time spent on them is divided between the two types as per the weight allotted to each (the total time has to be 24 hours). When countries find this difficult, they divide the total time spent on simultaneous activities into two equal parts and allot one part to each activity, which is not accurate. A slightly complex approach would be to develop time grids for simultaneous activities and/or let the total time go beyond 24 hours (this approach has not received much attention in developing countries). This review of the national time-use surveys found that the modular surveys (even with a time diary) did not collect data on simultaneous activities. When stylized questions were asked, respondents found it difficult to report the data, and when time diaries were used, the results were not likely to be accurate or useful because the number of activities were limited. In the stand-alone surveys, all countries excluding Malaysia (Bangladesh, China, India, Mongolia, Pakistan and Thailand) collected data on simultaneous activities. Bangladesh and China, however, did not analyse the data. India divided the time into two equal parts without classifying the primary and A review of challenges and future directions 49 secondary activities; Pakistan did the same. Only Mongolia and Thailand divided the time by primary and secondary status. We concluded that eight of the 16 countries (50 per cent) collected data on simultaneous activities. But in half of those countries, the data were not utilized. In short, \u201csimultaneous activities\u201d is another weak point of the surveys conducted in the reviewed developing and emerging countries. Most of the countries have missed the advantages of collecting data on these activities (see Annex IV for details). 50 Time-use surveys and statistics in Asia and the Pacific Context variables 8 A review of challenges and future directions 51 U nlike mainstream statistics, time-use statistics provide comprehensive information on all human activity \u2013 they are not restricted to any one sector or any", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e90cb4ac-816f-4d86-8452-0f9863d5fa4e": {"__data__": {"id_": "e90cb4ac-816f-4d86-8452-0f9863d5fa4e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Time Use Surveys and Statistics in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ecda56ff23f6d9efd92c2ecd949f1b9e1ceb3fe0faf9b66d36b06c03671293a0"}, "3": {"node_id": "f05ea3da-3502-40cc-b7b4-b7fc42937a00", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f40e4ee5520c0f4913f615cf38482e15ab9d7afdecebe2440c6389489a238e7a"}}, "hash": "347d2003f815bbfa248417c7d67ce2191b310eb057ffb76ed1a2d9033c8c25c5", "text": "one type of activity. To analyse them meaningfully, it is important to see these activities in their proper context so that they are classified properly. For example, cooking could be an unpaid domestic service or a free voluntary service if done for the community, or it could be employment if done in a restaurant by a chef. Context variables are thus a unique feature of time-use surveys that provide physical, social, economic, cultural or temporal features of the environment in which the activity takes place. Context variables are included in time diaries with each activity to collect additional information and to help in the recall of the involved time. 8.1 Types of context variables Context variables can be broadly divided into the following types. \u2022 Location-based: \u201cwhere\u201d. \u2022 Persons present: \u201cwith whom\u201d and \u201cin the presence of whom\u201d. \u2022 Beneficiary of activity: \u201cfor whom\u201d. \u2022 Motivation of activity: \u201cpaid or unpaid\u201d. \u2022 Instrument used and mode of travel (means of transportation). Location (where): This variable provides information on where the activity was performed. Australia has divided location into two parts: physical location (own house, someone else\u2019s house, public area, work place, leisure place, educational institute, etc.) and spatial location (indoor, outdoor, in transit, waiting, etc.). With whom or in the presence of whom: This variable provides information on whether a person was alone, with spouse, with friends, family members, own children, colleagues, etc. Australia has used codes like spouse, family member, friend, neighbour, colleague, crowd and no one. Japan has used five variables or categories: alone, with family members, with colleagues, classmates and others. For whom: This variable provides information on the beneficiary of an activity. For example, if the activity was performed for own children, family members, friends, community, etc. This helps in understanding the social behaviour of respondents and distinguishing voluntary work. This variable also provides information on the motive for an activity \u2013 for self-consumption or consumption of one\u2019s household or for selling something. Australia has used such codes as own family, for other relatives, for other family, for friends and for community. Context variables for mode of transport: People travel by multiple means for many reasons. How they travel and how much time they take in travelling are important 52 Time-use surveys and statistics in Asia and the Pacific inputs for transportation and infrastructure planning. Additionally, people walk the required distances by foot or they use different types of private and public vehicles. Different guidebooks and guidelines have recommended three context variables, namely: where, with whom and for whom. In addition, the mode of transport is also recommended. In 2012 a UNSD Expert Group meeting proposed three context variables for consideration by countries, i.e. \u201cfor whom\u201d, \u201cpaid/unpaid\u201d and \u201clocation\u201d (UNSD, 2012). Most developed countries have used the context variables of where, with whom, for whom and mode of transportation. 8.2 Context variables for specific uses The use of context variables has expanded to several new areas recently, including policy-making. Context variables for work and employment: For the most accurate description of activities related to employment and other forms of work, contextual information is very important. It needs to relate to the motivation or ultimate purpose of the activity (whether for pay, profit or family gain), to the organization of the working time (whether it is overtime or not), for the details of workplace (for which institution or organization is the activity carried out) as well as the location of the work (done at home, at workplace, during the commute) for main and secondary jobs. Contextual information may also relate to characteristics that are part of status of employment (paid work, home- based work, self-employment work, unpaid work in family enterprise) and are useful to distinguish between the different forms of work, such as unpaid household services and voluntary services. To ensure that activities carried out as part of employment or some other form of work are captured, it is important that all time intervals be coded to both the type of activity done and to the variables that describe it.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f05ea3da-3502-40cc-b7b4-b7fc42937a00": {"__data__": {"id_": "f05ea3da-3502-40cc-b7b4-b7fc42937a00", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Time Use Surveys and Statistics in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ecda56ff23f6d9efd92c2ecd949f1b9e1ceb3fe0faf9b66d36b06c03671293a0"}, "2": {"node_id": "e90cb4ac-816f-4d86-8452-0f9863d5fa4e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "347d2003f815bbfa248417c7d67ce2191b310eb057ffb76ed1a2d9033c8c25c5"}}, "hash": "f40e4ee5520c0f4913f615cf38482e15ab9d7afdecebe2440c6389489a238e7a", "text": "These context variables may refer to (i) whom the activity is carried out for (institutional unit, household, market or non-market enterprises and others); and (ii) the ultimate purpose of the work activity (to generate income, for own final use, to acquire skills, to seek work and to serve or benefit others, including own community).

This is because many activities may be done in the context of employment or other form of work and yet be the same type as what is done in other contexts, such as leisure and personal activities. Activities related to produce goods, services, travelling, reading, writing, waiting on-call, preparing food, caring for older persons and household management may belong to different work categories. Even sleeping and eating may be work activities in some jobs. This overlap requires that the classification system to which activities are coded eliminates duplications between activity descriptions, using relevant contextual information. For example: \u2022 Whether the activity is for (i) own-consumption, (ii) for sale or (iii) for barter can help in distinguishing subsistence production or unpaid domestic services and SNA work. \u2022 Information regarding for whom an activity was done can explain whether it was performed for own household or own use, for other households \u2013 unpaid, for voluntary organization or community organization, or for sale. \u2022 The other codes could be linked to the institution or organization for which the work is done, such as for government, quasi government, for corporate unit, for private sector or for a household unit. \u2022 Information on where an activity took place can help in estimating home-based work, work of street vendors and work in workplaces. Context variables for social policy: Variables can provide information on the social life of people as well as inputs for social policy designing. \u2022 Information on with whom an activity was done helps in estimating time spent with spouse or family, which in turn helps in assessing marital life, the work\u2013life balance or the socialization of a person. Time spent alone can reveal loneliness of people, particularly older or sick persons. \u2022 Time spent with children or those who need care in the family helps in assessing passive care. \u2022 Time spent on other organizations or members can reflect networking, and this may be useful in estimating social capital formation. Context variables for environment-related policies: Time spent in the presence of someone, the persons present or the surroundings provide useful inputs for environment policies. \u2022 Time spent in a polluted environment can be used to estimate the adverse impact of pollution on human health with the help of dose-response coefficients. \u2022 Time spent can be related to energy use and carbon footprints and how much time 54 Time-use surveys and statistics in Asia and the Pacific that electricity is consumed by people or how long an electric connection is on in households. \u2022 Time spent in a healthy open environment or in sunlight may reflect consumption of vitamin D. Context variables and transportation planning: Time spent on travelling and mode of travel generate useful information on travelling or commuting patterns of a population. \u2022 Time spent on travelling by different modes of transport, time spent on waiting, time spent in traffic jams, etc. provide useful inputs about the transport-related problems of any population. This can be useful for planning for public transport \u2013 its routes, frequency, mitigation needs, etc. \u2022 Information on mode of transport may also reveal requirements for speedy and cheap transportation (for example, if people are walking long distances on foot). \u2022 Knowing if long hours are spent in accessing basic services, such as in reaching basic infrastructural facilities, in waiting or in meeting service providers, will help in understanding the access of the population to basic services and infrastructure. This data can be used in planning for infrastructure and policy-making for efficient basic service delivery. 8.3 Subjective context variables Context information can be divided into subjective and objective variables. Objective variables refer to the elements discussed in the previous section, and subjective variables refer to personal feelings and the perception of respondents towards a specific activity, such as: \u2022 Did you feel stressed performing this activity? How much? (codes) \u2022 Did you feel time stressed or exhausted while doing the activity? (codes) \u2022 How happy are you doing each activity? How much did you enjoy the activity? Michelson and Robinson (2010), and Harvey (2014) used these context variables to estimate time stress or happiness of population. These variables are also used in computing time poverty and happiness indices.

Cambodia, which used a time diary with its modular time-use survey used common context variables, but the responses were found with unreliable quality. In Nepal, questions were asked for each activity about the location of the activity (where?), whether any pay was received (paid or unpaid) and whether the respondent performed any other activity with the first activity. In addition, general questions were asked about wages received, reasons for not working and terms of work. In stand-alone time-use surveys, however, context variables help to estimate the time spent on activities accurately. Bangladesh (2012) used the two context variables of where and with whom. The former had several codes: at home, in a car, train, bus, etc; while the latter context variable had three codes: alone, with a household member and other known person. Pakistan (2007) used the two context variables of location 1 and location 2. Location 1 had nine codes: at home, at somebody\u2019s home, field, farm or other agriculture workplace, educational establishment, public area, travelling, waiting or other. Location 2 had eight codes: inside, outside, travelling by foot, taxi, train, bicycle, any other public transport or other means of transport. China (2008) used two context variables: with whom and mode of transport. India (1998\u201399) also used two context variables: paid or unpaid and inside or outside home. Thailand used four context variables: paid or unpaid, for whom, where and with whom. In addition, the Thailand schedule asked specific questions on (i) the opinion of respondents about their time-use changes between the previous and present time- use survey, (ii) wages that should be paid for housekeeping and related activities of housekeeping and (iii) prevailing wages. It appears that context variables were used only by about half of the reviewed countries. However, these variables were not always selected based on the objectives of the survey. In short, the choice of context variables that should be used for a time-use survey essentially depends on the objectives of the survey. For example, if an important objective is to estimate and understand work and employment, context variables and additional codes can be designed to get information on the nature and characteristics of work. But the countries reviewed for this study have not gone beyond the common patterns of context variables to tap the full potential of possibilities that can enrich time- use information. This has been a missed opportunity. 56 Time-use surveys and statistics in Asia and the Pacific Quality considerations of time-use surveys in Asia and the Pacific 9 A review of challenges and future directions 57 9.1 Response rate in time-use surveys The data on the response rates were available only for some countries (see Annex III). This is partly because the response rates were not calculated and partly because the rates were not reported in the documents, papers and material that were reviewed. In developed countries, the response rate was 60\u201370 per cent in Australia, 75\u201380 per cent in Japan, 72 per cent in New Zealand and 98 per cent in the Republic of Korea (substitution was allowed, thus resulting in a high response rate). Of the 13 developing and emerging countries that conducted a national time-use survey, nine did not report the response rate. Of the rest, Mongolia had 80\u201383 per cent, Cook Islands had 98 per cent, while India and Pakistan each had 99 per cent. It seems that developed countries have a relatively low response rate. One main reason for the high response in developing countries appears to be the use of face-to-face interviews. Interviewers were usually allowed to substitute one person for another when the first person was not available. In the case of self-reported time diaries, respondents tended to avoid recording their use of time or only half-heartedly recorded. The low and declining response rate is a concern with time-use surveys in developed countries, thus indicating the interview method has at least one advantage over the self-reported diary method. 9.2 Issues related to terminology There are several problems related to the survey-related concepts and definitions used by countries. For instance, it is now globally accepted that SNA and non-SNA are both \u201ceconomic activities\u201d33 because they are economic production. However, in almost all of the time-use surveys reviewed, this distinction was not maintained. Non-SNA activities were referred to as \u201cnon-economic\u201d activities. Similarly, personal activities were called \u201cnon-productive\u201d activities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae1c7e35-5cea-4086-a2ac-c665f092e3c3": {"__data__": {"id_": "ae1c7e35-5cea-4086-a2ac-c665f092e3c3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Time Use Surveys and Statistics in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8c5587c54fd1af328607e123be0837e9017fa5d0b43ae71621e586c9d351c0bf"}, "2": {"node_id": "254e8263-0313-48e0-bd5e-7be09e42bb26", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8de7180adaae48549ff984b05c397eca469ed64f42588ee1c729f19f26d2b2af"}}, "hash": "4086db8bf0173e67aff2ca56952d98bbc88b65a184d3080207f5e5338cf37992", "text": "Similarly, personal activities were called \u201cnon-productive\u201d activities.

In most of the reviewed countries, no specific definition of a household was given, which implies that they accepted the established definition. In some countries, however, the term was defined as \u201cavailable members in the household\u201d, or it also included \u201cfull-time hired help and guests staying for more than a month\u201d. The concept of household in 33 Please refer to UN, 2008 for information on the SNA. 58 Time-use surveys and statistics in Asia and the Pacific Pakistan (for the purpose of the time-use survey) included \u201call those persons who normally live with the sampled household and present at the time of investigation\u201d; it included all boarders, domestic help, friends, relatives and non-relatives who were living with the household. Friends, guests, visitors, etc. who were living at least four nights a week over a period of the previous 30 days were considered part of the household. Similarly, Malaysia defined household as only those persons who were at home when the investigators visited. This variety of definitions creates problems of cross-country comparability of time-use data. Several countries did not use the concepts of SNA and non-SNA correctly, which frequently meant the classifications of activities did not provide clear results. For example, production of goods for own use was treated as non-SNA work, care of children was grouped with food processing, and horticulture was treated as household work. 9.3 Other quality issues in time-use statistics There are serious quality problems with the time-use surveys collected through 24-hour time diaries, particularly where face-to-face interviews were used to fill in the diaries. As discussed earlier, modular time-use surveys, with all their advantages, are not equipped to produce quality data. These surveys have several methodological limitations that prevent the generation of high-quality data. Additionally, almost none of the diary-based surveys had a background questionnaire adequate enough to address the objectives. Consequently, the data were not good enough to provide reliable estimates of the labour force by industry, occupation and employment status classification. Most of the background questionnaires did not generate enough data for studying the care economy or for valuing unpaid work in satellite accounts. Although systematic sampling techniques were used, the selection of household members and the diary days per person were not always selected well. Also, there were problems with the time sample (reference period) because not all the surveys collected data for seasonal variations in time use. The use of a 24-hour time diary in areas with low literacy and poor use of time pieces is definitely a positive development. This has helped in the expansion of time-use surveys in developing countries. However, countries did not implement the approach well: (i) The interviewer-centric data-collection method requires a detailed instruction manual, intensive training of investigators and strong follow-up, which were frequently not there; (ii) Initial visits to respondent households to ensure rapport were cut short frequently; (iii) A review of challenges and future directions 59 The long duration of time slots along with dividing the total time in smaller periods to get activity time were not sound methods. In short, most countries failed to tap the potential of simultaneous activities and context variables. The data on simultaneous activities was either not collected or not used. Those countries using this data divided the time by the number of activities rather than estimating primary and secondary activities. Context variables have huge potential to enrich time-use data. Yet, countries in Asia and the Pacific, which have largely followed the example of developed countries, do not seem to be aware of this potential. The classification of activities, mostly adapted from the available classification systems, are not always adequate to meet country-specific objectives. The SNA classification was a major limitation. The absence of an international and harmonized classification at the time when countries were running those surveys, was of course a major reason for this. 60 Time-use surveys and statistics in Asia and the Pacific Time-use activity classifications 10 A review of challenges and future directions 61 T he classification of activities is an important component of time-use surveys because it organizes the information in a systematic manner. Along with context variables, it generates rich information on how people use their time on different activities. Good time-use activity classification reflects certain norms: The classification should be comprehensive and inclusive of all activities performed by men and women. It should be hierarchical, echoing the different levels of activities in different digits (for example, the first digit represents the major group, the second digit represents the subgroup and so on).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a687cb98-4060-40d3-96b1-0a478d00556f": {"__data__": {"id_": "a687cb98-4060-40d3-96b1-0a478d00556f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Time Use Surveys and Statistics in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f241b4067cef6410b7c24081d2d3a98d6a4dad1f50b4823b454e27ac2b3e14e"}, "3": {"node_id": "f22eb7aa-ccc3-4832-9fbf-5f20e69a04bd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1118381807c66c6451a498784f809948707cfaddba25f55f81afc89e20916385"}}, "hash": "6980acd0fa58d4dd314e4061a46597576ed2c7bff9abd174c83a356f046f3619", "text": "It should be compatible with other relevant classifications (in this case, with established time-use classifications) to maintain comparability of data.

One widely popular classification divides time-use activities into four broad categories: contracted time, necessary time, committed time and free time.34 These four categories are then divided into (i) personal care activities, (ii) employment-related activities, (iii) education activities, (iv) domestic activities, (v) child care activities, (vi) purchasing goods and services, (vii) voluntary work and care activities, (viii) social and community interaction and (ix) recreation and leisure. These groups are again divided into subgroups and into activities. The classifications developed by Australia, Canada and Eurostat as well as several European countries and the United States have many similarities, and the data are comparable across countries. The harmonized time-use project of Eurostat has established a time-use classification that is intended to serve as a standard for the region. Most developed countries, except Japan, seem to be using this with minor changes.35 34 In 1978, Dagfinn Aas developed a classification that was widely used by several countries from the 1970s to the 1990s. According to this framework, time spent by human beings is basically of four types: necessary time (time spent on activities for survival), contracted time (time that human beings spend to fulfil the contracts that they have made), committed time (time committed to fulfil social responsibilities) and free time (the residual time left after performing contracted, committed and necessary time). 35 See Harmonized European time-use surveys 2008, http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/nomenclatures/index. cfm?TargetUrl=LST_NOM_DTL&StrNom=TIMEUSE_08&StrLanguageCode=EN&IntPcKey=&StrLayoutCode=HIERARCHIC [accessed 12 January 2018].

Looking into the specific needs of developing countries, UNSD set up an expert group meeting in 1997 to develop a global time-use activity classification. It had ten major groups, followed by two-digit subgroups and then three-digit activity lists. The expert group meeting in 2000 and then 2012 presented two new classifications. None of these, however, were found satisfactory. The United Nations finalized a revised version of ICATUS in 2016, characterized as \u201ca three-level hierarchical classification (composed of major divisions, divisions and groups) of all possible activities undertaken by the general population during the 24 hours in a day.\u201d ICATUS 2016 was adopted by the UN Statistical Commission in its forty-eighth session (March 2017). ICATUS 2016 has 165 groups classified into 56 divisions and nine major divisions and is aligned with the forms of work as defined in the 19th ICLS Resolution on Statistics of Work, Employment and Labour Under Utilization (previous versions had no distinction between production of goods for the market or for own final use).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f22eb7aa-ccc3-4832-9fbf-5f20e69a04bd": {"__data__": {"id_": "f22eb7aa-ccc3-4832-9fbf-5f20e69a04bd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Time Use Surveys and Statistics in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f241b4067cef6410b7c24081d2d3a98d6a4dad1f50b4823b454e27ac2b3e14e"}, "2": {"node_id": "a687cb98-4060-40d3-96b1-0a478d00556f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6980acd0fa58d4dd314e4061a46597576ed2c7bff9abd174c83a356f046f3619"}}, "hash": "1118381807c66c6451a498784f809948707cfaddba25f55f81afc89e20916385", "text": "10.3 Major groups of ICATUS 2016 ICATUS 2016 was designed to be consistent with international statistical standards and classifications, such as the definition of productive status of activities in the SNA 2008, the 19th ICLS resolution (with its five primary forms of work) and the definitions and categories of activities in line with the fourth revision of the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities. It is also meant to be comparable with activities defined in previous ICATUS versions and in major national classifications of time-use activities. Time-use activities under ICATUS 2016 are grouped into nine major divisions: The first five cover different productive activities and forms of work and the remaining four cover personal activities (table 2). 36 See United Nations (2017), https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic-social/time-use/icatus-2016/ .

In the modular surveys reviewed for this study, the classifications used were developed largely by government experts.

Cambodia had a list of 22 activities. The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic also developed a list of 22 activities that included a detailed list of SNA activities. Cook Islands focused on non-market SNA activities. The activity classification in Cook Islands had 14 categories of work, of which four were SNA (along with a long list of non-market SNA activities), two non-SNA activities (15 activities) and eight personal activities. Nepal had a large list of non-market activities focused on unpaid SNA activities; in all, there were 114 questions asked of each household or respondent. In stand-alone national time-use surveys, the most used classification was ICATUS 1997. The Bangladesh survey in 2012 used the ICATUS developed in 2000 and divided time-use activities into 15 major categories: There were four major groups for SNA activities, three groups for domestic and voluntary services and care, and seven groups for personal activities. India, China, Mongolia, Pakistan and Thailand used modified versions of ICATUS 1997. China developed nine major groups that Division Activities 1 Employment and related activities 2 Production of goods for own final use 3 Unpaid domestic services for household and family members 4 Unpaid caregiving services for household and family members 5 Unpaid volunteer, trainee and other unpaid work 6 Learning 7 Socializing and communication, community participation and religious practice 8 Culture, leisure, mass media and sports practices 9 Self-care and maintenance. Table 2 Major divisions and activities of ICATUS 2016 64 Time-use surveys and statistics in Asia and the Pacific included four SNA groups, two non-SNA groups and three personal activities. It called the first group formal employment.37 China also used occupation groups for SNA activities, and the National Bureau of Statistics of China developed its own time-use activity classification in 2008. It has four main activity groups: SNA productive activities; non-SNA productive activities; study, training, meals, watching TV, sleeping and other personal activities; and other free-time activities. Thailand used two sets of classifications (ICATUS 1997 and the classification used by Eurostat) to arrive at (i) necessary time, committed time and contracted time, along with the major groups of classification used in developed countries and (ii) the nine groups of ICATUS 1997. Mongolia used ICATUS 1997 as well as an economic classification of 21 activities developed by its NSO. The Pakistan time-use survey (2007) used the ten ICATUS 1997 major groups with 122 three-digit activities. Each of these countries divided activities into two-digit and three-digit classifications. Although the two-digit classification was per ICATUS, there were cross-country variations in the three-digit activities. India observed that one major problem with ICATUS 1997 related to the first three groups. The first group was expected to capture \u201cformal work\u201d (in establishments), while the second and third groups were expected to capture \u201cinformal work\u201d in the primary and non-primary sectors. However, the term \u201cestablishment\u201d was vague and did not reflect formality because establishments can be both formal and informal. The first three groups therefore could not describe formality or informality of activities. The Indian NSO thus changed the SNA groups to (i) primary production activities, (ii) secondary production activities (industry and construction) and (iii) territory economic activities (trade, business and services). In short, countries covered by this review used various types of classifications, many of which may not be comparable with ICATUS 2016 (or even with previous versions). ICATUS 2016 should not only improve the collection and production of time-use statistics but also boost comparability of the statistics among countries and over time. Finally, countries that still need to develop a relevant national classification of time- use activities, such classification should be comparable with ICATUS 2016. Countries will also need to base such classification on the following points: (i) The classification should meet the objectives of the time-use survey; (ii) It should be comparable with the established classifications as far as possible; (iii) It should be simple and easy to understand; (iv) And it should have the right context variables. 37 Clearly this group could not reflect the formal sector.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f10973d-f32b-4613-803e-1ad636bd8b22": {"__data__": {"id_": "4f10973d-f32b-4613-803e-1ad636bd8b22", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Time Use Surveys and Statistics in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "846295eedd2eaeb2fe030c4b54d6064364fe18eb11257afdb35aabd6b7c18ac4"}, "2": {"node_id": "9c851b7e-8315-46f2-94b3-47771ac73fa2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-use-surveys-and-statistics-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d47fd20f08d08d26179573dde4709eecc3488ce9da27c8176811f68c72bfa38a"}}, "hash": "6680cc102ef378bb1841f66c3369b16514d76e67ed4308290e4af6031ede54cd", "text": "37 Clearly this group could not reflect the formal sector.

The main categories of work are conceptualized as (i) own-use production work, such as activities to produce goods and services mainly for own final use by household, (ii) employment work, such as activities to produce goods and services for pay or profit, (iii) unpaid trainee work, such as activities to produce goods and services for others performed without pay to acquire work experience or skills, (iv) voluntary work, such as non-compulsory activities performed without pay to produce goods and services for others and (v) other work activities, such as compulsory activities performed without pay to produce goods and services for others. The 19th ICLS resolution re-emphasizes the importance of time-use surveys for measuring all forms of work, including unpaid work in households: \u201cTime-use surveys, in particular, are a main source of statistics on participation and time spent in own- use production work and volunteer work for purposes of individual, household and macroeconomic level analyses.\u201d38 It is clear that time-use surveys will provide a critical input into translating the resolution into practice. The data collected through the Labour Force Survey and other data-collection systems on labour and employment are not sufficient for this purpose. Equally so, the available time-use data are not yet adequate to translate the resolution into practice. Major changes will be needed in the objectives of time-use surveys, activity classification (at the national level) and use of context variables, the background questionnaire and methodological rigour to produce good-quality data. The ongoing ILO methodological work to implement the 19th ICLS resolution will contribute greatly towards improving time-use statistics while reinforcing the need to collect information on all forms of work. Countries will need to re-engineer their data-collection system to include appropriate modules or stand-alone surveys for the exhaustive gathering of time-use statistics, 38 See paragraph 67.b, 19th ICLS Resolution; see also reference to ICATUS in paragraph 94. A review of challenges and future directions 67 even if it at a less regular periodicity than with the Labour Force Survey or related surveys. 11.2 Positive achievements that need to be reinforced This review found several achievements within the Asia-Pacific region. First, there is rapidly growing awareness of the need to collect time-use data to estimate paid and unpaid work of men and women in the economy, to measure and address prevailing gender inequalities and to value the unpaid non-SNA work in money terms. Time-use surveys, which began as small-scale surveys in several countries in the 1970s and 1980s, are increasingly graduating into large and national surveys. Second, given the constraints arising from the specific problems in conducting their time-use surveys (such as poor literacy levels, limited use of time pieces in some remote areas and lack of funds), countries have still been able to complete the survey. These countries have used a kind of learning-by-doing approach. And finally, despite the different quality of time-use data generated, concrete data have emerged in a large number of countries on the use of time that not only gives visibility to non-SNA and personal activities but also sheds more and useful light on the SNA activities. Clearly, a new understanding has emerged on the contribution of women to national economies and the nature and extent of gender inequalities prevailing in these economies. Despite these positive developments, these countries have a long way to go to reach the goal of mainstreaming time-use surveys within their national statistical system. If one excludes the four developed countries, seven of the remaining 31 countries reviewed have not conducted any time-use survey to date, and 11 countries have only conducted small-scale surveys (mainly by private researchers) or small pilot surveys. The Pacific islands region is lagging the most.

Other constraints relate to the low level of literacy and poor use of time pieces in rural remote areas, perceived as precluding people from completing a 24-hour time diary. These constraints have led many countries in the region to opt for modular time-use surveys, which are easier to conduct, are much less expensive and convenient to mainstream. Several international agencies and donor agencies have sponsored and financed these modular surveys, perhaps because they think that countries are not yet ready for a 24-hour self-reported time-diary approach and that some time-use data are better than no time-use data. Or maybe these agencies are interested in covering a large number of countries with their limited funds. In addition to the above support, international organizations and donor agencies may also envisage preparing these countries by providing capacity building in conducting stand-alone diary-based time-use surveys. 11.3 Standardization and harmonization To ensure the sound quality of time-use statistics, it is important to standardize the different components of the survey process as well harmonizing these concepts at the regional level (at least to start with) for facilitating cross-country comparability of data. Some broad details of the framework and formats of time-use surveys at the global level may help in developing details at the regional and national levels. The newly adopted classification of time-use statistics (ICATUS 2016) will certainly contribute to boosting such harmonization. Countries running time-use surveys are encouraged to use this classification or to ensure that their national classification can be linked to ICATUS 2016 at one of the higher levels. 11.4 Capacity building of stakeholders Capacity building of data producers and data users (within the government as well as researchers) will not only help to produce (improve) time-use data but it will also encourage use of the data. Capacity building thus should be targeted for both NSO staff, staff of other government departments (such as the women-related ministry, the labour ministry, the agriculture and industry ministries, the ministry for social policy and human development) and researchers and activists. Ministry officers and other policy-makers concerned with time-use statistics should be targeted by any capacity-building programme. The lack of policy push from these A review of challenges and future directions 69 institutions is one of the major hindrances to the regular and expanded collection of time-use statistics. 11.5 Mainstreaming time-use surveys There are strong reasons to mainstream time-use surveys within national statistical paradigms in all countries in the Asia-Pacific region. This mainstreaming implies that (i) time-use surveys are conducted regularly and periodically (at least every five years) to provide meaningful time series data, (ii) these surveys use sound concepts, methods, classifications, and produce quality data and (iii) the data are used in a broader range of policy-making to maximize their potential. 70 Time-use surveys and statistics in Asia and the Pacific Bittman, M. 2008. \u201cMethodological issues in conducting time use survey at the global level and emerging lessons\u201d, in Ministry of Women and Child Development: Mainstreaming time use surveys in national statistical system in India (New Delhi, Government of India), pp. 247-267.

statistics are critical for measuring and analysing the quality of life and general well-being. They also offer a more comprehensive measurement of all forms of work, including unpaid work and non-market production. Time-use statistics provide reliable data for evidence-based policy advocacy, contributing to policy dialogues and measures towards gender equality. They can also be used for the development of household production accounts, etc. Despite their immense utility, time-use statistics are not yet widely produced nor are time-use surveys integrated into national statistical systems. The data collection methods and tools are not well understood and used, and fewer countries do implement time-use surveys as compared to other household-based surveys. This review of time-use statistics in Asia and the Pacific highlights achievements that need to be reinforced and methodological issues that need to be overcome for the wider collection and dissemination of such vital data. The review also looks at the capacity of practitioners and policy-makers in the collection and dissemination of time-use statistics. The priority challenge remains the harmonizing and better grasp of data-collection tools. The review\u2019s conclusion stresses the need for greater awareness among policy- makers and the statistical community on the importance of time-use statistics, particularly for the better monitoring of progress towards achievement of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a119308a-bcc4-4cb5-9004-0e53c3584a37": {"__data__": {"id_": "a119308a-bcc4-4cb5-9004-0e53c3584a37", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Managing mining for sustainable development - A Sourcebook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "540bf841ef575932de20258b01218b0ee3d41b08994259fc5771f4ecdaaeed98"}, "3": {"node_id": "a441714c-4677-4d7f-9596-b9cff78bd67d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ecb0135e5420d8aab3cd9d298c039352215b03b98bb908d69e5b2302b17cfaef"}}, "hash": "4069c25295cbb857a2066ee7bed66255085f060a680237fd6d2d65e68c664da6", "text": "A SOURCEBOOK Managing mining for sustainable development UNDP Bangkok Regional Hub and Poverty-Environment Initiative Asia-Pacific of UNDP and UN Environment April 2018 A SOURCEBOOK Managing mining for sustainable development UNDP Bangkok Regional Hub and Poverty-Environment Initiative Asia-Pacific of UNDP and UN Environment April 2018 UNDP partners with people at all levels of society to help build nations that can withstand crisis, and drive and sustain the kind of growth that improves the quality of life for everyone.

Acknowledgements 3 Minerals and metals are essential materials for the functioning of modern societies and economies. Mining provides great economic opportunities for resource-rich countries. However, the process of mining creates challenges and risks for the well-being of people and the environment. A key challenge for these countries is to manage mining in a way that contributes to \u2013 and does not jeopardize \u2013 sustainable development. The management of mining at all stages, from exploration to mine closure requires serious consideration of social and environmental impacts. The legal and contractual frameworks that govern mining are often made with little consideration of environmental sustainability and the well- being of affected communities. The rights of local communities and indigenous people to have a say in decisions about mining projects are often not realized. Most countries have adopted rules on environmental and social impact assessment and mine closure, but the implementation of these rules is lagging behind.

This sourcebook brings together existing knowledge, experiences and tools to help equip governments and communities in resource- rich countries and regions to manage mining in a way that is consistent with their aspirations for sustainable development. The premise of this sourcebook is that it is within the power of governments of resource-rich countries to protect people and the environment and to realize the benefits from mining, working alongside the mining industry and local communities. Much of the available knowledge on social and environmental sustainability concerns related to mining is produced by and for the mining industry, while most available knowledge products for governments are focused on the economic governance of mining.

Mining activities can also contribute to sustainable development, particularly to its economic dimension.

Thus, mining has both positive and negative implications for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with particularly strong impacts on 11 of the 17 the SDGs (Figure ES1).A Efforts to mitigate environmental impacts, protect human rights, promote social inclusion and enhance benefits from mining for development should be taken throughout the life of a mine and the whole value chain of mining.

This may not be consistent with the public interest. Instead of a contract-based regime, a law-based regime is preferable, because it is more transparent, is applicable equally to all investors, and creates less burden for the government in administering, monitoring and enforcing. Contracts with mining investors can also limit the policy space for adopting more progressive laws and regulations that mitigate the negative environmental and social impacts and enhance the fiscal and economic benefits from mining to host countries. If contracts need to be used, then countries should limit contract terms that are open to negotiation, consider the adoption of model mining agreements, and ensure public disclosure of mining contracts. The normative framework of mining is also shaped by international law, including international investment treaties, human rights laws and standards, and environmental conventions and treaties. Bilateral investment treaties, while important for attracting investment into host countries by protecting investors, have resulted, in some cases, in situations where investors\u2019 rights may be protected at the expense of the public interest and human rights in the host country. Thus, countries such as Ecuador, India and Indonesia have started assessing, revising and renegotiating or cancelling investment treaties they are party to.

These elements of the legal, regulatory and normative framework are often inconsistent with each other and have critical gaps, particularly in areas that are essential for the protection of the human rights and livelihoods of people affected by mining. Addressing these gaps and inconsistencies is essential to improve the environmental and social outcomes of mining activities and to protect the human rights of those affected by mining. Coordination within the government is necessary to ensure that the legal, regulatory and normative framework is implemented in a coherent manner and in ways that are consistent with promoting environmental sustainability and sustainable social and economic development. The domestic legal framework in mining, which consists of constitutions, laws, policies and regulations, needs to be coherent with international laws and norms, as well as customary rules practised in the country. Mining contracts, usually entered with large investors, constitute another key element of the normative framework of mining in many resource- rich countries. However, developing countries with EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 13 in shaping the domestic legal framework and the environmental regulation of the mining industry. These include conventions and treaties on mineral waste, water quality, nature preservation, biodiversity, air pollution and climate change. Voluntary standards and codes adopted by the mining industry on environmental and social performance may exert a strong influence on the actions of mining companies and in this regard also constitute part of the normative framework. A major report commissioned by the mining industry in 2002, \u201cMining, minerals and sustainable development\u201d (MMSD), critically examined the industry\u2019s performance related to the environmental and social impacts, human rights, local development and fiscal contributions of mining. The report gave rise to many initiatives promoting responsible mining, including standards on environmental and social performance. Governments can make use of voluntary standards by the mining industry to strengthen domestic standards. Customary rules form another important element of the normative framework relevant for mining. Customary land tenure systems, regulated through customary rules, are prevalent in many developing countries and indigenous territories. However, customary tenure systems are often not recognized by the law or are insecure. The insecurity of land rights defined by customary rules comes to the fore when mineral resources are discovered and mining development starts in these areas. As a result, people can be displaced, dispossessed and impoverished. Safeguarding the rights of indigenous peoples and other peoples over communal lands \u2013 such as forests and pastures \u2013 is important not only for protection of human rights; it is increasingly recognized as important for the sustainable management of these lands. The Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure have been endorsed by the Committee on World Food Security. They provide guidelines for governments on strengthening land tenure systems, including recognition and protection of the legitimate tenure rights of people and communities with customary tenure systems. This sourcebook makes recommendations to governments based on the experiences of countries, and on international normative instruments and standards. RECOMMENDATIONS Orienting legal frameworks towards sustainable development Making domestic laws and regulations coherent with each other and sufficiently detailed to function as the core set of instruments for governing mining Improving coordination between government agencies and between national and subnational governments Considering moving from contract-based regimes to law-based regimes, avoiding using mining contracts to fill legal and regulatory gaps Considering establishing model agreements which provide the policy space for environmental and social laws of the country, and limiting terms that are open to negotiations Where mining contracts are made, paying special attention to provisions related to environmental impact mitigation, mine closure, resettlement, local content and employment Ensuring transparency of mining contracts, including disclosure of beneficial ownership Recognizing and progressively registering customary land rights to protect poor and marginalized rural communities and indigenous peoples. Assessing implications of international investment treaties on the country\u2019s commitments to sustainable development, human rights and the domestic policy space; negotiating terms in investment treaties to minimize these negative implications Incorporating or strengthening the principles of consultation with local communities and free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) in domestic laws and regulations; and establishing or strengthening state remedy mechanisms for people affected by mining Making use of voluntary standards developed by and for the mining industry, encouraging responsible mining investments and recognizing companies that adhere to strong standards MANAGING MINING FOR SUSTAINABLE", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01e5cd46-821c-4be0-b315-de0a99ff7005": {"__data__": {"id_": "01e5cd46-821c-4be0-b315-de0a99ff7005", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Managing mining for sustainable development - A Sourcebook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "05c0103a5396de5986abdfb5685911a6c01e242baf42a6098dafc76e9b36af78"}}, "hash": "05c0103a5396de5986abdfb5685911a6c01e242baf42a6098dafc76e9b36af78", "text": "DEVELOPMENT 14 Protecting the environment and people family of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) (Figure ES3), which by now have become embedded in legal frameworks of most countries. Mining project proponents are required to conduct EIAs and prepare Environmental Management Plans (EMPs). Governments can also conduct cumulative and strategic impact assessments in regions and countries with extensive mining activity to formulate regional or national mining plans and policies. In recent years, governments and mining companies have increasingly recognized the social impacts of mining and are enabling communities affected by mining to have a say in mining-related decisions and processes. More countries are adopting laws and regulations that require mining companies to consult with local communities to be affected by mining. The entry point for local community consultation is often done through the EIA process. In Asia, for example, India, Mongolia and the Philippines have adopted requirements for community consultation during the EIA process. Community engagement is much broader than just the EIA process and should take place throughout the life of a mine. However, it is most effective during specific points \u2013 when mining company has not yet made significant investments and not secured the required permits. The principle of consulting with people in making decisions that affect their lives is expressed in the principle of free, prior and informed consent (FPIC), which is applicable to the rights of indigenous peoples in international law. FPIC is also applicable to other \u2018land-connected peoples\u2019, such as traditional and local communities living in rural areas near mining sites. The acceptance of the right of indigenous peoples to free, prior and informed consent has grown significantly in the 2000s in the international business community \u2013 including the mining industry. Community consultation and engagement helps to balance economic development considerations with social and environmental considerations, leading to decisions that are more sustainable and viable politically and socially. Developing country governments have been slower in accepting community consultation and engagement principles; nevertheless, community consultation is now increasingly adopted as a rule in laws and regulations \u2013 particularly in environmental ones. Over the past decades, the \u2018polluter pays\u2019 principle has become firmly embedded in the policy paradigm and environmental regulation has become more stringent around the world. While there are tensions between the objectives of attracting investment into mining and protecting the environment, evidence shows that it is possible to have both strong environmental regulation and a favourable investment environment in mining. Traditionally, governments have used prescriptive approaches to environmental regulation (also called technology standards), which specify concrete technologies to be used for the mitigation of pollution. Non-traditional approaches to regulation, such as performance-based regulation which specifies targets for environmental performance and economic instruments, have become more widespread in recent years. Under certain conditions, these non-traditional forms of regulation \u2013 performance standards and economic instruments \u2013 can incentivize companies to devise or make use of more innovative solutions and cleaner technologies in a more cost-effective manner. These approaches can be conducive to improving the competitiveness of their mining industries while at the same time upholding strong environmental standards. The main set of tools for mitigation and prevention of environmental and social impacts is the In this section: Trends and approaches in environmental regulation of mining Environmental and social impact assessment Environmental monitoring and auditing Community consultation, engagement and protection Managing mine closure EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 15 In 2011, the UN adopted its Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which provided a framework for protecting and respecting human rights and remedying rights violations and infringements. Leading mining companies, through the industry body, the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), were closely involved in the consultations which led to the development of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights; the ICMM \u201cfully supports\u201d the Guiding Principles. The framework rests on three pillars \u2013 protect, respect and remedy (Figure ES4). Governments have fundamental duties to protect people in their jurisdictions from human rights abuses by businesses. Businesses have a duty to respect human rights \u2013 not only complying with the applicable laws, but also respecting internationally recognized human rights. Governments also have the duty to provide remedies to people whose rights and lives are affected by mining by having strong judicial mechanisms, as well as instituting non-judicial grievance mechanisms, such as national human rights commissions and ombudspersons. The \u201cProtest, Respect and Remedy\u201d framework had become widely accepted and can be applied within the domestic legal framework. A special set of challenges arises during mine closures.

Moreover, weak environmental regulation results in mine abandonment, which can have extensive environmental legacies and large costs for governments. Countries with a long history of mining, such as Australia, Canada and South Africa, have started documenting the huge environmental impacts of abandoned and orphaned mines and taking action to clean them up, incurring large public costs. To reduce the risk of mine abandonment, governments should have in place effective regulations. They also require environmental financial assurance (EFA) from mining companies, a deposit payment before commencing mining operations which would be used for mine reclamation and rehabilitation should the company default on its obligations. Mine reclamation and rehabilitation are the key stages of mine closure. While governments and communities expect mine sites to be restored to their original state, these expectations usually cannot be achieved on a sustained basis or in a cost-effective manner. Alternative, and perhaps more realistic, objectives of mine closure can include establishing stable landforms with functioning ecosystems and at least some of the native biota, or bringing the site to a point where it can be used for alternative uses and establishing non-native biota and ecosystems. Such realistic expectations about land use after mine closure should be communicated to affected communities before a mining project starts. The predominant concern in mine closure has traditionally been with environmental aspects of mining. Since mining often takes place in peripheral, less developed regions and locations, the socio- economic impact of mine closure can heavily impact local communities. Therefore, mining companies and governments need to see, plan and manage mine closure in a more holistic way, which not only addresses the environmental impacts, but also socio-economic issues, such as re-employment of mine workers and the development of alternative economic activities in the area. Governments play a major role as regulators, enablers and facilitators for improving the environmental and social performance of mining. This sourcebook makes recommendations for governments towards this end. RECOMMENDATIONS Protecting the environment and people Designing environmental regulation that adequately protects the environment, which also establishes clear rules for investors Where capacities of the government and the mining industry allow, considering adoption of more innovative approaches to environmental regulation, such as performance-based regulation and economic incentives Making requirements for EIA and EMP for the mining industry, setting out clear roles for the government, mining companies, environmental services experts, civil society organizations and community groups Establishing laws and regulations for mine closure that prevent large environmental legacies and public costs Ensuring that affected communities are informed in advance of mining projects about land use options which are available after mine closure Investing in capacities of regulators for monitoring and enforcement of regulations Enhancing access to mining-related information that is important and relevant to local communities Fostering a culture of transparency in the government and in the mining industry Improving intra-governmental coordination mechanisms, such as those between mining and environmental ministries, local governments, human rights commissions and other government agencies Opening legal avenues for local communities and indigenous peoples affected by mining to have a say in mining projects; defining minimum standards for adequate consultation and consent; investing in the capacities of communities affected by mining; and providing access to remedy for people affected by mining. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 17 Realizing and enhancing the benefits from mining sustainable development benefits, governments need to design and institute fiscal regimes that ensure a fair share of benefits to the country, which are also attractive for mining investors. Tools available to gauge whether the country is getting its \u2018fair share\u2019 and for managing the volatility of revenues from mining (or generally, the extractive industry) are reviewed in this sourcebook. Governments, along with companies, need to improve the transparency of fiscal revenues, which include disclosure of mining contracts and revenue flows. The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) is one of the key international initiatives for improving transparency.

They also need to invest these revenues in long-term development \u2013 social, infrastructure investments, financial savings and economic diversification. Mining brings benefits by driving economic growth and creating jobs. In addition to direct jobs, mining creates indirect and induced jobs, which can be much greater in number compared with direct jobs in mining. Similar with manufacturing, mining is a sector with rapid technological progress, enabling people to learn and acquire skills. These skills can foster the productive capabilities of other companies in the country \u2013 which are arguably the single most important factor in driving economic development. Mining also drives economic growth through its linkages with the rest of the economy, such as by buying goods and services from supplier firms (backward linkages), and by supplying minerals to buyer firms (forward linkages) (Figure ES5). The mining sector can bring significant economic benefits to a country by generating fiscal revenues and export earnings, relieving constraints to investment, spurring economic growth and creating jobs, as well as contributing to physical infrastructure building. However, realizing and enhancing these benefits require action, primarily from the government, but also from mining companies, local communities, employers and businesses in the country. Fiscal revenues from the extractive industry \u2013 taxes, royalties and other payments \u2013 is one of the major reasons why governments seek to promote the growth of this industry in their countries. However, revenues from mining and benefits from these revenues do not flow in automatically. To translate fiscal revenues from the extractive industry into In this section: Fiscal revenues Employment and economic growth Mining and local development Integrating mining into strategies and plans FIGURE ES5.

Improving competitiveness is particularly important considering the rapid diffusion of automation technologies in the mining industry. Measures to improve competitiveness can be complemented by requirements for mining companies to increase local content \u2013 goods and services produced competitively in the host country or supplied by local workers and companies. Local communities that live near mine sites can also gain economic benefits from mining. They have legitimate expectations that mining companies should not only mitigate the negative environmental and social impacts of their activities, but should also take actions to promote local development. Increasingly, mining companies accept these expectations and seek to address them as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives. They do so by implementing or funding local development initiatives, usually focused on health, education, infrastructure and business development. In the past two decades, community development programmes have become widespread in the mining, oil and gas industry. In some cases, local development initiatives are formalized in community development agreements (CDAs). Traditionally, governments have focused on economic, mainly fiscal, benefits from mining, while putting low priority on the environmental and social costs of mining. This is becoming increasingly untenable. Governments should make their strategies for managing mining consistent with their commitments to sustainable development. Tools such as Strategic Environmental and Social Assessments (SESA) and Cost-Benefit Analyses (CBA) can assist in assessing the overall impacts of mining \u2013 not just financial. Despite pressures to consume and produce more minerals, mining is not inevitable \u2013 governments can decide to use the land and natural resources for other purposes \u2013 to preserve the environment or to promote economic activities that sustainably use renewable resources. This sourcebook makes recommendations to governments to help realize and enhance the benefits of mining for development. The lack of coherence between policies, laws, regulations and other actions of the government undermines the environment, the livelihoods and the rights of people, and the potential of a country to earn fiscal revenues from mining. Governments can use experiences and examples highlighted throughout this sourcebook to improve coherence of their policies, legal frameworks and actions to implement them to enhance the positive impact of mining on sustainable development and more effectively mitigate the negative impact.

It focuses on practical issues that need to be addressed by policymakers, administrators and regulators, as well as leaders and members of communities in areas impacted by mining, such as ensuring the coherence of the legal framework, environmental regulation and impact monitoring, safeguarding human rights and engaging local communities, as well as strategies to enhance the fiscal and economic benefits from mining. While the sourcebook was written to respond to the needs of countries in the Asia-Pacific region, it is also relevant to other regions of the world. The sourcebook focuses on the management of industrial-scale mining, rather than artisanal and small-scale mining. Many of the experiences and recommendations are also relevant for the management of other natural resource-based sectors, such as oil, gas and hydropower, as well as industrial-scale agriculture and logging (See Figure 1). OBJECTIVES OF THE SOURCEBOOK To provide national and local policymakers, as well as international development partners, with an introduction to sustainability considerations related to social, environmental and economic impacts of mining, as well as to policy instruments and practices for managing mining towards sustainable development To suggest ways for national and local policymakers and development partners to better incorporate social and environmental sustainability into their work, strengthening sustainable management of mineral resources at the national and subnational levels, and enhancing the economic benefits of mining for achieving the SDGs.

The universal importance of sustainable development has recently been more firmly recognized than ever, as signalled by the historic adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and 17 global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 193 United Nations Member States in 2015. Mining \u2013 the extraction of minerals4 from the earth \u2013 presents opportunities, challenges and risks to sustainable development. Minerals are essential for human well-being and fundamental for virtually all sectors of the economy. Much of the Asia-Pacific region\u2019s economic growth and poverty reduction is underpinned by a dramatic increase in utilization of mineral resources along with water and energy. Material use increased from 5 billion to 37 billion tons annually in 4 decades. At an annual growth rate of 5 percent, the Asia-Pacific region\u2019s material use is now the largest of all world regions and is growing much faster than in the rest of the world.5 Mineral and energy production in Asia and Oceania has grown from 33 percent of the world\u2019s production in 2000 to 48 percent in 2015.6 Australia, China, India, Indonesia and the Islamic Republic of Iran dominate the production of minerals in Asia and Oceania (See Figure 2).7 Mineral resources also represent a high proportion of exports in countries such as the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (38 percent, primarily copper and gold), Mongolia (68 percent, mainly copper) and Papua New Guinea (46 percent, mainly copper, gold and oil).8 3 Brundtland et al. 1987. 4 A broad definition of minerals includes metals, industrial minerals, construction materials and energy minerals (United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) 2000.

For instance, the demand for metals required for electric storage batteries such as aluminum, cobalt, iron, lead, lithium, manganese and nickel is projected to rise significantly under the goal of a scenario of 2 degrees of global temperature increase. The momentum towards a low-carbon society as marked by the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change highlights the urgent need for bringing together the extractive industry and the, clean energy, climate change and environmental communities together on a pathway to sustainable development.9 Mining can also contribute to sustainable development, particularly to its economic dimension. It can bring fiscal revenues to a country, drive economic growth, create jobs and contribute to infrastructure building. Mining is relevant for all Sustainable Development Goals,10 and has particularly strong impacts on (See Figure 3): \u2022 Environmental sustainability goals \u2013 SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 15 (life on land), and SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) and SDG 13 (climate action) \u2022 Social inclusion goals \u2013 SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 5 (gender equality), SDG 10 (reduced inequalities) and SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) \u2022 Sustainable economic development goals \u2013 SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) and SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production). To make mining more sustainable and to better balance the demand for mineral resources with the need for minimizing and managing negative social and environmental impacts of mining, the concept of sustainable development in the mining sector needs to be more effectively operationalized. To do this, it is important to specify the sustainable development principles that are most relevant to mining. Throughout the life of a mine and the whole value chain of mining, coordinated efforts must be made to protect the environment, safeguard human rights and enhance benefits from mining. This requires upholding principles such as minimizing the depletion of non-renewable natural resources, the \u2018polluter pays\u2019 principle, the precautionary principle, resource efficiency, full costing and environmental impact assessments, the FPIC principle, public participation, transparency and accountability, and multi-stakeholder partnerships in the public interest. The mining industry is increasingly becoming aware of its broader societal responsibilities, and some leading companies have progressed significantly in recent years, as manifested in numerous initiatives led by the peak industry body, the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM). Governments of over 60 countries have also come together and formed the Intergovernmental Forum on Mining, Minerals, Metals and Sustainable Development (IGF) to improve governance and decision-making to leverage mining for sustainable development. These are only two among many initiatives undertaken by governments, mining companies, civil society, financial institutions, academia, research institutions and international organizations to address the challenges of mining for sustainable development. It is important to more clearly identify and define the social, environmental and economic issues that are within the legal responsibilities and capacity of governments, as well as the mining industry, local 9 World Bank 2017. 10 CCSI, SDSN, UNDP and WEF 2016.

Based on this common understanding of concrete sustainable development issues related to mining, an optimal mix of legal, regulatory, fiscal, environmental management and social development policy tools and approaches can be identified based on the best available knowledge. Adequate institutional and technical capacity of different stakeholders will have to be developed to effectively implement the identified policies, tools and approaches to manage mining more sustainably.

At earlier stages of exploration, the environmental and social impacts are limited, but as exploration advances, the impacts escalate. Often, exploration can take place concurrently with mining \u2013 for instance, a mining company which already has started mining would do exploration in nearby areas. Environmental impacts during exploration include the transportation of heavy equipment, increased traffic to the site, erosion and scarring of land from drilling and transportation, removal of forest and vegetation covers, disturbance of wildlife habitat and dust pollution. The main social impacts associated with exploration relate to the possible displacement of people, exposure of workers and communities to hazardous materials and blasting, and impacts on cultural heritage. During the exploration phase, fears can be created about the loss of land and environmental impacts, and expectations formed about economic opportunities. 3.2 Mine development phase: mine design and construction The mine development phase includes detailed feasibility studies, detailed environmental impact assessment, mine design and planning, and the construction of the mine and mine facilities. At the mine development phase, the main decisions are made by mining companies and governments which have implications for the environment, the surrounding communities, and fiscal revenues from the mining project.

MAIN IMPACTS DURING THE LIFE OF A MINE Source: Adapted by authors based on sources cited throughout this sourcebook MANAGING MINING FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 30 where a critical opportunity exists for meaningful consultation with communities to be affected by mining and the modification of the mine design, technologies to be used, and other decisions in a way that minimizes negative environmental and social impacts. Major social and environmental impacts are felt when mine construction starts. Employment requirements at the mine site can surge, but often local communities have limited capacity to take advantage of employment opportunities. Limited fiscal revenues may be received by the host government, but the flow of revenues does not really start until after the mine moves into the next phase \u2013 production. The magnitude and the type of impacts depend on the type and scale of the mineral deposits and on the geological and physical features of the deposit, which largely predetermine the mining method (See Box 1). 11 United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) 2014. 12 Clark et al. 2013. Box 1 Mining methods Underground mining is done for minerals and metals that lie deep in the earth. It has less impact on the landscape, but still significant impacts on the groundwater. Over time, as mining progresses, improper refilling of underground mines can result in subsidence, or cave-in. Underground mining is costly and requires advanced engineering, equipment and skills. Surface (open pit) mining has the most visible and dramatic landscape changes where large areas of land are stripped of their vegetation cover, leading to the disturbance and loss of forests, animal habitat and displacement of people. These processes can disturb water sources and riverbeds, and deplete springs. In addition to hard-rock mining, surface mining includes placer (or alluvial) mining \u2013 mining of mineral and metal deposits that are found in gravel and sand, usually in riverbeds. Placer mining requires less advanced equipment and is often done by artisanal and small-scale miners. Deep sea mining has emerged in recent years, as oceans and seas are estimated to hold large quantities of precious metals and minerals.11 Mining of deep sea minerals will have different impacts depending on the types of deposits and local marine environments. It is difficult to estimate the scale of its impacts, given that the scientific knowledge of deep sea environments is currently limited.12 Land surface Land surface before mining Open pit Deposit Deposit Sea floor Sea Riser and lift pipe Production support vessel Land surface Shaft Deposit IMPACTS OF MINING DURING THE LIFE OF A MINE 31 13 L\u00e8bre and Corder 2015. 14 International Finance Corporation (IFC) 2012. 15 Downing 2002.

Human rights abuses associated with mining have been widely documented (See Section 4.5 on Customary rules). The impacts of displacement can be mitigated through well-managed resettlement processes and follow-up. Environmental impacts: Construction of mines and mining facilities has impacts on health and environment through water, air and soil pollution, and noise from blasting. New infrastructure constructed to serve mines adds further environmental impacts.

Leaching is a process of treatment of the ore or mining waste by chemical solutions, reagents and other compounds to extract the useful ore or ore concentrate. It is used for mining and mineral processing (beneficiation) of metals and some minerals. \u2022 In-situ leach mining involves applying chemical solutions to the host deposit; in-situ leaching involves less earth moving, but chemical solutions seep into the ground and ground water. \u2022 Heap leaching involves application of chemical solutions to the ore after extracting it and placing it on a lined surface, which largely prevents solutions from penetrating into the ground and ground water. \u2022 Dump leaching (similar to heap leaching) is reprocessing of mine waste for residual metals; if planned and carried out well, it could improve efficiency in mining with reduced environmental impacts.13 \u2022 Bio-leaching involves using bacteria to extract the mineral, rather than using chemical substances. Bio-leaching methods have been developed in recent years and they can have more benign environmental impacts. However, bio-leaching is slower and most costly than conventional leaching, and needs to be managed properly to avoid environmental problems.

Benefits such as building new infrastructure and providing jobs start to be realized during the mine development phase. Shared infrastructure: If infrastructure is planned and built to be shared between the mine and nearby villages and towns, they can spur economic activities and bring markets closer to local communities. For these benefits to be realized, planning and negotiation for the shared use of infrastructure and financial commitments should be done during the mine design phase \u2013 before mine construction starts. Employment: During the mine construction, there is usually a surge in demand for workers. In mining that takes place in rural, remote areas without a large enough skilled workforce, many jobs might be required filled by new migrants to the area or \u2018fly-in\u2019 workers. After the mine construction is completed, the demand for workers declines and stabilizes at a lower level. The skills required at the mine operation phase differ from the skills needed during construction. Conflicts: In mining, local communities living near mine sites experience negative impacts before benefits start flowing in. In many cases, they also receive disproportionately small benefits relative to the large negative impacts throughout the life of a mine. This can give rise to conflicts between mining companies and local communities. These conflicts can occur at any phase of mining, but are perhaps most prevalent during the mine construction phase. Globally, the number of recorded conflicts between mining companies and communities increased almost exponentially from 10 conflicts in 2002 to 90 by 2013.17 A more detailed review of conflicts, based on data from news sources and proprietary databases showed that all together, there were 453 mining-related conflicts in this period.18 Environmental, economic and health and safety issues were found to be the most common causes or triggers of conflict.19 Conflicts that delay or stop mining operations can incur substantial costs for mining companies: available figures suggest that delays cost mining companies US$10,000 to $50,000 per day during exploration; and in the order of US$750,000 per day during mining (excluding indirect costs).20 Other mining-related 16 Vo and Brereton 2014. 17 International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) 2015. 18 Andrews et al. 2018. 19 Ibid. 20 (Davis and Franks 2014) Box 2 Displacement from the Thach Khe iron ore mine16 The Thach Khe Iron Ore Mine is an open pit iron ore mine in central Viet Nam.

Mining activities were expected to impact around 4,000 hectares of land in six communes with about 4,000 households (16,800 people). These households were required to relocate. Under the resettlement plan, all households should have been resettled between 2009 and 2013, with 60 percent of the total relocated between 2010 and 2011. However, the mining company failed to contribute the promised capital. In 2009, the company had committed to contribute AU$65 million by 2010 but by 2012 had provided AU$11.05 million. As a result, resettlements were significantly delayed and some not completed. The delay in the resettlement process has seriously affected the lives of displaced people. In particular, the mining company progressed excavation operations before relocation had been finalized. Local people that had not been resettled on time were exposed to water shortage and contamination, air pollution, dust and noise. IMPACTS OF MINING DURING THE LIFE OF A MINE 33 conflicts can include conflicts within and between communities, and between locals and migrants. There are many cases when governments and artisanal miners also get involved in conflicts. 3.3 Mining operations phase: mining and mineral processing The mining operation phase involves extracting the minerals; removing and storing earth, rocks and waste; and processing and transporting minerals. The impacts of mining operations can differ greatly depending on the type of mineral being mined, the geological features of the deposit and mining technologies used. Major environmental impacts of mining include production of waste, release of toxic and hazardous waste, air pollution and emissions, water pollution and depletion, and the loss of productive land and ecosystems. Moreover, mining can magnify or multiply existing environmental risks and hazards. For instance, degradation of soil resources can exacerbate food insecurity in arid and semi-arid regions. Tailings discharges from industrial and artisanal mining can lead to bioaccumulation of toxins in the food chain \u2013 accumulation of mercury in fish is a prime example. Particularly in water- scarce regions, degradation and/or diversion of freshwater resources can aggravate water scarcity and multiply the impacts of climate change by further reducing the availability of water for household consumption. However, many of these impacts can be significantly reduced with good management of environmental impact, including the use of appropriate technologies. Nevertheless, the growing demand for minerals and metals is leading to increased incidences of exploration and mining in environmentally sensitive areas \u2013 watersheds and glaciers, as well as areas prone to earthquakes and tropical storms. 21 The Guardian 2015a, 2015b and 2015c. Box 3 The Samarco Minera\u00e7\u00e3o Mine accident in Brazil21 A recent large-scale disaster with tailings happened in Brazil in November 2015. A tailing dam of the open-cast Samarco Minera\u00e7\u00e3o Mine in the state of Minas Gerais burst open, pouring out around 50 million cubic metres of mudflow thick with toxic mining waste, equivalent to about 25,000 Olympic- size swimming pools. The slurry was a mix of contaminated water and sediment with heavy metal content generated by the iron ore operations. The slurry flooded communities close to the dam and rendered communities in the districts of Bento Rodrigues and Paracatu completely uninhabitable. The \u201csea of mud\u201d then oozed into one of Brazil\u2019s largest rivers, the Rio Doce and has extinguished vast amounts of plant and animal life along a 650-kilometre stretch of the river, with the heightened turbidity drastically reducing the levels of oxygen in the water. It also made the water undrinkable, which severely affected the hundreds of thousands of people that were depending on it. Concern over toxins in the mining residue has led Brazil\u2019s national water agency, ANA, to ban the use of the river water for human consumption. Hundreds of thousands of residents in the area have had to rely on supplies of bottled water. According to projections from Brazil\u2019s environment ministry, the toxic tide reached the Atlantic Ocean through the river estuary and has spread along 9 kilometres of coastline. It threatens the Comboios nature reserve, which is one of the only regular nesting sites for the endangered leatherback turtle. Brazil\u2019s environmental agency, IBAMA, described the collapse of the tailing dam of the iron ore operation as the country\u2019s \u201cworst environmental catastrophe in [Brazil\u2019s] history\u201d.

Box 4 Acid mine drainage Metals such as gold, copper, silver and molybdenum are often found in rock deposits that also contain sulphide minerals. When the sulphide minerals are exposed to water and air during the mining process, they form sulphuric acid, which is then dissolved in rainwater. The resulting acidic water leaches other metals in the rock, dissolving other harmful metals in the rock and forming a solution that is acidic, high in sulphate and rich in heavy metal. This solution flows from the mine and contaminates surface and ground water. Acid mine drainage (AMD) may be released from any part of the mine where sulphides are exposed to air and water, including waste rock piles, tailings, open pits, underground tunnels and leach pads. Acid mine drainage presents a long-term risk for neighbouring ecosystems and communities. The impact of acid drainage on local wildlife and human life is through two vectors: \u2022 Water contaminated by the acid drainage of a mine operation is often very acidic, with a PH value of four or lower. This level of acidity is similar to that of battery acid. Most plants, animals and fish cannot survive in such an acidic environment. \u2022 Heavy metals (such as iron, copper, aluminium, cadmium, arsenic, lead and mercury), dissolved in acidic effluents through acid drainage, are toxic to humans and animal consumption. These metals do not break down in the environment. They persist in the bodies of water for long periods, providing a long-term source of contamination. Carried in water streams, heavy metal pollution can travel far, contaminating streams and groundwater over great distances. AMD can be a perpetual problem, lasting for thousands of years. Prevention of AMD in the first place \u2013 so-called \u2018source control\u2019 \u2013 is a preferred solution compared with rehabilitation of AMD, because it is more cost-effective and reduces risks to the environment and people. However, source control measures may not always be feasible or pragmatic. Given the practical difficulties in inhibiting the formation of AMD at source, often the only alternative is to minimize the impact that the polluted water has on receiving streams and rivers and the wider environment; such an approach involves migration control measures. It is also possible to use some available technologies to extract and retain valuable metals from the AMD and use these to offset the costs of treatment. The toxic substance can seep into the ground and contaminate ground water. Breaking of tailings dams can release large quantities of toxic liquid that can kill aquatic life and poison water over large areas downhill from the tailings pond. Areas prone to storms, downpours and floods are more vulnerable to risks of tailings dam failures. Emissions and air pollution: Dust and particles from mining operations can be disseminated widely by wind, causing air pollution. This phenomenon causes respiratory diseases among miners and people living in proximity to the mines. Mining operations also generate harmful gas emissions such as heavy metals fumes, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and IMPACTS OF MINING DURING THE LIFE OF A MINE 35 24 International Maritime Organization (IMO) and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) 2013. 25 L\u00e8bre and Corder 2015. 26 Safework Australia 2016. nitrogen oxides, generated by the combustion of fuel from plants and vehicles, from explosions and from the processing of minerals with chemicals. Sedimentation and pollution of water: Mining affects and can even destroy bodies of water, such as rivers, estuaries, mangroves and wetlands. Some of the worst practices include disposal of tailings directly into rivers and shallow seas \u2013 practices that have catastrophic environmental consequences and are largely discontinued. Today, riverine tailings disposal is practised only in four mines in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.24 Water scarcity: Certain mining activities consume a lot of water, which can lead to the reduction of water resources particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. This can trigger water-use conflicts between mining companies and local communities. Loss of productive land, ecosystems and biodiversity: Mining has a significant physical footprint on the land \u2013 it is estimated that mine waste covers about 100 million hectares of land globally; this land is not usable in the long term.25 Land is also lost through waste storage, as well as the creation of large open-pit mines.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "775a1eaf-8549-4356-8c7a-17c3bb83691c": {"__data__": {"id_": "775a1eaf-8549-4356-8c7a-17c3bb83691c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Managing mining for sustainable development - A Sourcebook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "af69f259c14178ada396b5b4f2fd4912fdea813679b9de7c68b862cf07eb6117"}}, "hash": "af69f259c14178ada396b5b4f2fd4912fdea813679b9de7c68b862cf07eb6117", "text": "Mining affects the livelihoods of people who rely on resources of forests, pastures and cropland, and disrupts ecosystems. Safety: The mining industry is one of the most dangerous industries; therefore, safety standards are high on the priority of both mining companies and regulators. Mining operations carry high risk of injury, occupational illness or the death of workers due to reasons such as mishandling of machinery, explosions, gaseous asphyxiation and structural instability of underground mines; transportation also raises the risk of road fatalities. In 2014 and 2015, mining accounted for almost 7 percent of all worker deaths at workplaces in Australia.26 The number and relative incidence of injury and death tends to be higher in developing countries, where safety standards and skills tend to be lower. Gender inequality: Mining operations can widen gender inequalities. Women bear a disproportionate share of the social costs and receive an inadequate share of the benefits of mining. This asymmetry in gender impacts is due to various reasons. For instance, women\u2019s employment in mining is notoriously low, and they are more often employed in auxiliary jobs rather than core jobs. Due to their lower status in many traditional societies, women may not be consulted and compensations are often paid to men on behalf of their households. The negative environmental impact of mining can affect women\u2019s roles to provide food for their families. Mining also has positive economic impacts, most of which are realized during the mine production phase. Fiscal revenues: The most visible positive impact of mining is by generating taxes, royalties and other revenues for the governments of host countries. Governments can already start collecting revenues from mining at the mine development phase (such as signature bonuses paid upon signing of a mining contract). However, the bulk of revenues \u2013 such as royalties and corporate income taxes \u2013 come in when mine production starts. Employment and business development: Mining creates jobs directly and indirectly; in underdeveloped regions, it may provide the only job opportunities outside of subsistence agriculture. By buying goods and services from suppliers in the country, mining can provide stimulants to the local and national economy. During the mine operations phase, mining employs fewer people than during mine construction, but provides more stable, long-term jobs. The frequent challenge for local communities, which may lack required skills, is to take advantage of employment and business opportunities. MANAGING MINING FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 36 3.4 Mine closure phase Overall, mining leads to the loss of productive land, although with good planning and management of mining and its closure, mined land can be used for other purposes. Mining can also leave a legacy of long-term environmental impacts. After mine closure, jobs are lost, not only in the mine, but also in companies supplying to the mine. At the mine closure phase, companies are required to wind down mineral extraction and processing, decommission mining processing facilities, conduct land reclamation and rehabilitation, close and seal waste facilities, and remove mine workers\u2019 camp and equipment. Many jurisdictions now require companies to make financial provisions for mine closure and rehabilitation. As part of their corporate responsibility, companies also take measures to retrain and relocate workers. However, most mines close not because of depletion of the mineral deposit, but due to various economic, financial and political reasons, as well as social conflicts. An analysis of 1,000 mine closures showed that only 25 percent of mines close after exhausting the ore.27 Premature mine closure means that the environmental impacts can be greater, due to inefficient mining processes and difficulties in environmental impact management of mines which become abandoned or change ownership. Therefore, more long-term planning for mining is required, starting early in the life of the mine. 27 L\u00e8bre and Corder 2015.

These elements of the legal, regulatory and normative framework are often inconsistent with each other and have critical gaps, particularly in areas that are essential for the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2accecca-f0e6-4fe1-9161-7f04134f3efb": {"__data__": {"id_": "2accecca-f0e6-4fe1-9161-7f04134f3efb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Managing mining for sustainable development - A Sourcebook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3900476b9a48871c69ea3471bb0844c3a9e1fefa000e7fb1235de3c52b1e64b2"}}, "hash": "3900476b9a48871c69ea3471bb0844c3a9e1fefa000e7fb1235de3c52b1e64b2", "text": "protection of human rights and livelihoods of people affected by mining. Addressing these gaps and inconsistencies is necessary for improving the environmental and social outcomes of mining activities and for safeguarding the human rights of those affected by mining. Government agencies should coordinate between themselves at the national and subnational levels to ensure that the legal, regulatory and normative framework is implemented in a coherent manner, and in a way that is consistent with the sustainable development objectives of the country. 4.1 The domestic legal framework The legal basis for mineral exploration, development and production is usually established in constitutions and mining laws. Constitutions of some countries explicitly establish who owns and manages mineral resources \u2013 often, mineral resources belong to \u201cthe people\u201d, while the government manages these resources on behalf of the people. Constitutions include many provisions relevant to natural resources, such as land, health and labour rights, property ownership and access to justice, and civil and criminal legal procedures. However, constitutions do not contain details on the governance of the sector \u2013 these details are specified in laws and regulations. Domestic laws and regulations define the responsibilities of mining operators related to all aspects of mining \u2013 operations, taxation, health and safety, environmental safeguards and resettlement. They also define responsibilities of the government with respect to providing permits in relation to mining the environment and associated land access. Mining laws occupy the central place in the mining legal and regulatory framework. They set out procedures and conditions for exploration or mineral extraction permits. These terms and conditions typically include: operational requirements, transition from exploration to extraction, data and information sharing on geology and mineral reserves, feasibility studies, and production requirements. In addition to mining laws, other laws and regulations which influence mining include: tax laws; environmental laws and regulations, including environmental impact assessment and mine closure laws and regulations; laws and regulations on labour, health, safety, resettlement; land laws; corporation laws and investment laws; laws specifying roles and responsibilities of national and subnational governments, and laws on fiscal relations between them; and laws and regulations on public-private provision of infrastructure. Domestic laws and regulations need to be coherent with each other and with international laws, norms and customary rules practised in the country. In a country where the mining legal framework is implemented adequately, the division of responsibilities between various government agencies, and that between national and subnational levels of government are clearly defined, and their actions are coordinated. Where the government is directly involved in mining through state-owned mining companies, the legal framework distinguishes the roles and responsibilities of the government as a regulator from those in its commercial role, as a mining operator. MANAGING MINING FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 40 4.2 Mining contracts Mining contracts denote agreements made between the government and the investor for the purpose of mining. Mining contracts are usually entered with large investors and constitute another key element of the legal and regulatory framework in mining in many resource-rich countries.28 Depending on the importance of mining contracts within the domestic legal and regulatory framework, mining legal regimes can be classified as a: \u2022 Law-based regime \u2013 a regime that is mainly based on laws and regulations. Such a legal regime is uniformly applied across mining companies within the country; or \u2022 Contract-based regime \u2013 a regime that is mainly based on contracts between mining companies and the government. In this regime, most obligations of mining companies, such as taxes, environmental requirements and social contributions are defined by contracts. Mining contracts are signed by the executive government and, in some countries, they are further ratified by the legislature (parliament). Depending on the applicable legal system, in some countries mining contracts ratified by the legislature might acquire the force of the law and override mining laws and regulations. Even where they are not ratified by the legislature, they serve a regulatory function, since they specify rules for actions of the mining company and the government in respect to a given mining project. In countries with long experience with modern mining (more \u2018mature\u2019 mining destinations), the mining legal and regulatory frameworks are well- developed and predictable; therefore, they tend to have law-based regimes, as there is less need for case-by-case mining contracts. However, countries with less experience with mining might have less specific mining laws and regulations. In these countries, mining contracts might be used to make up for weaknesses or the lack of detail in the underlying laws and regulations, and thus their legal regimes become contract-based regimes.29 From the public interest perspective, a law-based regime is preferable to a contract-based regime.30 First,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4532bf5e-2b1f-4313-bb24-3cac3418ee3f": {"__data__": {"id_": "4532bf5e-2b1f-4313-bb24-3cac3418ee3f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Managing mining for sustainable development - A Sourcebook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7edc744e750c8eab83b7dcb3e442e1eebbd6d03d5a33a1c7ef7f1e8e8164961d"}}, "hash": "7edc744e750c8eab83b7dcb3e442e1eebbd6d03d5a33a1c7ef7f1e8e8164961d", "text": "contract-based regimes are more secretive \u2013 mining and other resource contracts are often not disclosed.31 Many countries\u2019 constitutions recognize that mineral resources belong to the people of the country, giving the public the right to know about their mineral resources. Therefore, a law-based regime, by being more transparent, is more conducive to informing the public about the resource sector. Transparency in mining or oil and gas deals is important also from mining investors\u2019 perspective, as investors have greater assurance that they are treated equally. Nowadays, contract disclosure is increasingly recognized as a part of international best practice. Recent developments have shown that contract disclosure is feasible for a wide range of countries. Jurisdictions such as Burkina Faso, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Liberia, Mexico, Niger, Peru, the Philippines, Tanzania and Western Australia now require resource contracts to be disclosed to the public.32 Second, if the legal framework applies equally to all investors, monitoring of mining projects is more streamlined and the government has fewer burdens to monitor them. In contrast, contract-based regimes can result in a proliferation of contracts with varying requirements and differing tax and royalty rates, making monitoring of contracts complicated. 28 Mining companies may make many different agreements such as financing agreements, community development agreements (See Box 22. Community Development Agreements (CDAs)), infrastructure agreements and sales agreements. To distinguish mining contracts between mining investors and governments from other agreements, the term \u2018investor-state agreements\u2019 is used to denote mining contracts. In this document, \u2018mining contract\u2019 and \u2018investor-state agreement\u2019 are used interchangeably. 29 In addition to this typology of countries, there are also countries that use contracts as another method of granting rights or setting further terms and conditions rather than to fill legal and regulatory gaps. In referring to countries with contract-based regimes, this document does not refer to this group of countries. The author thanks Ana E. Bastida for this point. 30 This consideration applies whenever contracts are used to fill regulatory gaps. 31 The primary reason for non-disclosure of resource contracts to the public seems to be a vestige of long-standing industry practice. Mining contracts emerged from purely commercial contracts, which typically had a confidentiality clause indicating that there would be consequences if either party shared the terms with anyone else. This practice of secrecy has persevered in most oil- and mineral-rich countries, even with public contracts that govern billions of dollars of public revenues and directly impact the lives of many citizens. 32 Natural Resource Governance Institute (NRGI) 2017.

Third, stabilization clauses in natural resource contracts can limit the space for policymakers and law makers of the host country, thereby affecting countries that adopt more progressive laws and regulations to limit negative environmental and social impacts of mining and enhance the fiscal and economic benefits from mining. Stabilization clauses makes the contract or specific provisions in the contract immune to changes in national laws, effectively limiting the government\u2019s ability to change the rules governing the mining project without the company\u2019s consent. Consensus has been reached that stabilization clauses in mining contracts, if used, should be limited to fiscal (tax) provisions. Wider stabilization clauses \u2013 which \u2018freeze\u2019 the legal and regulatory framework \u2013 are now considered unusual and outdated; however, they are still in effect in the mining sector in several less developed countries.33 From the perspective of mining investors, the possibility of freezing key provisions in the contract is attractive, because it helps prevent unanticipated changes in the legal framework that may jeopardize their investment and raise their costs. Large-scale mining operations require large upfront investments, and returns on these investments are recouped over several decades. Therefore, changes to the \u2018rules of the game\u2019 after the investments are made can make the overall investment less profitable than expected or even not worthwhile. Thus, governments seeking to attract large foreign investment may agree to stabilization clauses in mining contracts; this was prevalent in many developing countries in the 1980s and 1990s when mineral prices were low. Rather than using mining contracts to fill legal and regulatory gaps, it is preferable to improve the legal framework for mining and ensure its reasonable stability. Nevertheless, there may be good reasons for governments to make contracts with mining companies for purposes other than filling legal and regulatory gaps. Mining contracts allow dealing with project-specific issues such as building infrastructure, mitigating environmental impacts, and specifying the government\u2019s direct participation (shares) in a mining project.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a17087d0-d73f-4e9e-bd58-0fd3b3c5cada": {"__data__": {"id_": "a17087d0-d73f-4e9e-bd58-0fd3b3c5cada", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Managing mining for sustainable development - A Sourcebook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2bfb20a69c69b425c83bd7b36e86059aef8a9d25703045c4074032f40be173e8"}}, "hash": "2bfb20a69c69b425c83bd7b36e86059aef8a9d25703045c4074032f40be173e8", "text": "For example, in Australia, investor-state agreements have been used to establish large, export-oriented mining projects since the 1950s and are still in use today. In Western Australia, in addition to the Commonwealth (federal) and state laws and regulations, State Agreements between the state government and mining companies are used to facilitate the development of infrastructure (e.g. railways, ports and corridors) for mining projects in greenfield locations (undeveloped land).34 Box 5 Contract of Work in Indonesia In Indonesia, mining activity was governed by the Contract of Work (CoW) system for over 40 years. Each CoW was an independent piece of legislation approved by the Indonesian Parliament and signed by the President. No CoW has ever been revoked except as provided for under default provisions within the agreements themselves. The 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law allowed foreign investment in mining and in 1967 Freeport Sulphur signed the first CoW with the Indonesian Government to mine copper in the West Irian province. Mining CoWs designated foreign firms as contractors working for the Indonesian Government and paying corporate income tax on profits in addition to royalties and other taxes. A series of CoWs followed the Freeport Sulphur contract, on slightly less generous terms. Overall, the Indonesian Government has issued a total 268 CoWs, of which only 12 have achieved production status.35 In 2009, the Indonesian Government passed a new law to replace the CoW system by a general mining licence system. The 2009 Mining Law led to the renegotiation of several CoWs, though most mines currently in operations are still governed by these contracts. MANAGING MINING FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 42 Many developing countries have legal frameworks reliant on contracts, such as the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (mineral exploration and production agreements) and Papua New Guinea (franchise agreements). But countries are increasingly moving away from reliance on contracts that fill legal and regulatory gaps. For example, Indonesia reformed its mining legal framework with the adoption of the Mining Law in 2009, and is currently in the process of renegotiating existing mining agreements (See Box 5). Although each mining contract is negotiated on a case-by-case basis and establishes a unique framework for the development of an individual mining project, there is usually a degree of similarity between agreements. Adopting model mining contracts and limiting the number of contract terms open to negotiation enables countries to improve the consistency, uniformity and effectiveness of their contractual regimes. The International Bar Association has developed a Model Mining Development Agreement (MMDA) with the support of the World Bank in 2012.36 It was developed by analysing many existing investor-state agreements in mining, and through an extensive process of consultation and feedback from public and private interest groups and leading experts in the field. The Model Mining Development Agreement provides a set of \u2018lead clauses\u2019, as well as a series of alternative clauses taken from existing agreements. However, it should be noted that the MMDA should not necessarily serve as an aspirational model, because it relies on existing agreements which are not necessarily conducive for sustainable development. Model agreements should provide sufficient policy space for environmental and social laws and regulations of the host country. If mining contracts are made, governments should pay special attention to provisions related to environmental impact mitigation, mine closure, resettlement, local content and employment. Separate community development agreements can also be helpful in this regard (See Box 23). 4.3 International treaties, conventions and soft law While few specific references to mineral exploration and exploitation appear in international law, the international legal framework has a bearing on the governance of mining. It is a general principle in international law that sovereign states have the rights and responsibilities to legislate and regulate activities within their borders, including exploitation of their natural resources. Nevertheless, international law \u2013 treaties, conventions and declarations \u2013 have implications on extractive activities. Therefore, governments should seek to ensure consistency between their domestic legal framework and its enforcement, as well as the international law. Three categories of international law have the most relevance for mining: international investment treaties, international human rights law, and environmental conventions and treaties. 4.3.1 Investment treaties Although investor-state agreements are situated within the domestic legal framework, a contract with a foreign investor is considered an international contract and is governed by international investment treaties if the host and home countries\u2019 governments are parties to such treaties. Home country governments enter into these treaties to protect their companies\u2019 investments abroad, while host country governments do so to promote foreign investment in their countries.

It should also be noted that many arbitrations are conducted behind closed doors. 38 United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) 2017. 39 Knottnerus and Ryskeldi 2017. 40 Ibid. 41 This text was contributed by Samara Yawnghwe, PEI Myanmar. direct or indirect expropriation, limit performance requirements, and provide guarantees on free transfer of capital. Moreover, the enforcement of international treaties is very effective. There are several issues to watch for in investment treaties with respect to mining and its environmental and social impacts. For example, if the host country government adopts a law banning the use of certain substances (e.g. mercury) prohibiting mining in ecologically sensitive areas, or strengthens its environmental regulations to require better compliance, a mining company can claim that these government actions reduce the value of its mining investment and constitute indirect expropriation or unintended discrimination; they can litigate against the host country government on these grounds. Some investment treaties also restrict performance requirements, such as requirements to buy local goods and services, use certain technologies or train workers. These restrictions can limit the positive impact of mining investment on the local economy. Between 1987 and 2015, investors globally initiated approximately 650 international arbitrations against governments,37 with most of these arbitrations initiated in the last 10 years. About one in eight of these arbitration cases are associated with mining investments.38 The cost of such arbitrations and lost claims can be particularly harsh for countries with high poverty and development needs. For example, Kyrgyzstan currently faces arbitration claims of US$925 million, including major claims by mining companies. Compare this to the combined health and education budget of the country in 2015 of US$616 million.39 The government of Ecuador lost an investment dispute case against Occidental Petroleum; the initial award to the company was US$1.7 billion, approximately equal to the country\u2019s annual health budget. In 2016, Ecuador withdrew from bilateral investment treaties with 16 countries \u2013 a decision based on evidence that these treaties failed to deliver investment, costed the country billions of dollars, and threaten the government\u2019s capacity to protect its citizens.40 Although many of the problems that give rise to investment disputes have to do with corruption and mismanagement on the part of host country governments, there are also many cases of unreasonable claims of investors against host country governments. Overall, strong protections afforded to investors and the effective enforcement of international investment treaties can be detrimental to environmental protection, human rights and social development. Beyond litigation costs and possible compensation costs in the case the state loses the claim, arbitration and litigation Box 6 Investment treaty negotiation support in Myanmar41 Since the beginning of democratic reforms in 2010 in Myanmar, numerous policies and laws have begun to be reviewed and amended, while old laws have been rescinded. At the same time, Myanmar was approached by countries seeking to make investment agreements. As of 2016, Myanmar has signed 5 bilateral investment agreements and is said to have 12 investment agreement negotiations pending. However, Myanmar\u2019s experience in dealing with such international investment agreements is limited, further complicated by the evolving legal and regulatory framework. The UNDP-UNEP Poverty Environment Initiative (PEI) has supported the Directorate of Investment and Company Administration (DICA) of Myanmar in understanding the implications of investment agreements and their interactions with national law. It also developed an investment treaty negotiation support document and conducted training in using it. MANAGING MINING FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 44 cases with investors can deter other foreign investors from investing in the country. Partly prompted by a billion-dollar lawsuit made by a UK-based mining company against the Indonesian government, the government of Indonesia embarked on a process to rebalance its engagement with investors by discontinuing treaties or reassessing provisions of existing investment treaties and investment chapters in trade agreements. As part of this effort, Indonesia is also developing a new treaty model of international investment agreements.42 To ensure that mining contributes to sustainable development and to prevent costly arbitration processes, resource-rich countries should consider adequate protection for the environment and human rights in negotiating new investment treaties", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a12400c-6046-4519-a163-deb93cecc125": {"__data__": {"id_": "4a12400c-6046-4519-a163-deb93cecc125", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Managing mining for sustainable development - A Sourcebook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "98a6c511524d70206fd1834a35716cb2916707b2426fc1a13847998eee5a0923"}}, "hash": "98a6c511524d70206fd1834a35716cb2916707b2426fc1a13847998eee5a0923", "text": "or renegotiating existing ones. 4.3.2 International human rights law The core instruments of human rights law are the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.

In addition to hard law (covenants, conventions and treaties binding on states that ratified them, such as the Human Rights Covenants and the ILO Convention 169), there is also a body of soft law \u2013 non-binding instruments such as declarations and guidelines. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which was adopted in 2007, is non-binding, but it refers to the rights specified in the Human Rights Covenants and thereby becomes customary law. The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP) by the UN Human Rights Council in 2011 is a prime example of a soft law instrument with far-reaching implications.43 Although the Guiding Principles are non-binding on investors or states, they can shape the overall regulatory environment in which companies operate and their expectations and actions with respect to human rights, environment, and other issues critical for the development of communities and countries. The principles cover not only the operations of the company itself, but also those of its suppliers and other business relations. Governments are encouraged to adopt National Action Plans (NAPs) on Business and Human Rights as part of their responsibility to disseminate and implement the Guiding Principles. The NAPs allow governments to increase policy coherence and coordination, monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the Guiding Principles, and promotion of transparent dialogue with stakeholders.44 The uptake of NAPs has recently accelerated in Asia, with eight countries having started the process for developing these plans (India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea and Thailand).45 Leading mining companies, through the industry body, ICMM, were closely involved in the consultations which led to the development of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights; the ICMM \u201cfully supports\u201d the Guiding Principles.46 42 Jailani 2015. 43 United Nations 2011. 44 United Nations Working Group on Business and Human Rights 2011. 45 Business and Human Rights Resource Centre 2017. 46 International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) 2017.

Box 7 UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights47 The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP) provides a normative framework outlining the roles of states and businesses in addressing the adverse impact of business operations on human rights. The UNGP outlines the duty of states to protect human rights, the obligation of businesses to respect human rights, and the role of both states and businesses in providing effective remedies. The UNGP applies to all states and to all businesses, including small and medium-sized enterprises. I. The State duty to protect human rights The Guiding Principles instruct that \u201cStates must protect against human rights abuses within their territory and/or jurisdiction by third parties, including business enterprises\u201d and that \u201cStates should set out clearly the expectation that all business enterprises domiciled in their territory and/or jurisdiction respect human rights throughout their operations.\u201d The UNGP also sets out operational principles for states that address general regulatory and policy functions of the states, such as enforcement of laws and guidance to businesses, and the state-business nexus which includes the conduct of state-owned enterprises, as well as enterprises with which the states make contracts or conduct business transactions. A special set of operational principles considers the heightened measures businesses must employ to ensure respect for human rights in conflict-affected areas. The operational principles also encourage policy coherence between human rights instruments, such as between government agencies, and in dealing with investment treaties and contracts. II. The corporate responsibility to respect human rights The UNGP also requires businesses to respect human rights, \u201cat a minimum, as those expressed in the International Bill of Human Rights and the principles concerning fundamental rights set out in the International Labour Organization\u2019s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.\u201d Businesses should also seek to mitigate negative human rights impacts which may be caused by them indirectly, through their operations and relationships with other entities in their value chain. The operational principles require businesses to craft policy commitments towards respecting human rights; to conduct human rights due diligence in all operations; and to provide remedies where operations have had an adverse impact on human rights. Importantly, the Guiding Principles set out expectations that business enterprises should not only comply", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f13e0c33-b5c1-425c-ae38-1d138c8818a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "f13e0c33-b5c1-425c-ae38-1d138c8818a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Managing mining for sustainable development - A Sourcebook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fb7b9925bc32ac5b93655c64b169918a4f2d612ae7295a5e3ecdc6541e402771"}}, "hash": "fb7b9925bc32ac5b93655c64b169918a4f2d612ae7295a5e3ecdc6541e402771", "text": "with applicable laws, but also respect internationally recognized human rights, as well as, \u201ctreat the risk of causing or contributing to gross human rights abuses as a legal compliance issue\u201d. III. Access to remedy The UNGP also provides that states must ensure access to judicial and non-judicial mechanisms to remedy business-related human rights abuses, through judicial, administrative, legislative and other means. The operational principles provide guidance on state-based judicial and non-judicial mechanisms, and non-state-based grievance mechanisms. They also provide effectiveness criteria for non-judicial grievance mechanisms, often maintained by businesses, that relate to legitimacy, accessibility, predictability, equity and transparency. MANAGING MINING FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 46 The UN Human Rights Council adopted a resolution in 2014 to set up an intergovernmental working group to elaborate an international legally binding instrument in international human rights law to regulate the activities of transnational corporations and other business enterprises.48 Discussions about a treaty on transnational corporations and other business enterprises with respect to human rights are currently ongoing.49 These discussions are informed by analysis of the obstacles that victims face in transnational human rights cases, and of the sources of the impunity of corporate entities that operate across different national jurisdictions \u2013 primarily in the natural resources industries. The expected treaty, when eventually finalized, would be the first international human rights agreement to specifically and explicitly regulate the activities of transnational corporations with respect to the fundamental rights of individuals and communities. Another important normative instrument is the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, adopted by 42 countries.50 The OECD Guidelines cover issues such as human rights, employment and industrial relations, environment, combating bribery, consumer interests, science and technology, competition and taxation. The significance of the OECD Guidelines is that they have been adopted by governments of mostly developed countries \u2013 the home countries of most multinational companies, which have regulatory power over these companies. Overall, whereas international law provides strong and effective protection for investors, it is still a long way from providing similarly strong protections for people affected by investment, including mining investment. To strengthen the protection of human rights in order to balance with the protection of investors\u2019 interests, governments should make their domestic laws and regulations consistent with their international human rights commitments; they should also seek to incorporate the principles and guidance within soft laws into their legal and regulatory framework to protect people affected by mining. 4.3.3 Environmental conventions and treaties There are various instruments in international environmental law that are relevant for the environmental regulation of the mining industry. These include conventions and treaties on mineral waste, water quality, nature preservation, biodiversity, air pollution and climate change.51 Mineral hazardous waste and recovery About 95 percent of all toxic and hazardous chemicals fall into the four industry groupings of toxic metals, petrochemicals, pesticides and radioactive materials.52 An international treaty that is directly relevant to the (gold) mining industry is the 2013 Minamata Convention on Mercury.53 It envisages the controlled use and progressive removal of mercury from circulation, due to its significant negative impacts on human health and the environment. The strictest treaties include outright bans on imports and exports of hazardous wastes. The 1991 Bamako Convention bans imports into Africa, but permits States in each region to trade with each other, subject to certain controls. The 1989 Lom\u00e9 Convention bans exports from the European Union to the African, Caribbean and Pacific States parties, except if the importing country has adequate facilities. Another approach has been to allow hazardous waste transfers, subject to protective requirements like notification, informed consent, manifesting and facility adequacy. This has been the approach of the most comprehensive of these treaties, the 1989 Basel Convention on the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal. 48 United Nations Human Rights Council 2014. 49 United Nations Human Rights Council 2017. 50 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 2011. 51 The text in this subsection was contributed by Angela Kariuki, International Environmental Law Unit, UN Environment. 52 Louka 1994. 53 United Nations 2013.

Water quality International and regional treaties governing water quality include treaties covering marine pollution and pollution of freshwater resources. Examples of treaties on marine water quality include the 1974 Paris Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Land-Based Sources (applicable to parts of the North Atlantic, Arctic Ocean and North Sea), the 1972 Oslo Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft and the 1973 London International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) and its 1978 Protocol.

Other treaties cover international watercourses and water bodies, groundwater, and multi-state and regional waters in Africa, the Americas, Europe and the Middle East. For example, the 1978 United States-Canada Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement could be applied to mining in one country which causes pollution in the other. Nature preservation The Convention on Wetlands of International Importance Especially as Waterfowl Habitat (Ramsar) (1971) provides the framework for international cooperation in the conservation and wise use of wetland biomes. Parties are obliged to list and protect at least one Wetland Site of International Importance in their countries, include wetland conservation within national land-use planning, and promote the wise use of wetlands. The Bonn Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) (1979) aims to conserve avian, marine and terrestrial migratory species. It provides a framework within which parties may act to conserve migratory species and their habitats. Parties can adopt strict protection measures for those migratory species in danger of extinction, develop agreements for the conservation and management of migratory species that have an unfavourable conservation status, and undertake joint research and monitoring. UNESCO\u2019s Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage (World Heritage Convention) (1972) defines the kinds of natural and cultural sites that can be considered for inclusion in the World Heritage List. It also sets out the duties of states in identifying potential sites, and their role in protecting and preserving these sites. Mining and petroleum developments should be aware of any existing or potential World Heritage Sites in the vicinity, and take steps to protect them from any adverse environmental impacts that arise from development activities. The International Nature Conservancy Union (IUCD), an international nature conservation NGO, has agreed with ICMM, the mining industry\u2019s peak body, on a number of \u201cno-go\u201d World Heritage sites.54 There are also similar regional treaties for the Americas, Africa, Europe and Asia. These include the 1985 ASEAN Agreement on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. Biodiversity The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) has three main goals: the conservation of biodiversity; the sustainable use of the components of biodiversity; and sharing the benefits that arise from the commercial and other use of genetic resources in a fair and equitable way. The preservation provisions of the CBD have the most immediate relevance to extractive operations, particularly mining. Air pollution and climate change Air pollution from extractive operations, particularly mining, smelting and related operations is still regulated chiefly by national laws. However, there are several international air laws that have potential implications for the future of the extractive industry. A growing body of regional treaties governs transboundary air pollution. The 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP), with its four protocols setting specific emissions limitations on sulphur dioxide (1985, 1994), nitrogen oxides (1988, 1998) and volatile organic compounds (1991), provides very substantive restrictions on some of the basic mineral beneficiation pollutants in northern hemisphere countries (e.g. Canada, the MANAGING MINING FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 48 Russian Federation, the United States and countries of the European Union). Two notable global treaty regimes \u2013 governing ozone and climate change \u2013 have long-term implications for the extractive industry. The 1985 Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, as amended by its 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (Montreal Ozone Protocol) and other subsequent adjustments and amendments, requires a rapid phase-out of use and emissions of stratospheric ozone-depleting chemicals, chiefly chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halons and carbon tetrachloride, of relevance to some extractive endeavours. Even more significantly, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol provide the foundation for intergovernmental efforts to address the problem of potentially irreversible climate change resulting from rising concentrations of greenhouse gases in the earth\u2019s atmosphere. 4.4 Voluntary standards Increasingly, the mining industry has come under the spotlight of international media and civil society criticism, and experienced increased conflicts and opposition from local communities. In 2002, the mining industry commissioned a major report critically examining the industry\u2019s performance related to wide-ranging issues in sustainable development and identifying ways to improve performance.55 The report gave rise to many industry initiatives promoting responsible mining.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01c65833-a123-4f1e-a408-77272447ba27": {"__data__": {"id_": "01c65833-a123-4f1e-a408-77272447ba27", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Managing mining for sustainable development - A Sourcebook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f9b3a6d537c6171d8a671734541887ebd808993d17c99be47de13ec499ef1836"}, "2": {"node_id": "45cde37d-a5ea-411c-b34e-8c85332d21fe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c8c05aa77605512a3e7590770437a2438406b74f896294f4659e50c14f14883f"}}, "hash": "a1d2ddb8751606670ccea60fa402948a8678f625f08c3394b4b4252362dc9589", "text": "Several of these initiatives included standards on environmental and social performance of mining (See Box 8).

The promise of assurance, combined with the need to meet the expectations of their stakeholders \u2013 buyers, shareholders or the general public \u2013 provide incentives for mining companies to implement the standards. Some standards also have participatory governance arrangements, involving environmental and human rights stakeholders in their governing or advisory bodies. Without independent oversight through such governance arrangements, the legitimacy of standards can be questionable. In addition to the mining industry, financial institutions and banks have also developed standards which are used as conditions for getting financing. However, the increasing proliferation of such standards with varying metrics, governance systems of standard-setting bodies, and assurance processes can reduce their usefulness by making it difficult for non-industry practitioners to understand them. A study found that 10 out of 15 such standards or certification schemes covered workers\u2019 health and safety, 9 standards covered indigenous peoples and community development, 11 covered human rights, 10 covered waste management, and 5 covered water management.59 Therefore, if a mining company is certified by a particular standard, this does not guarantee that this company conducts its business in a socially and environmentally responsible manner, although it is more likely to do so. In recent years, the China Chamber of Commerce of Metals, Minerals and Chemicals Importers and Exporters (CCCMC), with over 6,000 member companies in mining and downstream industries, has adopted guidelines to improve environmental and social responsibility in the industry. Given the rapid increase in outbound investment by Chinese companies, such guidelines were much needed.

Even the best standards are not a substitute for binding legal provisions. Nevertheless, given the evolving nature of environmental and social laws and regulations in developing countries and the capacity constraints of government institutions, the existence of such standards is an important contribution to mitigating the environmental and social impacts of mining. The role of governments with respect to voluntary industry standards could include: staying abreast of such standards and the adherence of companies to these standards. 4.5 Customary rules Customary rules61 related to land tenure are particularly relevant to mining, and can be considered as another important part of the normative framework for mining. In many developing countries, as well as in territories of countries populated by indigenous peoples, customary rules are used in regulating land tenure. In contrast to statutory land tenure systems, which are codified in the law, customary land tenure systems are regulated through unwritten rules and practices used by local communities which are shaped by cultural and historical relationships of the people with the land. These rules define the ownership, use, management and transfer of land. Common lands such as forests and pastures have been historically governed by customary tenure rules. Forests and pastures span large areas and, in some countries, large numbers of people depend on these lands. For instance, forests account for half or more of the total area of countries such as Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia and Myanmar.62 In Indonesia, it is estimated that about 50 million people live in forest areas and another 20 million live in nearby villages, depending on forest resources.63 Pastures account for 71 percent of agricultural land in Asia and Australia.64 In many countries, customary tenure systems have been overridden by statutory tenure systems. Laws consider such common lands as land \u201cin the public domain\u201d, belonging to the state. In many countries, governments do not recognize customary land tenure and even in countries where such land tenure is recognized, land rights based on such tenure systems are insecure. The insecurity of land rights defined by customary rules comes to the fore when companies discover the economic potential of mining, oil, gas, logging and agriculture in these lands and seek legal rights to exploit these resources \u2013 through licences, permits and concessions from governments. Worldwide liberalization of mining laws in the 1980s and 1990s, followed by the mineral and oil \u2018supercycle\u2019 \u2013 the unprecedented rise in prices of minerals and oil in the 2000s \u2013 led to increased mineral and oil exploration and extraction in areas less explored until recently, which intensified pressure on indigenous territories and common lands. In many countries, governments issue licences and concessions for resource exploration and exploitation, but fail to recognize and to take effective action to protect land rights of indigenous peoples and other peoples dependent on these lands. Indonesia is a stark example of this trend: as of 2008, there were 71 million hectares of forest lands under timber and oil concessions, as opposed to 0.23 million hectares of forest lands designated for and owned by communities and indigenous groups.65 There is overwhelming evidence that the lack of regard for the rights of peoples inhabiting common and indigenous lands on the one hand, and the disproportionate power of mining, oil, gas, 60 China, Chamber of Commerce of Metals, Minerals and Chemical Importers and Exporters (CCCMC) 2014. 61 Customary rules are rules derived from consistent practice and have thus become the norm. 62 Quizon 2013. 63 2004 estimates.

Governments can and should make use of international normative instruments which provide guidance. The two sets of normative instruments below provide general guidance on protecting rights, while the third provides specific guidance with respect to land tenure. International human rights law provides protections for the rights of indigenous peoples and peoples dependent on lands. The ILO Convention 169 (1989)69 was the first legal instrument which substantiated and reinforced the rights of indigenous peoples. Moreover, it is legally binding on the states that ratified it. However, to date, no countries in Asia have ratified this convention. The adoption of the Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)70 by the UN General Assembly in 2007 was significant \u2013 most countries have ratified the UNDRIP. As its name implies, UNDRIP is non-binding, but it refers to rights specified in human rights covenants, which are binding. The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, supported by some of the world\u2019s largest mining companies, provides a clear framework and a guide on what governments and businesses should do to protect, respect and remedy human rights (See Box 7). A key normative instrument focused on tenure of land is the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure endorsed by the Committee on World Food Security. The Voluntary Guidelines state that \u201cStates should provide appropriate recognition and protection of the legitimate tenure rights of indigenous peoples and other communities with customary tenure systems\u201d.71 The Guidelines recommend that States should hold \u201cgood faith\u201d consultations with indigenous peoples before initiating any resource project and promoting their effective participation in decisions regarding their tenure systems. The Guidelines also provide recommendations for strengthening land tenure systems, such as legal recognition and allocation of tenure rights in a way that is consistent with the obligations and voluntary commitments of countries under international laws and instruments, providing systems to record individual and collective tenure rights, and determining conditions for responsible investments.72 MANAGING MINING FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 52 73 Adam, Owen, and Kemp 2015. 74 Ibid. 75 Vivoda, Owen, and Kemp 2017. 76 Quizon 2013. 77 Ibid. 78 Minority Rights Group International 2012. 79 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) 2015. 80 Kasimbari 2017. 81 Rumler 2011. communities and indigenous peoples can give rise to litigations against these governments and the costly settlement of claims (See Section 4.3.1 on investment treaties). The most direct and devastating impacts of mining projects on people are physical and economic displacement. Despite making statements to improve the livelihoods of resettled people, many mining companies focus their resettlement measures merely on building housing and, in some cases, physical infrastructure. Most companies fail to take measures to rebuild livelihoods during the post- relocation phase.73 Civil society has documented the overwhelming negative impacts of mining-induced resettlement, including impoverishment and the loss of social support networks.74 At the same time, national legislation is often inadequate or is simply missing the key elements required to address the impacts of resettlement.75 Safeguarding the rights of indigenous peoples and other peoples over communal lands \u2013 such as forests and pastures \u2013 is important for improving food security, preventing poverty and the sustainable management of these lands.

In Papua New Guinea, the Constitution recognizes the property rights of forest people over these forests.76 India\u2019s Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers Act 2006 recognizes the environmental and human rights of tribal people.77 The Philippines Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Rights Act (IPRA) 1997 recognizes ancestral lands of indigenous people and provides protections of their rights over these lands, and requires the state and concession holders to consult with indigenous people and to obtain free, prior and informed consent. 78 Land registers and cadastres are necessary for the protection of land rights of indigenous peoples and other peoples dependent on land. Without such records, even when the rights are recognized, they are not protected. For instance, even though in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic the constitution recognizes communal land use rights, and in Papua New Guinea forest people\u2019s rights are constitutionally recognized, due to the absence of land records, this recognition does not prevent the issuance of land and forest concessions that infringe on the rights of people dependent on these lands. The Philippines, however, has been conducting the process of recording and awarding indigenous land titles. By 2015, the Philippines National Commission on Indigenous Peoples issued 173 communal land titles covering an area of 4.5 million hectares and 257 individual land titles covering about 17,000 hectares to indigenous peoples.79 Systematic land registrations have also been done quite successfully in Chile, Ethiopia and Rwanda.80 The legal framework should also require obtaining consent to natural resource exploitation projects from indigenous peoples and other peoples dependent on land. However, there are not many examples of countries that set such requirements. One notable example is the Philippines. The Philippines Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Rights Act, as noted earlier, requires obtaining free, prior and informed consent. In Australia, the Native Title Act 1993 gives indigenous peoples the right to negotiate agreements, but not the right to give (or withhold) consent. The Northern Territory in Australia, however, provides stronger protections to indigenous peoples \u2013 the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976 has some provisions for indigenous peoples to give their consent for mining activities on their land. 81 ORIENTING LEGAL FRAMEWORKS TOWARDS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 53 RECOMMENDATIONS Orienting legal frameworks towards sustainable development Making domestic laws and regulations coherent with each other and sufficiently detailed to function as the core set of instruments for governing mining Improving coordination between government agencies and between national and subnational governments Considering moving from contract-based regimes to law-based regimes, avoiding using mining contracts to fill legal and regulatory gaps Considering establishing model agreements which provide the policy space for environmental and social laws of the country, and limiting terms that are open to negotiations Where mining contracts are made, paying special attention to provisions related to environmental impact mitigation, mine closure, resettlement, local content and employment Ensuring transparency of mining contracts, including disclosure of beneficial ownership Recognizing and progressively registering customary land rights to protect poor and marginalized rural communities and indigenous peoples.

India, Mongolia and the Philippines have adopted requirements for companies to consult with communities when conducting Environmental Impact Assessments. Out of 85 National Human Rights Institutions recognized under the Paris Principles, 31 were accredited to handle grievances, as of 2008. 55 The negative environmental and social impacts of mining are well recognized. Through environmental regulation, monitoring and enforcement, as well as coordinated action within the government and with mining companies, many environmental impacts can be mitigated. Increasingly, consulting with and involving communities in decisions on mining that affects their lives is recognized as critical for protecting the rights and livelihoods of these communities, as well as for the sustainable management of lands and natural resources. 5.1 Trends and approaches in environmental regulation of mining Until the 1970s, most countries did not have sound environmental regulation \u2013 they largely let companies work without requiring them to prevent or", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b799eb8-1be1-4ca6-acdf-c290443dddaa": {"__data__": {"id_": "0b799eb8-1be1-4ca6-acdf-c290443dddaa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Managing mining for sustainable development - A Sourcebook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9c4ff7e7be043449274af1a40976520f3022e575f612d28b5e77cdeb1ac4c617"}}, "hash": "9c4ff7e7be043449274af1a40976520f3022e575f612d28b5e77cdeb1ac4c617", "text": "clean up pollution. Undoubtedly, the world had made much progress since then. The paradigm has shifted from the \u2018pollutee suffers\u2019 to the \u2018polluter pays\u2019 principle.82 There is now consensus that polluters \u2013 rather than societies \u2013 need to bear the cost of pollution. Reflecting this consensus, environmental regulation has become more stringent around the world in the past decades.83 While there are tensions between the objectives of attracting investment into mining and protecting the environment, evidence shows that it is possible to have both strong environmental regulation and a favourable investment environment in mining. For instance, several Latin American countries \u2013 Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Peru \u2013 adopted competitive mining regimes aiming to attract investment into mining in the 1990s, and at the same time strengthened environmental provisions in their laws or constitutions.84 Mining investor surveys and other studies show that in countries with stable political and legal institutions, strict environmental regulations do not affect companies\u2019 decisions, although this may not be necessarily true for politically unstable countries.85 This finding is more applicable to multinational mining companies, which need to comply with environmental regulation in different jurisdictions \u2013 typically, more stringent regulation in developed countries \u2013 and thereby accumulate experience in meeting higher regulatory standards than is typically present in developing countries. However, mining companies from developing countries are more sensitive to environmental regulations.86 Apart from raising regulatory standards, more governments are experimenting with or using non- traditional approaches to environmental regulation, such as performance standards and economic instruments. Traditionally, governments have used prescriptive approaches to environmental regulation (also called technology standards), which specify concrete technologies to be used for mitigation of pollution. In contrast, performance-based regulation specifies targets for environmental performance. Whereas technology standards are more effective in industries with a high degree of technology standardization, performance-based regulatory standards work better in situations where technologies and environmental conditions differ significantly from one project to another. Under performance standards, the decision on how to mitigate pollution is left to companies, thus allowing space for technological innovation. For example, rather than specifying the angle of the slope for landforms made up of piled up waste rock, the government of Quebec, Canada, specifies a factor of stability for such landforms.87 Economic instruments are now widely used to influence the environmental performance of companies. These include taxes, fees and subsidies that incentivize companies to use better technologies to reduce pollution or improve resource efficiency. For example, in Mongolia, the government raised water-use fees sixfold in 2013, 82 For an illuminating discussion about these principles of environmental regulation in mining, see Warhust 1999. 83 S\u00f6derholm et al. 2014. 84 Bastida 2002. 85 S\u00f6derholm et al. 2014. 86 Ibid. 87 Jones 2011. MANAGING MINING FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 56 which resulted in a significant increase in the water recycling rate in mining operations. In Peru, the government set up a US$120 million fund to co-fund industrial technical innovation, including innovation in mining.88 Mine closure bonds89 have also been used to prompt companies to do proper mine closure, land reclamation and rehabilitation (See Section 5.5.2 on Financing mine closure). Under certain conditions, these non-traditional forms of regulation \u2013 performance standards and economic instruments \u2013 can incentivize companies to devise more innovative solutions and cleaner technologies in a more cost-effective manner, and to make use of innovative practices. In the past decade, the mining industry has made technological advances in managing water and waste metal toxicity, and developed good practices in mine closure, land rehabilitation and biodiversity protection (offsets).90 These non- traditional approaches can be beneficial for the competitiveness of mining companies and at the same time help achieve better environmental performance. However, these approaches to environmental regulation require high capacity and knowledge of regulatory agencies and mining operators. In countries where mining operators are relatively small and inexperienced, setting clear, unambiguous technology standards might achieve better outcomes. Another trend in regulation is the greater recognition of social impacts and enabling communities affected by mining to have a say in mining-related decisions and processes. The international human rights community, indigenous peoples and civil society organizations have led a movement revolving around the concept of free, prior and informed consent (FPIC), with large players in the mining industry increasingly coming on board. Developing country governments have been slow to accept community consultation and engagement; nevertheless, community consultation is now increasingly adopted as a rule in laws and regulations \u2013 particularly in environmental laws and regulations. 5.2 Environmental and social impact assessment A family of tools on environmental and social impact assessment is used for the mitigation and prevention of the environmental and social impacts of industrial activities", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "50313bd9-3308-4744-87ea-96a6212f6277": {"__data__": {"id_": "50313bd9-3308-4744-87ea-96a6212f6277", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Managing mining for sustainable development - A Sourcebook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6804eec0adad9ac6011a5b9ca76d0b337a7900855d29d6889daf0c213c88eaa6"}, "3": {"node_id": "a141d4c8-bffb-4550-864b-f0b500f290bc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d231490f95938a781569d626b58a7126606c9e5b3b3099fe1867bbbcfa726a41"}}, "hash": "cc48a5cfc18b892fc0dbc9e738d0ac3f91cf398fad9dfa4a2d5357419e5cafb8", "text": "\u2013 including mining. Environmental impact assessment (EIA) was initially developed in the United States in the 1970s, was later adopted by developed countries, and has now been adopted by most developing countries. The EIA is accompanied by the Environmental Management Plan (EMP). Since mining is considered one of the most polluting industries, the preparation of EIAs and EMPs (hereinafter \u201cEIAs/EMPs\u201d) is compulsory for mining projects in most countries.91 EIAs/EMPs serve to inform the mining company, the government, affiliated stakeholders and the public of the environmental consequences of implementing a mining project and identify mitigating actions. In its narrow form, EIAs are a project-based process. Their scope is thus limited to mining projects within the formal mining sector.92 This limitation of scope allows for the assessment to specify concrete actions to mitigate impacts, with clear accountability for implementing and financing those actions. Over time, EIAs have expanded in scope, both thematically and geographically. Greater recognition of social, human rights and gender impacts of mining prompted the development of specialized impact assessment tools. EIAs now increasingly include social impact assessment. Cumulative and strategic impact assessments are also carried out in regions and countries with extensive mining activity, for example, before opening an area for mining (See Box 10). 88 Masson, Walter, and Priester 2013. 89 Technically, mine closure bonds are not taxes. They are returned (relinquished) to companies upon satisfactory land reclamation and rehabilitation (See Section 5.5.2 on Financing mine closure). 90 Buxton 2012. 91 However, for mining exploration projects, some countries do not require EIA at all, or require a simplified EIA. 92 In the case of oil and gas, an EIA is done for a block of assets collectively. PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT AND PEOPLE 57 93 USAID, US EPA, INECE, and CACED 2011. 94 The EMP may be separate from the EIA report, or be part of it, depending on the legal requirements of the host country. Box 10 Environmental and social impact assessment tools EIA (Environmental Impact Assessment) as a process: An EIA provides the environmental baseline before the start of the project, evaluates the likely impact of the project, and proposes how impacts are to be monitored and how are they to be mitigated.93 A typical EIA report includes the following parts: a) description of the project, b) project alternatives, c) environmental baseline, d) identification and evaluation of likely impacts, e) monitoring plan; and f) environmental management plan (EMP).94 In a narrow sense, the EIA refers only to the immediate process of assessing environmental impacts of a project, which includes feasibility studies, baseline studies and impact studies. In a broad sense, EIA refers to the comprehensive process which consists of screening, general and detailed environmental impact assessment, public consultation, preparation of an EIA report, preparation of an Environmental Management Plan, and their review and approval by the government. EIA is often used as an umbrella term which covers the entire family of environmental and social impact assessments. EIA versus EIS (Environmental Impact Statement): In general, EIA is a process, while an EIS is a statement or a report documenting the EIA process. However, some jurisdictions may refer to the EIS as an \u201cEIA report\u201d. Other jurisdictions use the terms \u201cEIA\u201d and \u201cEIS\u201d interchangeably. To avoid confusion, the exact legal terms of the particular jurisdiction should be used. EMP (Environmental Management Plan): While EIA is an assessment of impacts, an EMP is a plan for mitigating these impacts. In some jurisdictions, an EMP is treated as part of the EIA report, while in others it is a separate document. For large mining projects, there can be several EMPs joined together in a \u201cmaster\u201d EMP, such as separate EMPs for mine camps, underground mines, waste water management and tailings management. Full EIA versus simplified EIA: In many jurisdictions, a simplified version of an EIA may be conducted before the mining exploration phase, followed by a full EIA before the mine development. Typically, small-scale mining projects can undergo simplified EIAs. For instance, the state of Queensland in Australia differentiates mining projects by scale of investment, land used, or ore extracted, while Canada differentiates them by the severity of potential environmental impact to determine whether projects require a simplified or a full-fledged EIA.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a141d4c8-bffb-4550-864b-f0b500f290bc": {"__data__": {"id_": "a141d4c8-bffb-4550-864b-f0b500f290bc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Managing mining for sustainable development - A Sourcebook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6804eec0adad9ac6011a5b9ca76d0b337a7900855d29d6889daf0c213c88eaa6"}, "2": {"node_id": "50313bd9-3308-4744-87ea-96a6212f6277", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cc48a5cfc18b892fc0dbc9e738d0ac3f91cf398fad9dfa4a2d5357419e5cafb8"}}, "hash": "d231490f95938a781569d626b58a7126606c9e5b3b3099fe1867bbbcfa726a41", "text": "Again, terminologies differ in various jurisdictions.

Gender impact assessment (GIA) is a subset of SIA or ESIA. MANAGING MINING FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 58 \u2022 HRIA (human rights impact assessment) is used for identifying, understanding, assessing and addressing the adverse effects of a mining project on the rights of impacted people such as workers and community members. HRIA is an emerging practice.95 Cumulative EIA: In contrast to EIA, cumulative EIA (also referred to CIA \u2013 Cumulative Impact Assessment, or CEA \u2013 Cumulative Environmental Assessment or Cumulative Effects Assessment) extends beyond an individual mining project. Cumulative EIA assesses the impacts of several mining projects on a given area. It is also suitable for assessing impacts of artisanal and small-scale mining. SEA (Strategic Environmental Assessment) and SESA (Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment): These assess impacts at the policy or programme level. In this regard, SEA allows considering alternatives over the long term and over a larger area \u2013 such as an entire region or a country or a sector. For example, SEA can be used in considering whether to open a particular region for mining projects, or in considering changes in mining royalties and the ensuing implications on mining activity. Figure 5 shows how these types of impact assessment differ from each other in terms of geographic area covered, and the scope of issues covered by the assessments. 95 G\u00f6tzmann 2014. FIGURE 5.

For example, such two-tiered systems are in place in Indonesia (Mining Law 2009), the Lao People\u2019s Democractic Republic (Environmental Protection Law 1999, and Regulations on the Process of ESIA of the Investment Projects and Activities 2012) and Mongolia (Environmental Impact Assessment Law 2012). 98 B2 mining projects that do not require public hearings include earth and sand mining on areas below 25 hectares. An EIA is conducted before any mining project activities are carried out on the ground. In some countries, an EIA must be approved (environmental permit issued) before a mining licence is issued, while in others, it is approved after the issue of the mining licence, but before carrying out earth works. Legislation should clearly specify the roles of various stakeholders with respect to EIAs. \u2022 Government authorities usually define the terms of reference for conducting an EIA. After an EIA is conducted, they are responsible for reviewing the EIA, and making a decision whether to clear the project, not clear the project, or clear the project only after modifications. They are also responsible for monitoring the impacts of the project and monitoring the implementation of the Environmental Management Plans. \u2022 Mining companies (project proponents) are responsible for conducting or commissioning an EIA. Mining companies are better placed to do this because of their skills and the project information they have access to. \u2022 Independent experts or environmental services companies conduct the EIA in many jurisdictions. Since these experts or companies are usually paid by the project proponent to conduct the EIA, concern about conflicts of interest exist. This concern can be addressed by a strong system of accreditation of experts or environmental service companies, on the basis of their technical capacity and ethical conduct. \u2022 Individuals and communities affected by mining, and civil society organizations supporting them should play key roles in EIA and ESIA processes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dcf7f848-968b-47af-b11e-2155b2aaebc9": {"__data__": {"id_": "dcf7f848-968b-47af-b11e-2155b2aaebc9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Managing mining for sustainable development - A Sourcebook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "38a179a506cffff0679f4191c10af1adda8add9c168f072def6367e0bc95f551"}, "2": {"node_id": "5f585354-eff8-4285-aa38-5bb5dff6aa5f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "56b1c5736cd705ab6859d6e1cb5f3d03d1a8731227ec2ae7c74af994abe394f0"}}, "hash": "d05ded25d5d57afd8f36e38a22462336e8d3580248d40590b15556d808316b9c", "text": "A growing number of countries require affected individuals and communities to be consulted with during the EIA process.

The EIA provides the environmental baseline before the start of the project, evaluates the likely impact of the project, and proposes how impacts are to be monitored, and how are they to be mitigated.96 In Asia and the Pacific, most countries have adopted requirements for conducting EIAs and preparing EMPs before the start of mining exploration and extraction projects.97 However, legal and regulatory frameworks are still evolving in most developing countries in the region, while the implementation and enforcement of environmental regulations lag behind laws. More countries are adopting laws and regulations that require mining companies to consult with local communities to be affected by mining. The entry points for local community consultation are often through the EIA process. For example, in India, the 2006 revision of the EIA Notification made public hearings mandatory for all category A (large-scale projects) and B1 projects (smaller-scale projects),98 consisting of on-site public hearings, additional consultations and written concerns. Public hearings, where the public can express and record their grievances, are conducted by the government, rather than the mining companies. In the Philippines, the EIA regulation consists of the Presidential decree (1978) and implementing rules and regulations which have revised the regulation several times. The latest revision, through the Administrative Order No. 2003-30 on EIA, provides for public consultation at the scoping stage of the EIA, and provides guidelines for conducting these consultations. In Mongolia, the Law on EIA was overhauled in 2012. Major changes to EIA procedures included requirements to consult with local residents affected by the project, to develop an Environmental Management Plan (EMP), and to report on EMP implementation to local communities and governments. MANAGING MINING FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 60 5.3 Environmental monitoring and auditing Environmental monitoring is conducted by both governments and mining companies. Mining companies conduct environmental monitoring by tracking environmental and social indicators in accordance with the environmental monitoring plan, which is usually part of the environmental management plan (EMP). Environmental monitoring at a project level acts as an early warning system, informs company management, and serves as the basis for environmental auditing, inspection and enforcement. Governments conduct environmental monitoring through inspections to verify whether mining companies are implementing the actions they committed to in their environmental management plans, and whether these actions are effective in mitigating environmental impacts. Governments usually rely on monitoring data and information provided by mining companies. The frequency of government inspections can be determined using a risk-based approach, whereby larger mines or mines with higher risk are inspected more frequently and in greater detail. In regulation based on technology standards, environmental monitoring focuses on ascertaining whether the required technologies are implemented, whereas in regulation based on performance standards or economic instruments, monitoring focuses on whether the required performance targets are achieved (See Section 5.1 on Trends and approaches in environmental regulation of mining). In developing countries, government capacities to monitor the environmental performance of mining are limited. Government agencies need more trained personnel and organizational capacity. Key government agencies, such as mining ministries and licensing authorities; environmental ministries and agencies; and local government also need to coordinate with and learn from each other, for example through joint site inspections. Many government authorities also need better capacity to interact with mining companies, affected communities and civil society organizations in the monitoring processes. Box 11 Strengthening monitoring and enforcement in mining in Lao PDR and Myanmar99 The UNDP-UNEP Poverty-Environment Initiative (PEI) supported the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic to create and manage an investment compliance database that seeks to improve monitoring of the compliance of investors with environmental and social safeguards and other requirements. The National Investment Compliance Database covers concessions for agricultural activities, mining and electricity and captures essential data pertaining to licensing, taxes, duties, MoUs, concession agreement information, data on environmental and social obligations and other related information crucial to the management and monitoring of the quality of investments. Much of the data stem from information obtained during the initial investment approving procedures. In Myanmar, the UNDP-UNEP PEI supported the capacity of the Directorate of Investment and Company Administration (DICA) to promote quality investment in natural resources. It conducted a legal review of 23 national laws, their associated regulations and procedures, as well as 5 national policies relevant to the mining sector, identifying overlapping and contradictory measures. The review also supported DICA and other government departments with mandates for environmental or social management to identify priority sites to better monitor", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2fd8194d-569b-434b-8922-deaa2c84c8d7": {"__data__": {"id_": "2fd8194d-569b-434b-8922-deaa2c84c8d7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Managing mining for sustainable development - A Sourcebook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fefa14890db5b1020e7e7400c2e84362db83a51813fdae8801d4daa7099f9e62"}, "3": {"node_id": "0f262b74-ae6d-42d8-abb1-39dbbbe43b83", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e6ded5778e417d7d4335d662540c075b9a7585d3e5ebe96805c5102e66bb3a27"}}, "hash": "9ce86171f1e38358b2e6719e7ce668ee203ebbabdcee8efaa981d3b5b87b01af", "text": "environmental and social impacts in a coordinated manner and to improve compliance. 99 The text in this box was contributed by Samara Yawnghwe, PEI Myanmar and Chitlatda Keomuongchanh, PEI Lao PDR, and is complemented by the UNDP-UNEP Poverty Environment Initiative (2015), \u201cAsia-Pacific PEI Internal Review\u201d. PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT AND PEOPLE 61 Communities and civil society groups have several paths available to influence environmental regulation in mining: \u2022 Participating in environmental monitoring \u2022 Demanding public access to documents such as EIAs and EMPs \u2022 Providing relevant information and findings and making requests to elected representatives or relevant government agencies \u2022 In cases of significant violations, publicizing them to leverage public opinion, raising grievances through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, or litigating against the mining company or the government.100 Environmental auditing is conducted to provide in-depth information on environmental performance and compliance against established standards, impact mitigation plans, and potential environmental liabilities. Environmental audits do not replace environmental monitoring. They include internal audits and external audits. Internal audits are also called first party audits, as they are carried out or commissioned by the mining company. External audits include second party audits, carried out or commissioned by the government, lender or investor, and third party audits, carried out by an independent party.101 In addition to project-specific audits, environmental audits can also be industry-wide or regional. Such audits of broader scope are conducted or commissioned by the government, particularly audit agencies. For instance, in 2013, the Audit Office of Queensland, Australia conducted an audit of the resources sector (mining, oil and gas) in the state, to see \u201cwhether monitoring, supervision and enforcement of environmental conditions for resource and waste management activities is effective and protects the [Queensland] state from liability for rehabilitation and the environment from harm\u201d.102 Governments can support the involvement of civil society organizations by requiring mining companies to provide access to mining contracts, EIAs, EMPs and environmental monitoring information; requiring third party verification of and participation in environmental monitoring; and helping develop the capacity of civil society organizations. 5.4 Community consultation, engagement and protection While the entry points for community consultation and engagement in mining projects are opening in some countries through their EIA laws and regulations, community engagement is much broader than the EIA process \u2013 it is done not only for the sake of impact assessment. Engaging communities is important in its own right. It also helps to balance economic development considerations with social and environmental considerations, leading to decisions that are more sustainable and viable politically and socially.103 Reflecting a shared understanding of the international community about the importance of citizens\u2019 engagement for environmental sustainability, Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration 1992 states that \u201cEnvironmental issues are best handled with participation of all concerned citizens, at the relevant level\u201d.104 The Intergovernmental Forum on Mining, Minerals, Metals and Sustainable Development, in its Mining Policy Framework, recommends to its member states \u201cmaking consultation with affected stakeholders a requirement of the permitting process and at every stage of the mining cycle\u201d.105 In making decisions about mining projects that affect the lives of people in local communities, governments and mining companies should engage them. The engagement should start before exploration and continue throughout all phases in the life of the mining project. 100 Litigation can be done by civil society if laws enable representational litigation on behalf of the person suffering the damage. 101 United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), n.d. 102 Queensland Audit Office, Australia 2013. 103 Buxton and Wilson 2013. 104 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) 1992. 105 Intergovernmental Forum on Mining, Minerals 2013.

In 2011, the UN adopted its Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which provided a framework for protecting, respecting human rights and remedying rights violations and infringements (See Box 7). The OECD strengthened human rights standards by updating its Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises in 2011 \u2013 and since most multinational enterprises are domiciled in OECD countries, these guidelines potentially have far-reaching implications. In 2012, the IFC, the private sector lending arm of the World Bank Group, included the principle of free, prior and informed consent in its \u201cPerformance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability\u201d (revised from its 2006 version), which became a standard and a reference for banks and lending institutions. In 2013, the international mining association \u2013 the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) \u2013 updated its Position Statement on Indigenous Peoples and Mining which requires its members to work towards FPIC and to respect human rights. While the right to free, prior and informed consent focuses on indigenous and tribal peoples, it is also broadly applicable to other \u2018land-connected peoples\u2019, such as traditional and local communities that live in or adjacent to areas where development projects are located.107 This broader applicability of the right to free, prior and informed consent is particularly relevant for affected communities in countries which do not recognize indigenous peoples in their laws, countries that have not been colonized, or countries that do not differentiate between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples. Obtaining free, prior and informed consent is not limited to obtaining one-time consent before a decision to start a mining project. According to the World Commission on Dams, FPIC \u201cinvolves a continuous, iterative process of communication and negotiation spanning the entire planning and project cycles\u201d.108 In its report, IIED also argues that companies can build trust and respond to local issues by implementing the \u201cspirit of FPIC\u201d \u2013 by engaging communities throughout the life of the project and across the value chain.109 Guidelines for mining companies issued by the OECD and the Australian government recommend continuous engagement of communities through the life of a mining project.110 Another issue is whether obtaining free, prior and informed consent from a community can result in a veto over a project that affects the community. Over the past years, the mining industry \u2013 particularly the most visible multinational companies \u2013 is gradually accepting the concept of \u2018consent\u2019 which implies the possibility of refusal by local communities to give consent. In practice, instances when a community\u2019s refusal to give consent resulted in stopping of a project are rare. Despite increased acceptance and understanding of the concept of free, prior and informed consent in the mining industry, the implementation of 106 United Nations 2007. 107 Buxton and Wilson 2013. According to the Forest Stewardship Council, the definition was further broadened to include pastoralists that may not be physically close to the area, but depend on the area\u2019s natural resources seasonally or in times of hardship. 108 World Commission on Dams (WCD) 2000, quoted in Buxton and Wilson 2013. 109 Buxton and Wilson 2013. 110 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 2017; Australia, Government of. 2016a. PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT AND PEOPLE 63 this concept \u2013 and engagement of communities consistent with the \u201cspirit of FPIC\u201d \u2013 has been limited.111 Within the mining industry, it is mostly large multinational mining companies \u2013 mining \u2018majors\u2019 \u2013 that have accepted the concept of FPIC,112 while most mining \u2018juniors\u2019 and the rest of the industry are yet to come on board. Many multinational mining companies have instituted community relations departments and created jobs for professionals to perform community relations functions. However, mining companies\u2019 community engagement processes often remain inadequate even in some of the most visible multinational mining companies. Within mining companies, community relations departments do not closely collaborate with the core engineering departments and often have limited influence on company decisions. And some mining companies tend to view community engagement as a tool for managing their business risks and the risk of conflict with the community rather than for managing risks to communities, or contributing towards the social and economic development of the communities.113, 114 111 Buxton and Wilson 2013. 112 Ibid. 113 Kemp 2009. 114 Owen and Kemp 2013.

Nevertheless, local communities have greater leverage and a stronger negotiating position at specific points during the life of a mine \u2013 where laws and regulations provide for the engagement and consent of local communities (such as during community consultation during ESIA), and at points when a mining company has not yet made substantial investments and has not obtained mining and environmental permits. Community engagement is also critical during planning for mine closure and during the mine closure itself (See Section 5.5 on Managing mine closure). The modes of engagement range from information- sharing to consultation and collaboration (See Box 12).

Paradoxically, local communities and even local governments may experience opposing problems in accessing information: too little relevant information on the one hand, and too much irrelevant (or unprocessed) information on the other hand. Aggregate data such as nationwide mineral reserves and production may have little relevance to local communities and may even contribute to unreasonable expectations and subsequent alienation from the mining industry. Thick financial and environmental reports are not very useful for local communities unless important pieces of information are extracted and presented in accessible form.116 Necessary information at the local level may include: \u2022 Information on licences sought and allocated in the territory of the local community \u2022 Plans for land use after mine closure \u2022 Mining plans and technologies to be used \u2022 Expected impacts on the environment and people \u2022 Plans for resettlement and compensation \u2022 Mining agreements (such as investor-state agreements and community development agreements) \u2022 Beneficial ownership of the mining company (who controls the company) \u2022 Fiscal revenues that the national and local governments collect from the company \u2022 Plans for buying goods and services and employing people by the company.117 \u2022 In addition, local communities will often benefit from training on financial and environmental literacy, and basic information about mining processes and lifecycles, as well as participatory methods and negotiation techniques.118 While it is important for the mining industry to engage local communities and indigenous peoples, it is the responsibility of governments to protect and ensure the realization of internationally recognized human rights. Towards this end, governments should: \u2022 Ensure domestic laws and regulations are consistent with international human rights obligations \u2022 Ensure policy coherence and coherence in actions taken by mining and environmental ministries, human rights commissions and other government ministries and agencies that have implications on engagement of local communities in mining-related decisions \u2022 Enhance access to mining-related information that is important and relevant to local communities and foster a culture of transparency in the government and in the mining industry \u2022 Open legal avenues for local communities and indigenous peoples affected by mining to have a say in mining projects, particularly during the mining and environmental", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "902117e3-b789-4643-9bca-b38d72f66ecb": {"__data__": {"id_": "902117e3-b789-4643-9bca-b38d72f66ecb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Managing mining for sustainable development - A Sourcebook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b39ac63381c97902cc8d08c62495aae42330526edd63b4bec59a391efba5bfad"}, "3": {"node_id": "bccea102-c1cb-4675-8382-3152e6c9cabf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "11799cdf5a6f79d271eac098fedeb9769848e196dd0ba952eb2e10e86eefdd03"}}, "hash": "5983296a4d07a29cd7703806e8591d7ab47071aeeaa008baac3666dca50d3bc9", "text": "permitting process and in preparation for mine closure \u2022 Define minimum procedures for adequate consultation and consent \u2022 Invest in the capacity of communities affected by mining.

Both states and businesses have the duty to address and, where found necessary, to redress grievances. Without access to effective remedy, the state\u2019s duty to protect and the businesses\u2019 duty to respect human rights will not be realized.120 There are four types of grievance mechanisms to provide remedies for affected persons: 1) judicial mechanisms; 2) state non-judicial grievance mechanisms; 3) company-based grievance mechanisms; and 4) third party grievance mechanisms. Judicial mechanisms, while fundamental for addressing and redressing grievances, often have weaknesses in addressing specialized cases such as those related to mining, environment and human rights. Moreover, laws and regulations might not be coherent enough to provide the basis to make a claim. Alternative (non-judicial) dispute resolution mechanisms have become increasingly used in the past decade. For instance, public ombudspersons operate in 120 countries.121 The increased popularity and use of ombudspersons is prompted by the limited ability of judiciary bodies to address more complex issues that fall outside the confines of the law, as well as the high cost of using judicial processes.122 The Philippines government established the Office of the Environmental Ombudsman to address specialized environmental cases. National Human Rights Commissions (NHRCs) are important institutions which can address human rights-related grievances. In 2008, out of 85 recognized NHRCs, 40 were able to handle grievances, of which 31 were accredited under the Paris Principles.123 Company-based grievance mechanisms are often the only remedy accessible in rural and remote areas with mining. Recognizing this, in recent years the mining industry has developed guidelines for mining companies on handling grievances.124 In practice, there is greater availability of company- based grievance mechanisms in the mining industry, but their effectiveness needs improvement.125 In addition, financial institutions such as the IFC have also set up grievance mechanisms. Taken together, however, grievance mechanisms in many countries are fragmented and may not provide an effective avenue for redress. The report of the United Nations Special Representative on Business and Human Rights sets out principles for designing grievance mechanisms.126 120 United Nations Human Rights Council 2008. 121 French and Kirkham 2009. 122 Ibid. 123 United Nations Human Rights Council 2008.

Although mine closure is the last phase in the life of a mine (See Section 3.4 on Mine closure phase), it requires planning and preparation from the very beginning of the mine life. In practice, however, mine closure is often inadequate. Many of these cases are a legacy of a time of loose or non-existent environmental regulations when companies could close their mines without carrying out proper mine reclamation and land rehabilitation. In many cases, substandard mine closure occurs due to environmental incidents, social conflicts, or decline in market prices for minerals causing the mining company to temporarily close the mine or sell it to another operator.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bccea102-c1cb-4675-8382-3152e6c9cabf": {"__data__": {"id_": "bccea102-c1cb-4675-8382-3152e6c9cabf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Managing mining for sustainable development - A Sourcebook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b39ac63381c97902cc8d08c62495aae42330526edd63b4bec59a391efba5bfad"}, "2": {"node_id": "902117e3-b789-4643-9bca-b38d72f66ecb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5983296a4d07a29cd7703806e8591d7ab47071aeeaa008baac3666dca50d3bc9"}}, "hash": "11799cdf5a6f79d271eac098fedeb9769848e196dd0ba952eb2e10e86eefdd03", "text": "As a result, some mining regions are peppered with orphaned and abandoned mines, with a lasting legacy on the environment and surrounding communities and a significant drain on public resources.

Mine reclamation is the process of backfilling the void created by extraction, while mine rehabilitation is the process of revegetation and restoration of fauna on the site. While governments and communities often Box 13 Good practices in mine rehabilitation One of the good practices in rehabilitation of open-pit mines of coal and placer gold mining is progressive rehabilitation, where mining companies rehabilitate \u201cas they go\u201d \u2013 backfilling and revegetation as some mine areas are exhausted and mining works move to other areas. Progressive rehabilitation, as opposed to rehabilitation after the entire mine is mined out, is advantageous due to two reasons. First, progressive rehabilitation shortens the duration of time to stockpile the topsoil, thus reducing the loss of native seeds embedded in the topsoil and increasing the chances of success of revegetation.135, 136 Second, progressive rehabilitation allows spreading out costs more evenly over time and thus reduces the risk that rehabilitation may not be carried out at all, or might not be carried out adequately. Another good practice is the determination of indicators of success of mine rehabilitation. These indicators typically include indicators of physical and chemical stability, as well as ecosystem indicators such as species composition, plant cover, degree of self-regeneration by plants, the extent of colonization by alien species of plants or animals, and the quality of run-off water.137 Relinquishment of the mine site from the mining operator needs to be based on such objective and measurable criteria. To enable environmental regulators to assess the quality of land rehabilitation, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) of Australia has developed a monitoring tool which allows comparing the condition of the ecosystem in a rehabilitated site with that in similar sites.138 MANAGING MINING FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 68 134 International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) and World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) 2002. expect mine sites to be restored to their original state, these expectations usually cannot be achieved on a sustained basis or in a cost-effective manner. For example, even if native biota (animal and plant life) and ecosystems are restored upon mine closure, their evolution on a disturbed site is not predictable and their sustainability cannot be guaranteed. For large open-pit mines, backfilling the void might not be feasible, as it might be prohibitively costly. It might not also make sense from an environmental point of view, since the amount of fuel and energy required, and emissions released from such an undertaking would outweigh the environmental benefits of closing the pit. Alternative, and perhaps more realistic, objectives of mine closure range from establishing stable landforms with functioning ecosystems and at least some of the native biota, or bringing the site to a point where it can be used for alternative uses and establishing non-native biota and ecosystems that are necessary for these uses.132 For instance, in Australia, several states require rehabilitation until a mine site is \u201csafe, stable, non- polluting and enable[s] a sustainable new land use\u201d.133 The predominant concern in mine closure has traditionally been with environmental aspects of mining. Since mining often takes place in peripheral, less developed regions and locations, the socio- economic impact of mine closure can be dramatic for host communities. Therefore, mining companies and governments need to see, plan and manage mine closure in a more holistic way, which not only mitigates the environmental impacts, but also addresses socio-economic issues, such as the re-employment of mine workers and development of alternative economic activities in the area to prepare for mine closure. In recent years, the mining industry has paid increased attention to the socio-economic aspects of mine closure, such as planning for the unemployment of workers after mine closure, reduced work for local businesses, decline in government revenues and reduced use of infrastructure.134 While mining companies have direct responsibility for addressing environmental, health and safety issues, governments are usually expected to assume more responsibility for addressing long-term socio- economic development issues beyond the life of a mine (See Figure 7).

The mitigation hierarchy, recommended for regulators and project developers, envisages four sequential steps in ensuring no net loss of biodiversity: avoid impact on biodiversity, minimize impact, rehabilitate and restore biodiversity, and offset biodiversity by restoring it on a different site. A key idea of the mitigation hierarchy is that a project proponent should only consider the subsequent step if the earlier step is not possible. Within the mitigation hierarchy, biodiversity offset is the \u201clast resort\u201d step. It is defined as \u201cmeasurable conservation outcomes of actions designed to compensate for significant residual adverse biodiversity impacts arising from project development after appropriate prevention and mitigation measures have been taken\u201d.140 The mitigation hierarchy is particularly relevant for mining projects. However, biodiversity offsets are considered controversial by some conservation organizations because they may allow regulators to give a \u201cgreen light\u201d to projects with severe impacts on biodiversity.141 They also appear to be less preferred when juxtaposed with rehabilitation of the mine site itself (in situ rehabilitation).142 Biodiversity offsets may also not be preferred from the social perspective, as they do not consider the issues of land tenure \u2013 who owns or uses which land. For instance, while land belonging to one community may be mined, the company may do an offset in another land which belongs to a different community.

At the exploration phase, companies gather preliminary baseline data and discuss with communities about their expectations and possible options for land use after the mine closure. A preliminary closure plan is made. At the mine development phase, mine planning and design is done considering environmental and social considerations to minimize the negative impacts after the mine closure. Mine construction should be done considering future land uses and to maximize the potential for mine reclamation and rehabilitation. During this phase, regulators require mining companies to submit mine closure plans as part of the Environmental Management Plan, which articulates the end goal of rehabilitation, and to pay financial assurance to finance the mine closure (See below in Section 5.5.2 on Financing mine closure). At the operation phase, companies develop detailed mine closure plans on the basis of detailed baseline data, and already start implementing mine closure steps, such as soil management and placement in an optimal way that is conducive to mine reclamation. Where possible, they should conduct progressive reclamation and rehabilitation. Since reclamation and rehabilitation vary from site to site, mining companies also try out options in a small area to see what methods suit best.

The impacts of AMD are long term, spanning several generations. This means that accountability and responsibility for managing the long-term effects of AMD should be clarified and assigned well in advance of mine closure. Community engagement is important throughout all the phases of a mining project and should be done regardless of whether community members have legal, statutory rights over the land where the mine site is located. 5.5.2 Financing mine closure Mining companies incur major costs at mine closure phase, at a time when financial inflows from the mine dry up. This is the main reason why many mining companies abandon mines or do not conduct mine reclamation and rehabilitation adequately, particularly in countries with weak environmental regulation. Moreover, most mines close for reasons other than the depletion of the mineral deposit: economic, financial, social and political reasons. A study of 1,000 closed mines shows that only 25 percent closed upon exhausting the mineral deposit.144 The costs for the public can be staggering. For instance, in Queensland, Australia, the cost of rehabilitating 15,000 abandoned mines in that state alone is estimated at AU$1 billion.145 To reduce the risk of mine abandonment, most governments nowadays require environmental financial assurance (EFA) from mining companies, a deposit payment before commencing mining operations which would be used for mine reclamation and rehabilitation should the company default on its obligations. Environmental financial assurance goes by different names in different jurisdictions, such as \u2018environmental bond\u2019, \u2018surety\u2019, or \u2018guarantee\u2019. According to surveys of large mining companies conducted by ICMM, between 1998 and 2004, a number of jurisdictions have strengthened their legislation on mine closure during this period, namely, Botswana, Canada (Yukon), Chile, Ghana, India, Peru, South Africa, Sweden and the United States.146 The amount of EFA should be determined on the basis of the mine closure plan, specifically based on scientific and engineering considerations, rather than negotiations. The amount is then regularly updated as the mine progresses and the mine closure plan becomes more and more clearly defined.147 In practice, some jurisdictions set EFA amounts significantly lower than costs needed for reclamation and rehabilitation (Ghana, South Africa and Quebec, Canada), while others set them significantly higher than deemed necessary (New South Wales, Australia; Ontario, Canada; Nevada, USA).148 In Australia, the government of the state of New South Wales commissioned a tool to estimate rehabilitation costs, on the basis of which the amount of EFA can be determined.149 Arguably, the tool enables the government to arrive at estimates that are more objective, and less dependent on mining companies\u2019 estimates. In Western Australia, the government recently renewed regulations to pool mining operators in the same area and create a common fund for funding the rehabilitation of abandoned mines.150 EFAs should not be used for purposes other than mine closure. To ensure that an EFA is used for the purpose intended, the EFA should be treated separately from other revenue flows to the government and kept in separate accounts. Countries require different forms of EFA instruments, such as cash deposits into a separate account of the government treasury or in a separate bank account. In addition, there are more sophisticated forms of EFA, such as surety bonds, insurance policies, letters of credit, deeds and certificates of self-guarantee, but they are less secure and should only be used with major, creditworthy mining companies; they also require greater capacity from the government authority to ensure that the issuer of mine closure guarantee is creditworthy.151 144 L\u00e8bre and Corder 2015. 145 Queensland Audit Office, Australia 2013. 146 Miller 2005. 147 Nikiema 2015. 148 Miller 2005. 149 Australia, Government of. 2016b. 150 Dalaibuyan et al. 2016. 151 Ibid.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f4baac48-025b-4294-b5f3-235c8a9788f4": {"__data__": {"id_": "f4baac48-025b-4294-b5f3-235c8a9788f4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Managing mining for sustainable development - A Sourcebook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d55c535570ca8a6b75cc0bf471c141829281a50c29fcf382872039849f16c000"}, "2": {"node_id": "8927326e-ec6d-4e6b-a811-704327d98d99", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1890e3146c7b62c82d401b10b92065acf73a5bdfd16fe5de8c8d35ea70ec8079"}}, "hash": "278bf39851edd17fc66957468f3b428683070d6636093157b164298a46461c7c", "text": "2016b. 150 Dalaibuyan et al. 2016. 151 Ibid.

However, realizing and enhancing these benefits require actions, primarily from the government, but also from mining companies, local communities, employers and businesses in the country. 6.1 Fiscal revenues Flows of fiscal revenues from the extractive industry \u2013 taxes, royalties and other payments \u2013 are one of the major reasons why governments seek to promote the growth of this industry in their countries. Revenues from the extractive industry, particularly oil and gas, can account for a large proportion of fiscal revenues in resource-dependent countries. In 2011, during the peak period of mineral prices, mining accounted for 34 percent of total fiscal revenues in Botswana, 25 percent in Guinea and Zambia, 24 percent in Mongolia and 17 percent in Chile.153 The extractive industry gives impetus to other economic sectors, such as infrastructure, construction and some service sectors, which can further magnify the impact of mining on economic growth and fiscal revenues. However, benefits from revenues earned in the mining or other resource sectors do not flow in automatically. To translate fiscal revenues from the extractive industry into sustainable development benefits, at least four steps are needed: 1. Mining companies need to earn profits (or rents)154 2. Governments need to collect fiscal revenues from mining companies 3. Governments need to manage these revenues 4. Governments need to spend or invest these funds for sustainable development 6.1.1 Earning profits from mining An obvious but sometimes overlooked point is that in order for a government to collect taxes and payments from the mining industry, mining companies in its territory need to earn profits, or at least have prospects to earn profits in the future. Profits of mining companies are driven by several key factors. First, the geological features of the mineral deposits define the profitability of mining this deposit. For instance, if the mineral deposit lies deep in the earth, the cost of mining it will be much higher compared to a shallow deposit. If the deposit grade is high (the concentration of the valuable mineral within the earth is high), then its cost per unit of mineral will be lower. The size or scale of the deposit is another major factor in determining profitability. Second, technologies used by the mining company are also important for determining its profitability. More environmentally friendly technologies might be costlier in terms of capital and operational expenditures. However, these technologies can also be more efficient (although this is not always the case), thereby bringing more revenues and having lower environmental clean-up and liability costs for the company. Third, the markets for mineral and metal commodities are highly cyclical \u2013 subject to large fluctuations in prices. Since getting a mineral deposit ready to be mined (the mine development phase) can take several years, the mining industry is globally prone to periods of undersupply", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dc687224-ffcc-4ac6-a1e6-bc0b463fe035": {"__data__": {"id_": "dc687224-ffcc-4ac6-a1e6-bc0b463fe035", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Managing mining for sustainable development - A Sourcebook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "53d51db5d2c80a559536627b7c1cefdd331bbc92928a497b0ab2b30dab7fc40d"}}, "hash": "53d51db5d2c80a559536627b7c1cefdd331bbc92928a497b0ab2b30dab7fc40d", "text": "and oversupply of minerals and metals, which translates into these price fluctuations. These fluctuations 152 Much of this section is relevant not only for mining, but also for the oil and gas sectors. Collectively, mining, oil and gas industries are referred to as \u201cextractive industries\u201d. This section will use the terms \u201cextractive industry\u201d and \u201cresource sector\u201d interchangeably. 153 IMF dataset on fiscal revenues from mining, oil and gas, 2000\u20132011. The database is an unofficial internal survey by the IMF and has not been verified by country authorities. For more information about the methodology for estimation of fiscal revenues from the extractive industry, see International Monetary Fund (IMF) 2012. 154 In economics, a concept of rents is similar to, but not the same as profits. Rents are \u201cexcess profits\u201d earned above \u201cnormal profits\u201d that would have been earned in a competitive environment. However, for simplicity, the notions of profits and rents are used in this section interchangeably. MANAGING MINING FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 76 affect profits. For instance, a mining company which acquired a mining licence at the time of high mineral prices may only start producing when the mineral prices have declined. The fluctuations of the prices of most minerals are outside of the control of an individual mining company or the government of the host country.155 In feasibility studies, companies make provisions for such market price fluctuations. However, delays in the mine development and operations processes which arise from conflicts, or the time needed for adequate consultation of local communities are difficult to foresee. They can result in delays in timing of the mine production and the profitability from the mine. Although these factors are external \u2013 largely outside of control of governments, they are important for governments, since these factors should be considered in making decisions about taxes, managing resource revenues and investing them sustainably. In addition to these external factors, there are also factors which can be influenced by governments that impact on company profitability. For instance, if the overall business environment is healthy, then the company incurs fewer costs and earns more profits. Transparency in the governance of the resource sector, such as ensuring the provision of information, licensing, contracting and environmental regulation, is important for a healthy business environment. Having a coherent legal and regulatory framework is also conducive to a healthy environment for doing business. Having an educated, trained and skilled local workforce is beneficial not only for the workforce, but also for mining companies, since in countries with skilled workers, companies can employ local workers and spend less on worker relocation. Having institutions and systems that protect human rights is also beneficial for mining companies in the long run, since in such an environment there will be less risk of conflict and less conflict-related costs. Thus, it is within the power of governments to create a business environment that is conducive for doing business in the extractive industry, which at the same time benefits their citizens and minimizes the impact on the environment. 6.1.2 Getting fiscal revenues from mining The subsequent step towards realization of fiscal benefits from the extractive industry is to capture a portion of extractive industry profits156 through taxes, royalties and other tax-like instruments.157 This portion is called the government \u201ctake\u201d,158 as opposed to the company \u201ctake\u201d, which is the portion that is retained by extractive companies. The objective of governments of resource-endowed countries is usually to have a fiscal regime that is attractive to investors and, at the same time, ensures a fair share to the government.159 Analysis conducted by the IMF shows that in practice, the government \u201ctake\u201d (or the average effective tax rate) has been approximately 40 to 60 percent of mining sector rents;160 if it is significantly lower than this benchmark, it is a cause of concern that the government is not getting its fair share from mining. At the time of increasing mineral prices during the recent mining boom, many resource-rich countries found their share of the \u201ctake\u201d declining, whereas corporate profits were rising disproportionately.161 As a result, countries started revising their fiscal regimes in order to capture a bigger share of resource rents \u2013 between 2002 and 2012, at least 22 countries reviewed their natural resource fiscal regimes.162 155 However, if a country holds large enough reserves of a specific mineral, it can be a price-setter \u2013 influencing prices by controlling the production of this mineral. In addition, some large mining corporations are sufficiently big to control non-trivial amounts of mineral and metals production, and can influence the prices of these minerals and metals.

REALIZING AND ENHANCING THE BENEFITS FROM MINING 77 159 Compared to the mining sector, the government \u201ctake\u201d (the average effective tax rate) in the petroleum sector is higher. The same analysis shows that the government \u201ctake\u201d accounts for 65 to 85 percent of petroleum sector rents. International Monetary Fund 2012. 160 Sachs et al. 2013. 162 Ibid. 163 Simpasa et al. 2013. 164 Subsequently, Zambia overhauled its mining regime, replacing mining contracts with a law-based regime. It also raised royalties from 3 to 6 percent. For a detailed discussion, see Sachs et al. 2013. By 2014, the share of mining revenues in the budget increased to 32 percent before declining to 26 percent in 2015 (EITI Secretariat 2016b). 165 Simpasa et al. 2013. In comparing a natural resource fiscal regime of one country with that of another country, simply comparing tax rates does not help because of differences in how tax bases are defined and many other factors that determine the effective tax rate paid by mining companies. There are alternative methods for estimating the government \u201ctake\u201d, or estimating how fiscal revenues from the extractive sector compare with those of other countries. The simplest method is comparing fiscal revenues collected from the resource sector (as a share of GDP) with that of other countries with comparable resource sectors (measured, for example, as a share of the mining sector in GDP or exports). Figure 10 illustrates such a comparison: countries depicted close to the upward-sloping line have fiscal regimes that are in line with an international benchmark; those significantly above it get a greater government \u201ctake\u201d relative to the size of their extractive sectors, while those significantly below it get a lower government \u201ctake\u201d. In 2006\u20132010, Zambia, one of the countries heavily dependent on mining (minerals accounted for over 70 percent of its exports), got less than 5 percent of its fiscal revenues from natural resources, while during the same period, Mongolia with a comparable share of minerals in its exports, got 30 percent of fiscal revenues from mining (See Figure 10).163 So clearly, Zambia taxed its resource sector much less than other countries with comparable resource sectors.164 FIGURE 10.

It does not allow distinguishing between mining, oil and gas; between different types of minerals, or between specific mining projects. It is also only suitable for comparing countries that predominantly export their minerals. Another method is to model taxes and payments paid to the government at the project level by constructing a project-level mining fiscal model.

The main indicators of interest to governments from the tool are the Average Effective Tax Rate (AETR), the Marginal Effective Tax Rate (METR) and the progressivity of the fiscal regimes (a measure of the extent to which the effective tax rate becomes higher as the profitability of the project becomes higher). Project-level fiscal models, such as FARI, have several uses. When applied to specific resource projects, the tool allows governments an independent model for estimating the profitability or \u201ctake\u201d of the company, and the government \u201ctake\u201d, which is important for negotiating taxes and other payments with large mining investors. The model enables the adoption of a long-term perspective on the fiscal regime, considering fiscal revenue flows over the whole life of a mining project (or oil and gas project).169 For instance, Figure 11 shows the flows of fiscal revenues from a hypothetical oil project (which has some similarities with a mining project) over the life of the project; fiscal revenues are small during the exploration and development phase, peak during the production phase and disappear during the closure phase. The tool can also be used at a macro, or economy- wide level. When applied to several large resource projects, the tool allows assessing the overall government \u201ctake\u201d of the existing fiscal regime and comparing it with that of other countries. Also, for countries with large resource sectors relative to their economies and where the resource sector is concentrated in a few large-scale projects, this tool can be used for forecasting fiscal revenues (See Box 15). In principle, mining fiscal models should include the costs of environmental and social impact management. In recent years, more jurisdictions have started using Environmental Financial Assurance (EFA) in the mining sector, commonly referred to as environmental bonds (See Section 5.5.2 on Financing mine closure). While EFA is not a tax (it is a deposit held in trust by the government to be returned upon adequate mine reclamation and rehabilitation), it has financial implications, since a mining company may need to borrow at interest to make the EFA deposit. Similarly, insurance against environmental disasters is also becoming a common requirement for mining companies. These and other costs, such as environmental compliance costs, costs of consultations with local communities, costs of resettlement and social investments in communities\u2019 development should also be included in mining fiscal models. 166 Otto 2000. 167 Ibid. 168 Fiscal Analysis of Resource Industries, IMF website: http://www.imf.org/external/np/fad/fari/.

Box 15 Mining fiscal models in practice In 2015, the UNDP-UNEP Poverty Environment Initiative in Myanmar worked with the Myanmar Department of Mines to develop a financial model aggregating data from six major mining enterprises in the country. The model allows the government to gauge the extent of fiscal revenues to be collected from the mining sector. In 2015, UNDP commissioned a study of foreign direct investment in the mining sector of Guyana for the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment.170 Using a mining project-level fiscal model, the study estimated projected fiscal revenues from gold mining in 2015\u20132030, and found that under the existing fiscal regime, the government\u2019s revenues from the existing four large gold mines will peak in 2020 and rapidly decline thereafter. The study helped inform the government\u2019s long-term plans on foreign direct investment. In 2017, NRGI worked with the government and mining companies in Mongolia to develop a macro- fiscal model to propose debt sustainability options to policymakers.171 A key component of the macro- fiscal model was a set of aggregated project-level models from the five largest mines in Mongolia (three copper mines, a gold mine and a coal mine), which allowed estimating the mining output and fiscal revenues from these mines for the next 30 years.172 FIGURE 11.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "34740381-72ee-43c8-b33a-50dfd8320c03": {"__data__": {"id_": "34740381-72ee-43c8-b33a-50dfd8320c03", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Managing mining for sustainable development - A Sourcebook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e6320a231b2e66a070af718ca016806238226685da159ea521b122fdbd76b209"}, "2": {"node_id": "ae918644-3ada-490a-abe3-4d9bb74d212f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8507fff601118f79b5c311920c3a794201556d6bc78dc1e29519bbbac0f16ead"}}, "hash": "39116b37527b912d3160503efc843044f838ccfbff492d3100225e3852a34998", "text": "A TYPICAL PROFILE OF FISCAL REVENUES FROM A RESOURCE PROJECT (PETROLEUM) Source: Adapted from Luca and Puyo (2016) Royalty Corporate income tax Resource Rent Tax (RRT) Other direct charges Mineral exploration phase Mine development", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b61582e-d435-42e7-8bfe-130e8d86318e": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b61582e-d435-42e7-8bfe-130e8d86318e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Managing mining for sustainable development - A Sourcebook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8ad9e9866dafaf0f53b495b152af14ce6d8cccce2585325d8e8bbeea253fca5e"}, "3": {"node_id": "4e2e5c02-e5c3-4a35-b158-0b0f88d99cde", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "96b48e49eb494e03f223da3baf45d44ea58d4d57968e5fd5096ad604c8582ddd"}}, "hash": "e86d1b5be39252329e605e72a8c43bc4b22a9d00641deac161dbdd3cffd90070", "text": "phase Mine closure phase Mining operations (production) phase Government revenues Signature bonus During depreciation of development cost RRT only once rate of return threshold reached MANAGING MINING FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 80 Beyond the government \u201ctake\u201d at a specific point in time, governments also consider the stability of their fiscal regimes, which is one of the priority factors for mining investors.173 This is because mining is an industry with high upfront capital and operational costs and once these costs are incurred, the negotiating power shifts to the government. Changes to the fiscal regime after incurring the upfront costs can render the mining project unprofitable. Therefore, frequent, unforeseen changes to the fiscal regime are one of the main deterrents of investors. Due to such changes, investors seek to establish mine-specific contracts and to stabilize fiscal terms in these contracts for the duration of the mining project (See Section 4.2 on Mining contracts). To start with, governments should seek to ground their fiscal regimes in laws, rather than contracts.174 The stability of a mining fiscal regimes helps governments to move towards a law-based regime. However, having a stable fiscal regime does not mean being stuck with a fiscal regime that does not give the country its fair share of resource revenues. Case studies of five resource-rich countries that overhauled their legal and fiscal regimes in recent years show that for the most part, despite the threats by investors to leave the country, these reforms have done little to deter foreign investment in their resource sectors. In some of these cases, such as Tanzania and Zambia, the reforms represented a rebalancing from fiscal regimes with extremely low government \u201ctake\u201d towards more internationally comparable regimes.175 Ways of building flexibility into the mining fiscal regime include putting provisions in mining contracts to renegotiate terms within a specified period of time (recent known examples set the renegotiation period to five years), as well as adopting sliding- scale royalties which allow for automatic adjustment of royalty rates upon changes in mineral prices176 (See Box 17). Another key consideration for fiscal regimes in the resource sector is transparency. Since the early 2000s, several important international initiatives have been undertaken to increase transparency of the extractive industry (See Box 16). The lack of transparency can seriously undermine the country\u2019s efforts to collect and subsequently to use revenues from resource sectors for sustainable development. Due to the large size of many resource projects, fiscal revenues from this sector are especially prone to corruption. Transparency also benefits investors, since the public is aware of fiscal revenues coming to the country from the sector and is less likely to contest mining or other resource projects. Ensuring transparency also means having a relatively straightforward fiscal regime. In countries with very complex fiscal regimes, even if disclosure of information is practised, information on taxes and payments is difficult to understand and, therefore, becomes inaccessible. 173 Commonwealth Secretariat and International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) 2009. 174 Otto 2000. 175 Ibid. 176 Ibid. 177 EITI Secretariat 2016a. 178 See a report about PWYP\u2019s progress till 2007.

The EITI sets standards to improve the governance of mining, oil and gas. Currently, it is funded by 16 supporting countries (developed countries) and a number of companies in the extractive industry. To implement the EITI standard, a country needs to apply to EITI. To meet the standard, the country needs to publish revenues received by all government agencies from the extractive sector; extractive companies in that country need to publish all payments made to the government; then, these amounts are reconciled and made publicly available. A key element is that EITI \u2013 both at the global and country levels \u2013 is overseen by a multi-stakeholder board which ensures independence of its activities.

Given the importance of contracts in the mining and other resource sectors in shaping the fiscal regimes, public disclosure of contracts is critical for transparency of fiscal revenues from the resource sectors. In addition, the database is useful for governments in negotiations for investors, since it enables them to draw on a large number of contracts available publicly. In doing this, it addresses the asymmetry of information between governments of resource-rich countries and investors. For more information, see http://resourcecontracts.org/ The IMF released the draft Natural Resource Fiscal Transparency Code in 2016,179 which addresses issues of the clarity of roles and responsibilities, open budget processes, public availability of information, and assurances of integrity. The code goes beyond transparency in reporting and includes recommendations on the features of the legal, contractual and fiscal regimes that are important for transparency. The US Dodd-Frank Act180 (Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, 2010) includes provisions that require companies in the extractive industry that are publicly listed in the United States to disclose all \u201cmaterial\u201d payments made to the US and foreign governments. The new EU Accounting and Transparency Directives which were adopted in 2013, require companies in the logging and extractive industries, which are publicly listed in the European Union or large unlisted companies domiciled in the EU, to disclose payments made to governments.181 The Dodd-Frank Act and the Accounting and Transparency Directives complement the EITI by legally requiring extractive companies based in the United States and the European Union to publish their payments to governments. Since many multinational companies are domiciled in these jurisdictions, these acts have far-reaching implications for improving transparency in fiscal revenues in the extractive sector. MANAGING MINING FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 82 Box 17 Main taxes and payments paid by mining companies to governments Corporate income taxes are one of the largest sources of fiscal revenues from mining in most countries. The tax base is the taxable income defined by the difference between total revenues and deductible costs of the mining company. Key considerations include: 1) methods of calculating depreciation of assets (accelerated versus simple); 2) loss carry-forward provisions (which allow investors to deduct, up to a certain number of years, losses incurred in prior years as costs in the present year); 3) limiting the deductible interest expenses on loans; and 4) ring fencing of revenues and deductible costs for each mining project (which limits the possibility of mining companies moving costs between different mines to minimize payable taxes).182 Other important considerations that arise with regard to multinational companies are the issues of transfer pricing and double tax treaties. Host countries can be subject to an abusive transfer pricing practice \u2013 a practice whereby a multinational company misstates prices to shift the source of profits to jurisdictions with lower tax rates.183 Transfer pricing disadvantages jurisdictions with higher income tax rates. Double tax treaties, as well as strategies of investors to minimize their taxes, can erode the tax base of the host country.184 Royalties are one of the largest revenue sources from mining in many countries. Royalties are specific to resource sectors and are imposed on the volume of mineral production (unit royalties) or the value (ad valorem royalties). Royalties can also be profit-based. Some countries use uniform rates of royalties for all minerals; others set different rates for different types of minerals; in less common cases, royalty rates are set not in the law, but on a project-by-project basis (for instance, investors propose rates when bidding for mining permits). In recent years, several countries have moved to sliding-scale ad valorem royalties, whereby a higher value of mineral production is taxed at a higher rate.185 Sliding", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8aa8c959-060f-4271-a140-a8ee1925755e": {"__data__": {"id_": "8aa8c959-060f-4271-a140-a8ee1925755e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Managing mining for sustainable development - A Sourcebook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cdcc3f7ce4869da4e014e91925f17f0c0b6bad2dd940a4fb3080937322336366"}}, "hash": "cdcc3f7ce4869da4e014e91925f17f0c0b6bad2dd940a4fb3080937322336366", "text": "scale royalties represent a progressive fiscal regime. One of the implications of royalties is that they raise the cost of production; therefore, companies paying higher royalties would mine deposits with higher grade (content of the mineral). This means that some of the deposit with lower grades is left in the ground, which represents inefficient use of natural resources.186 Some jurisdictions require mining and other resource companies to pay additional royalties directly to indigenous peoples. For example, the Philippines requires payment of at least one percent of the value of the resource to indigenous peoples.187 Resource rent taxes are used less commonly in the mining sector; they are more common in the oil sector. They are similar to corporate income taxes, but are applied on cash flows. Customs duties include import taxes and export taxes. The import tax bill of mining companies can be significant due to the high value of mining equipment that is typically imported to resource-rich developing countries. Some countries also impose export taxes on raw minerals to incentivize further value addition (mineral processing) in the country. VAT, with regard to the mining industry, is mostly derived from VAT on imports of equipment and services, as well as on exports of minerals. 182 Otto 2000. 183 Daniel, Keen, and McPherson 2010. 184 Ibid. 185 Sachs et al. 2013. 186 Otto 2000. 187 Bauer et al. 2016. REALIZING AND ENHANCING THE BENEFITS FROM MINING 83 Withholding taxes include taxes on dividends, on foreign interest service and on foreign services. Withholding taxes on dividends can be lowered or eliminated by a host country for investors from countries with which it has bilateral investment or tax treaties. Withholding taxes on foreign interest services are applied to encourage local lending to mining projects; and those on foreign services are applied to incentivize mining companies to buy local services (See more on local content in Section 6.2.3 on Strategies to increase employment and growth through mining). Signature bonuses are paid upon signing a mining contact or when the contract becomes effective. They usually constitute single, lump-sum payments. Licence/permit fees are payable upon granting of a mineral exploration or mineral extraction licence or permit. Government equity participation is technically not a tax, but in many cases represents a payment from a mining company to the government. Resource-rich developing countries can gain equity participation in a mining project/company through several means: 1) by paid-up capital, like any other investor; 2) by borrowing the amount from the private investor (with or without interest) and later repaying it from royalties and taxes payable to the government; 3) by giving up some future taxes; 4) by making in-kind contributions, such as infrastructure provision; 5) by receiving free equity share. However, government equity participation is accompanied by several challenges, including carrying risk as a shareholder; not being able to realize anticipated learning and technology transfer; not being able to influence the company\u2019s decisions; or having to give up some future tax revenues.188 Natural resource fees, such as fees for the use of land and water, are also imposed on mining companies. Environmental compliance costs are not taxes, but constitute costs for the mining company.189 From the taxation point of view, they may be deductible from taxable income (up to a certain amount). In addition, mining companies also use environmental insurance to cover their potential environmental liabilities. Environmental Financial Assurance (EFA, also commonly referred to as environmental bonds) is now increasingly required by jurisdictions to cover the cost of mine closure (See Section 5.5.2 on Financing mine closure). Local development costs constitute spending by mining companies on community development, such as social and infrastructure spending. Similar to environmental compliance costs, these are not taxes. However, in recent years, mining companies are increasingly expected by communities and governments to make contributions towards local development initiatives (See Section 6.3.2 on Community development initiatives). Some jurisdictions allow local development or social investment costs to be deducted from taxable income (up to a certain amount), which incentivizes mining companies to invest in local development, but reduces the taxable income of companies. Moreover, some countries have instituted mandatory charges on extractive sector companies. For instance, Kyrgyzstan introduced a surcharge on royalties towards \u201cpayment for development and maintenance of local infrastructure\u201d to be paid to local governments.190 Such charges are in principle not very different from royalties. 188 Revenue Watch Institute-Natural Resource Charter (RWI-NRC) et al. 2014. 189 Otto 2000. 190 Bauer et al. 2016.

However, because mineral prices are highly variable and, consequently, mining rents or profits are very cyclical, a more progressive mining fiscal regime also means that the volatility of fiscal revenues will be greater (See Figure 12). This volatility has a negative impact on economic growth and development. There are many examples when during resource booms, governments of resource-rich countries spend \u201cvoraciously\u201d, by spending over their means and borrowing against future resource revenues.192, 193 During an earlier oil price boom, Mexico \u201cborrowed against expectations of increasing real oil prices after 1981 and suffered badly when these expectations turned out to be far off track\u201d.194 A recent example is Mongolia, a country dependent on mining, which enjoyed double-digit economic growth during the peak of the recent mining boom. However, the government had expanded its expenditures unsustainably, so that the decline in mineral prices has hit its fiscal revenues. In 2016, the fiscal deficit reached an unprecedented 17 percent of GDP and in 2017, faced with the urgent need to repay its debt obligations, the country obtained emergency financing from the FIGURE 12.

The problems don\u2019t stop at the level of central government. During the recent mining boom, some governments of mineral-rich countries allocated more fiscal resources to subnational governments. Where not designed well, such allocation schemes can result in passing on the volatility of fiscal revenues from the national to the subnational level. For instance, a small municipality in Peru has seen its fiscal revenues increase 26 times in a single year, and revenues of a municipality in Colombia increased 100 times in a few years in the early 2010s. Much of these windfall revenues were invested in building \u2018white elephant\u2019 projects with limited use once the mining boom ended.196 The volatility of mineral prices, particularly in countries where resource revenues account for a sizeable share of fiscal revenues, has adverse impacts on financing development expenditures \u2013 such as education, health, social assistance and infrastructure. The main measures to manage the volatility of revenues are the adoption of structural budget rules, and setting up natural resource funds for stabilization and savings, accompanied by improved public financial management. Structural budget rules developed by the IMF197 entail splitting fiscal revenues into two parts \u2013 non- resource revenue and volatile resource revenue. The budgetary balance is also split into two parts \u2013 the structural budget balance which does not consider resource revenues and the non-structural budget balance which considers both resource and non- resource revenues. More importantly, structural budget rules require fiscal revenue projections that are based on a long-term trend rather than short- to medium-term fluctuations,198 so that they prevent overly optimistic budget expenditure plans. Governments can also set up natural resource funds for stabilization and savings of fiscal revenues from their resource sectors.199 When used for stabilization of fiscal revenues, governments save a portion of their revenues in natural resource funds during high mineral or oil prices, and draw them down during low prices.200 Natural resource funds are also used to save a part of resource revenues when the country does not have enough absorptive capacity to spend them, such as in Timor-Leste, or has not much need for public spending, such as in Norway.201 Natural resource funds should be used in tandem with structural budget rules and are used to smooth public expenditures.

In general, the magnitude of fiscal revenues from oil is greater than from mining. Therefore, natural resource funds are more common and are larger in oil-producing countries than in mineral-producing countries. (Bauer and Toledano 2014) 200 Bauer and Toledano 2014. 201 Ibid. 202 Ibid. MANAGING MINING FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 86 In most countries, major taxes and other payments by the extractive industry are paid to national (central) governments. National governments may then transfer a portion of natural resource revenues to subnational governments. Many resource-rich countries which implement such schemes redistribute natural resource revenues to subnational governments on the basis of derivation \u2013 to provinces where mining takes place, or from where revenues were derived from.203 In other countries, royalties and major taxes are paid directly to subnational governments. Direct payments to subnational (state) governments is often the case in countries with federal systems, such as Argentina, Australia, Canada, India, the United Arab Emirates and the United States, as well as China, which has a unitary system.204 Transferring natural resource revenues to mineral- producing provinces can help address existing or potential conflicts and compensate \u2013 to some extent \u2013 for environmental degradation and the resource depletion of these provinces. However, such transfers create perverse incentives (such as overspending during booms) and lead to complications in revenue management, as subnational governments may have less capacity than national governments to manage resource revenues. The design and implementation of such systems should consider general public fiscal management principles, as well as those specific to natural resource revenues.205 6.1.4 Investing fiscal revenues from mining Since extraction of minerals or other non-renewable resources depletes national wealth, a key principle is that revenues from resource extraction should be invested in building other forms of wealth or capital, rather than consumed (See Box 18). These forms of capital can include physical capital such as rail, road and energy infrastructure; human capital such as healthy, educated populations; and financial capital such as savings in the form of natural resource savings funds. The priorities of countries differ depending on their levels of development. In less developed countries with significant needs, it is justifiable to use more financing for spending on infrastructure, health and education, rather than saving the surplus in financial assets.206, 207 Timor-Leste illustrates an example of trade-offs that are faced by resource-rich countries when questioning what to invest their natural resource revenues in. Timor-Leste is endowed with abundant oil reserves but has significant development needs, with 70 percent of the population deriving their livelihoods from agriculture.208 Timor-Leste established a Petroleum Fund in 2005 modeled after Norway\u2019s Government Pension Fund Global, envisaging a small percentage (3 percent) of the value of the Petroleum Fund to be used for public expenditures.209 However, within a few years it became apparent that the strategy should allow greater fiscal space to fund infrastructure and social service provision, for which the needs in Timor- Leste are immediate and are far greater than in Norway. Resource-rich countries can also use proceeds from resource extraction to create other sources of growth, diversifying their economies away from the resource sector. Evidence shows that developing countries with a diversified economic base are better able to progress towards sustainable growth in the long run as they are more resilient to external shocks and are better able to mitigate vulnerabilities associated with globalization and 203 In fewer countries, national governments distribute natural resource revenues on the basis of indicators, such as population or level of development, which may be motivated by the principle of equalization between provinces. 204 Ibid. 205 For discussion and recommendations on the design and implementation of natural resource sharing systems, see Bauer et al. 2016. 206 For more discussion on strategies for investing fiscal revenues from natural resources, see Bauer and Toledano 2014.

Box 18 Weak and strong sustainability concepts Environmental economists have sought to reconcile the tensions between the material needs of societies with the sustainable use of natural resources through the theoretical concepts of \u2018weak sustainability\u2019 and \u2018strong sustainability\u2019. These concepts treat natural resources as a form of capital used in the production process along with capital and labour, in order to produce goods to satisfy people\u2019s material needs. Sustainability is achieved when the total stock of capital (total national wealth) increases or at least does not decline. Proponents of the weak sustainability concept hold that natural capital can be substituted by manufactured capital or human capital (labour).210 From here, it follows that, as long as physical, human or financial capital are created, depleting natural capital does not clash with sustainability. The weak sustainability concept has resonance in less developed, natural resource-rich countries, where the proceeds of extraction of mineral resources are invested in infrastructure, health and education \u2013 to increase the stock of physical or social capital. However, the assumption that labour or capital can fully substitute for natural resources is unrealistic. Facing criticism for this assumption from environmental organizations and experts, economists came forward with the \u2018strong sustainability\u2019 concept \u2013 whereby natural capital is no longer considered replaceable, so the stock of natural capital should be maintained to satisfy conditions for sustainability.211 The strong sustainability concept implies policies that are focused on the greater protection of the environment and conservation of natural resources. Strong sustainability is less compatible with exploitation of non-renewable natural resources - which depletes these resources. trade openness.212, 213 Policies for diversification can entail using resource revenues to promote the growth of non-resource sectors, such as through public investments in research and development, provision of subsidized credit, and investing in human resource capacity. However, there are not many examples of successful diversification of mineral and oil-dependent countries in the recent history. Among the few examples of countries which have achieved relative success are Chile and Malaysia. In Chile, the government invested in research and development of the agro-industry and fishing sectors, improved agricultural technologies, and invested in agro-processing ventures in the 1970s and 80s; these measures were complemented by actions by the industry and industry associations. As a result, the share of copper in total exports of Chile declined from half in 1980 to one a third in 1998, while agro-processing and farmed salmon sectors have emerged as major new export sectors.214 Malaysia implemented policies to promote manufacturing and the exports of intermediate industrial goods in the 1970s, diversifying away from the reliance on exports of primary commodities.215 MANAGING MINING FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 88 6.2 Employment and economic growth In addition to fiscal revenues, another important benefit from mining for development is the creation of employment and business opportunities. 6.2.1 Employment in mining The mining industry is capital-intensive and direct employment in mining is relatively small. However, a growing mining sector can increase employment significantly through the creation of indirect and induced jobs (See Box 19). The number of indirect and induced jobs can be substantial. According to a review of available studies by the IFC, for every job created in the mining sector, the mining sector was responsible for creating more indirect or induced jobs in the economy (4 jobs in the United States, 6 jobs in Chile and 28 jobs in Ghana). Such indirect and induced job effects were much greater for the mining sector than other sectors such as hotels, retail or agriculture.216 Similar with manufacturing, mining is a sector with rapid technological progress,217 enabling people to learn and acquire skills. Skills that people learn and the productive capabilities of firms which depend on these skills are arguably the most important factors driving economic development. These skills \u2013 such as soft skills that are relevant across all sectors, or technical skills that can be useful for relevant occupations \u2013 can be transferred to other industries, spurring their development.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2fa7526a-9520-4eee-bfd2-190f09d82325": {"__data__": {"id_": "2fa7526a-9520-4eee-bfd2-190f09d82325", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Managing mining for sustainable development - A Sourcebook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f0a741620c036056124bae5bde82e17ac7be33a24d304c9df52b2f705bfb8c50"}}, "hash": "f0a741620c036056124bae5bde82e17ac7be33a24d304c9df52b2f705bfb8c50", "text": "6.2.2 Economic growth through linkages with mining Production linkages of the mining sector with other sectors can be more important to economic diversification and development than fiscal revenues.218 Moreover, this contribution can be greater in monetary terms. It is estimated that 40 to 80 percent of extractive companies\u2019 revenues is spent on the procurement of goods and services.219 Another estimate suggests that 50 to 65 percent of mining companies\u2019 spending is on employment, infrastructure and procurement, while only 15 to 20 percent is on taxes and other fiscal payments.220 Thus, even a relatively small shift of mining company expenditures from overseas to domestic suppliers (in the host country) can be larger, in monetary terms, than a large increase in tax payments. 216 International Finance Corporation (IFC) 2013, table 3.1, p. 29. 217 Although the recent trend towards greater automation in the mining industry is likely to reduce demand for low-skilled workers.

Box 19 Production and consumption linkages of the mining sector with the economy221 Mining is connected with the rest of the economy through production linkages, such as buying goods and services from firms, and supplying minerals to firms. In economics, linkages with firms which supply to the sector are called backward linkages, and linkages with firms which use the sector\u2019s goods as inputs are called forward linkages (See Figure 13). Indirect employment222 is created through jobs in firms with backward and forward linkages to mining \u2013 jobs that would not have been created in the absence of mining. These include, for example, jobs in firms providing geological, engineering and IT services to mining, some transportation and construction firms, and firms selling supplies to the mining industry. By strengthening backward and forward linkages, the positive impacts of mining on economic growth, development and employment can be enhanced. Another link of mining to the economy is through consumption linkages. The growth of a resource sector raises economic growth and incomes generated through: 1) employment and wages in the resource sector, as well as sectors linked to it through backward and forward linkages; and 2) earnings accruing to owners of firms in the resource sector and sectors linked to it. Stronger consumption linkages of the resource sector mean that a bigger share of incomes is spent domestically, rather than on imported goods. The increase in domestic consumption raises demand for goods and services produced in the country, which translates into more jobs for people to produce these goods and services, which raises incomes further. Such employment is called induced employment (by the resource sector).223 FIGURE 13.

One strategy is to use local content requirements. The other strategy is to improve the competitiveness of local workers and businesses. The first strategy \u2013 local content requirements \u2013 entails limiting the use of foreign employees and imported goods and services in the mining industry while giving preference to the use of local employees and locally produced goods and services. Local content requirements are implemented through policies such as quotas and taxes on the employment of foreign nationals, and provisions in mining contracts and laws on the minimum number of local employees, and the minimum percentage of goods and services to be bought from or produced in the host country. Local content requirements can create a number of problems. They could lead to the loss of competitiveness of the mining industry; prop up suppliers and employees without corresponding improvement in skills and quality, which does not make them competitive; and promote corruption in both the government and the mining industry. This last risk is substantial given the magnitude of the amount of money involved in the procurement of goods and services by the mining industry. An important consideration is that local content requirements go against the core idea of free trade and investment agreements.

However, local content measures are allowed for a number of years upon first joining the GATT; moreover, Least Developed Countries (LDCs) are allowed to use local content measures. In recent years, Indonesia and Nigeria have used local content measures for the development of their oil and gas sectors;224 these and other measures can give rise to disputes under the above agreements. Nevertheless, local content requirements are common \u2013 as of 2013, more than 70 countries had in place some requirements for the extractive industry to buy goods and services locally.225 While local content policies may be needed to address market deficiencies, to be effective they should be complemented by the second strategy \u2013 measures to improve the competitiveness of local workers and companies to work in or to supply to the mining industry. These measures include creating a business-friendly environment, investments in basic infrastructure, improving access to credit and investing in education and skills. This strategy to improve competitiveness is more sustainable since it is more conducive for developing sectors to diversify away from mining. With the trend of growing automation in the mining industry, raising the level of skills of workers might increasingly become a necessity, not an option. For example, it is estimated that further diffusion of automated technologies in the mining industry, which is already underway, will likely reduce the number of jobs in a typical mine by 30 to 75 percent.226 Demand for lower-skilled jobs such as truck drivers and drilling and blasting workers will decline, whereas demand for remote machinery operators will increase.227 Improving skills requires strong and proactive collaboration between the government, the mining industry and educational institutions. Policies and programmes to implement this strategy include training and education programmes, apprenticeship programmes, industry representatives teaching at educational institutions, skills certification programmes, providing public funding to students or educational institutions in professions needed 224 For more information, see here: https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news15_e/monit_16apr15_e.htm 225 Ibid. 226 McNab et al. 2013, Accenture 2010, quoted in Cosbey et al. 2017. 227 Cosbey et al. 2017.

This World Bank\u2019s study on local content policies in the oil and gas industry provides an extensive review of policies in different countries, as well as policy recommendations. Despite being focused on the oil and gas industry, many of the study\u2019s recommendations are applicable to the mining industry as well. Also see a series of studies conducted by a research programme \u2018Making the Most of Commodities\u2019 in African countries by the Open University and University of Cape Town (Accessed 5 May 2017. http://www.commodities.open.ac.uk/mmcp ); and Morris, Kaplinsky, and Kaplan 2011a. 229 Today, most mining operations are run not by vertically integrated mining companies, but are subcontracted. A large portion of spending of mining companies is on contracts with Engineering, Procurement and Construction Management (EPCM) or Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) companies.

MANAGING MINING FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 92 by the industry, retraining, forecasting the types of skills needed by the industry and using this information for providing training and education, investing in research and development, and promoting promising start-ups and small companies in the mining sector. For example, in Chile, large mining companies established a Mining Skills Council in 2012 under the Mining Council, with the objective of addressing future skills gaps and shortages \u2013 the most critical challenge for the industry. Members of the Mining Skills Council worked together to standardize criteria for qualifications, created job profiles, and conducted projections of the skills for the industry for the next decade. This allowed the removal of inefficiencies in the training system, whereby each mining company had their own training centre, and allowed the educational system to collaborate with the industry in training for needed skills. Overall, this experience is seen as a crucial step for upgrading skills in mining to a sector with world-class skills; it has been emulated by other industries in the country.230 6.3 Mining and local development Mining can bring development benefits to local communities. Local communities living in the impact area of mining have legitimate expectations that mining companies should not only mitigate the negative environmental and social impacts of their activities, but should also take actions to promote local development. These expectations are justified on the grounds of legitimate claims of these communities to the land where they reside and which is to be used by mining companies. In many cases, these claims \u2013 or rights \u2013 may not be legally recognized, but are usually socially legitimized because of the length of time that the community lives on this land and their connection to the land. 6.3.1 Corporate responsibility and mining Increasingly, mining companies accept these expectations and seek to address them as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives. (See Box 21 for the definition of CSR and other related concepts; see Section 4.4 on Voluntary standards). 6.3.2 Community development initiatives To respond to local community expectations, mining companies often implement or fund local community development initiatives. By doing this, companies seek to build good relationships with local communities and to obtain a social licence to operate. Such initiatives usually focus on health, education, infrastructure and business development. Most contributions to local development initiatives by mining companies take the following forms: \u2022 Philanthropic donations to community groups, either in cash or in-kind, such as provision of equipment, facilities and supplies \u2022 Funding and implementation of social campaigns and programmes, such as social service programmes, income-generating programmes, skill- and capacity-building programmes, and advocacy and awareness campaigns \u2022 Funding and building of social infrastructure such as schools, hospitals and housing \u2022 Financing of development programmes by providing grants Payments to third-party or government funds used for social purposes such as improving education and health outcomes. Large mining companies recruit community relations staff or dedicated Corporate Social Responsibility units to implement local development initiatives and engage local communities. Companies may also partner with NGOs and 230 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) 2018.

UNDESA summarizes these various views on CSR, distinguishing between the minimum standard (complying with regulations and doing \u201cno harm\u201d), median standard (positive contribution of businesses to society beyond compliance \u2013 while justifying CSR as being good for business), and maximum standard (aligning business goals with societal sustainable development goals).232 There is also an argument that corporate responsibility should not be merely \u201csocial\u201d, since it is also about responsibility towards the environment. For this reason, the UN Global Compact uses the term Corporate Responsibility (CR), rather than CSR.233 Social Licence to Operate (SLO) means tacit, informal consent from the public to a company\u2019s activities. This term has become widely used by the mining industry, based on \u201cunderstanding that local perceptions or responses can determine a company\u2019s ability to access land, water and other [\u2026] resources\u201d.234 The concept of the SLO is based on the idea that, in addition to government permits, mining companies also need permission or consent from the public to conduct their business. Shared value means delivering outcomes of value to local communities as part of companies\u2019 regular business activities.235 In the mining industry, for example, shared value can be created by developing the capabilities of local suppliers, going beyond regular market transactions. It is argued that such activities are beneficial to the company, as well as local suppliers. The concept of \u2018shared value\u2019 has been successfully promoted in business and academic circles by Michael Porter, considered one of the leading business theorists. However, the shared value concept has also been subject to criticism. The main criticism is that this concept is similar to a subset of CSR and can undermine the broader concept of CSR.236 Social investment, community investment, sustainability investment and impact investment \u2013 These are investments made by mining (or any other) companies for the benefit of society at large or specific communities, as opposed to investments made only for profit. Definitions vary, but in general emphasize that these investments are good for both societies and businesses. For instance, the International Finance Cooperation defines community investment as \u201cVoluntary contributions or actions by companies to help communities in their areas of operation address their development priorities, and take advantage of opportunities created by private investment\u2014in ways that are sustainable and support business objectives\u201d.237 In recent years, a similar term, \u2018sustainability investment\u2019 has emerged and has become popular, highlighting the emphasis on environmental sustainability or sustained impact of these investments on societies or communities. MANAGING MINING FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 94 international organizations. Where funding is substantial, mining companies may set up funds, trusts and foundations for the financing and implementation of local development initiatives. Particularly in the case of indigenous communities, local development initiatives may be formalized through agreements between the mining companies and the communities (See Box 23). Often, as a company progresses from one phase of mining to another, it can move from philanthropic donations and ad hoc initiatives to programmes with sustained focus, and eventually towards institutionalizing its support to local development initiatives through formal institutional arrangements and/or agreements (See Box 22). In the past two decades, community development programmes have become widespread in the mining, oil and gas industry. Moreover, some countries have adopted laws requiring resource companies to fund or implement community development programmes. In 2014, there were 32 countries which had such legal requirements.238 6.3.3 Challenges with community development initiatives Mining companies\u2019 community development initiatives \u2013 or corporate responsibility initiatives \u2013 have been criticized that they are motivated by companies\u2019 business goals at the expense of attention to poverty reduction and sustainable benefits for local communities.239 The understanding of the importance of investing in sustainable development is still not widely shared within the mining industry, even though there has been a marked increase in such recognition, especially among leading companies in the industry.240 In particular, smaller mining companies (called \u2018juniors\u2019 in the industry), which tend to do mining exploration, are criticized for their lack of regard for local engagement and corporate responsibility.241 Box 22 The progression of community development initiatives around the Sepon Mine in Lao PDR242 Sepon is an open-pit gold and copper mine in Savannakhet Province in southern Laos, operated by the Minerals and Metals Group (MMG).

REALIZING AND ENHANCING THE BENEFITS FROM MINING 95 Box 23 Community Development Agreements In some cases, local development initiatives are formalized in community development agreements (CDAs). CDAs are made between mining companies and local communities to promote positive contribution from mining projects for local development and to formalize the obligations of parties in this process.243 CDAs may be used in different situations. For instance, when there is a brewing conflict between a mining company and a local community, CDAs are used to improve relationships between the parties.244 In countries where indigenous communities\u2019 rights to their land are recognized, CDAs are done to set out the terms for access to these lands for mining companies.245 More generally, CDAs are done as part of companies\u2019 corporate responsibility motivations and to gain \u201cthe social licence to operate\u201d. CDAs go by different names (e.g. Benefit Sharing Agreements, Impact Benefit Agreements, Indigenous Land Use Agreements and Social Responsibility Agreements).246 CDAs have been used mainly in the context of indigenous peoples, but increasingly, such agreements are also made with other, non-indigenous local communities affected by mining, oil and gas.247 CDAs can be a condition in mining permitting processes, i.e. for issuing mining, environmental or land use permits, or they can be made independently of permits. The scope of issues covered in CDAs varies greatly. However, a recent review of good practices found that CDAs commonly cover issues such as local employment, training, local business development, and the shared use of infrastructure.248 In the case of Impact Benefit Agreements (CDAs in the context of Canadian indigenous communities), the range of issues covered is wider. These agreements may cover royalties and other payments to be paid to indigenous communities; access to the land; respect for culture; compensation for people whose livelihoods are affected; environmental management measures, including mine closure and participation of indigenous communities in environmental monitoring; and a range of social measures.249 CDAs also include clear provisions regarding processes such as communication, stakeholder participation, governance, amendments and revisions of the agreement renegotiation, grievances and dispute resolution. There are several stages in the process of agreement making: 1) making pre-agreements, such as Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs), to define the scope of issues to be included in the CDA, and to agree on financing of and procedures for consultation and negotiation; 2) conducting research, consultation and training/information provision; 3) conducting negotiations and making the agreement.250 To make lasting agreements, local communities should be provided with sufficient time for consultation, since reaching out to the critical mass of constituencies may take a lot of time particularly in the case of projects affecting large areas. Altogether, the processes of consultations, research, learning on both sides and negotiations can take several years.

During the recent period of intensified resource development prompted by high mineral prices, large mining companies invested in their CSR and community relations capacities, rather than merely public relations, as used to be common before. Nevertheless, community relations units within companies face numerous limitations that undermine mining companies\u2019 performance in terms of local development \u2013 such as their low status vis- \u00e0-vis the \u2018core\u2019 engineering and other departments in mining companies, and lack of access to and attention of senior management.257 A broader problem with community development initiatives is that mining companies and local communities operate on a different timescale and often with a different worldview.258 To keep costs (such as interest on borrowing, remuneration of technical specialists and renting of specialized equipment) low and to make profits (by taking advantage of the relatively narrow window of time of high mineral prices), mining companies are motivated to move fast \u2013 which includes engaging communities, designing and starting community development programmes, and concluding REALIZING AND ENHANCING THE BENEFITS FROM MINING 97 community development agreements. But for indigenous peoples and other land-connected communities, they may lose land they have used for generations and see a potentially irreversible transformation to this land. Local communities, particularly those with limited experience of mining in their areas, also lack knowledge about the business of mining, the science of environmental impacts, and the complexity of national, international norms and rules; this puts them at a disadvantage in engaging with mining companies to develop local development initiatives or in negotiating community development agreements that are beneficial to them. Lack of experience and skills also prevents them from making use of employment and business opportunities. 6.3.4 The role of governments in community development initiatives The role of governments in enhancing benefits from mining for the development of communities impacted by mining has often been limited, particularly as it relates to community development initiatives. In some countries, governments underinvest or do not provide essential services to local communities in remote areas, which compels mining companies to implement community development initiatives in the first place. Even where governments are closely involved, they may put in place legal and regulatory requirements that are not coherent, not well-informed by the realities of communities, or that marginalize certain indigenous and minority communities. Greater understanding of CSR and CDAs and greater engagement with communities can help governments navigate the complex landscape of mining\u2013community relations and contribute effectively to maximizing benefits from mining for local development.

Governments should also support the capacity of local communities impacted by mining, which can include funding training, supporting negotiations of communities over royalties earned from mining, and supporting coordination and partnerships among several mining companies for local communities\u2019 capacity development. Improving transparency and access to information \u2013 such as information on mining permits, fiscal revenues from mining, and environmental impacts \u2013 can go a long way to support the capacity of local communities. 6.4 Integrating mining into strategies and plans In countries and regions with significant mineral resources, mining activities have a significant impact on and the opportunity to contribute to sustainable development. Governments should consider the impacts and benefits of mining on sustainable economic and social development and environmental sustainability. They should consider how their mining sector strategies fit holistically within their overall sustainable development visions, and within concrete plans, policies and strategies. By doing so, they can enhance the benefits and mitigate the impacts of mining industry for more sustainable development of their countries and regions. MANAGING MINING FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 98 6.4.1 Considering the overall impacts of mining Traditionally, governments have focused mainly on fiscal benefits from mining, while putting a low priority on environmental and social costs of mining. Using tools such as SESAs, EIAs and Cost-Benefit Analysis and listening to communities is helpful for making an assessment of mining projects and activities that is more holistic and balanced. Strategic Environmental and Social Assessments (SESAs) and Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs), conducted before mine development, play an important role in assessing the overall impact of mining development, as they complement economic analyses (See Section 5.2 on Environmental and social impact assessment). Listening to local communities can uncover important evidence and knowledge to inform decisions about mining projects and overall mining sector strategies. For example, the government of Western Australia has undertaken the \u201cBrowse LNG Precinct Strategic Social Impact Assessment\u201d259 as a planning diagnostic tool to determine the consequences of opening the Kimberley region to resource development and identify long-term strategies and actions. Another important tool is a cost-benefit analysis (CBA). Cost-benefit analysis is a comprehensive form of project evaluation that lists economic, social and environmental impacts of a given activity on the region or the country, and attributes monetary value to these impacts. The activity or activities evaluated could be a single project, a series of investments in a given region, or a whole industry. By converting various impacts into monetary measures, CBA allows comparing positive and negative impacts to determine if there are net benefits of the activity \u2013 in this case mining activity. To do that, CBA uses methodologies that are by now well-established in environmental economics, such as the contingent valuation method, hedonic pricing method and travel cost method. CBA helps decision makers consider trade-offs and determine whether mining is the optimal development option. CBA can provide credible results and findings which can be used for communicating about projects and policy decisions and for facilitating community engagement in deciding for or against mining. Cost-benefit analysis is used by international organizations, as well as by many governments. For example, the government of Australia uses cost- benefit analysis to evaluate major infrastructure investment decisions.260 Some Australian states request cost-benefit analyses when evaluating large mining investment proposals.261 The International Finance Corporation, part of the World Bank Group, provides support to help governments use cost- benefit analysis to assess large mining projects.262 The main downside of the cost-benefit analysis approach is that it cannot capture impacts on intangible values. Cultural, environmental and strategic losses are difficult or impossible to capture in monetary terms. For example, it is very difficult to put a value on the loss of a sacred site for indigenous communities that results from a mine site construction. In deciding the payment of AUD 3 million to the Ngaliwurru and Nungali indigenous groups as compensation for the loss of access to a sacred site at Timber Creek, an Australian judge admitted that there was no clear way to calculate the value of cultural loss.263 Moreover, attributing a monetary value to certain impacts, such as the loss of human life or the extinction of animal species, is considered morally or ethically wrong. 6.4.2 To mine or not to mine?

Box 24 \u201cNo-go\u201d zones for mining in the Philippines264 In an attempt to balance mining rights and environmental concerns, the Philippines government has defined areas where mining projects are forbidden. The 1992 National Integrated Protected Area System classified protected areas and declared certain categories of protected areas as strictly \u201cno- go zones\u201d for mining. The 1995 Philippine Mining Act also identified areas closed to mining. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources has developed a \u201cno-go\u201d zones map for mining, which is used in the issuance of new permits. However, the Philippines government still has to deal with mining permits already issued in protected areas. total benefits of mining activity. If a government decides that mining is not appropriate for a given area, it can issue a blanket prohibition forbidding mining activities in that area (setting \u201cno-go\u201d zones for resource extraction). For instance, declaring a site to be a natural park or preserved area can make it off-limits for mineral exploration and exploitation. In 2003, member companies of the ICMM, representing some of the world\u2019s largest companies, voluntarily committed to not to do exploration and mining in World Heritage Sites; this was a significant milestone. Some countries, such as the Philippines, have issued such blanket prohibitions to protect the environment and to preserve indigenous cultures (See Box 24). Prohibiting mining in areas where mining is already taking place is problematic for both the government and investors. Governments take different approaches to this problem \u2013 some annul existing licences and contracts, while others apply the prohibition to new projects only. If they annul existing mining licences, governments can be subject to legal claims, particularly if the country is a signatory to investment treaties protecting investors\u2019 interests (See Section 4.3.1 on Investment treaties). Moreover, cancelling licenses can have negative reputational consequences for the country, deterring future investment. It is also likely to lead to the abandonment of opened mine sites, with possible continued environmental impacts even after mining operations are ceased. At the same time, if prohibition of mining is only applicable to new projects, the benefits for the environment and biodiversity can be very limited. While it may seem obvious, the main way to address these problems is to prevent them. That means that governments should make decisions on whether mining activities should be prohibited before mining exploration and extraction permits are issued and investments are made. Detailed mapping is critical for governments and companies in making such early decisions, and such mapping requires ground surveys, which are usually costly and time consuming.

To be realized, strategies for leveraging mining for sustainable development should be articulated, operationalized into actions, and integrated into plans and policies. Possible entry points where this can be done include: \u2022 Integrating into national and regional development plans: Many countries in Asia and the Pacific use national development plans to guide their development efforts over the medium and long term. In countries that rely on such development plans, articulating the government\u2019s intent with regard to mining in national or regional development plans is important to shape government policies and inform investors\u2019 decisions. In other countries, regional development plans play a more prominent role. Regional development plans provide a blueprint to address future needs for housing, jobs, infrastructure and a healthy environment. Changes to the economy and social structure of a region, triggered by large mining projects need to be understood and integrated in government planning. \u2022 Integrating into fiscal revenue projections, and medium- and long-term budget plans. In countries with a large resource industry, taxes and royalties paid by mining projects account for a significant share of the government budget. In these countries, mining accounts for a large proportion of fiscal revenues, so budget planning needs to factor mineral price volatility and, where relevant, the decline of revenues due to depletion of mineral resources (See Section 6.1.3 on Managing fiscal revenues from mining). \u2022 Integrating into macroeconomic policies: Rapid mining growth can prompt currency appreciation and inflate the cost of labour and other resources. Governments need to factor in mining cycles and long-term mining prospects when devising their macroeconomic policies, so that they stimulate the long-term competitiveness of non-mining sectors. \u2022 Integrating into land use plans or spatial plans. Governments need to factor in mineral reserves and mining projects when planning land use and allocating land permits. For example, the government of New South Wales, Australia, has developed Strategic Regional Land Use Plans267 in response to concerns about the expansion of mining and competition for land with the agricultural industry. The plans provide a strategic framework for identifying strategic agricultural land and critical industry clusters which need to be protected from mining development. \u2022 Integrating into infrastructure plans. Infrastructure investment by mining companies can drive the development of regional infrastructure, if it is coordinated with existing infrastructure and with public infrastructure investment plans. Integrating mining infrastructure investments into government infrastructure planning can help avoid duplication, improve efficiencies, create economies of scale, enhance public benefits and address cumulative impacts.268 \u2022 Integrating into public service delivery plans. When planning for the delivery of public services, such as health, education or water supply, governments need to take into account changes 266 Intergovernmental Forum on Mining, Minerals 2013. 267 State of New South Wales, Australia 2012b. 268 For policy papers and toolkits on shared use of infrastructure between the resource sector and the rest of the economy, see the website of the Columbia Center for Sustainable Investment \u201cLeveraging Mining-Related Infrastructure Investments for Development\u201d.

Box 25 Mining and regional infrastructure planning in Australia269 The Government of South Australia produced in 2014 the Regional Mining and Infrastructure Plan to define how mining activities can contribute to the development of South Australia, identify infrastructure challenges that could constrain this contribution, identify potential infrastructure solutions which will support mining, and integrate them into the State\u2019s broader economic development. The plan has received funding from the State and the Commonwealth (Australian federal government). The plan is based on an assessment of the economic, social and environmental contribution of each infrastructure option to South Australia and its regions, including interaction with other economic sectors, and sets priority actions for the government. As part of its planning process, the government of South Australia has produced several other reports to inform development decisions including: three subregional reports for the Eyre and Western region, the Yorke and Mid North/Braemar region and the Far North region, which propose roadmaps that identify infrastructure solutions to maximize the net benefits to South Australia by improving connectivity from existing mines and by reducing infrastructure-related risks.270 induced by mining activities, additional public service needs stemming from these changes, and additional fiscal resource needs. The inflow of migrants to work in mining can overwhelm local government services and utilities. Without considering this sudden increase in demand for services, local communities might find themselves short on water, electricity, housing, health and other services. Governments should also integrate into their plans the various community development initiatives financed or implemented by mining companies. \u2022 Integrating into", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4df2aa21-d2fd-4ee9-87a9-7d129ff72149": {"__data__": {"id_": "4df2aa21-d2fd-4ee9-87a9-7d129ff72149", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Managing mining for sustainable development - A Sourcebook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5ab5b7e496b66d2de752471452237e538e4cf05871365a86b7c6d50ced3f3341"}, "3": {"node_id": "55b44f0c-2feb-4017-9139-dfaed582b91c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/managing-mining-sustainable-development-sourcebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "43dae3ed9aa8bd93f25954219d545242d16e7c2a559ff088beed074527bdec42"}}, "hash": "7b21419d310ff96aaa7d7271b1a0080e0774edc6d8027439fe656af3b5f23f9c", "text": "human resource development planning and education sector policies: The ability of a country or region to benefit from its mining sector depends on the quality of its human resources. Governments \u2013 in collaboration with mining and other industries \u2013 should devise and implement human resource development programmes for mining and other sectors into which they seek diversification. Such integration can help improve the horizontal coherence of policies and laws and coordinate government actions \u2013 for example, between government agencies responsible for mining policies, permitting, environmental regulation, resettlement, local development, infrastructure, education and many others. It can also strengthen vertical coherence \u2013 between central and subnational governments, as well as with international bodies. Governments are important, but are not the only actors that determine how mining impacts on the economic, social and environmental dimensions of development. They need to collaborate with mining companies, local communities, international actors and other stakeholders in a way that promotes good environmental stewardship, efficient resource extraction, human rights, and the enhancement of economic benefits from mining. MANAGING MINING FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 102 RECOMMENDATIONS Realizing and enhancing the benefits from mining Designing and instituting progressive fiscal regimes that balance between the financial returns to the country (or the government) and those to the mining companies, in line with international comparisons Making use of tools such as project-level mining fiscal models to estimate the government \u201dtake\u201d from mining projects to design fiscal regimes and negotiate with mining companies Ensuring that the fiscal regime is stable over time, which in the long term would help to move towards greater reliance on legal frameworks, rather than mining contracts At the same time, ensuring flexibility of the fiscal regime to respond to the cyclical nature of the minerals and metals commodities markets, by building in contract negotiation clauses Ensuring transparency of the fiscal regime (in the flows of resource revenues and in mining contracts) and access to information, by drawing on international transparency initiatives such as the EITI; ensuring a relatively straightforward fiscal regime that does not obscure transparency; and fostering an overall culture of transparency Managing the volatility of resource revenues by using tools such as structural budget rules developed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and designing and instituting natural resource funds Investing resource revenues in a way that increases (or does not deplete) the national wealth, into infrastructure, social service provision, financial assets and alternative sources of growth, setting priorities that are consistent with the country\u2019s level of development and needs Using a combination of strategies to improve the competitiveness of domestic workers and firms and to set local content requirements to help enhance the benefits from the mining sector for employment, business development, and economic growth Collaborating with and fostering collaboration between mining companies in oder to design and implement local development initiatives, community development agreements and skills development initiatives Supporting the capacity of local communities impacted by mining to take greater advantage of local development opportunities Encouraging local development initiatives by mining companies to be synergized with government plans and programmes Integrating the country\u2019s mining sector strategies with other plans and policies, such as national and regional development plans, fiscal revenue projections and budget plans, macroeconomic policies, land use plans, infrastructure plans, public service delivery plans, human resource development plans and education policies; and ensuring coherence between plans, policies, strategies and laws REALIZING AND ENHANCING THE BENEFITS FROM MINING 103 Accenture. 2010. \u201cUsing Autonomous Equipment to Achieve High Performance in the Mining Industry: Is There a Benefits Case for Broader Adoption?\u201d Adam, A.B., J.R.

Its mandate is to foster cooperation between its 53 members and 9 associate members. ESCAP provides the strategic link between the global and country-level programmes and issues. It supports governments in consolidating regional positions and advocates regional approaches to meeting the unique socioeconomic challenges in a globalizing world. The ESCAP office is located in Bangkok. The Asian Development Bank\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to a large share of the world\u2019s poor. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth and regional integration. Based in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, guarantees, grants and technical assistance. The United Nations Development Programme works in about 170 countries and territories, helping to achieve the eradication of poverty, and the reduction of inequalities and exclusion. We help countries to develop policies, leadership skills, partnering abilities, institutional capabilities and build resilience in order to sustain development results.

The theme of the 2018 High-level Political Forum, \u2018Transformation Towards Sustainable and Resilient Societies\u2019, is therefore deeply resonant for policymakers, citizens and businesses in a changing Asia-Pacific region. The countries of the Asia-Pacific region are, in a sense, well versed in transformation. They have dealt with financial crises in the last century, and seized opportunities to strengthen the foundations for economic resilience and dynamism. As our 2017 report pointed out, countries have made impressive gains in reducing income poverty, and the region has transformed from one of the poorest in the world to one that is now an engine of the global economy. That progress is not universal, however, nor is it guaranteed to continue. Further transformations that will allow us to realize the 2030 Agenda are urgently needed. We live in a world of increasingly unpredictable and complex risks. Trends such as demographic change, rural\u2013urban transitions, technology change and climate change are reshaping our region. We need to be much better prepared to deal with the interlinked impacts of long-term trends, and deal with the inevitable changes the future will bring. It is increasingly urgent to understand how best we can realize the transformations that will ensure that we achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A stronger focus on resilience can support these efforts; for example, it will be essential to incorporate a stronger focus on risk and resilience into the region\u2019s strategies for financing development. Innovation will also be vital, enabling us to turn new challenges and risks into opportunities for transformation in line with the SDGs. Together, we must help people, institutions and the region \u2018bounce back\u2019 from new shocks and stresses by pursuing new and more sustainable development paths. This report takes stock of the changing nature of risk in Asia and the Pacific, and the stresses, shocks and opportunities that are affecting a diverse region\u2019s prospects for achieving the SDGs. It quantifies the effects of selected natural hazards, commodity shocks and pollution shocks on the region\u2019s fundamental human systems. It highlights practical efforts being made by citizens, civil society, government and the private sector to build resilience capacities. It urges attention on the need to strengthen our ability to transform our societies if we are to achieve the SDGs. We are pleased to issue this joint report as a contribution to the ongoing regional and global dialogue on pathways to achieving sustainable development.

Explanatory notes Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies in Asia and the Pacific xii Executive summary People across the Asia-Pacific region live with diverse and interlinked risks. These risks are related to increasingly severe and complex shocks to the political, social, economic and ecological systems that underpin human development. The impacts of such shocks often fall disproportionately on the most marginalized groups and communities, and so have the potential to undermine the region\u2019s potential for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The region\u2019s resilience must be tapped more effectively to deal with this complex risk landscape. Resilience enables individuals, communities and systems to survive, adapt and grow in the face of stress and shocks; to convert risks into opportunities; and to transform when conditions require it. The actions required to strengthen resilience can be understood in terms of inter-related and complementary resilience capacities: z Anticipatory capacity: the ability of human systems to anticipate and reduce the impact of shocks through preparedness and planning. Several SDGs make explicit links to resilience and numerous goals have targets and indicators that capture dimensions of resilience. Resilience and disaster risk reduction are central to the SDGs, particularly SDGs 1, 11 and 13, and poor people are especially vulnerable to the impacts of natural hazards. Effective social protection systems, as anticipated under SDG 1, can help strengthen the resilience of individuals and households to stresses and shocks. Current and future vulnerabilities need to be factored into programmes; SDG 9 focuses on the resilience of connectivity infrastructure, particularly transport and information and communications technology. The region will need to adopt more resilient approaches to infrastructure development, with a focus on protecting ecosystems. Resilience in the SDGs z Absorptive capacity: the ability of human systems to absorb and cope with the impacts of shocks and stresses. z Adaptive capacity: the ability of human systems to change in response to multiple, long-term and future risks, and to learn and adjust after a shock materializes. z Transformative capacity: the ability to take deliberate steps to change systems that create risks, vulnerability and/ or inequality. This report presents a three-step approach for incorporating resilience thinking into policymaking to build resilience capacity. The approach: (1) identifies risks; (2) explores the potential impacts on human systems and vulnerable groups; and (3) identifies policies and institutional responses that build these resilience capacities. The application of the three-step approach in the case of food systems reveals the emerging risks of climate change and demographic changes to these systems. For example, 73 per cent of food commodity trade networks in the Asia-Pacific region exhibited signs of weakening resilience in 1986\u20132013, and the report identifies policy options to strengthen the resilience capacities of food systems. The changing nature of risk in Asia and the Pacific Trends including demographic change, rural\u2013urban transitions, increasing demand for natural resources, globalization and economic liberalization, climate change and technological progress are reshaping the Asia-Pacific region. These trends can create important opportunities for countries to make progress towards the SDGs, but also increase and complicate some of the risks to the human systems that define the ways that societies function. An exploration of the first steps of the approach proposed in this report points to some emerging sources of risks in the region, and underlines the fact that each subregion faces different challenges. These sources of risk as highlighted in consultations xiii include: the implications of ageing for financial systems; the impacts of rural\u2013urban transitions and commodity shocks on financial and food systems; the looming impacts of pollution on health and economic productivity; the impacts of a changing climate on provisioning systems, and the potential for social conflict; and the implications of economic structure change for dietary patterns and for health-care burdens on government budgets. Some groups or communities are disproportionately exposed to risks and are more vulnerable to the changing risk profile of the Asia-Pacific region \u2013 and specific analysis for each context is needed. This report assesses the impact of selected recurrent shocks to illustrate the diverse range of challenges to which human systems in the Asia-Pacific region must build their resilience.

Flooding is one of the most pervasive recurrent shocks, affecting South Asia in particular. Between 1970 and 2016, some 35 per cent of floods in the region occurred here; in August 2017 alone, intense monsoon rains affected 40 million people in Bangladesh, India and Nepal, claimed nearly 1,300 lives, put 1.1 million people in relief camps, and brought major cities to a standstill. By some estimates, floods could cost the subregion as much as $215 billion each year by 2030. z Commodity price shocks: Economic dependence on commodity exports impacts the resilience and vulnerability of financial and social systems and results in high carbon intensity. Oil price slumps in 2014 had severe economic and financial consequences in Central Asia. In Azerbaijan for example, for every 1 per cent change in crude oil prices, household expenditures changed by 0.94 per cent; economic growth rates dropped from 6 per cent to \u20133 per cent, and financial reserves shrank by 56 per cent in just two years. In some countries, youth unemployment increased. Reliance on oil also results in high carbon intensity, whereas economic diversification can support low carbon development. z Pollution shocks: Pollution events that lead to severe, concentrated pollution within a short period of time can pose severe shocks to human systems. Welfare losses from exposure to ambient and household air pollution are estimated to have cost South and South-East Asia and the Pacific the equivalent of 7.5 per cent of regional gross domestic product. Recurrent transboundary smoke and haze in South-East Asia, caused by forest and peatland fires, has had severe social and economic effects in the subregion, affecting people in multiple countries. In 2015 alone, more than 500,000 cases of acute respiratory infection were recorded, while transport and logistics systems were disrupted, resulting in losses of up to $1.3 billion, and total losses of about $16 billion for the Indonesian economy. Building resilience capacities Fortunately, there are encouraging signs that many countries and communities are beginning to build resilience capacities to manage such shocks, and are already realizing the benefits. There are also initial emerging signs that countries are starting to look at policies and systems to build transformative capacities. This report provides several examples of where resilience has been successfully strengthened through appropriate actions. z Anticipatory capacity: Knowledge, information and experience are essential elements of anticipatory capacity, and education and effective communication can play a vital role. Many countries have set up early warning systems to help them avoid or reduce the impact of hazards such as floods, landslides, storms and forest fires. However, the realization of anticipatory capacity requires translating information and knowledge into action, and needs to take social, cultural and gender considerations into account. z Adaptive capacity: Diverse efforts that build adaptive capacity by reducing exposure and vulnerability are underway across the region, using a variety of measures including prudent macroeconomic and fiscal policies, integrating risk information into key sectoral policies (e.g. agricultural development), and mainstreaming risks (e.g. climate change- related) into national planning and budgeting. Most countries in the region have begun to incorporate climate risk into national and sectoral planning, including through National Adaptation Plans and Nationally Determined Contributions, and in some cases, this information is being used to determine resource allocation. There are also more Executive Summary Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies in Asia and the Pacific xiv localized examples of building adaptive capacity. Further, diversifying income sources and forms of capital can help to build resilience at individual and household levels. z Absorptive capacity: One crucial aspect of building absorptive capacity is to increase the options through which basic needs can be met in times of crisis. Many countries in the region are investing in social protection systems that can help build general resilience by providing income and health security, in particular to vulnerable populations. Some countries have universal old-age pension coverage. z Transformative capacity: While much more needs to be done to achieve transformation towards the sustainable development required in the region, there are examples of important steps to change the underlying systems and build the capacity to make deliberate change. Examples include the transfer of responsibility for forest management to the communities that rely on these forests for their livelihoods, and the amendment of policies and regulations to promote renewable and clean energy. Larger-scale transformations can be triggered in response to a crisis, as in the case of public health emergency responses that have triggered a series of interventions, from creating awareness to planning", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f7b9f4bd-9f6c-4b1b-ba66-41332e546f4f": {"__data__": {"id_": "f7b9f4bd-9f6c-4b1b-ba66-41332e546f4f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/transformation-towards-sustainable-and-resilient-societies-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/transformation-towards-sustainable-and-resilient-societies-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d689649cd60b1d8bf1d1aaca0b9521910d1d449cf27983a9a0d6e8bcee88d461"}}, "hash": "d689649cd60b1d8bf1d1aaca0b9521910d1d449cf27983a9a0d6e8bcee88d461", "text": "and putting a new public health emergency system in place. Towards transformation The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development states global leaders\u2019 determination to \u201ctake the bold and transformative steps needed to shift the world on to a sustainable and resilient path\u201d. Transformation requires breaking through the \u2018path dependency\u2019 that defines the way things are done. This report identifies three barriers to transformation that make change difficult. The first is inadequate human and institutional capacity; the second is institutional rigidity, which diminishes institutions\u2019 capacity to evolve; and the third is inadequate social momentum for change. Socio-cultural factors, gender and other dimensions of inequality, and imbalances in access to decision-making also affect prospects for transformation. Taking into account experiences across the region, the scale of change needed, and the imperative to ensure inclusive transformation, four strategies for transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies are proposed: (1) transformative learning as part of the policy cycle; (2) deeper social engagement to promote broad-based stakeholder support for change; (3) social enterprise to connect poverty alleviation, sustainability and resilience-strengthening objectives with economic objectives; and (4) diversifying financing and investment to maximize options when crisis strikes or opportunities arise, and also to promote inclusion. The many international agreements that countries in the Asia-Pacific region have signed \u2013 not least the 2030 Agenda \u2013 provide a framework around which discussions can be based, efforts coordinated and progress measured. There is every reason to believe that the Asia-Pacific region can increase the resilience of its societies and pursue development pathways that truly leave no one behind. xv Overview This report contributes to regional and global dialogue on the theme of the 2018 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, \u2018Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies\u2019, from an Asia-Pacific perspective. It explores how resilience thinking can strengthen public policy to enable the transformation towards sustainable societies envisaged by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Chapter 1 sets out the relevance of the theme for achieving the 2030 Agenda in the Asia-Pacific region, and the steps needed to build the four key resilience capacities: absorptive, adaptive, anticipatory and transformative. It presents a three- step approach for incorporating resilience into policymaking that: (1) identifies risks; (2) explores the potential impacts on human systems and vulnerable groups; and (3) identifies policies and institutional responses that build these resilience capacities. Chapter 2 explores the first two steps, reviewing the main underlying sources of risks in the region. It assesses the impacts of various types of recurrent shocks on human systems in the region, with a focus on the most vulnerable people in society. A Special Feature of the report takes stock of the situation in the region with respect to the SDGs that explicitly refer to resilience. Chapter 3 supports the final step: the identification of policy and institutional responses. It shows how each of the four different types of resilience capacity can be built, presenting a range of examples of policies and programmes, from across the region, that have proven effective. It draws conclusions on the key characteristics that individuals, organizations and societies need to become resilient. Chapter 4 concludes the report by considering opportunities to support transformation for resilience, particularly through regional cooperation. Overview Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies in Asia and the Pacific 2 1.1 Risk and resilience in the Asia-Pacific region People in Asia and the Pacific today face increasingly diverse and interlinked risks, which are increasing in severity. For example, recent projections from the Asian Development Bank (ADB)1 highlight the current and potential impacts of climate change in the Asia-Pacific region. Similarly, recent research from the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP)2 shows how climate change magnifies the risks associated with disasters, while increasing the costs of protecting people against them. Trends such as demographic change, rural\u2013urban transitions, increasing demand for natural resources, technology change and climate change are reshaping our region. These large-scale processes and their interactions can have major effects on critical human systems. Human systems are the combination of political, social, economic and ecological systems that underpin human development.3 Combined, these trends are leading to increasingly complex and unpredictable outcomes for societies in the region, with disproportionate impacts on marginalized groups and communities which have the potential to undermine hard-won development gains. These developments make achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the central aspiration of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \u2013 \u201cto leave no one behind\u201d \u2013 ever more challenging. Furthermore, challenges that were once localized can now escalate into global crises, due to the increasingly integrated nature of human systems.

Protests and riots, triggered by rising prices, broke out in 48 countries; in some places, these exacerbated ongoing political crises.4 The Asia-Pacific region\u2019s resilience \u2013 its ability to absorb and recover from shocks, and to adapt and transform people\u2019s structures and means for living in the face of long-term stresses, change and uncertainty \u2013 must be \u2018tapped\u2019 more effectively to deal with this complex risk landscape. A resilient society not only responds to disruptions and crises by bringing human systems back to their previous state, but also tries to develop solutions that bring about a new state \u2013 one that is capable of addressing present and future challenges.5 In other words, resilience incorporates the ability of individuals, communities and systems to survive, adapt and grow in the face of stress and shocks; to convert risks into opportunities; and to transform when conditions require it.6 While several of the SDGs make specific reference to resilience (see the Special Feature on page 25), the relevance of resilience can be understood in the context of any of these goals. Take, for example, SDG 1: to end poverty in all forms everywhere. While economic growth can propel people above income poverty lines, shocks \u2013 such as natural hazards exacerbated by climate change, industry relocations due to technological change, or health deterioration due to exposure to pollution \u2013 can all have effects on assets, livelihoods and well-being, and push people back into poverty. Resilience is about enabling the capacities of people to anticipate and bounce back when hit by such shocks. Where possible, resilience should help people \u2018bounce forward\u2019 towards improved development outcomes. For instance, to anticipate potential job losses from technological disruptions, societies can provide vulnerable populations with training in specific skills that will allow them to find better jobs in other sectors. Building resilience requires governance approaches, institutions and policies that are better geared to dealing with risk. As discussed in Chapter 3, the scale of risks and shocks is determined by three factors: hazards, exposure and the vulnerability of a society. Hazards refer to the possible occurrence of natural or human-induced physical events that could happen, with adverse effects on vulnerable and exposed elements. The hazard can be manifest as a slow trend (e.g. air pollution or sea level rise) or a shock (e.g. a cyclone or tsunami). When it occurs, it may create little impact (e.g. a cyclone in the middle of the ocean, where no people or critical ecosystems are exposed) or a disaster (e.g. a storm surge associated with a cyclone which engulfs coastal settlements, causing deaths, injury and property damage). Poor policy choices can make a society exposed to hazards more vulnerable.7 Building resilience means being able to seize the opportunities for transformation that a crisis can sometimes present. Resilience is critical to facilitate the transition towards sustainable societies envisaged in the 2030 Agenda, and harnessing resilience will be the basis for achieving the SDGs. This report focuses on how to make sustainable devel- opment processes resilient to emerging risks and stresses. It presents a three-step approach to help policymakers explore the theme of transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies. It examines how governments, communities and other stakeholders can manage complex risks; identifies critical systems and communities vulnerable to these risks; and provides insights into the links between 3 Sustainable and resilient societies resilience capacities and the transformations needed to achieve sustainable development. In doing so, it presents a regional perspective on the theme of the 2018 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development: transforma- tion towards sustainable and resilient societies. 1.2 Understanding resilience The Asia-Pacific region confronts complex risks that originate from multiple sources. One way to understand the impacts on society of these increasingly interconnected risks is to study their impacts on the human systems that are critical for the functioning of societies. Significant human systems8 include: z economic systems, which determine how resources are allo
