Source: Article 12 of the Constitution of Sri Lanka Equality and non discrimination find a reference in all the constitutions. These rights are guaranteed only to a citizen. Caste discrimination is prohibited under the Constitutions of Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The Constitutions of Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka permit the State to introduce special laws in favor of women and children. The interim constitution of Nepal is the only constitution that prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender. Such provisions cannot be considered discriminatory in view of the articles that address substantial equality. Thus the States are empowered by their Constitutions to provide for affirmative action and to introduce temporary special measures as envisaged in Article 4 of CEDAW. A different example is in the case of Islamic Republic of Iran where the role of the woman in the family is stressed in the constitution. The Constitutions of all the countries grant a set of constitutional rights that include freedom of expression, freedom of movement, right to form associations and cultural rights. The constitutions of Afghanistan, Islamic Republic of Iran and Pakistan give supremacy to Islamic law. Box 11:Caste System in Indian Sub-Continent The caste system is peculiar to the sub continent. It is an elaborate hierarchy of birth based groups cutting across religion that form the basis of stratification. The entire structure of caste is based on endogamy and this in turn results in controlled marriages and relationships within the community. The system has also resulted in control of land and resources, by groups that are the dominant caste and hence can get interlinked with class. The Dalits, who are a cluster of castes considered \u201clowest\u201d in the hierarchy face tremendous violence with increasing crimes against them. Despite several laws in India for their protection, many practices such as the Devadasi system, where Dalit girl children are dedicated to goddesses and then forced into prostitution, and manual scavenging where men and women undertake sanitation work literally with bare hands continue even in State run systems like the railways in India. Currently public interest litigation is pending in the Supreme Court of India in this regard. The practice of un-touchability against the Dalits, continues in great measure in the sub- continent. Dalits face historical discrimination that requires many temporary special measures at various levels.

The structure of trial courts of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka and their jurisdictions are a part of their colonial legacy and have similar features with slight variations.

Afghanistan In the Islamic republic of Afghanistan, no law can be contrary to the principles of Islam. The constitution prohibits discrimination and guarantees to all citizens fundamental equal rights and duties before the law.16 Followers of other religions are free to perform religious ceremonies in accordance to the provisions of law. The legal system of Afghanistan operates at a three-tier level. The Supreme Court, courts of appeal and primary courts are the three structures with the first being the highest in hierarchy and the last court of appeal. The primary courts that are the trial courts include the juvenile court and the family issues court where disputes relating to the family are taken. There are a small number of women in the formal legal system whowork as clerks or with NGOs. Judges do not have formal legal training and there is a lack of legal texts. There is a near absence of defense lawyers both in urban and rural Afghanistan with the total number of lawyers in the country estimated at 150.17 The difficult terrain, the remoteness of the region and the lack of infrastructure has prompted the Government of Afghanistan to adopt the novel method of mobile courts that reach the litigant rather than the litigant approaching the system (Box 12). Box 12: Mobile Courts of Afghanistan In the absence of adequate qualified and legal personnel, the Government of Afghanistan has introduced the concept of mobile courts as a possible solution to the problems of accessibility and security. Mobile courts are a system where the court travels to the site of justice delivery to settle the dispute rather than being stationary in the city. The Government of Afghanistan considers that such courts have the advantage of maintaining the delivery of justice in the place where the wrong has been committed, by reducing the 16 Article 22 of the Constitution of Afghanistan. 17 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices 2007, Afghanistan, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, March 2008.

Mobile courts can improve the caliber of local justice officials, survey facilities and improve the legal awareness of local people. They could also delay or eliminate the necessity of courts in many places. Teams of experienced judges, prosecutors, lawyers and administrative officials make periodic visits to places that are too remote, to insecure or too small to have permanent staffing. With the salaries and benefits of officials already provided, the additional costs are primarily transport and accommodation. As part of the NPP in 1383, the permanent justice institutions proposed a 3-year pilot program, eventually planning one traveling court for each province. Mobile courts are considered as best practice in other countries with remote populations as in the remote aboriginal communities in Canada.

The persons who filed PILs included journalists, academics, lawyers, Doctors, activists of women\u2019s groups and human rights groups. They sought the enforcement of the constitutional rights against legal wrong. In the initial stage, PILs were filed by even sending letters to the court enclosing news reports of violations and the court treated them as a writ petition and issued many directions in this regard. The traditional rule of standing, the strict rules of evidence and the language of the law were simplified. In a PIL there is no determination or adjudication on individual rights. In a series of judgments the Court has given directions to the executive on large areas of human rights. The court also expanded the right to life guaranteed under the constitution to include the right to livelihood, right to health, right to education, the right to environment, the right to a safe working environment free of sexual harassment and the right to a fair trial process in the criminal justice system. The court has also addressed concerns relating to abuse of power and corruption in PILs.

In addition to this division there is a concurrent area where both the federal and the state governments can legislate. Family laws and criminal laws form part of the concurrent list under the Indian Constitution.30 The constitution permits judicial review of legislations while citizens can challenge new laws through the prism of constitutional validity.31 By the development of PILs, the Indian Supreme Court has expanded its scope by including under it a host of socio economic rights including the right to livelihood, education, health, privacy, environment and a right to protection from sexual harassment (Box 15).32 The Indian Supreme Court has also read the provisions of international human rights treaties to which India is a party into domestic law. The court framed guidelines on sexual harassment citing Article 11 of the CEDAW Convention, which directs the state to take appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women in the field of employment.33 This includes the prevention of sexual harassment in the workplace.

At the lowest level are the magistrate courts that try cases that are punishable with various degrees of imprisonment stipulated by different statutes. At the next tier are the session courts that try serious criminal offences and are empowered to give death sentence as a punishment. These courts also hear appeals from the magistrate courts. Special courts clothed with jurisdiction under special statutes deal with cases of corruption, and other crimes created under special laws. In the case of civil litigation, the systems also provide for different tiers, beginning from trial courts and appeal courts.

These are very powerful courts that can hear all appeals, enforce fundamental rights, issue directions to every functionary and issue writs. Judges to these courts are constitutional authorities. The Supreme Court is the highest tier in these countries, which can hear all appeals, decide constitutional matters and even adjudicate interstate disputes. The Indian Constitution is the only one in the region that permits judicial review. In Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, the Supreme Court can interpret the law but does not have the power of judicial review. The Supreme Courts of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan also have an advisory jurisdiction. Pakistan is the only country among the four detailed here that has a Federal Shariat Court. The Federal Shariat Court can on its own motion or on the petition of a citizen of Pakistan or the Federal or provincial governments examine and decide whether or not any law or provision of law is repugnant to the injunctions of Islam. If the Court decides it to be so, the law ceases to have any effect and must be amended. The Federal Court also has appellate jurisdiction over cases that are tried under Hudood law and hears appeals from decisions of criminal courts relating to the enforcement of Hudood law. An appeal from the Shariat court goes to the Supreme Court. Judges of the Shariat court are drawn from the High Courts and the Ulema, scholars of Islamic law. Cases under the Hudood law that describe certain specific categories of offences are tried by the Sessions Courts. In the case of Nepal the interim constitution provides for a three-tier system comprising the District Court at the lowest level, the Appellate Court and the Supreme Court\u2212 the highest court in the country.48 The Supreme Court has the power to interpret the constitution, issue writs, and also consider the constitutional validity of legislation thus paving the way for judicial review. 49 Maldives The Republic of Maldives is a democracy based on the principles of Islam, the state religion.50 The citizens of Maldives are equal before the law and are entitled to equal protection of the law.51 The right to life and liberty is also guaranteed under the constitution.52 Criminal defense in conformity with fair trial standards is a fundamental right.53 The right of defense has to be in accordance with the principles of Shariah.54 The legal system in Maldives is a combination of English common law for commercial matters and Islamic law in all other areas including criminal law. The presence of a large number of islands has resulted in a highly decentralized system of administration. Each inhabited island has a magistrate or Ghazi dealing with legal and criminal matters.

The constitution guarantees equality to both men and women who enjoy equal protection under the law and enjoyment of all political, economic, social and cultural rights in conformity with Islamic criteria.55 The government is obliged to ensure the rights of women in all respects, in conformity with Islamic criteria.56 Separate goals are created in addressing the role of a woman. All laws and regulations including civil, criminal, financial, economic, administrative, cultural, military, political, or otherwise must be in accordance with Islamic principles.57 The Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran is responsible for the delineation and supervision of the general policies of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Next to the Supreme Leader, the President is the highest official in the country elected by universal suffrage for a four year term. The constitution also provides for the Council of Guardians comprising of twelve jurists, six of whom are appointed by the Supreme Leader while the other six are appointed by the President on the recommendation of the head of the judiciary.58 The Council of Guardians interprets the constitution and determines if the laws passed by parliament are in accordance with Sharia. They have the power of vetoing a legislation passed by Parliament if in their opinion it is against Sharia. Prior to the Islamic Revolution, Islamic Republic of Iran had ratified the ICCPR, ICESCR,59 and later the Child Rights Convention (CRC).60 Judges in Islamic Republic of Iran serve not only to make judgments, but their functions also include to serve as prosecutor, jurist and arbiter. In many ways the system is a form of the inquisitorial system. The constitution stresses the need for an independent judiciary.61 The Chief Justice and the Public Prosecutor are required to be members of the clergy and demonstrate sufficient erudition in religious laws called Shia mujtahibds. Judges of all courts are required to be experts in Shia jurisprudence. There are four categories of civil courts and two levels of criminal courts. Women are forbidden from becoming judges by long standing edicts of Islamic jurisprudence. However, they are allowed to climb the promotion chain and advance in the judiciary on an equal basis with men by becoming legal advisers in various civil and administrative courts, prosecutors, defense attorneys, etc. 62 55 Article 20 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 56 Article 21 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 57Article 4 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 58 article 91of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 59 Iran ratified them on 4th April 1968. 60 5th September 1991. 61 Article 156 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 62 http://www.parstimes.com/women/womens_employment_situration.html 23 While the trial process in Islamic Republic of Iran is far speedier than in other countries, its duration is often limited to a few hours. Defendants can be found guilty on popular repute and the concept of a defense attorney is dismissed as a western absurdity. The charge of \u201csowing corruption on earth\u201d describes a variety of offences including insulting Islam and the clergy, opposing the Islamic revolution, supporting the Pahlavis and undermining Islamic Republic of Iran\u2019s independence.63 Alternate dispute resolution (ADR) within the community The resolution of disputes through alternate ways in the community is prevalent in Afghanistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Nepal and in many instances pre-dates the formal justice system. Such process does away with the formal requirement of evidence and is informal. Since the dispute is resolved by the community, the decisions are also speedily enforced. The settlement of such disputes is however fraught with serious concerns from a human rights perspective. Customary practices operate not only as a source of substantial law in the region as indicated earlier but also act as a source for adjudication of disputes in an alternate forum. In Afghanistan, customary law was enforced through the local Jirga, which was comprised of community members. Under the Taliban all customary laws were banned. They changed the Pashto word Jirga to the Arabic word Shura and instead of allowing the community to resolve disputes themselves, appointed the village Mullah as the head of the Shura and made him a government servant. The head then elected four others to constitute the Shura. With the defeat of the Taliban the old system of customary laws is slowly being practiced. But regardless of law enforcement before the Jirga or the Shura, women cannot be members. The Constitution of Afghanistan does not explicitly prohibit such practices. In Pakistan the Jirga is commonly referred to as", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5660b673-5add-4d4d-b128-ac1c92917422": {"__data__": {"id_": "5660b673-5add-4d4d-b128-ac1c92917422", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "38e38be065bddf595f0835fc4a1481e1ef77951ce8e624323b0bf86a183136a0"}}, "hash": "38e38be065bddf595f0835fc4a1481e1ef77951ce8e624323b0bf86a183136a0", "text": "a tribal justice system. As in Afghanistan, elder men of the community comprise the Jirga. The disputes before the Jirga cover a broad spectrum from small claims to large disputes relating to land, money and disputes within the family. However the Jirga also judge crimes and impose punishment on those charged with Zina (adultery) by stoning or death. In India and Nepal, disputes are settled by caste elders in caste Panchayats, ranging from enforcing customary divorce to permitting bigamous marriage. Minor disputes such as theft of cattle or crops are also brought before the informal legal systems. However the settlement of disputes by caste Panchayats has led to major human rights violations of including death, excommunication from the community and social ostracisation. Over the years these forums have also served the rich and powerful elements of the community. Measures to curb and ban them by court orders have not been successful since they enjoy tremendous community support.64 63 Abrahamian Ervand, Tortured confessions, University of California Press 1999 page 125. 64 In 2004, the Sindh high court banned jirgas in the state but government functionaries, including chief ministers continue to participate in such meetings. Report of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. 24 Alternate dispute resolution (ADR) formulated by the state The Lok Adalat or the people\u2019s court in India has been created under the Legal Services Authority Act of 1987 as amended in 1994. The courts operate under the formal judiciary and settle disputes that were pending for a long time in the formal justice system. Such disputes are settled by a panel comprising of lawyers, retired judges and other members drawn from civil society. A large number of civil disputes such as accident claims, default money claims, land acquisition claims, pension claims and other financial claims are settled this way and are facilitated by the various legal services authorities in the country. Once the Lok Adalat settles the dispute, the judge passes a decree on the case and the order becomes final and is executable. While a chunk of disputes have been settled this way, Lok Adalats are often critiqued as being concerned only with disposal of cases and not being sensitive to the concerns of the parties.65 4. Gender Equity in the Political Sphere Nationality and Citizenship While the terms \u201cnationality\u201d and \u201ccitizenship\u201d have similar impacts on people\u2019s lives and are often used interchangeably, they have different usages. Nationality is a term used in international law while citizenship is the term used in domestic law. While all citizens are nationals of a state, not all nationals are citizens.66 CEDAW sets global benchmark on nationality rights. It requires equal rights of men and women to acquire, change or retain nationality (Box 17) Box 17: Under Article Nine of CEDAW State parties shall grant women equal rights with men to acquire, change or retain their nationality. They shall ensure in particular that neither marriage to an alien nor change of nationality by the husband during marriage shall automatically change the nationality of the wife, render her stateless or force upon her the nationality of her husband. State parties shall grant equal rights with men with respect to the nationality of their children. Source: Article 9 of CEDAW. Citizenship under national laws is obtained in three ways. The first is the principle of Jus Sanguinis, where citizenship is determined by the citizenship of parents. Jus Soli is when citizenship is determined by the place of birth and through naturalization, which operates independently and is given at the discretion of the state. The countries in the study follow both these principles but complexities arise in the context of cases where one parent has a different nationality. The concept of nationality has traditionally been discriminatory, based on the oneness of the family and the unity of the nation, which in turn was based on the patriarchal notion that this unity should be determined only by the male \u201chead of the household\u201d. This resulted in the concept of \u201cdependant nationality\u201d that assumed that once a 65 For an excellent critique of the system, \u201c Marc Galanter and Jayanth K.

The rights of children, born to parents of different nationalities in such situations, are determined solely by that of their father. The impact of discriminatory nationality laws on the basis of gender restricts the woman\u2019s freedom to choose a residence and domicile. Children born to different nationals also risk becoming stateless in the event of the man abandoning his wife or denying paternity of the child. This in turn affects the right to education, and other social welfare benefits that might accrue to a child. In Nepal, children of sex workers faced severe consequences because their mothers could not transfer their citizenship to them.67 The laws of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, and Sri Lanka have reformed their nationality laws and entrenched the concept of non-discrimination. In the case of the Islamic Republic of Iran, women continue to retain their nationality after marriage. However, her right to possess property is restricted if it is shown to be beneficial to her foreign spouse. While the legislation permits women to retain their nationality, it does not allow an individual to renounce his or her nationality except under strict conditions. However, the domicile of a married woman is the same as that of her husband. Nevertheless where the husband has no known domicile and also when the wife has a different domicile with the consent of her husband or by sanction of a court, she can have a separate domicile.68 In Nepal, a person born, after the commencement of the Interim Constitution, whose father is a citizen of Nepal during his child\u2019s birth is a citizen of Nepal by descent.69 A corresponding right is not available to the mother. A similar provision exists under their citizenship law. The Interim Constitution however seeks to rectify this anomaly (Box 18).

Political Participation Though all countries permit women the right to vote, their participation in the electoral process is very low. While there is no direct discrimination in the context of women participating in political and public life in most countries, the discrimination is indirect and structural in the form of socio economic barriers; cultural stereotypes; limited access to information; the prohibitive costs of the process; and threats and acts of violence. In sync with CEDAW\u2019s requirements, most countries have constitution provisions on women\u2019s equal political participation.

Gender-Based Violence International human rights law guarantees various rights to an individual who is charged of an offence.75 The foundation of these rights is found in the Universal Declaration of Human rights and in the International Convention of Civil and Political rights. Some of these rights include the right to be informed about the grounds of arrest, the right to a lawyer, the right to understand the trial process in a language known to the accused, the right to appear before a court immediately, the right to bail and the right to appeal. These are considered extremely important to a fair trial process and are found in many criminal justice systems in the region. In all the countries in the study the prosecution is required to prove the guilt of the accused who is presumed innocent unless found guilty. In the context of gender based violence however, complexities emerge since the sexual nature of certain offences result in substantive and procedural laws having a strong gender bias. This in turn often results in male behavioral standards being used in the application and interpretation of the law. Gender based violence is a form of discrimination and states are obliged to eliminate violence perpetuated by public authorities and private persons.76. States are required to follow the principle of due diligence under which the state has the responsibility to prevent violations of rights or investigate and punish acts of violence perpetuated by private actors. 71 Article 46 and 114 of the Nepal constitution 72 Articles 330 and 332 of the Constitution of India. 73 The term Panchayat used here is a creation of the Constitution and should not be confused with caste Panchayats under the heading on ADR. 74 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments in India. 75 Article 9 and 14 of the ICCPR. 76 Rebecca Cook (1994) State responsibility for violation of women\u2019s human rights \u201c Harvard Human Rights Journal\u201d 7, p 125-175 29 Under the CEDAW, gender based violence is defined as violence that is directed against a woman because she is a woman or that which affects women disproportionately.77 Violence against women is \u201cany act of gender based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life. 78 The International Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination addresses sexual violence committed against women members of a particular racial and ethnic group as a form of racial discrimination.79 Under the Convention against Torture, sexual abuse and physical violence by state agents is considered torture and a violation of human rights protected under the torture convention.80 Not all gender based violence in the region is of sexual nature. Deliberate denial of adequate health care during pregnancy, withdrawal of food to the girl child, forced physical labor, driving a woman to suicide are all examples of gender based violence. Customary practices such as dowry, forced marriages, violation of free speech norms, domestic violence, honor crimes, witch-hunting, female genital mutilation, sex determination and sex selective abortion are some of the other examples that result in violence.81 Same sex behaviour among consenting adults is an offence in all the countries defined variously as against the order of nature in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka and as Hadd in case of Islamic Republic of Iran. The Delhi High Court has struck down this provision as discriminatory and unconstitutional with the case pending adjudication before the Indian Supreme Court.82 This section looks at the de jure position of some of the critical areas relating to gender violence Common Customary Practices in the Region The following are some of the customary practices in the sub region that have an impact on gender based violence. All relationships are within the framework of marriage. A very high premium is placed on a woman\u2019s marital status and being single is not encouraged. Despite Islamic law being more progressive with reference to status of divorcees and widows, social norms operate against single women. Women who have relationships outside the institution of marriage are often 77 CEDAW general recommendation NO 19, paragraph 6 78 UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women adopted by the General Assembly resolution 48/104, 20 December 1993. 79 The UN International Convention on the Elimination of All forms of Racial Discrimination ( ICERD) General recommendation No 25; Gender-related dimensions of racial discrimination.

In some countries such as Iran such relationships are considered an offence inviting severe punishment. a) Child marriage: Sanctioned by law in some countries, the caste system and kinships among tribes strictly control relations in the family and provide for marriage within one\u2019s own community at a very early age. b) Forced marriages: Marriage by choice though permitted by law is not a common practice. Arranged marriages within one\u2019s community are common. People who make their own choice or marry outside the community are subject to violence. It should be noted that not all arranged marriages are forced. c) Dowry: The custom of dowry exists in Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan and cuts across religion. The system is one where property or valuable security are given or agreed to be given to the bridegroom\u2019s family by the bride\u2019s family at the time of marriage or in connection with the marriage and are most often demanded by the man\u2019s family. These demands include both movable and immovable such as money, vehicles, furniture, house, gold jewels, silver to name a few Among certain communities, the marriage expenses and expensive gifts to the husband\u2019s relatives are also borne by the woman\u2019s family. The practice of dowry has resulted in significant violence against women ranging from harassment, abuse, assault, murder and suicides. Box 20: Dowry Deaths and Honor Killings The two practices are manifestations of severe violence against women. While dowry deaths are violence caused by the husband and his family who kill the bride, \u201cHonor killings\u201d relate to the death of the woman due to a variety of causes as defined in under honor crimes. \u201dHonor killings\u201d are often caused by the natal family members with community sanction. At the De jure level there are laws to tackle both forms of crimes in the countries of the region. The practice of dowry and that of \u201cHonor Killings\u201d have community sanction making it a greater challenge to address the crime. Source: For a detailed study, Honour; Crimes, Paradiigms and Violence Against Women, Lynn Welchman and Sara Hossain, 2005 Zed Publications d) Fatwas: Actually an advisory opinion concerning religious law and religious edict, Fatwas are often issued by self-styled leaders of the community in reaction to any act of \u201ctransgression\u201d. As with the opinion of the caste panchayats, Fatwas enjoy community sanction and have often instigated violence against women. e) Honor crimes: The term is extremely problematic since it encompasses a variety of manifestations of violence against women including interference with choice of marriage, partner, sexual preferences, adultery, pre marital relationships and rape. \u201cHonor\u201d is defined in terms of women\u2019s assigned sexual and familial roles as dictated by traditional ideology.83 Violation of codes dictated by the family and the community is regarded as an attack on \u201chonor\u201d, \u201cprestige\u201d, \u201cGhairat\u201d or \u201cIzzat\u201d. Used in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, the term is a wide ranging masculine concept underpinning patriarchal practices (Box: 20). 83 Report of the UN Special Rapporteur, on Violence Against Women its causes and consequences, March 10 1999, para 18, UN Doc.

Sometimes traditional adjudication forums such as Panchayats and Jirgas conduct a kangaroo trial and impose punishment. The social sanction to commit such crimes is given by these forums that often operate as parallel legal systems. In Pakistan and Afghanistan, the term has different names in different provinces, \u201cKaro Kari\u201d, \u201cKalakali\u201d, \u201cSiyakari\u201d and \u201cTaurtoora\u201d.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "04145648-ccaa-424d-bcde-665baaec620b": {"__data__": {"id_": "04145648-ccaa-424d-bcde-665baaec620b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9b97af9f6b0bc1f6f5c5698182432956c59cc8784de379c3414eda1113d5efd7"}, "2": {"node_id": "1e05294c-24d3-46d5-aac2-20c05ee05e4c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "92b49e9a7222aa8022ae0fcea584fcbf4b47f7538da902d198c6dfaad335f064"}}, "hash": "971bb970c3961c071e0efba8a37bceb790bc403da3154257b32b018adf713742", "text": "Country Specific De Jure Laws Afghanistan Fair trial standards are sought to be provided under the Afghan Constitution.

Allegiance to tribes is an important identity for the people of Afghanistan. The practice of Bad or Badal where women or girls are exchanged between tribes as a method of resolving disputes are criminalized under the Afghanistan Penal Code and are in contradiction to the general rule that marriages take place only between same tribes. Sexual violence such as rape requires the victim to produce four witnesses to prove the crime. In the absence of such witnesses the woman can be charged with Zina (adultery) as she would have complained of an act of sexual intercourse. The Jirgas or community of elders, comprising of men, impose punishment that is legal under the law. Hadd and Zina make it virtually impossible for women to report sexual abuse or rape since they would not be able to obtain multiple witnesses, but having laid the charge, they could be punished for adultery. There are currently no laws relating to domestic violence and sexual harassment. The absence of legislation in Afghanistan is only a part of the problem. Judicial institutions need to be sufficiently created and strengthened in order that they can contribute to an integral process of building political, economic and social development in Afghanistan. 84 Article 32 of the Constitution of Afghanistan 85 ibid 32 The Commonalities between Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka Since the criminal justice system of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan are part of a shared legacy, the definitions relating to various offences relating to violence, are similar with certain amendments specific to the country. The Penal Code, the Evidence Act and the Criminal Procedure Code form the foundation of the criminal justice system. In the context of these countries, assault or force against a woman with intent to outrage her modesty; kidnapping and abduction of woman to compel her to marriage; inducing a girl under 18 years of age to go from any place or to do any act with the intent that she is forced or seduced into illegal sexual intercourse; or importation of a girl below 21 years of age for the purpose of selling or disposing her when she is under 18 years of age for prostitution are all offences under the various penal codes. Marital rape is an offence only when the wife is below 15 years.86 Kidnapping, abducting or inducing a woman to compel her marriage are offences under the Penal Codes of India, Bangladesh and Pakistan.87 However, the framework and the language of the law do not reflect the reality of women\u2019s lives. Broadly there are two ways in which laws define rape. First, sexual intercourse with a woman must occur and second, it must be without her consent.88 Intrinsic to the concept of rape are the notions of penetration and forced or involuntary sexual relations. Any other violent act, such as the use of objects or instruments, is treated as a different crime (outraging the modesty of a woman).89 The age of consent is 16 years and sexual intercourse below that age is statutory rape. However, the law does not recognize marital rape except when it is committed by a man on his wife if she is below 15 years90 or when it is committed after the wife obtains a decree of judicial separation.91 In the context of Pakistan, the introduction of Qisas and Diyat to the Penal Code have changed the law by introducing the concept of retribution. 92 Qisas (exact retaliation) and Diyat (monetary compensation) are forms of punishment prescribed under law. Bangladesh Bangladesh is the only country in the study that has taken serious note of the offence of acid attacks and defined acid crimes in the region. Acid attacks are committed by persons who pour or throw acid on women. Most of the time they occur when the woman has rejected the advances of the man or where the man perceives himself as jilted. Cases of men pouring acid on their wives are also common.

The Acts call for the death penalty for acid attack and further seek to provide with regulatory mechanisms addressing the creation and the sale of acids. The Speedy trial of Tribunal Act of 2002 seeks to reduce the length of trials in order to make the justice delivery system more responsive to the needs of the victims. Other provisions include protecting the privacy rights of the victim by prohibiting the media from featuring pictures of the victims of such crimes. Source: Summary record of 5th periodic report of Bangladesh to the CEDAW Commitee In January 2001, the Bangladesh High Court, issued a suo motu ruling declared Fatwas issued against women as illegal. The Court observed \u201cthe legal system of Bangladesh empowers only the Courts to decide all questions relating to legal opinion on Muslim and other Laws in force. We therefore hold that any fatwa are all unauthorized and illegal.\u201d The Court also recommended that the government should bring about \u201can unified education system that would bring freedom of religion subject to law, public order and morality within the scope of article 41(1) of the Bangladesh Constitution.\u201d Members of some extremist political groups obtained a stay of the order before the Supreme Court. Bhutan Bhutan does not have a statute relating to domestic violence but any such act is punishable with fine. The draft Penal Code seeks to define marital rape as sexual intercourse without the consent or against the will of the spouse. Criminal cases are adjudicated under a legal code established in the 17th century and revised in 1958 and 1965. Accused are entitled to legal representation from a list of lawyers maintained by the Government. India Custodial rape is committed by a police officer, public servant, or by persons managing jails, remand homes or places of custody. Here, the burden of proof is shifted to the accused as there is a presumption as to the absence of consent.94 The definition of consent has often reflected male behavioral standards in judgments of courts resulting in the accused getting acquitted. Despite the Indian Supreme Court holding that a person can be convicted on the sole testimony of the victim, many courts still look for corroboration. Courts have ruled that a victim of rape is entitled to legal assistance at the expense of the state. There is no statutory compensatory mechanism but courts have ordered compensation in individual cases. The Supreme 93 The Indian Supreme Court in a public interest litigation is considering directing the government of India to formulate similar legislation in India by citing the Bangladesh experience. 94 Articles 376 (2) a, b, c, d and e and 114 A of the Indian Evidence Act. 34 Court has also extended the concept of payment of compensation in such cases to fix the liability on those in the area where the offence was committed.95 The offence of outraging the modesty of a woman is the framework for cases of sexual harassment. The language of the law from the days of colonialism is extremely problematic casting a burden to prove \u201cmodesty\u201d on the woman. In the absence of a statute on sexual harassment this is the provision under which criminal cases are filed for all forms of harassment and sexual assault short of rape and attempted rape. The Dowry Prohibition Act of 1961 prohibits the giving and the taking of a dowry and makes these acts a crime. Under law even the bride\u2019s parents can be prosecuted for the offence though there are hardly any cases in this regard. Despite outlawing dowry the law holds that any dowry that is given is for the benefit of the wife or her heirs. Due to the increasing practice of dowry and with increased campaigns by the women\u2019s movement, the Penal Code was changed to include mental and physical cruelty towards a married woman as an offence.

A person who abets the commission of a suicide commits an offence under the Penal Code.99 If a married woman commits suicide within seven years of marriage and it is shown that her husband or his family has subjected her to cruelty, a presumption is raised that they may have abetted her suicide.100 All these offences are in the context of the institution of marriage and not applicable to women in relationships outside the marriage. 95 Chairman Railway Board and others vs Chandrima Das and others All India Reporter, 2000 Supreme Court, page 988.

It does not exclude from its purview women who are governed by different personal laws. It is inclusive in its definition and even those women who are sisters,widows, and mothers have a right of residence in the shared households and can get protective orders from courts. The Act recognizes physical abuse, mental abuse, sexual abuse and economic abuse as forms of violence and recognizes the concept of shared household. It provides for \u2018stop violence\u2019 orders, and gives effect to the guarantee of immediate protection. This legislation has been of particular importance for redefining relationships and addressing the gendered power inequality in the family. Kidnapping from lawful guardianship is also an offence. Since the lawful guardian of a minor is the father when minors elope or run away fearing family pressure, it results in the commission of an offence. Fathers seeking to retrieve their daughters from the men whom they choose to marry or live with bring charges of kidnapping, abduction and inducing their daughters to compel them into marriage. Any person above the age of 18 years in the case of a female and 21years in the case of a male have a right to marry a person of their own choice. Pre-marital relationships among adults are not prohibited under the law though they do not guarantee any civil rights such as inheritance. Under the Domestic Violence Act, women in live-in relationships are entitled to a right of residence in the shared household and can claim compensation. . The law criminalizes adultery when it is committed only by a married woman and gives a right to her husband to make a complaint.101 The woman is not treated as an accused but the person with whom it is alleged that she has had a relationship is treated as one and can face five years imprisonment. Adultery committed by a single woman is not a crime. The constitutional validity of this provision has been challenged on the grounds of discrimination but the Supreme Court has refused to strike it down on the grounds that when a person \u201ctrespasses into a marriage, he is an offender\u201d.102 Bigamy is an offence punishable up to seven years imprisonment.

In cases of rape, the woman\u2019s charge needs to be proved by two men or four women witnesses. Given the requirements of strict rules of evidence, cases are rarely proven. However a woman\u2019s pregnancy may establish her commission of this offence even when she is a victim of sexual abuse or rape. This could include even a pregnant minor (below 18 years) being sentenced to punishment. Zina is the exception to the rule that puts a minimum age limit of eighteen years on a person to receive adult punishment. The sentence in relation to Zina allows for public lashings. There are no statutes on domestic abuse or sexual harassment. Nepal Nepal is the only country in the region to recognize freedom from domestic violence as a constitutional right in its Interim Constitution. It is yet to formulate legislation relating to domestic violence and on sexual harassment. The laws of Nepal are exhaustively contained in Mulki Ain, or country code that is in the process of change. Confessions before the police are legal under the law unless they are retracted. There is no difference in the evidentiary requirements between a male and a female. While marital rape is not yet prohibited under legislation, the development of marital rape by judicial precedent is path breaking (Box 22). Box 22: Nepal\u2019s Supreme Court Vocal Stand on Crime of Marital Rape The offence of Rape as detailed in the statutory law exempted marital rape. A judgment of the Nepal Supreme court held that such an exemption was violation of the obligation of Nepal to CEDAW and other treaties. The court reasoned that if an act is an offence by its very nature, it is unreasonable to say that it is not an offence merely because different categories of individuals commit the act and held that to say that a husband can rape his wife after marriage denies a woman\u2019s independent existence, her right to live with self respect, and her right to self determination. Nepal is the only country in the study that now addresses marital rape as a crime. Source: Forum for law and development (FWLD) vs his majesty\u2019s government Writ no 55/048, Supreme Court decided on May 2, 2002 Pakistan The criminal justice system of Pakistan, though similar in its origin to the system in Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka, was Islamicized to introduce the concept of Qisas. Under the system of qisas,103 a person convicted of an offence can be punished by causing similar hurt that was caused to the victim. If the victim was killed, the sentence of death could also be executed in the same manner that resulted in the death of the victim. 103 Qisas are defined under Section 299 k of the Pakistan Penal Code as punishment by causing similar hurt at the same part of the body of the convict as has been caused to the victim or by causing his death if he has committed Qatl-i-Amd in exercise of the right of the victim of Wali. 37 Death penalties however cannot be imposed where the direct descendents or legal heirs, or Walis, of the victim are related to the accused. To give an example, if a man kills his wife and they have a child he will not be given the death sentence since his child is also the legal heir of the victim. A murder can be proven if the accused confesses or if there are eyewitnesses to the crime.104 Thus even though torture is expressly prohibited under the Constitution, since confessions of the accused have validity unless retracted under the Evidence Act, instances of law enforcement authorities using torture to extract confessions are not uncommon. Even though circumstantial evidence is a strong requirement of the criminal justice system, the confessions and the lack of retraction by the accused may result in a conviction. The law of evidence was amended in 1984 that devalued women\u2019s testimony as a result of which the evidence of two women is equal to that of a man.

The idea is rooted in the cultural notion that women are the custodians of family honor and by entering into an illicit relationship they tarnish the family reputation.105 The custom of Karo Kari is sometimes used to legitimize murders that are not even remotely connected to the family honor. In some cases the Kari\u2019s (victim) family demands a girl from the Karo\u2019s (accused) family in exchange for the life of the accused. Women have been killed in the name of \u201chonor\u201d in cases of perceived \u2018sexual misdemeanor\u2019 to situations where women have married by choice, refused to be forced into marriage or sought a divorce, or have been raped.106 The complexity of \u201chonor killings\u201d arises because courts permit the use of the defense of grave and sudden provocation despite such a provision no longer being available under the Penal Code after its amendment based on Islamic law.107 The defense of grave and sudden provocation is based on common law. The superior judiciary has through various decisions recreated the rule of grave and sudden provocation both on the basis of Islamic jurisprudence as well as on the grounds that the plea of diminished responsibility under grave and sudden provocation had been well- recognized in the sub-continent for more than one hundred years.108 The plea of grave and sudden provocation weaved into \u201chonor crimes\u201d has often been used in a way that reinforces patriarchal bias.109 Earlier amendments to the law were not successful and 104 Section 299 of Pakistan Penal Code. 105 Hina Jani and Eman M.

This provision continues to exist in the Indian Penal Code, the Bangladesh penal code and the Sri Lankan Penal Code. 108 See footnote 66. 109 The following cases are examples where honor killings was used as mitigating circumstances. A man who killed his mother\u2019s \u2018lover\u2019, ( Ghulam Mustafa and another vs state 1983 Pakistan Criminal Law journal p 1712 Lahore), a man who shot his ex wife because he saw her with a stranger, 38 have been critiqued as being a matter of culture.110 However some progressive judicial rulings by Supreme Court of Pakistan aim to realize the due legal rights of women (Box 23) The offence of rape is termed as Zina bil jabr while Zina is a consensual act of sex outside the institution of marriage. Under Hudood laws that criminalize such acts, rape can be committed by either a man or woman. The concept of statutory rape currently does not exist. In the past few years various legislative interventions have taken place in Pakistan addressing violence against women. In 2004, the Criminal Law Act, declared Karo Kari and other similar customary practices as criminal offences.111 The Prevention of Anti Women Practices (Criminal law Amendment) Bill of 2006sought to further amend the Pakistan Penal Code criminalizing the practice of settling disputes by marrying off girls and women and was introduced through the Criminal Law Amendment Act 2004. Under the Women's Protection Bill of 2006, women are not arrested under the Hudood Ordinance nor are they required to produce four witnesses to prove a charge of rape, as required under the zina laws (laws regarding extramarital sexual intercourse). Failure to prove a charge of rape will not attract the offence of fornication which is sexual relationship between an unmarried male and female.112 In July 2007, the Law Reforms Ordinance was promulgated, allowing women held under the Hudood Ordinance to be eligible for bail. Sexual harassment falls under the category of outraging the modesty of a woman. Stripping a woman and exposing her to public view is punished with death.113 Box 23: Pakistan\u2019s Supreme Court Stand on Honor Killing Neither the law of the land, nor religion permits so-called honor killing, which amounts to murder ( qatl-e-amd ) simpliciter.

The substantive definitions are not only discriminatory but also encourage violence against women both in the family and in society. Islamic Republic of Iran also follows the practice of Qisas (retribution or blood money), The blood money of a Muslim woman is half of that of a Muslim man.114 As an example, if a woman is murdered and her family members insist on retribution, the family of the woman is obliged to give half of the Qisas to the accused or his family. Thus, even in the retributive justice the accused stands to gain if the victim is a woman. If the father or the paternal grandfather murders his child or grandchild, the accused does not face the death penalty. But if a woman kills her children, she can be sentenced to death. The evidence of two women is the same as that of one man in certain instances while in other instances it is not sufficient in a court of law.115 Ironically, despite her evidence having no value, a girl child is treated under law as an adult after nine years of age while a boy child is an adult at the age of 15.116 Thus, girl children above nine years of age can be tried as adults in criminal trials and can face severe punishment. To give an example, if a girl child above nine years is a victim of rape, she can be charged under Zina or adultery if she is unable to prove the crime with sufficient witnesses and can be sentenced to 100 lashes. Any act deemed to be prohibited under Sharia is punishable in Islamic Republic of Iran. The definition of \u201cprohibited acts\u201d does not have a clear legal definition but is left to the discretion of the judiciary and the government agents. Certain acts such as appearance in public by women without covering the entire body, except the face and palms, are considered a \u201cprohibited act\u201d. Women who appear on streets and in public without the prescribed Hejab can face fines and lashing.117 A man and a woman enjoying each other\u2019s company even without sexual relationship can also be punished with 74 lashes.118 Transgender individuals have been classified as a distinct group separate from homosexuals and have been granted legal rights. \u201cGender identity disorder\u201d is officially recognized and the judiciary permits sexual reassignment surgery. Sri Lanka The Penal Code of Sri Lanka is part of the colonial legacy and has similar provisions as that of India and Bangladesh. The law was amended in the 1990s and certain changes were incorporated.

Marital rape is an offence only if the parties are separated by a decree of judicial separation. The Domestic Violence Act of 2005 permits courts to grant protection orders and injunctions against men who perpetuate violence. Trafficking Article 6 of CEDAW requires States parties to take appropriate measures, including legislation, to suppress all forms of traffic in women and exploitation of prostitution of women. Under the draft constitution of Bhutan women had the right to be free from all forms of discrimination and exploitation, including trafficking in women, prostitution, abuse and violence. Bhutan is the only country in the study that has made freedom from prostitution and trafficking a constitutional right thereby making it clear that prostitution was a form of discrimination. In Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka prostitution is not illegal per se, but trafficking, brothel keeping, soliciting and seducing are treated as criminal offences.122 While sex work is not an offence, the law still has ample scope for police harassment under soliciting and seduction. In Afghanistan, Maldives, Pakistan and the Islamic Republic of Iran, prostitution is illegal and those accused face criminal charges. Two kinds of trafficking take place in the countries of the study. The first is internal trafficking and the other is trans-border trafficking. The demand for cheap labor, deception and trickery resulting in transporting women for sex are common in the various countries. This results in trans-border trafficking facilitated by porous borders. Lack of employment opportunities, organized crime and the presence of organized criminal gangs, economic disparities, social discrimination, armed conflict, profitability, growing deprivation and marginalization of the poor, internal displacement, natural calamities and insufficient penalties against traffickers are some of the factors that result in trafficking being \u201ca low cost, high profit\u201d situation. Women are trafficked on promises of a better job only to find themselves forced into prostitution. In many instances the agents pay the families money to take the women. Bangladeshi and Burmese women are trafficked into India and then to Pakistan via the borders. The border police on all the sides are part and parcel of this 119 Section 364 of the Penal Code of Sri Lanka. 120 Section 364 (A) of the Penal Code of Sri Lanka. 121 Section 364 of the Penal Code of Sri Lanka. 122 The Immoral Traffic ( Prevention) Act of 1956, India, the Suppression of Immoral Traffic Act, Bangladesh, and the Country Code, Nepal. 41 network of corruption and they make it easy to get the women across without any documentation.123 A crucial problem relates to the repatriation of the woman to her country since such an act is a lengthy process requiring the permission of the various home governments, identifying the nationality of the victim by the special branch of the police and then sending the victim home. Meanwhile, the woman is kept in protective custody during a process that may take years. One of the most important requirements of repatriation is the home address of the victim. But in many cases the victims themselves are unable to provide the same. The lack of a proper birth registration system in India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Bhutan make the determination of age and identification of victims extremely difficult. Trafficking is also closely linked with kidnapping and abduction and while the countries have strict laws making such acts a serious offence, few offenders are prosecuted. It is an area where the system operates against the women in harsh ways. In Pakistan and Islamic Republic of Iran the concept of Zina does not make any difference between forced and consensual prostitution. This often results in the traffickers going free while women are charged with adultery. Trafficking is surrounded by a culture of silence, making it very difficult for any kind of action at the micro level. An added dimension to trafficking is that women come not only from impoverished backgrounds but are also from the disadvantaged classes and castes. The caste factor operates in large measure in South Asia with many Dalit women being forced into prostitution. Cultural practices such as the Devadasi system and the Deuki system in Nepal, where young Dalit girls and those of the Badi caste respectively are dedicated to a Goddess and then exploited in prostitution are common despite legislation prohibiting such practices.

Gender Equity in the Economic Sphere Women in Employment Under Article 11 of CEDAW, states are required to provide for protective legislation to ensure equality in employment. These include the right to work free choice of professions, right to equal remuneration, benefits and conditions of service, right to social security, protection of health and safe working conditions and prevention of discrimination on grounds of marital status.

A concerted effort to encourage their presence in the form of quotas would be a form of special temporary measures to address inequity. The constitutions of India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh prohibit all forms of slavery, forced labor and bonded labor. Discrimination by the state is prohibited and special measures can be taken for women and children. But the prohibition of discrimination and special measures such as quotas in jobs apply only to employment with reference to state. Private actors are exempted from the purview. The constitutions make provision for just and humane conditions for work, ensuring that women and children are not employed in hazardous tasks and that they are entitled to maternity benefits. In Maldives, sex-based discrimination in employment opportunities and remuneration is not recognized by the State as discriminatory from the principle of substantive equality.125 All countries have legislation addressing the rights of persons in employment and have put labor policies and institutions in place. 124 Global Gender Gap Index 2007, http://www.weforum.org/pdf/gendergap/index2007.pdf 125 Shadow report of Maldives to the third periodic Government Report submitted to the CEDAW Committee, 2006. 43 There is a fundamental right to form associations and to enter any lawful business in all the countries in the region. The earliest laws in the sub-region were factory laws that related to mines that were implemented under colonialism in the early part of the twentieth century. Some of these statutes, such as the Factories Act, prohibited employment of women in night shifts such as mines work. On the other hand, industries termed as essential services, such as hospitals and power supply do not have any exemption on women being employed in night shifts. In India and Pakistan, the prohibition of women working on night shifts in factories has been repealed. While this could be seen as addressing inequality, employers can now force women to work two shifts at a time or terminate their services. Such changes have more to do with the demand of market forces rather than with gender equity.

The 1980 Police Act in Bhutan discriminates against women in the Royal Bhutan Police, by limiting their functions to investigating cases involving women, handling female prisoners or directing traffic.126 Though there is no formalized gender bias in employment, a rigid division of labor based on gender persists. In Islamic Republic of Iran, a minimum national wage is applicable to each sector of activity fixed by the Supreme Labor Council. Membership to the social security system is compulsory. The minimum age for workers is 15 years but certain categories such as family owned enterprises, agricultural operations and home based industries are exempted from this law. Labor laws in Islamic Republic of Iran are worker-friendly, with lay off made difficult to carry out. Employees cannot be dismissed without proof of a serious offence, while employing personnel without making them permanent for a consecutive six month contract is illegal. Labor in the Organized Sector Persons working in the organized sector have better rights when compared to those in the unorganized sector in all the countries included in this study. Historically there were strong labor movements in the region and the organized sector witnessed a series of legislation that sought to protect the rights of people. Labor legislation also provides for mechanisms for redressing disputes. While the laws do give a series of valuable rights, they are almost always based on the formal model of equality. Thus, concerns of sexual harassment at the workplace that are very gender specific have emerged as part of the legal discourse only in recent years. 126 This provision has now been repealed under the Royal Bhutan Police Act 2009 44 Labor in the Unorganized Sector Unorganized sector includes agriculture and many categories of employment such as construction, domestic work, beedi work and home based industries. In addition, primary employers that include the state sub-contract many jobs to contractors, which in turn employ others as contract labor. Such employment is governed under the various Contract Labor Acts of the region. While legislation provide for equal pay for equal work exist in the region, a large part of women employed in areas such as agriculture, construction and domestic work do not get the benefits of such laws since there is a division of labor based on gender. Persons working in the unorganized sector also lack the power of collective bargaining. The rights of domestic workers in all the countries of the region except India are hardly recognized by any statute. Such workers work in homes under poor paying conditions for long hours without any leave and in exploitative conditions. The sector also has a large number of child labor. The Domestic Workers (Registration Social Security and Welfare) Act of 2008 in India seeks to ensure and regulate conditions of service for domestic workers and to prevent their exploitation. Impact of Market Forces With liberalization, the stress on good labor laws is developing even in the organized sector since the creation of special economic zones have resulted in the non- application of existing legislation to these areas. The employment of a large number of women working night shifts in BPOs (business process outsourcing) and call centers has raised new issues relating to health and safety. With the exception of existing labor laws, no new mechanisms have been put in place. An argument in favor of market forces is that they are a better way to close the gender wage gap than legislation. However, free market forces do not automatically translate into a reduction in the gender gap. Many employers do not employ women if it means giving them more privileges such as maternity leave. Studies also indicate that in special economic zones, there is a preference for unmarried young women over married women based on the justification that unmarried women are more efficient, willing and available for compulsory overtime work.127 In order to increase targets and the limitless extension of the workday, women workers are left with very little time for household chores- a phenomenon that married women are not able to cope with on a day-to-day basis.128 Strong legislative intervention is required to safeguard women\u2019s rights in the workplace.

The region has had many case laws relating to the discriminatory rules of airlines that distinguished between male and female flight pursuers restricting their employment. The courts of Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh and India have struck them down as discriminatory. The Pakistan Supreme Court struck down a discriminatory age of retirement rule, which was different (lesser age) for women holding that there was no intelligible differentia (Pakistan International Airlines Corporation vs. Samina Masood and others).129 The Bangladesh Supreme 127 Padmini Swaminathan, The trauma of wage employment and the burden of work for women in India, quoted in the Violence of our times, edited by Kalpana Kannabiran, Women Unlimited, 2005. 128 Ibid. 129 Pakistan Law Digest 2005 Supreme Court 831. 45 Court struck down a similar rule that held that men and women were different as women lose their intelligence, while men don\u2019t, and that women hostesses should be young and attractive for viability in the travel industry (Dalia Parveen vs. Bangladesh Biman Corporation and another),130 The Nepal Supreme Court took the same view (Rina Bajracharya and other vs HMG, Secretariat of Council of Ministers).131 Sexual Harassment in the Workplace Women workers face additional risk of sexual harassment in the workplace. Currently forms of sexual harassment, though not defined as such, constitute an offence such as outraging the modesty if they are in public places. The Nepal Supreme Court had directed the Government of Nepal to make appropriate laws in this regard in apublic interest litigation (Janahit Samrakshan Manch and others vs. HMG).132 The Indian Supreme Court formulated various guidelines to address sexual harassment in the workplace during a class-action litigation. Holding that sexual harassment violated the constitutional rights of the right to life and observing that there was still no legislation, the court defined sexual harassment by using the language of General Recommendation 19 of the CEDAW Committee.133 The court cast an obligation on employers to take preventive steps, formulate rules in the workplace, initiate disciplinary action against an employee who indulged in sexual harassment, provide for a grievance mechanism and an enquiry committee to look into the complaint. The chairman of the committee is required to be a woman. The rules and guidelines have resulted in changing the language of the law. However, for the purpose of an offence, cases have to be filed under the provision of \u2018outraging the modesty of a woman\u2019. Ten years after this judgment, efforts are underway only now to formulate legislation. However, the guidelines form part of service rules in various establishments of the government, the corporate and the organized sector. Maternity Leave All countries in this study have provisions for maternity leave. In Pakistan, a woman worker is entitled to six weeks prenatal and postnatal leave. In India, it is three months, while in Bangladesh it is four months. The concept of paternity leave has been introduced in India only in employment with the Federal government. In Islamic Republic of Iran, women employees are entitled to 90 days of maternity leave. The employee\u2019s salary is paid according to the social security act. Maternity leave is considered as part of a service record and employers are required to provide returning employees with the same position. However, a man may prohibit his wife from employment.134 In the region, Islamic Republic of Iran is the only country that provides for nursing breaks for lactating mothers and does not treat it as a break in employment (Box 25). 130 48 Dacca LawReports 1996. 131 Writ No.2812 of 2054 BS. 132 NKP 2061 ( 2004) Vol. 10, page 1312. 133 Visaka Vs state of Rajasthan AIR 1997 SC 3011. 134 Article 1117 of the Civil Code of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 46 Box 25: Islamic Republic of Iran\u2019s Law on Lactating Mothers In Islamic Republic of Iran, Mothers who breast-feed are given half an hour break every three hours at work in order to feed their babies.

Migrant Workers The region has very little regulation that empowers migrant workers. Legislation in this area has yet to be formulated. Migrant workers enjoy no protection from unscrupulous recruiting and employment agencies. Workers are sometimes sent overseas without any proper documentation or without assurance that there is an actual job vacancy. At times, workers in the country are not subject to positive domestic laws because they are not citizens. The region has a large number of workforces that are employed abroad but a concerted effort in this direction has yet to emerge. In Bangladesh, the Emigration Ordinance of 1982 seeks to regulate migrant workers, but the necessary supplementary rules and ordinances are yet to be formulated. A ban imposed on female domestic workers in 1998 in Bangladesh has led women to using illegal channels of travel and recruitment leading them to further vulnerability.135 Inheritance and Succession The right to own, dispose and earn profit from property is a right recognized by CEDAW Convention under Article 15. Since the laws of inheritance and succession are based on religion and have a cross cutting influence in the region, this subheading analyses the system of inheritance among Hindus, Muslims, Christians and others in the region. The inequality in the private sphere is reflected in the inheritance laws of the region. Islamic Laws in the Region Islamic law has a very sophisticated system of inheritance where the interests of all family members are cared for (Box 26). The Sunnis and the Shias have a slight difference in their laws of inheritance. Three kinds of heirs are recognized under Islamic law, viz \u201csharers\u201d who are entitled to a prescribed share on inheritance, \u201c residuaries\u201d who take on prescribed share but succeed to the residue left after 135 Shadow report of Bangladesh to the periodic report of the government to the CEDAW committee. 47 satisfying the claims of the sharers, and \u201c distant kind reds\u201d who are blood relations other than the sharers and residuaries and succeed only in the absence of sharers and residuaries. The principles of succession are two fold, viz the nearest in blood relationship excludes the remote and whoever is related to the deceased through any other person shall not inherit while the person is living.136 Box: 26: Islamic Provision On Inheritance Holy Quran Verse 4:176 says:- They ask thee, for a legal decision, Say: Allah directs (thus) about those who leave, no descendants and ascendants as heirs. If it is a man that dies, leaving a sister but no child, she shall have half the inheritance. If such deceased person was a woman who left no child, her brother takes her inheritance If there are two sisters, they shall have two thirds of the inheritance between them; if there are brothers and sisters, ( they share) the male having twice the share of the female, Thus doth Allah make clear, To you ( His law), lest you err and Allah hath knowledge of all things. Source: S A Kadar, Muslim Law of Marriage & Succession in India, Eastern Law House, 1998 The sharers are called Quranic heirs because definite shares are allotted to them under the Quran, which varies under certain circumstances. They consist mainly of females and in the distribution of the estate of a deceased person, their shares are carved out first. The Residuaries are agnate heirs who were the principal heirs before the advent of Islam. They consist of all male agnates and four female agnates, daughter, son\u2019s daughter, full sister and consanguine sister. Distant kindred are distant relatives on whom the property devolves if there are no sharers and residuaries. Under Shia law there are only sharers and residuaries. Since the shares are fixed, every member of the family is entitled to a fixed portion of the property. A general principle that discriminates against women is that the female inherits half of the share of the male. To give an example, when a male dies among the Sunnis of the sub continent, the wife (or wives) will inherit one eighth of their husband\u2019s estate if there are children and one fourth if there are no children. When a female dies, the husband will get one fourth of his wife\u2019s estate if there are children and one half of her estate if there are no children. In the same way, the mother is entitled to one sixth of the estate of her son if the deceased left behind a male child or has brothers or sisters. On the other hand the father gets one sixth from the estate of his son if the deceased son", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1cda1c50-ce22-48b3-b520-8e0c1258a3da": {"__data__": {"id_": "1cda1c50-ce22-48b3-b520-8e0c1258a3da", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a111f5b0f706d747bca533acac8a5b87189ba1eb5fe0c172d2be18c14caeabb5"}}, "hash": "a111f5b0f706d747bca533acac8a5b87189ba1eb5fe0c172d2be18c14caeabb5", "text": "left a male child. In the absence of any grandson, the father also gets the entire residue after satisfying other claims of sharers and becomes a sharer and a residuary. Since the rule of nearer in relationship excludes the remoter in relationship, children of a predeceased son or daughter do not inherit from their grandparent if the deceased grandparent left behind other children. This often renders children of predeceased parents destitute. In Bangladesh this anomaly has been removed by the Muslim 136 Mulla Principles of Mohamedan law, 48 Family Laws Ordinance 1961, which provides that the children of a predeceased child would inherit as if their parent was alive. A widow of a predeceased son cannot inherit from her father by law. A Muslim can only bequeath one third of his estate by will. In Islamic Republic of Iran, a Muslim can bequeath more than one third provided the other sharers agree to the same. Islamic law of inheritance is not codified in the region except in case of Islamic Republic of Iran (Box 27).137 It is the only country in the study that recognizes the rights of transgender persons in inheritance. The law permits such persons to inherit as male or female depending upon their physical attributes. Box 27: Islamic Republic of Iran\u2019s Laws On Inheritance Article 862 of the Civil Code- Persons who take inheritance by relationship are of three categories: 1 - Father, mother and children. 2 - Grandparents, brother, sister and their children. 3 - Paternal uncles and paternal aunts, maternal uncles and maternal aunts and their children. Article 863 - Heirs of the lower categories take an inheritance when no person of a higher category exists. Article 864 - An instance of those who inherit by marriage is one of the spouses who survive the other one. Article 865 - If several causes of inheritance are united in the same person, he takes inheritance from all the causes, unless some of those causes exclude other, in which case he takes inheritance only from those causes which exclude others. Article 939 of the Civil Code If the heir is a hermaphrodite and be one of a group of heirs which are such that the males take twice the portion of the females, his portion will be determined as follows. If the indications of masculinity are the greater, he takes the portion of boy of his degree; and if the indications of femininity are the greater, the hermaphrodite takes the portion of one girl of that degree; and if neither the masculine nor the feminine indication be preponderant, the hermaphrodite will take one - half of the sum of the portions of one boy and one girl of his degree Sources: Civil code of Islamic republic of Iran http://www.alaviandassociates.com/documents/civilcode.pdf http://www.parstimes.com/law/Iran_law.html In India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, Muslims who adopt children are governed under the Guardian and Wards Act of 1890. 137 Articles 907, 1059, Civil Code of Islamic Republic of Iran. 49 Hindu Law in the Region Hindu law has been codified only in India and Nepal. Hindu law in India applies to Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs who are other religious minorities in the country.138 Women and men inherit equally and there are no fixed shares. The law recognizes various classes of heirs, with the first class taking precedence over the other classes. Separate classes of heirs exist for male and female Hindus. The mother is a class one heir along with the widow and children of a male Hindu. By making a mother a sharer in her son\u2019s property, the legislation reinforces the need of a male heir. In the case of a female Hindu, three distinct kinds of property are recognized. These are property obtained from her parents, property obtained from her husband and her self-acquired property. The first-class successors are the children and the spouse for a female Hindu. In the event of no class of heirs from the first set, the property is obtained from her parents and in-laws revert to them respectively. In the case of self- acquired property, the husband\u2019s family is the beneficiary. Hindu law also has a complicated system of inheritance in the joint family property called the Mitakshara coparcenary. In such a system, the property is held jointly by three generations with the right of succession to the male at birth. All agricultural land is held as coparcenary. Females were excluded from this system until recently when till the Act was amended abolishing such discrimination.139 A male or female Hindu in India can will away their entire self-acquired property.140 In Nepal, The Country Code Amendment Act of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a2f46b12-4bb7-4a02-9a39-c09696f768f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "a2f46b12-4bb7-4a02-9a39-c09696f768f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e0727a0b117744efa0e585e5b76052a49cbdd586c93b0b83dbb12e58d960b9ea"}}, "hash": "e0727a0b117744efa0e585e5b76052a49cbdd586c93b0b83dbb12e58d960b9ea", "text": "2002 Establishes a wife\u2019s equal right to her husband\u2019s property immediately after marriage, rather than after she reaches 35 years of age or has been married for 15 years, as prior to the amendment.

However, if she does not have any child, she should return her property to her divorced husband\u2019s child or to her divorced husband. The right to food, clothing, appropriate education, and healthcare is granted to daughters as it is the case with sons. 141 In countries where Hindus are a minority such as in Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, there are no statutory changes in Hindu law and individuals are governed by ancient texts and laws that have varied schools. Among Hindus in India and Nepal, while adoption is recognized for both sexes, a married woman can adopt only with the consent of her husband. A corresponding obligation is not required for the husband to seek the consent of his wife. A child that is adopted has equal right to inheritance. The law permits the adoption only if the person does not have a child of the same gender. This implies that a Hindu cannot adopt a girl child if she already has a girl child. In Sri Lanka, the Tamils are governed by the Thesawalamai law that is not codified and based on customary practices. 138 Section 2 of the Hindu Marriage Act, Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act and Hindu Succession Act. 139 The Hindu Succession ( Amendment) Act 2005 140 The Hindu Succession Act and the Indian Succession Act. 141 www.fao.org/gender/landrights/report/country-NP 50 Under the Kandyan law that applies to people of Kandyan origin in Sri Lanka, a surviving spouse receives only a life interest in the property of the deceased spouse. Although this law does not appear to be discriminatory per se, in reality it has greater negative impacts on women who have less economic capacity and cannot inherit property absolutely. The Drukpa branch of Buddhism enjoys a statutory representation in the National Assembly of Bhutan. Questions of family law are resolved according to Buddhist tradition and Hindu tradition. Christian Law in the Region In India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, Christians are governed by the Succession Act of 1925. Upon the death of a Christian the surviving spouse and lineal descendants are the heirs. The spouse inherits half of the property while the remaining descendants get the remaining half. In the absence of children, the lateral descendants get the remaining half. A Christian can bequeath their entire property by will. The Succession Act is also the substantive and procedural law in relation to wills for all communities in these countries. In India, if a spouse belongs to a different religion and is married under the Special Marriage Act, then the Succession Act will apply for purposes of property inheritance. However, for the purpose of inheritance from their natal families, their personal laws will be applicable. The community of Parsees is also governed by the provisions of this Act. However the rules of inheritance are different for them. In Bhutan, the Inheritance Law provides for equal inheritance among all sons and daughters, but traditional inheritance practices, which vary among ethnic groups, may be observed if the heirs choose to forego legal challenges. Traditional inheritance laws for the majority of Buddhists stipulate that daughters inherit family land. As a result, 60 per cent of rural women hold land registration titles. These inheritance practices favoring daughters accounted for the large number of women who owned shops and businesses. Tradition dictates that the most capable member of the family runs the household, which often resulted in the mother or eldest daughter holding this position.142 In all the countries in the study women have the right to acquire and dispose property. However due to discriminatory inheritance laws, women\u2019s share of ownership of property is limited. Despite being inheritors under the law, women can still be denied their rights by male members of the family who use force, subjugate or indulge in violence to prevent the females from seeking their rightful share. Civil Laws in the Region All of the constitutions studied provide for equality before law and equal protection before the law. In sync with CEDAW\u2019s article 15 requirement (Box 28), various constitutions of the region also have provisions that permit the state to make special measures for women. However discrimination in the realm of civil law operates in various ways. 142 Country Reports on Human", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3f0814b5-16f8-4f0b-b1c9-f7325e3b1861": {"__data__": {"id_": "3f0814b5-16f8-4f0b-b1c9-f7325e3b1861", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a9b1e4c5adce0117f7a082285787bd60f121213d022c54729c8fe98f9def4420"}}, "hash": "a9b1e4c5adce0117f7a082285787bd60f121213d022c54729c8fe98f9def4420", "text": "Rights Practices 2007, as released by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, March 2008. 51 Box 28: CEDAW\u2019s Article 15 on Equality Before The Law 1.

Source: Article 15 of CEDAW The laws of evidence are similar to both civil and criminal cases in Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka following the common law system. It is also similar in Pakistan except for changes in the realm of criminal law. In countries following Sharia law, the evidentiary requirements for women are different than that of men. (Table 2). TABLE 2: Evidence Requirements Of Men And Women in Criminal Cases in the South-Asia Region Country Evidence Status of Women vis-a vis Men Afghanistan Evidence of two women equal that of one man. Bangladesh Evidence of men and women have equal validity. Bhutan Evidence of men and women have equal validity.

Pakistan Evidence of two women is the same as that of one man. Sri Lanka Evidence of men and women has equal validity. In cases relating to civil transactions such as contracts, transfer of property, partnerships, labor law and corporate law, the impact of such discriminatory evidentiary value is not seen since women constitute a major part of the work force, own and dispose property, are decision makers at various levels, hold senior posts and 52 participate in the political process. The Civil Code of Islamic Republic of Iran does not distinguish the evidence of men and women while in the realm of criminal law the differences are present. The Civil Code stipulates that a witness muss have maturity, sanity, justice, faith and legitimate descent.143 It has a further provision relating to children that stipulates that the evidence of children who have not reached the full age of 15 may be heard only for supplementing information, except where the law has recognized evidence given by such children as valid.144 A dichotomy is thus seen between civil and criminal law relating to the value of evidence relating to children. Since the husband is the designated head of the household a wife cannot travel out of the country without his permission.145 A wife is also legally obligated to be obedient to her husband.146 Women have the right to sue and can be sued under the various laws. The Code of Civil Procedures in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan have special provisions for Pardanashin (women who live in Purdah) and courts can exempt their personal appearance. But it does not exonerate such women from the legal process. In Nepal, a woman must have the approval of her father or husband before she can initiate proceedings in a court. A daughter cannot dispose family property without the permission of her father; a wife cannot dispose family property without permission of her husband; and a widow cannot do so without permission from her son. The Interim Constitution of Nepal now seeks to eliminate all forms of discrimination. The capacity to enter into a contract is 21 years of age for civil transactions under the Majority Act of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. However, in these countries civil transactions such as obtaining a driving license, opening a bank account, controlling finances are also permitted at the age of 18. Any adult male or female (18 years of age or older) have the capacity to enter into any contract. The Act stipulates that this age does not concern matters relating to marriage.

It is a complex area, with more difficulties arising from the combination of increasing fundamentalism and the assertion of the third generation of human rights that stress group identities, making reform difficult in some countries. It is also an area where the intersection of caste, class and religion play a part in the realization of rights. Marriage Rights such as maintenance, legitimacy of children, and mutual rights over property in inheritance are only possible through the prism of marriage in the countries covered in 56 the study. In each country, relationships outside the institution of marriage do not give any rights to the parties. In some jurisdictions, they would also be offences as illustrated in the section on gender in social context relating to violence against women. Here, we discuss the various marriage laws in the region, rights on divorce, child custody, maintenance and child marriages. Marriage under Muslim Law In Muslim law, marriage is a contract and must be based on mutual acceptance. Divorce is based on the principle of the irretrievable breakdown of marriage. The marriage of a Muslim man with a non-Muslim woman who belongs to the religion of the book (Kitabiyya) is acceptable while the marriage of a Muslim woman with a non- Muslim man is not legal under religious law. Marriages with persons who are not Kitabiyya (not of the book) have no legality under Muslim law. In Pakistan and Bangladesh, marriages are governed under the Family Law Ordinance. The laws in Pakistan and Bangladesh have been amended to provide for compulsory registration of marriages. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, the code of civil procedure has codified family law. While these laws have their origin in Shairah as do all personal laws that have their origin in religion, codification makes it easier for the application of law. In India, Nepal and Sri Lanka substantive Islamic law is not codified. In India there was only one law, after its independence from British colonialism, that addresses the rights of Muslim women to maintenance. Dower or Mahr Dower or Mahr is a unique feature of Islamic law that is often confused with bride price due to colonial interpretations. Mahr is a specific settlement of property made by the husband to the wife that has to be specified in the marriage contract and is arrived at by the contracting parties.147 It is given to her as a mark of respect and is an economic right that allows the woman to use and utilize the Mahr absolutely. The wife is within", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7fc009df-66a2-4df7-a6fa-d367db7754ee": {"__data__": {"id_": "7fc009df-66a2-4df7-a6fa-d367db7754ee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0a8610744b03655ee603d2de3998fc66c97ad7d09e124305dbbab9fbf106a01d"}}, "hash": "0a8610744b03655ee603d2de3998fc66c97ad7d09e124305dbbab9fbf106a01d", "text": "her rights under Islamic law to refuse any \u201cmarital obligations\u201d until her Mahr is paid.148 Mahr is an essential ingredient to the marriage and if it is unspecific in the Nikahnamah, or marriage contract, it must be judged on definite principles. Since Mahr is property, it can be both movable and immovable and includes money, livestock, gold jewellery, land, house, etc. Mahr can be prompt or deferred. A prompt Mahr is one that is given at the time of marriage. A deferred Mahr is one where the marriage\u2019s contract stipulates the time when it is to be given, such as during divorce, or death. On the death of the husband, Mahr as a debt has priority over the claims of other heirs to the estate and a claim for unpaid Mahr constitutes a debt on par with the demands of other creditors. Mahr can also be paid in installments. Muta Marriages Shia law recognizes temporary marriages called Muta. They are common in Islamic Republic of Iran, and are also prevalent among the Ithna Asharis in the Indian sub- continent. These are temporary contractual marriages that can last for a few hours, days, months or years with Mahr being stipulated in the contract. A man has the 147 Apart from judicial precedents, this is stipulated in Articles 1078 to 1101, Chapter 7 of Civil Code of Islamic Republic of Iran. 148 Ibid. 57 capacity to contract any number of wives by Muta marriage, without the normal limitation of four wives. The non-specification of these would make the marriage void. Such marriages are not recognized among the Sunnis. All the requisites of a valid marriage, such as offer and acceptance, must be observed in a Muta marriage. The main distinction between a permanent marriage and a Muta marriage is that in the later a term is specified and parties to a Muta marriage cannot inherit from each other. The woman is not entitled to maintenance unless stipulated in the contract. The marriage comes to an end on the expiry of the term and there is no need for a formal Talaq or divorce. Children born of Muta marriages are legitimate and have the right of inheritance from their father.149 Marriage under Hindu Law India and Nepal have unified marriage law as applicable to all Hindus. The Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs are considered Hindus for the purpose of the personal law, and are governed by the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955 but these communities are religious minorities under the constitution. The law requires both parties to be Hindus in order for the marriage to be valid. It is evident that the hold of religion on law in matters of marriage starts from the validity itself. In other countries of the region, where Hindus are a religious minority as in the cases of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, ancient texts and scriptures govern them. Marriage is a sacrament, making it indissoluble and extremely difficult for a spouse to obtain a divorce. Marriage under Christian Law The region has a large number of Christians, both Catholics and Protestants. Under the Christian Marriages Act of the region, it is sufficient if one party to the marriage is a Christian. Inter religious marriages: The Special Marriage Act in India governs interreligious marriages where either party does not convert to the religion of their spouse. Other legislation in the region addresses such marriages. Registration of Marriages In Bhutan, all marriages must be registered, without which they are not legally recognized. Certificates are not issued for common law marriages below the minimum age, even though they are legal and parties involved in the same can be fined. Registration of marriage is not compulsory in India and Nepal, though certain states in India have formulated legislation in this regard. Non-registration of marriages results in a lack of documentation in India and often result in the man denying the marriage itself and the woman is left without any proof. The Family Law Ordinance in Bangladesh and Pakistan provide for compulsory registration of marriages to be solemnized by a Nikah Registrar. In all the countries in the region, non-registration does not make the marriage void. 149 Articles 1062 to 1070 of Chapter 6 of the Civil Code of Islamic Republic of Iran. 58 Polygamy Among the countries in the region that follow Islamic law, it is permissible for a man to have four wives (Box 3).

Notice has to be given to his spouse and the Arbitration Council grants permission only if it is satisfied that the proposed marriage is necessary and just. In Bhutan, polygamy and polyandry are permissible under the law with the consent of the spouse.

In Bhutan, marriages contracted between persons within the degree of consanguinity and affinity if permissible by local custom is recognized by the law. Different customary practices within the region permit certain kinds of marriages that may otherwise appear as one of consanguinity. Marriage among paternal cousins is legal among Muslims but not with maternal cousins. Among Hindus of South India, marriage with the maternal uncle or cousin is legal owing to customary practice, but not that with a paternal cousin. However, such a marriage is void in other parts of India. Restitution of Conjugal Rights A spouse can file proceedings under for this relief claiming that the other spouse has withdrawn from the marital life without any reasonable excuse. While such a decree is unenforceable, it can coerce a re-union since it provides for attaching the salary of the spouse who refuses to comply with an order under the Code of Civil Procedure in India. Restitution of conjugal rights is legislative sanction for the marital rape. However, those that challenge the law have unsuccessfully claimed that it violates the 150 The Family law Act 2001 of the Republic of Maldives. 59 right to life by forcing people to live together.151 The remedy of restitution of conjugal rights is available under Muslim, Hindu and Christian laws in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Divorce Laws in the Region Muslim Laws Divorce in Islamic law, as practiced in the region, is the practice of Talaq-ul-biddat, or triple talaq where the divorce is complete by pronouncing the word Talaq three times in the presence of two witnesses. The pronouncement can be made in the absence of the woman. This practice is one of the legal forms of divorce in Afghanistan, India, Islamic Republic of Iran, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Box 31 : Quranic Reference on Divorce If ye fear a breach between them twain appoint two Arbiters\u2212 one from his family, and the other from hers. If they seek to set things right, Allah will cause their reconciliation. For Allah hath full knowledge and is acquainted with all things.\u201d Source: Verse 4:35 of the Holy Quran Muslim law In Bangladesh and Pakistan, the practice of Triple Talaq is prohibited under the Family Law Ordinance 1961, which provides for reconciliation and adjudication of divorce cases. When a man pronounces Talaq, he has to intimate the authority under the statute of his intention. After this an arbitration council is constituted to bring about reconciliation between parties.152 The practice of reconciliation is also encouraged under Islamic law provisions (Box 31). India, Pakistan and Bangladesh also have a common legislation called the Dissolution of Muslims Marriages Act of 1939, where women can seek divorce on various grounds such as cruelty, desertion, neglect, impotency and failure to perform marital obligations; or when her marriage is solemnized before the age of 15 years and she repudiates the marriage between the age of 15 and 18 years; or if the husband does not treat all of his wives equally; and on any other ground recognized under Muslim law.

The current opinion seems to be that the husband has to give his consent to release her from the marriage when she asks for it. In Maldives, the law permits pre-nuptial agreements where the wife can impose a condition restricting the right of the husband to commit polygamy during the subsistence of their marriage. However, even when requiring both men and women to approach the court for divorce, the language of the requirement is different for men and women, based on the \u201cinalienable right\u201d of man to divorce his wife, at his discretion with or without any reason whatsoever. Men must require the court\u2019s permission for divorce, but if a woman wants a divorce she must request court mediation in requiring her husband to grant her a divorce. Parties are expected to 151 The court in one instance observed that \u201c introducing constitutional law into the family is like introducing a bull into a china shop. 152 Section 3 of the Family Law Ordinance 1961. 60 appear by themselves in family disputes without the legal assistance.153 In Islamic Republic of Iran, a man may divorce his wife whenever he wishes to do so.154 However, a woman may seek khul\u2019a in which case she forgoes her right to Mahr.155 In Sri Lanka, the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act of 1951 have similar provisions for divorce based on matrimonial wrongs such as adultery, cruelty and desertion.156 Courts are required to mediate in cases before them, but the husband has the right of pronouncing Talaq. Iranian law also recognizes the practice of Mubarat, or divorce by mutual consent. In such instances the compensation for the wife is not more than her Mahr or \u201cmarriage portion\u201d.157 In other regions the practice of Mubarat is also recognized, but such options are not generally exercised. The practice of triple Talaq is regulated in countries by various legislation that are based on Islamic law or have a Muslim majority. Countries such as Nepal, India and Sri Lanka, where Muslims are religious minorities, have refrained from addressing this form of divorce. This in turn has resulted in double discrimination against Muslim women in these countries since they face the brunt of arbitrary divorce. Hindu law The law of divorce for Hindus in India is based on matrimonial wrongs where the spouse who seeks divorce has to prove cruelty, adultery, desertion or other grounds listed in the statute.158 The wife has grounds of divorce such as conviction of a husband on charges of rape, sodomy or bestiality apart from an additional ground for divorce when her marriage is solemnized before the age of 15 years and she repudiates the marriage between the ages of 15 and 18. There is hardly any litigation under this provision, as not many children married below age 15 can find support systems to file cases before they attain the age of 18. No corresponding right is available to the boy child. The statute also has separate grounds of nullity and divorce. Grounds such as impotency, fraud, a subsequent marriage while the first one is subsisting are some of the grounds for nullity. The law also recognizes divorce on mutual consent. In Nepal, divorce is also granted on fault based grounds.159 In Sri Lanka, the law relating to the Tamils is based on the customary law of the Theswamalai law. The Marriage Registration Ordinance 1907 in Sri Lanka permits divorce on adultery, malicious desertion, and incurable impotence apart from mutual consent. However, the Kandyan Marriage and Divorce Act 1952 that applies to Sri Lankans of the Kandy region, stipulates that divorce can be granted on the basis of adultery by the wife, adultery by husband coupled with incest, desertion for two years and mutual consent. In Pakistan and Bangladesh, since Hindus are a religious minority, the state has refrained from amending laws of marriage and divorce that are based on ancient texts. 153 Shadow report of Maldives. 154 Article 1133 of the Civil Code of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 155 Article 1146 of the Civil Code of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 156 Section 19 of Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act 1951 157 Article 1147 of the Civil Code of Islamic Republic of Iran. 158 Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955. 159 Mulkiyan Ain or Country Code of Nepal. 61 Christian law The Indian Divorce Act of 1869 applies to Christians living in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

The fault based grounds are similar to those under the Hindu Marriage Act and the Special Marriage Act. In Bangladesh and Pakistan, however, the Act has yet to be amended. It recognizes adultery as grounds for the men only, while in the case of the women, grounds for divorce has to be incestuous adultery, bigamy with adultery, rape, sodomy or bestiality, or adultery coupled with cruelty, or adultery coupled with desertion for more than two years. By providing only adultery as a ground for divorce for the man while combining it with other grounds for a woman, the law becomes discriminatory in nature. Apart from that, it recognizes only various forms of adultery as a form of divorce. The Act also permits the husband to claim damages from the \u201cadulterer\u201d and to seek the settlement of her property in the name of the children, while no corresponding right is available to the woman. Along with the penal provision on adultery, this colonial vestige continues to exist in the statutes, making it one of the harshest law in the region. In Sri Lanka, Christians are governed by the Marriage Registration Ordinance of 1907 that permits divorce on the fault based grounds as mentioned above. Bhutan The Marriage Act permits either spouse to initiate proceedings for divorce on various grounds, such as adultery, abandonment, sterility, impotence and willful negligence by one of the spouses. Guardianship and Custody of the Children In all legal systems, the father is considered the natural guardian of the child. There are different laws relating to the custody of children with an overriding law in the sub- region being termed the Guardian and Wards Act of 1890. Despite personal laws giving a preferential right to the father, courts in the region have harmoniously used the personal law and the Act to grant custody to mothers or appoint women as guardians of children based on the welfare and best interests of the child. In Sri Lanka, the various laws recognize the best interests of the child for purposes of guardianship and custody.160 Muslim law In Afghanistan and the Islamic Republic of Iran, the natural guardian of the minor child is the father or the paternal grandfather.161 In Bangladesh, Pakistan and India, while the same principle applies in customary law, the Guardian and Wards Act of 1890 under which proceedings of guardianship and custody are filed, stresses the \u201cwelfare of the minor\u201d as a factor that determines guardianship and custody. In the 160 The Civil Procedure Code 1889 (Sri Lanka): Section 621, The Kandyan Marriage and Divorce Act 1952 33(7) ii-iii and the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act 1951Section 48. 161 Article 1180, Chapter 3 of the Civil Code of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 62 Islamic Republic of Iran, if a guardian is found to be acting against the interests of the child, the public prosecutor can seek the investigation of his conduct and seek the appointment of a provisional guardian.162 Article 21 (5) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran also declares that the guardianship of children can be granted to worthy mothers in order to protect the children in the absence of the guardian. Muslim law in the region permits the mother to have the custody of the girl child until puberty and that of the boy child until the age of nine. However, courts have addressed this in the context of the welfare of the minor in cases of custody, and are currently moving towards the \u201cbest interest of the child\u2019 principle . But welfare or best interest of the child principle often depends on the the subjective satisfaction of the judge. In Sri Lanka, under Shafi law the female child remains with the mother until she re-marries. Under Hanafi law, custody is with the mother only until the girl reaches puberty. If it is a boy child, the mother has custodial rights until the age of seven. Hindu law Hindu law in India recognizes the father as the natural guardian of the child and after him the mother. The constitutional validity of this provision was challenged on the grounds of discrimination, but while the Supreme Court recognized the right of the mother as a guardian, it did not", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b1ec68c-752c-4e85-a217-436b3db02ae4": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b1ec68c-752c-4e85-a217-436b3db02ae4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "657fa27a4294d7178a220f2a7b6ac24f5be1b27884fec8ba722fc9259e3ee349"}}, "hash": "657fa27a4294d7178a220f2a7b6ac24f5be1b27884fec8ba722fc9259e3ee349", "text": "strike down the law and only held in case of the father\u2019s absence, the mother will also be the guardian. The mother is the natural guardian only if the child is illegitimate. The law recognizes the preferential rights of the mother to keep a child with her until the age of five.163 Under the Hindu Marriage Act, courts are required to pass orders during matrimonial proceedings, keeping the welfare of the child in mind.164 Christian law Guardianship in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh is governed by the Guardian and Wards Act as mentioned earlier. In disputes relating to custody, courts are required to pass orders during matrimonial proceedings keeping the welfare of the child in mind under the Indian Divorce Act . In Sri Lanka, custody is based on the best interests of the child. In Bhutan in the event of divorce, the mother is given custody of the child until the child attains the age of nine. Thereafter, the child can choose to live with either parent. Maintenance and Alimony Muslim law In Bangladesh and Pakistan, classical law recognizes the right of the woman to have maintenance only for the period of Iddat or Iddah, which is a waiting period to be observed by the woman on death of or divorce from her spouse. It is approximately three months, and is calculated by three menstrual courses. If the woman is expecting a child, then the period starts after the birth of her child. Classical Islamic law recognizes the right of the wife to claim maintenance and live separately from her husband if he re-marries. 162 Article 1186 of the Civil Code of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 163 Section 6 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act of 1956. 164 Section 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955. 63 In countries where there is a provision for arbitration and mediation and where Talaq is regulated, the right of maintenance is also well-defined. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, the cost of maintenance during Iddat includes housing, clothing, food, furniture and other amenities in proportion to their standards of living.165 As long as the dispute is pending between the parties, even the court can fix a suitable dwelling for the wife.166 The tension of balancing minority rights with those of gender is reflected in the rights of maintenance of Muslim women in India. Under the Code of Criminal Procedure, wives including divorced wives and parents of all religions were entitled to maintenance.167 Since this is under the Criminal Code, it was argued that it was a secular law since the criminal justice system applied to all irrespective of religion. The constitutional validity of this provision was challenged as violating personal law by a Muslim husband who argued that legislative interventions asking a husband to pay maintenance to his divorced wife was anti-Islamic since she was entitled only to maintenance until Iddat. The Supreme Court dismissed his case. 168 To neutralize the effect of the judgment, the government enacted the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act that restricted maintenance to Muslim women to the period of Iddat and gave her \u201ca reasonable and fair provision and maintenance\u201d. An issue that has come up before the courts is the interpretation of this term. The Supreme ourt has interpreted this provision harmoniously with customary law and taking note of the status of women, held that at the time of divorce, a Muslim husband is required to contemplate the future needs for the entire life of the divorced wife and make preparatory arrangements in advance for meeting her needs.169 Parents can claim maintenance from their children including married daughters under the Code of Criminal Procedure in India. Hindu law Two types of maintenance are recognized under statutes in India: interim alimony that is paid pending litigation and permanent alimony that is payable once the marriage is dissolved under the Hindu Marriage Act.170 Among Hindus, the woman can also be directed to pay alimony to her husband. Alimony is paid either monthly or as a lump sum. Hindu law also recognizes the right of dependants to claim maintenance. These include parents, children, a widowed daughter-in-law, and grandchildren of predeceased children. Daughters are entitled to marriage expenses. In Nepal, a divorced woman who is unable to maintain herself is entitled to maintenance for a period of five years or until remarriage, whichever is earlier. 165 Article 1107 of the Civil Code of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 166 Article 1116 of the Civil Code of theIslamic Republic of Iran. 167 Section 125 Code of Criminal Procedure (India) 168 Mohammed Ahmed Khan vs", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0a166725-b269-410d-b007-e5b13f034035": {"__data__": {"id_": "0a166725-b269-410d-b007-e5b13f034035", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "846f157c589baa5a274bd98afa855a6eb09a3a319a9ad8684ae8925e2f5a539b"}}, "hash": "846f157c589baa5a274bd98afa855a6eb09a3a319a9ad8684ae8925e2f5a539b", "text": "Shah Bano Begum, AIR 1985 SC,945 (India). 169 Daniel Latifi vs Union of India, AIR 2001 SC page 3958. 170 Section 4 and 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act (India). 64 Christian law The Divorce Act of 1869 in Bangladesh, Pakistan and India provides for permanent alimony and maintenance. In India Christian women can also claim maintenance under the Code of Criminal procedure.171 Women and Health The issue of health has always been in the realm of public policy and has not always been addressed as a right that is enforceable under the law. But some related concerns have had major impacts on the gender. Early marriage, teenage pregnancy, lack of adequate measures to plan or space a family, the lack of control over sexuality and the arbitrary authority of the state are examples where gender inequity exists. Abortion and Sex-Selective Abortions Abortion is legal in India under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act of 1971. The law permits abortion in cases where the pregnancy involves a risk to the life, or grave injury to women\u2019s physical and mental health, or where there is a substantial risk that the child would suffer from physical or mental abnormalities. Pregnancy caused by rape, or failure of any device or method used by any married woman for the purpose of limiting the number of children are examples of injuries to women\u2019s mental health. The woman\u2019s actual or reasonably foreseeable environment must be considered before termination. In the case of minors (below 18 years of age), the consent of the guardian is required before such termination. Since the father is the natural guardian this often result in young pregnant women seeking out quacks out of fear of informing the male members of their family. The law gives wide leeway and though the statute was partially in response to the number of deaths that were taking place due to illegal abortion, it also served the interest of the state in its population control program. Under the Act, only a registered medical practitioner can terminate the pregnancy, which should not exceed 20 weeks.172 Any other termination resulting in miscarriage amounts to an offence under the Penal Code. These include causing miscarriage with or without a woman\u2019s consent, and if it results in the death of the woman, the offence is punishable with imprisonment for life.173 The law treats abortion as a woman\u2019s right to choice (except in the case of minors). Since the consent of her husband or partner is not required , courts have held that termination of pregnancy without the consent of the husband amounts to cruelty for the purposes of divorce. In Maldives, abortion is legal on two grounds only: at any time during the pregnancy, if the mother\u2019s life was in danger; and up to the 120-day mark, if one or both of the parents was a thalassaemia carrier and a doctor confirmed that the fetus was a thalassaemia major. There are moves to permit the same in cases of rape of minors but it has yet to shape into law. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, under the Abortion Act of 2005, abortion before 19th week of pregnancy, is now allowed if the mother's life is in danger, and also in cases of fetal abnormalities. The consent of the father is not a requirement and the mother is required to show the opinion of three specialist physicians. 171 The Divorce Act of 1869 and section of the Code of Criminal Procedure 172 Section 3 of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act of 1971. 173 Sections 312, 313, and 314 of the Indian Penal Code. 65 Child Marriage The practice of child marriage is common in most of the countries in the study except Sri Lanka. The Child Marriage Restraint Act of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh prohibit child marriages and have different ages of consent. In India, the age of consent is 18 years of age for a female and 21 for a male. Marriages below the age of consent are voidable at the option of the person who wishes to repudiate it, provided it is done by any of the party to the marriage, within two years of attaining 21 years.174 The Act has been repealed in India, and such marriages are declared void at the option of the children. However, while child marriages are prohibited under the legislation, statutory Hindu law and Muslim law do not consider such marriages void. The law only punishes parents, clergy, priests, etc. As a result of this, all child marriages in India among Hindus and Muslims are valid under the law.

One view is that given the premium placed on the institution of marriage and its gendered structure, declaring child marriages as null would affect women more adversely given the practice of dowry, the low status of women, and social norms that stigmatize her since re- marriage is harder for Hindu women. In Pakistan, the age of consent is 16 years for a female and 18 years for a male, while in Bangladesh the age of marriage is 18 for girls and 21 for boys. The age of marriage for both men and women is 18 years in Bhutan.175 However, under its common law, marriages below the stipulated age are legal.. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, the age of marriage is 13 lunar years for girls, and 15 lunar years for boys. Marriage before that age is valid if the guardian (Vali) approves the same.176 In Sri Lanka, the legal age of marriage is 18. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, boys older than 15 years may freely choose their wives, while women who have reached adulthood can choose their spouses only if their guardian have granted permission.177 However, if her family members refuse to grant permission, she can obtain the permission from the court. The legality of a marriage is contingent on the father or grandfather\u2019s approval.178 One of the difficult areas is with reference to puberty in Bangladesh, India, Islamic Republic of Iran, and Pakistan. While the various state measures stipulate a minimum year of marriage, puberty is often taken as a yardstick for adulthood. In Pakistan, in the absence of puberty, adulthood is considered 16 for females. Since puberty is attained at the girl\u2019s first menstruation, with some girls attaining it as early as 11 or 12 years of age, they can be considered adults for the purpose of customary marriage. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, they can be prosecuted for Zina. A similar opinion is indicated in Pakistan where the term \u201cpuberty\u201d is used in the Protection of Women Act 2006.179 174 Child Marriage Restraint Act 1929 The Act has been repealed in India with the prohibition of Child Marriage Act 2006 175 Marriage Amendment Act 1976 (Bhutan). 176 Article 1041 of the Civil Code of the Islamic Republic of Iran . 177 Article 1043 of the Civil Code of the Islamic Republic of Iran 178 Article1105 of the Civil Code of the Islamic Republic of Iran.; Immigration and Passport Regulations, ratified in 1971. 179 Second Shadow report, Undermining Cedaw in Pakistan, April 15, 2007, submitted to the CEDAW Committee. 66 7. The Impact and Application of the Law in the Justice System The de jure provision indicates that legislation not only fall short of addressing concerns in areas such as violence against women, sexual harassment at the workplace, and family law, but are also discriminatory. Most of the laws are based on the formal model of equality, and does not take note of the reality of women\u2019s lives. In all the countries studied, despite constitutional guarantees, discrimination persists. Currently discrimination, as applied by law, only protects individuals against the state. The absence of laws prohibiting non- state discrimination makes it impossible to address gender inequalities. The fundamental rights provisions in the constitutions do not extend to situations of discrimination by private parties. While courts in some of the countries, notably Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Nepal and Sri Lanka, have expanded the right to life guaranteed under their constitutions to address violations by private parties, the concept has not been extended in detail to the private sphere. In the absence of legislation or even a definition on discrimination, this has its limitations since judicial precedents often depend on the views of the judge. Another factor to be noted is that equality is guaranteed in most of the constitutions only with reference to public employment. But with greater privatization and the state withdrawing itself from its role in many areas including education and health, this poses a great challenge for addressing de facto equality since the private sector lacks sufficient legal restrictions. In India, the debate on the extension of provisions of affirmative action to the private sector has met with sharp opposition from the industrial sector that sees its freedom of employing persons being curbed with such policies. But unless there is affirmative action in this area, minorities, Dalits, women and others from marginalized groups will continue to be denied equal opportunities. Further, despite the constitutional provisions of equality, the persistence of inequalities in the personal laws of different religions\u2212 in matters of divorce, inheritance,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "851df6d6-e494-4b56-8f33-01ad1962c575": {"__data__": {"id_": "851df6d6-e494-4b56-8f33-01ad1962c575", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d5c11170134adc68a816a816f0bca5ec5287c5aeec12036e507e767f6a074f1f"}}, "hash": "d5c11170134adc68a816a816f0bca5ec5287c5aeec12036e507e767f6a074f1f", "text": "custody, maintenance and other matters pertaining to the family\u2212 is a matter of critical concern. As an example, despite legislation prohibiting child marriage, the practice continues in the region except in Sri Lanka. But even in Sri Lanka, it is prevalent among the Muslims in small numbers. In Bangladesh, in 50 per cent of the marriages that take place, the girls are below 15 years of age.180 The impact of corruption on the justice system is not clearly analyzed. In Pakistan, there are allegations against the police of bribery, manipulation of evidence and using provisions of law that are lesser offences.181 The same situation exists in other countries too. Gender Equity in the Justice System The justice system in the region is based on a combination of common and religious laws. The structures of the legal systems draw their sources from their constitutions, which in turn have many provisions based on common law. Thus, there are unifying features in the formal body of the justice system of the region especially with reference to fundamental rights, fair trial standards, the presumption of innocence of 180 Summary records of CEDAW, 5th periodic report of Bangladesh, 9th july 2004. 181 Hina Jilani, Violence against the legal system, page 163. 67 the accused and the various tiers of the courts. The formal laws and constitutional provisions, while providing for substantial rights, raise problematic issues in the context of gender. In the context of de facto equality, what is required is to link the connections between non-discrimination, equality and equity. \\ The application of the law to particular situations would depend on the justice system and it is in this arena that understanding equity is of great importance. Equity is the remedial justice that addresses the imperfection of laws, taking note of the fact that what is legal is not always just.182 The development of cases in the region indicates that while courts have taken note of inequality within the constitutional right, they have also used equity as a measure to address substantial justice. The complexities in the region make the task of addressing gender equity daunting and challenging. The justice system has had both a positive and negative role in this direction. Sometimes, despite the de jure law granting certain rights, the justice system fails to protect rights and is also misused by powerful interests as indicated below. At times, despite the de jure law\u2019s failure to protect the rights of women, the justice system has stepped in and rectified the situation. The judgment of the Lahore High Court addresses the constitutional right of the woman to have a family, has given an interpretation that has a harmonious construction with religious injunctions in addressing the right to choice and is a good example of gender equity (Box 32). Despite such positive interpretations in the region, problems persist. 182 ibid 647 68 Box 32: Pakistan High Court Judgement\u2212Mst Sajida Bibi and another vs Chouki 2 Police Station, Saddar, Sahiwal An adult woman who married a man of her choice was harassed by her family members who filed police cases against them. Under Article 35 of the Constitution of Pakistan, the State shall protect the marriage, the family, the mother and the child.\" The couple filed proceedings against the station house officer protesting the harassment. The Lahore High Court observed, \u201cMajor and sane persons, both male and female have the right to contract marriage with their own free will. When a marriage is contracted by a woman without the consent of her parents, it is often seen that effort is made by her parents to undo the marriage. In most of the cases this is done on account of the tribal customs or social taboos or on account of barbarism. However, such considerations have to yield to the constitutional commands, law and the Islamic Injunctions. The divorce obtained through coercion or the recovery of the girl secured otherwise by the parents in most of the cases results in very awful situation. As a result of the consummation of marriage, except in rare cases, the wife conceives and the parents of the girl in the first instance try to kill the still born child in the womb of the mother through abortion. If such efforts fail and the child is born, it leads to still more serious consequence. First, the legitimacy of the child is called in question and secondly, the responsibility to bring up the child is not shared by the parents of the mother and thirdly, she is compelled to marry elsewhere against her wishes.

The court further observed, \u201cIf the spouses are deprived of their right to live together and they are compelled to live separately against their wishes then it will be a worst kind of violation of their fundamental right guaranteed under Article 9 of the Constitution. The duty of the police is to act in aid of the Constitution and the law. Neither the police nor any other functionary of the State has any right to cause harassment to a married couple or their family members with a view to cause separation between the spouses. The duty of the police lies in protecting the marital life of a duly married couple and not to cause any hindrance therein. The police should not lend a helping hand in depriving the spouses of their fundamental right to live together peacefully. Article 9 of the Constitution provides that no person shall be deprived of life or liberty save in accordance with law. Source: Pakistan Law Digest, 1997, Lahore, page 666. Despite the de jure law permitting such marriages and relationships, and with higher courts recognizing the rights of parties to marry a person of their choice, there are many instances of the criminal justice system being put in motion to contest the validity of such marriages. For example, if a heterosexual couples(same sex behavior is an offence in the region), belonging to two different religions or castes, decide to marry they face opposition from their community that is further fueled by fundamentalism, with the communities getting involved in using the criminal justice system to harass young couple. The first objection is made with reference to the age of the woman. If the woman is unable to prove her age, charges are made that she is a minor using the various provisions of kidnapping from lawful guardianship in the penal codes. Proof of age is a major requirement in such cases and school certificates are considered valid evidence. But since there a high degree of drop outs and illiteracy, in addition to lack of age documentation in the region, matters are compounded as the woman is unable to prove that she is above the age of consent. The woman is then detained in \u201cprotective custody\u201d, a concept peculiar to the region. 69 In Pakistan, young men who marry women, defying parental norms, can also be charged of kidnapping and if the girl refuses to testify against her husband they are charged of Zina.183 All systems in the region recognize the right of the court to detain women in protective custody in shelter homes or in homes run by the government where other women offenders are housed even when they have not committed an offence. Even adult women are detained if during a course of a criminal proceeding the court is of the opinion that she does not have a proper place of residence. This concept, where the woman is kept in protection for her own good, does not apply to men. There are many instances of adult rape victims being kept in protective custody while the perpetrators of the offence are released on bail. These are not legislative interventions but advanced by courts in the region. In Bangladesh the Suppression of Violence against Women and Children Act 2000 (Nari o Shishu Nirjaton), and the Suppression of Violence against Women and Children Act 2000 (Nari o Shishu Nirjaton Daman Ain) prevent the practice of placing women in \u201csafe custody\u201d. However, judges still place adult women in \u201csafe custody\u201d in shelter homes without even ascertaining their consent. Apart from violating her right to liberty and movement, besides restricting all her freedoms, there is a grave concern of safety and security. Conditions in such shelters are often inadequate and women in \u201csafe custody\u201d are reported to have been subjected to physical and psychological abuse.184 In India, the remand home in Agra became a hub where women were sexually assaulted and exploited resulting in public interest litigation.185 In Bhutan, it has often been explained as necessary since there was no safe custody law and judges had no other option to ensure their security.186 In the area of trafficking, women often enter the host country on false promises, and become illegal immigrants thus", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2cf88168-df87-47d8-af63-08d64ff8d712": {"__data__": {"id_": "2cf88168-df87-47d8-af63-08d64ff8d712", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "72dba5d4c5f91d30727c492714ca8d94005e3f05902150aea5d111bef97dd8c9"}}, "hash": "72dba5d4c5f91d30727c492714ca8d94005e3f05902150aea5d111bef97dd8c9", "text": "violating various legislation. Laws that are required to prevent trafficking and sexual abuse of women, including the sale of women into prostitution are rarely implemented, with a low rate of convictions among traffickers. On the one hand, many countries do not treat the \u201csex worker\u201d as an offender. But the definition of soliciting as an offence results in many \u201csex workers\u201d being charged with an offence under the law. In the context of HIV/AIDS, the problem is more complex. While health departments of various governments identify sex workers as major stakeholders in their policies, the police harasses and subjects sex workers to violence. The introduction of Qisas in Pakistan and its recognition in the Islamic Republic of Iran and Afghanistan has privatized certain categories of criminal law that has had severe implications for women. Men who kill their wives are assured from the outset that such murder will not be punished in the same manner as the murder of other people, but merely with a sentence of few years\u2019 imprisonment.187 The custom of Karo Kari (women and men involved in illicit relationships) results in honor crimes, where mere allegations and public perceptions of persons having affairs are sufficient to prove their guilt. The custom is sometimes used to legitimize murder and some 183 The report of the commission of enquiry of women 1997 observed that 40 to 45 per cent of women in jail have been accused of Zina.

This age differential on the basis of gender is extremely problematic. Problems arising from sexual stereotypes also persist in the region. Sexual violence is still an area that is difficult to address since in most of the cultures in the study matters relating to sex are not discussed openly. However, common law expects women to narrate their experiences in a factual manner. The system also expects her to describe her experience to various persons. Investigations are not carried out by women police. Courts view evidence from a hyper technical approach and acquit offenders on the slightest doubt. While the right of the accused is not challenged here, what is of concern is that the recording and collection of evidence is not taken in a scientific manner either deliberately or negligently causing miscarriage of justice. One of the difficulties in handling cases of violence is in the evidentiary requirement. The procedural rules in many countries often require that a victim of violence receive a requisition from the police before being treated in a hospital. Valuable evidence is often lost since private hospitals often refuse to treat victims of crimes arguing that it is a medico-legal case. Bangladesh has changed its rules whereby such victims first see a doctor, who then sends a report to the police. Apart from providing timely help to the person, such a practice also helps to prevent the destruction of valuable evidence. Despite medical research proving the contrary, courts in India still rely upon the intact nature of the hymen in rape cases. Doctors often perform what is called a \u201ctwo finger test\u201d to determine whether the rape victim was subject to sexual intercourse. It is a technique that verifies whether the hymen is broken or not, and whether it is distensible or not. A large part of the cross examination of defense lawyers then rests on the argument about the women\u2019s body to put forth a case that she was not a virgin and was by implication habituated to sexual relationships. Rather than addressing the violence, such an approach encourages stereotypes of women. Apart from being highly interventionist and disturbing, this test is also misleading and not borne by scientific evidence. 8. De Facto Gender Equity in the Political Sphere The representation of women in elected bodies assumes significance since their experience can make a great difference in the enforcement of policies that are based on equality laws. Women\u2019s representation at the national and local levels remains low. Legislation to address this has had mixed success as indicated earlier.

Currently, the prohibitive expenses, violence and corruption in electoral practices are not conducive for women\u2019s participation. \\ Representation of women in the judiciary is low in the region. \\There are many instances of positive state interventions in the region. Under the Gram Sarkar Act of 2003, women parliamentarians are designated as advisors of each Gram Sarkar, an associated body of the local Union Parishad or local self governments. Such interactions between women parliamentarians and local self bodies would give a gender vision to ground-level policy, encourage leadership potentials of grassroots women leaders and serve as role models for other women. In the civil service, ten per cent of the entry-level places are reserved for women. Women can also be directly appointed at the decision-making level under a presidential quota. Bhutan had its first national assembly election in March 2008. Prior to the elections, women occupied 26 per cent of civil service posts. While participation in elections for public office at the village and national levels was low, 12 of the 100 people\u2019s representatives recently elected to the National Assembly and one of the six Royal Advisory Councilors were women. Although Bhutan had achieved excellent development and growth in a number of areas, including literacy, health and education, men benefited more from the development process than women.190 Currently, three women have been elected to the government. The Islamic Republic of Iran has a clear institutionalized structure to address corruption in the judiciary. 9. De Facto Gender Equity in the Economic Sphere The region has achieved many positive developments in the area of employment, but with greater privatization the role of non-state actors has to be critically examined and existing mechanisms need to be strengthened. Sexual harassment in the workplace is an area of concern where the absence of legal interventions has impeded the advancement of women in the social and economic spheres of life. Despite a strong labor movement in the organized sector, in most countries in the region there is still a lack of understanding about the magnitude of the problem. While there is no separate law to address it in the workplace, general criminal law provides a mechanism by treating it as an offence. While this could only be a reactive solution to the problem, effective enforcement mechanisms in the workplace are required to address the concern. The judgment of the Indian Supreme Court in Visaka\u2019s case is a step in that direction. 189 Alternate report of NGOs to the CEDAW committee, 2006. 190 Summary records of CEDAW, combined initial, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth periodic report of Bhutan January 2004. 72 The conditions of women in the unorganized sector indicate that there is hardly any law in the region that addresses even their basic legal rights of employment such as hours of work, leave and other rights. While all countries in the region have laws relating to minimum wages, these do not apply to individual employees such as domestic workers. Exploitation in this area in the absence of substantive law and procedural mechanisms is a matter of concern. Access to justice implies that a woman who wants to access the system must not only have good lawyers, but also access to various services. A woman who has suffered violence would first require shelter and medical attention should she decide to leave her violent spouse. A search for employment would be the next priority. Only then would she be able to contemplate legal recourse. On the other hand, a man who wants to leave a spouse would not require any such measures. Thus, access to justice in the context of gender is wide and far reaching. Legal services should include not only the services of lawyers but also other support structures such as shelters, medical facilities, education for children, and employment opportunities. Pro bono legal service is a right recognized in all the countries studied. But these are not linked to services that would address women\u2019s needs.

The mobile courts of Afghanistan are another example of an innovative method of expanding the judicial process for greater access. It enables the court to go to the people, rather than the people having to go to court. In efforts to provide speedier justice, ADRs supported by the judiciary are seriously considered as an alternative to the existing formal legal systems in Bangladesh and India. They are not bound by the formal rules of evidence and if applied properly, would facilitate access to justice. For example, in a case on validity of marriage before an ADR, the mediator would not look immediately at the legality of marriage but try to address the issues beneath the surface. Cases relating to inheritance laws where there a party faces discrimination, could be better addressed in an ADR. A formal court, on the other hand, would have to address the case based on the evidence provided. However, members in ADRs should be experts in law and be sensitized to gender and equity as otherwise it could be counter-productive. There is a tendency in India to consider ADRs as an alternate mode of disposal rather than one where the rights of the parties can be addressed without much formality. In order for ADRs to be effective, they must be considered as evocating an imaginative way of resolving the dispute and not as one that disposes litigation merely because the formal system is overburdened. Otherwise, the system would focus only on increasing the disposal rate and providing statistics, rather than serving as an effective tool of justice. Family courts have been established in some countries to address disputes in civil laws relating to the family. The Family Courts Act of India, however, does not permit parties to have legal representation as a matter of right, but lawyers can appear only on discretion of the court. This makes the issue extremely burdensome for the litigant since substantial laws on marriage, divorce, custody, etc are extremely complex and the denial of a lawyer affects the woman adversely since she is generally less educated than the man. 73 The establishment of women\u2019s commissions and human rights commissions in Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and India has highlighted the concerns of women\u2019s human rights. 10. De Facto Gender Equity in the Social Sphere Declining Sex Ratio and Feticide While various factors determine sex ratio, clear correlations exist between the proliferation of sex determination tests, increase in sex selective abortions, and declining sex ratios in urban areas. Within the region, India has introduced legislation that addresses this problem. But the law imposes mild punishment for the first offence and increase it gradually, the penalty structure itself defeat the purpose. The conspiracy of silence and non-reporting, especially by the medical fraternity, even when definite information of the commission of this offence is available is yet another dimension of the problem. In its concluding observations on India, the CEDAW committee noted with concern that the maternal mortality rates and infant mortality rates in India are among the highest in the world.191 It also observed that the adverse sex ratio and the incidence of sex-selection abortions, despite being banned by law.192 Since then a number of policies have been formulated and legislations such as the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act have been reviewed. The problem persists due to a cultural factor that stresses the importance of a boy child and devalues a girl child. It is an area where, apart from legislative interventions, proactive measures and major interventions such as campaigns are required. In the context of child marriages, despite legislations, the practice continues since it is believed that a child bride would adapt well to inter-or intra-familial responsibilities imposed on her. The repercussions of child marriage results in poor health and educational status of women, lack of socio, political and economic opportunities, and alternatives and resources.193 There are hardly any convictions under these laws. If one were to take legal remedy against child marriages, in Pakistan a girl child can legally repudiate her marriage before she turns 18. Similar provision exists in India under the Hindu Marriage Act. The reality however, is that despite a provision that addresses child marriages, it would be impossible for a girl married as a child to take legal recourse and seek nullification of her marriage just before she turns eighteen while being under the control of her family. Not surprisingly, there are hardly any case laws under this legal provision in the region.

One example is with reference to marriages of choice between adults under civil law in India. The Special Marriage Act in India is a civil law permitting such marriages and requires parties to put a notice in the office of the marriage registrar for one to three months. Radical religious organizations track notices of such marriages and then harass the families. Thus, even despite the de jure 191 The MMR is 540 deaths per 100,000 births. 192 Concluding observations of the CEDAW committee India 1/2/2000 A/55/38 para 78. 193 alternate second and third NGO report on CEDAW. 74 position permitting such marriages, at a de facto level,adults are not able to exercise their rights. Violence both before and after inter-caste and inter-religious marriages is often the norm, with the purported threat of the breakdown of law and order being used by the police and the executive to retrieve the woman.194 From a de facto position, in terms of access to justice, the Family Courts Act in India provides for special courts to try disputes relating to personal laws. These courts have brought an entire gamut of cases under one umbrella, however only in cities. In other places, cases are tried in regular civil courts. While family courts have made the process easier, they give greater importance to preserving the family than upholding gender justice and addressing economic issues when a marriage ends. Delayed trials are also a problem. Courts deal with a wide variety of cases that include issues of caste, class, religion and ethnicity. Judges are not aware of how each aspect of identity combines to create particular forms of disadvantages and impact women\u2019s rights.195 The evidentiary requirements of fault based divorce often results in hardships to parties in the context of collecting evidence. The practice of triple talaq is a very problematic area since the husband can divorce his wife at will, leaving no scope for her to seek any remedy. Since she is not entitled to maintenance beyond the period of Iddat, this often results in her impoverishment. Further, though dower is a beneficial right to the woman, in practice, the sums that are fixed are small. The decisions of courts that direct the husband to pay a reasonable and fair maintenance by which lump sums are ordered actually benefits only women who are married to husbands who can raise and pay a large sum. The legislative impetus in Bangladesh and Pakistan under the family law ordinance, the Civil Code of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and the family laws of Maldives all create a structure to address matrimonial disputes. These legislative changes are worth considering in other countries of the region. In the context of Islamic law, the practice of ijtihad involves interpreting sharia law and Islamic doctrine according to the needs of the people, should be revived. One of the key factors contributing to the stagnant laws has been the lack of Ijtihad and its replacement with Taqleed. To quote Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, \u201csome issues about women, which exist in religious jurisprudence, are not the final say. It is possible to interpret new points through research by a skillful jurist\u201d.196 In the present context, it is more practical to work from such a framework in law. In the region there is significant abuse and misinterpretation of religion and the role of women, running counter to tolerant sharia laws. The judgment of the Bangladesh High Court that declared Fatwas as violating fundamental rights and that of the Lahore High Court that held freedom of choice in marriage was a fundamental right, are positive examples of judiciary responses in addressing gender equity. 194 Uma Chakravarti, from fathers to husbands; of love, death and marriage in North India, Honor Crimes, paradigms and violence against women edited by Lynn Welchman and Sara Hossain, Zed Books, London 2005. 195 National Conference on women and access to justice A report organized in December 2006 by Partners for law in development 196 quoted from the web site, Naseer Karimi, \u201c Iran Leader signals flexibility on woman\u201d A.P.

Key Issues Emerging from the Study One of the key issues emerging from the study is that there is no clear understanding on discrimination.

Another key issue emerging from the study is that criminal law that impact the lives of women is often a measure of oppression and harassment resulting in the deprivation of her rights. Even stringent legislation, such as rape law that are substantive in nature, fail to address gender discrimination due to procedural laws. Thus the substance, culture and procedure of laws can be a major obstacle to gender justice. The study indicates that in the area of family law, complete reform of secular legislation cannot be easily achieved. On the other hand, critical areas can be identified for proposed reforms that will integrate human rights norms and harmonize domestic laws with international standards that governments are bound to integrate into the legal system. The CEDAW committee has approved the practice of women\u2019s groups studying their religious and customary traditions to engage in a reform process that harmonizes the law with constitutional and international human rights norms.197 Customary practices and the findings by alternate resolutions of disputes through communities are discriminatory. The study indicates that there is no legislation to address discriminatory or lack of rights of persons with HIV/AIDS. Same sex behaviour is criminalized in all the countries. The study finds that in all the countries, certain endemic problems in the context of the legal system remain. The lack of law enforcement is a major hindrance to equity justice in the region. The non-registration of cases by law enforcers due to a lack of gender awareness and corruption is extremely problematic. Necessities of evidentiary requirements and proof of age and marriage are common in the region. Currently there is no law to address sexual harassment, despite it being a matter of serious concern. 197 CEDAW concluding comments on Maldives (2001), Egypt (2001) Tunisia (2002) and Sri Lanka (2002) 76 The laws of nationality continue to discriminate against women in some countries of the region, but discussions on change have also emerged. Registration of marriages is not yet part of the law except in Bangladesh and Pakistan. Child marriages are permitted under the law. There is currently no comparative review of existing legislation and judicial precedents. The study indicates that cross border trafficking and repatriation are often detrimental to the interests of justice. It also indicates that the problem is acute, despite regional conventions and efforts by the states. Efforts to address domestic violence through legislation has fructified as laws in India and Sri Lanka, while Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nepal are in the process of evolving their own legislation. Current laws are inadequate in addressing reproductive techniques used to determine the sex of the child and then abort it if it is a female. The development of public interest litigation has led to many positive judgments in the region. Structures to address corruption are not in place in many countries of the region, such as Iran. The importance of sufficient training for members of the judiciary, lawyers, and the police can never be over-emphasized. Training must focus on measures to introduce legislative reforms aimed at eliminating discrimination. Police protocols need to evolve with reference to rights of persons especially in the context of gender. There is a need to develop a witness protection scheme. 12. Conclusion The findings narrated in this paper broadly indicate the concerns emerging in the region. While legislative changes are essential, the paper also highlights that despite such intervention at the de jure level, there are many hurdles in its implementation. The dynamics of the interplay of civil, criminal and constitutional law with custom is extremely complex and gender equity has to be nuanced in addressing these areas. A combination of various agencies can facilitate addressing this situation by generating awareness in sustained campaigns, highlighting positive developments in the area, and sharing information on best practices in the region that have a cultural context for the various countries. The paper has its limitations. There are many areas that were not covered or adequately covered in the study. The study has chosen a sample of concerns in the region and looked at them through the prism of international human rights and 77 constitutional rights. This is to provide an indicator that can serve as an impetus for more research in the region.

Currently, prohibitive expenses, violence and corruption are not conducive for women\u2019s participation. Such concerns have to be seriously addressed. \u2022 In Bangladesh, under the Gram Sarkar Act of 2003, women parliamentarians are designated as advisors of each Gram Sarkar, an associated body of the local union Parishad, or local self governments. Such interaction between women parliamentarians and local self bodies would give a gendered vision to ground-level policy, encourage leadership potential of grassroots women leaders, and provide role models for other women. \u2022 The Islamic Republic of Iran has a clear institutionalized structure to address corruption in the judiciary. \u2022 In cases of sexual harassment in the workplace, mechanisms that address the concern are required. Such mechanisms include setting up committees, transferring or suspending employment of the perpetrator, and other civil measures such as compensation. \u2022 With regards to the role of private actors in cases of employment, existing redress mechanisms need to be strengthened. \u2022 Access to justice in the context of gender is wide and far reaching. Legal services should include not only the services of lawyers but also other support structures such as shelters, medical facilities, education for children, and employment opportunities. Legal services must have a link to social and economic services so that a woman can gain access to justice. \u2022 The mobile courts of Afghanistan are an example of an innovative method of expanding the judicial process to areas where people formerly did not have access to justice. \u2022 ADRs are not bound by the formal rules of evidence, and if applied properly would facilitate access to justice. Such dispute resolutions must be institutionalized structures with clear cut accountability. 198 http://www.unfpa.org/swp/1999/chapter4b.htm 78 \u2022 In cases of maintenance, attachment proceedings take a very long time where the onus is on the woman to prove the worth of the person. An alternative would be for the state to evolve a policy to provide sums for a woman seeking recourse to maintenance and recovering the sum from the errant spouse. \u2022 The legislative impetus in Bangladesh and Pakistan under the family law ordinance, the Civil Code of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the family laws of Maldives all create a structure to address matrimonial disputes. The sensitivity of minority rights, not withstanding these legislative changes, is worth considering in other countries of the region. \u2022 In Pakistan and Bangladesh, the law requires registrations of marriages. The region also needs to develop a system of such nature. \u2022 In the context of Islamic law, the practice of ijtihad, involving the interpretation of sharia law and Islamic doctrine, needs to be revived. \u2022 NGOs can take note of best practices in the region and start the impetus for law reforms through sustained campaigns. \u2022 Training programs for judges on comparative law and judicial practices in the region would facilitate gender sensitization. \u2022 Networking of lawyers in the region, to share legal information and litigation, especially in areas of trafficking, is crucial. \u2022 The media can initiate sustained campaigns on positive practices, judgments and legislation in the region and also disseminate such information. 79 BIBLIOGRAPHY BOOKS A Fyzee - Outline of Mohammedan Law, 4th Edition, Oxford University Press, Delhi 1972 Ali Shaheen Sardar, Gender and Human rights, \u201c Islam and International Law\u201d, 2000, Amy Senior, Rebuilding the Judicial Sector in Afghanistan: The role of Customary Law, The Fletcher School of Online Journal for Issues related to Southwest Asia and Islamic civilization Anant.T, Sundaram K, and Tendulkar S - Employment and labour in south Asia 1999.

On the ground in 177 countries and territories, we offer global perspective and local insight to help empower lives and build resilient nations. ICLEI \u2013 Local Governments for Sustainability, is an international, not-for-profit association of local governments and local government organisations that have made a commitment to sustainable development. ICLEI\u2019s mission is to build a movement of councils to achieve tangible improvements in environmental conditions through the cumulative impact of local action. 4 Abstract More than half the world\u2019s population lives in urban areas and urbanisation trends are growing, with Asian cities at the heart of urban growth. Cities play an important role in the climate change arena, both as significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, and also centres of innovative activity for reducing emissions. However, cities are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. An understanding of their vulnerabilities, and how to reduce these vulnerabilities is imperative. This paper explores the sources of greenhouse emissions in Asian cities and the particular vulnerabilities of Asian cities to the impacts of climate change. Through a review of policies and field-based studies undertaken in two Asian megacities, Jakarta (Indonesia) and Mumbai (India), local community vulnerabilities are explored and innovative adaptive measures identified. The predominant climate related focus for communities researched in both cities was flood mitigation, where community adaptation included such things as raising the floor level of houses, storing clothing in plastic bags on high shelves, and collective community cleaning of rubbish from canals before the monsoon season arrived. However, many of these residents were placed at greater risk of future climate change, due to such things as lack of properly executed and enforced urban planning, poor provision and maintenance of basic services such as water supply, sanitation and waste collection, and poor disaster risk reduction planning. City governments have a role to play in reducing both greenhouse emissions, and vulnerability to climate change impacts, through activating \u201clevers\u201d, such as planning, regulation, purchasing power, network facilitation, education and their civic leadership role.

Researchers in Australia, India and Indonesia were engaged to assist with this work. A literature review was undertaken to investigate and analyse the importance of cities and urbanisation in the context of addressing climate change and promoting human development for people in Asia. Field-based studies for two mega-cities in Asia, Mumbai and Jakarta, were reviewed to determine what the local challenges and vulnerabilities were to climate change impacts and the adaptation strategies undertaken to date. Additionally, a policy review was undertaken to consider the impact of policies on climate change in the two cities. Urban centres are focal points of economic growth, job creation, culture, creativity and innovation, but as they rapidly expand, they also exhibit extremes in living standards across their communities, income inequity, and differential access to services. Some of the key challenges that increase the negative impacts of urbanisation in developing countries include short-term planning, lack of capacity of local officials and of the local community to engage with the planning system, poor governance, competing priorities and an ongoing process of decentralisation, without the associated knowledge, skills and resources. Each of these challenges further exacerbates cities\u2019 potential contribution to climate change, and its exposure to impacts. The International Energy Agency estimates cities contribute 71% of global greenhouse gas emissions, either directly or indirectly.2 These emissions stem from energy used to power cities, (which predominantly comes from fossil fuels), transport, commercial and residential buildings, waste, wastewater and industry sectors. Many of these emissions are increasing in cities not because of the increased number of people, but of the way they live; how they choose to consume goods, to travel etc. City governments can influence these areas, through engaged, transparent, long-term planning, effective implementation of regulations, their own purchasing power, facilitation of networks, education and civic leadership. Even with strong, global action to reduce emissions, however, the impacts of climate change will not be avoided, and cities, particularly in Asia, are vulnerable to these impacts. One framework proposed to assess the vulnerability of cities to climate change considers their level of exposure to climate change impacts, their sensitivity, or the degree to which it is affected by those impacts, 1 (Sanchez-Rodriquez, et al. 2005, 8) 2 (IEA 2008) 7 and their capacity to adapt to and cope with the impacts of climate change. This may be represented by the formula: Vulnerability = f (Sensitivity * Exposure * 1/Adaptive Capacity)3 Cities located on coasts, rivers or river deltas are particularly exposed to a range of projected climate change impacts, including coastal erosion, salt-water intrusion and flooding from sea-level rise; flooding or drought from altered precipitation regimes; flooding and other damage associated with more intense storm events; heat waves and increasing temperatures associated with the urban heat island effect. As cities concentrate people and systems, they are more sensitive to the impacts of climate change, and likely to be impacted to a higher degree. The inter-related nature of the systems that keep cities running, including power systems, communications, transport, water supply and sanitation systems, mean that a disruption or poor performance in one system, may have flow on impacts to other connected systems. Disruptions to these systems have a greater impact on poor communities in cities, affecting both their health and livelihood. In Asian cities, although exposed to multiple climate change impacts, the perception of most cities is that flooding (whether this be caused by increased intense precipitation events, cyclones and storms or sea-level rise) is the focus area for adaptation efforts. To consider the vulnerabilities and adaptation actions of Asian cities in a more localised way, Mumbai (India) and Jakarta (Indonesia) were reviewed more closely, through analysing field-based studies undertaken in these cities. Both Mumbai and Jakarta are exposed to serious flooding, severe storms, drought, urban heat island effect and heat waves, along with the associated direct and indirect impacts of these conditions on city service provision, health and livelihood. Projections suggest that as a result of climate change, Mumbai and Jakarta will be even more exposed to these impacts. Their sensitivity to impacts is high, as they are the economic centres of their countries, contributing significantly to their respective country\u2019s GDP. Additionally, both cities are classed as \u201cmega-cities\u201d, with populations of their broader metropolitan regions exceeding 10 million people. A significant proportion of the population, 6.9million4 in the case of Mumbai and in excess of 700,0005 people in Jakarta live in poverty, and are more exposed to climate change impacts, and more sensitive to them. Through the collection of case studies, interesting examples of planned and unplanned adaptation were observed.

Collective community actions such as cleaning the rubbish from canals before the monsoon season to widen the channel for water were also documented. However, examples of where adaptive capacity was reduced were also revealed, including: lack of properly planned and enforced land use and urban planning (which allows building on highly exposed areas such as riverbanks, over natural drainage areas, upstream intensive urban development along river ways); the clearing of mangroves and forests; poor provision of basic services such as water supply, sanitation services and waste collection services; poor maintenance of sanitation and water services, and poor disaster risk reduction planning. At the national and also local city level in both Mumbai and Jakarta, there is an increasing recognition of the importance of climate change, and several policies are highlighting this. 3 (IPCC 2001, 89) This is the framework first presented by the IPCC in 2001, in Section 1.4.1 of WG2, TAR, then refined further by several authors. 4 (Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai 2009) 5 (Firman, et al. 2010) 8 However, while many of these policies appear to be gaining some traction, and have implementation in place, there is still a perceived lack of engagement with the urban poor who may be affected by these policies, which therefore affects how well they will be received and implemented. Many of the actions that could be taken to improve the cities\u2019 response to climate change, and adapting to its impacts are less on the policy formation level, and more on the strategy and implementation level. Many of these actions are not only for city level authorities and agents to undertake, but also at the national and international level. These include undertaking more urban field-based studies to inform the development of appropriate policy and strategies, improving city- level climate modelling, developing better climate change communication approaches and language and capturing and sharing the experiences of communities adapting to climate change. There is a role to better integrate climate change into current NGO agendas and to encourage community-led initiatives. Further strategies include facilitating the improved understanding of climate change by both the community and local government staff and elected representatives, improving the capacity of the community to engage in local government processes, and of the local government representatives to engage the community in planning processes. For emergency events in particular, the improvement of early warning systems would be of value. Broader local government issues of addressing short-term, non-integrated planning and improving governance will have positive implications beyond the climate change agenda. Finally, facilitating understanding by donor agencies of the unique challenges and concepts of urban resilience to climate change is an important strategy to be undertaken. As concentrators of wealth and innovation, cities are uniquely placed to address the challenges of climate change, and to be supported to achieve positive outcomes for their communities. Asian cities are faced with particular challenges, and need to be encouraged to take urgent action. It is hoped this report will assist agencies and development professionals to target appropriate action to facilitate improved resilience of people in Asian cities to climate change impacts.

INTRODUCTION This report aims to analyse the importance of cities and urbanisation in the context of addressing climate change and promoting human development for people in Asia. Additionally, it aims to synthesise the understanding in two urban mega-cities in Asia of: \u2022 Local challenges to climate change impacts \u2022 Vulnerabilities to climate change \u2022 Existing local adaptation strategies of urban communities \u2022 Existing local mitigation strategies of urban communities \u2022 Impact of the policy framework on vulnerabilities Finally, it will identify opportunities to promote pro-poor policies and strategies to reduce vulnerabilities to be considered by development professionals and local government representatives in developing countries. No primary research was undertaken for this report. It relied on published materials and field- study reports conducted by others. ICLEI Oceania engaged research assistants in India and Indonesia to assist with sourcing field studies, and conducting the policy review for each city. This process is outlined in Section 2, Methodology. The world is becoming more urbanised, with more than half the world\u2019s population now living in cities6, and with anticipated future world population growth occurring almost exclusively in urban areas7. These urban centres are focal points of economic growth, job creation, culture, creativity and innovation, but as they rapidly expand, they also exhibit extremes in living standards across their communities, income inequity, and differential access to services. Section 3 considers the process of urbanisation generally, its drivers, benefits and challenges. It then considers the interaction of urbanisation and climate change, including the role cities play in contributing to climate change. With an estimated 71%8 of global greenhouse gas emissions directly or indirectly attributed to cities globally, they have an important role to play in reducing global emissions. Local governments, along with national governments, business, industry and individuals are implementing measures to limit greenhouse gas emission growth, however emissions continue to grow and the impacts of climate change are now believed to be inevitable.9 It is merely the scale of impacts under question. Even with immediate, strong action to decrease emissions, cities will still be impacted. Section 4 outlines some of these impacts, and the inter-related nature of further direct and indirect impacts on urban systems and poor populations. It then considers how some of the challenges of urbanisation will exacerbate some of these impacts. Cities in Asia are rapidly growing during a time when the causes and impacts of climate change are known. Section 5.1 considers what contribution Asian cities are making to global emissions, and what initiatives are being implemented to mitigate them. Across Asia, impacts of climate change have already been observed, including changes in mean temperature, deviations in precipitation levels and in precipitation patterns, in the frequency and 6 (UN-HABITAT 2008, 13) 7 (UN-HABITAT 2008, 5) 8 (IEA 2008) 9 (IPCC 2007a) 11 intensity of storm and cyclone events, and sea level rise.10 It has been proposed that a city\u2019s vulnerability to climate change can be seen as a function of its exposure to a specific (or range) of impacts plus its sensitivity to that impact, and the inverse of its adaptive capacity. This can be represented by: Vulnerability = f (Exposure, Sensitivity, 1/Adaptive Capacity)11 Applying the above concept of vulnerability, cities in Asia are projected to be among the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change particularly the coastal cities of Asia.12 Section 5.2 highlights Asian cities\u2019 exposure to climate changes and their sensitivity. It considers the impacts already felt by many cities, and how these are projected to worsen in the future. Two Asian mega-cities, Mumbai in India and Jakarta in Indonesia, have been identified as having high levels of exposure to multiple risks, such as drought, sea-level rise and flooding. They are also economic hubs for their respective countries, with large populations in excess of 10 million people and growing, so exhibit high levels of sensitivity. These two cities will form the basis of this report\u2019s further analysis of the vulnerability of people in cities to climate change. This analysis presents some key statistics about each city (Section 6) and includes a review of policies impacting the two cities at the national, regional and city level (Section 7). It also briefly considers some of the drivers in the two cities that increase greenhouse emissions (Section 8). Field-studies from each of the cities focusing on the impacts of flooding and sea-level rise, particularly for the poor, are analysed for both current and future vulnerabilities in Section 9. Section 10 brings these thoughts together to consider recommendations for policy makers and development workers in developing countries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e00023f6-cec8-47a7-bd0f-4cf5acf7f2b7": {"__data__": {"id_": "e00023f6-cec8-47a7-bd0f-4cf5acf7f2b7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5411d989bd875f7fbc986c4d91fbc8d2763de251b2db2568c2de4651dae5de59"}}, "hash": "5411d989bd875f7fbc986c4d91fbc8d2763de251b2db2568c2de4651dae5de59", "text": "The climate change field, in particular the adaptation area, is a multi-disciplinary and emerging field. A standard terminology is still to be accepted across all disciplines, so definitions for the key terms used in the report are presented in Section 12, Glossary Key Terms. 2. METHODOLOGY The geographic scope of the research is predominantly the Asia region, focusing on two mega- cities chosen from this region; one city in South Asia (Mumbai) and one city in Southeast Asia (Jakarta). This report aims to synthesise some of the information currently circulating about climate change and cities in Asia. For this reason, no primary research was undertaken. A literature review was undertaken to consolidate key terms and definitions in use in the field of climate change mitigation and adaptation. The literature review also considered the growth of urbanisation, particularly in Asia, and what the links were between urbanisation and climate change. The role played by cities in increasing greenhouse gas emissions was explored, and how they could be a significant player in reducing global emissions. Across Asia, many research projects and networks are being established to determine the likely impacts of climate change on urban communities, who will be most vulnerable, and what can be 10 (Cruz, et al. 2007) 11 (IPCC 2001, p89) This is the framework first presented by the IPCC in 2001, in Section 1.4.1 of WG2, TAR, then refined further by several authors. 12 (WWF 2010), (Yusuf and Francisco 2009) 12 done to minimise the impacts and build resilience. These networks and initiatives include the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network (ACCCRN), the Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APN), UN-HABITAT\u2019s Sustainable Urban Development Network (SUD-Net) Cities in Climate Change Initiative amongst many others. This paper drew on the work of these networks and initiatives to consider the likely impact of climate change on urban centres in Asia, although few of these initiatives focus on megacities. For the selected cities of Mumbai and Jakarta, a policy review was undertaken to consider if climate change considerations were being integrated into national, regional and local policy, and if so, how. A literature review was undertaken to investigate the areas of production and consumption that most impacted on greenhouse gas emissions for the two cities. Finally, field- based studies were identified for Mumbai and Jakarta and interrogated to draw out the local challenges to climate change impacts; the particular vulnerabilities identified; the existing local adaptation and mitigation strategies of urban communities and the impact of the prevailing policy framework on these vulnerabilities. The research was undertaken in five stages: Stage 1 \u2013 City Selection and Description The selection of the two cities was based on a range of criteria, including their exposure to multiple climate change impacts, the population living in informal settlements, the access and availability of information relating to their vulnerability to climate changes, and the access to local knowledge of the policy and city situation. The first stage of the research developed the criteria for city selection and then investigated these criteria across potential cities. The intention was to then narrow the focus of the research to particular research groups. However, due to the limited number of field-based studies undertaken in mega-cities to date, the study was forced to limit the research groups to those chosen in the few available studies. Research assistants were engaged in Australia, India and Indonesia to assist with this investigation. Stage 2 \u2013 Urbanisation, Climate Risk and Vulnerability This stage of the research focused on gathering and synthesising information relating to urbanisation, its benefits and negative aspects, and some of the perceived causes of the negative aspects. It then went on to review the literature about how cities were contributing to climate change, and importantly, how they could potentially abate their greenhouse gas emissions. It specifically tried to identify the links between the causes of the negative aspects of urbanisation and how these may exacerbate climate change, thereby identifying common areas of future effort to improve development outcomes, and reduce global climate change impact. As the IPCC have now stated that climate change is inevitable,13 the climate risk and vulnerability research gathered information relating to the impacts of climate change in Asia more broadly, but then narrowed its focus to the two countries, and the two cities in question. In particular, the impacts were framed in human development terms; that is, in what way will the anticipated climate change impacts affect health, income generation and other key determinants of human development. 13 (IPCC 2007) 13 Stage 3 \u2013 Policy Review As the adaptive capacity and sensitivity of cities to climate change", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e5fa0f08-5f01-4774-a22d-cdcd65ad0ae6": {"__data__": {"id_": "e5fa0f08-5f01-4774-a22d-cdcd65ad0ae6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8fcaa7531a42a9165ebaececbe36b0db8b0deb2f3e7c4a54d44f67ebfcda177d"}}, "hash": "8fcaa7531a42a9165ebaececbe36b0db8b0deb2f3e7c4a54d44f67ebfcda177d", "text": "is greatly influenced by policies at the national, regional and local levels, the research gathered and analysed the policies most relevant for impacting on the vulnerability of the chosen two cities. These policies covered a range of infrastructure, housing, energy and transport considerations, as well as poverty reduction and specific climate change related policies. The analysis investigated whether the policy included climate change considerations, specifically if it addressed climate adaptation or mitigation issues or both. It then considered what impact the policy would have on the city\u2019s exposure, sensitivity or adaptive capacity to a range of relevant climate impacts. Stage 4 \u2013 Review of Field-Based Studies Based on collected field-based studies, this stage investigated the types of climate change related impacts urban communities are currently experiencing, the challenges experienced by the poor and vulnerable communities, and the factors responsible for aggravating vulnerability. Additionally, it investigated what coping strategies were in place at the local level, and identified both planned and unplanned adaptation experiences and opportunities to further support these. Stage 5 \u2013 Recommendations This stage focused on recommendations for potential policy and strategy interventions that can help promote greater resilience, and low emissions development for vulnerable groups. There is a particular focus on the role of cities to reduce vulnerability, promote resilience and low carbon futures. 2.1 Limitations of this Research As with all studies, there are limitations to this research. The two most pressing limitations were 1) the access to available, relevant field studies and 2) the breadth of focus on mitigation and adaptation restricted the depth of the study into either particular area. Firstly, extensive research (in the time permitted), revealed that local-level field based studies on the impacts and vulnerability to climate change are being undertaken in secondary cities, but not as yet in mega-cities. Most studies relate to a particular event or impact, rather than research to glean an understanding of local perceptions and challenges to climate change more generally. This meant that the studies selected for the field-based review were narrow in focus, and did not capture the breadth of possible climate change impacts. Additionally, the researchers were restricted to working in English, Hindi or Bahasa Indonesia, so smaller studies undertaken and reported in other languages were not accessible. Secondly, the scope of this study aimed to cover both mitigation and adaptation issues, which is very relevant and reasonable. However, the constraints on time and size of the report meant that neither issue could be explored in great depth, so for that reason it is quite a high-level synthesis report. 3. URBANISATION AND IMPACT ON CLIMATE CHANGE The relationship between urbanisation and climate change is a complex one. Increasing urbanisation is frequently cited as a contributor to increased greenhouse gas emissions, although some challenge this causal assumption. As cities continue to concentrate the world\u2019s economic and social systems, they will exhibit increased vulnerability to the impacts of a changing climate, but perhaps also be the centres of action and innovation to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in the future. As many of the aspects of increased urbanisation play a role in either exacerbating or reducing the impacts of climate change, it is important to understand these aspects. Additionally, 14 some of the drivers for urbanisation are themselves influenced by climate change (such as rural to urban migration due to drought, salinity, precipitation change and so forth), creating a reinforcing feedback relationship. 3.1 Urbanisation \u2013 The Positives and the Negatives Globally, urban populations are growing, with more than half the world\u2019s population now living in cities.14 The State of the Worlds\u2019 Cities Report 2010/11 notes that by 2050, \u201curban dwellers will likely account for 86% of the population in the more developed countries, and 67% in less developed regions\u201d.15 In previous decades, the rate of global population growth of both rural and urban communities was comparable, however, in the next 30 years, it is estimated that most of the world\u2019s population growth will actually occur in cities,16 with a significant proportion of this urban growth occurring in developing countries.17 Some of this growth is contributing to the emergence of urban agglomerations such as mega-regions, urban corridors and mega-cities, that is, cities that have in excess of 10 million people.18 (Refer Appendix 1) This phenomenon is particularly evident in Asia, where by 2050, urban populations are expected to reach 64.6 per cent, from a current urbanisation proportion of 42.2 per cent.19 This region is also where the growth in mega-cities will be most apparent, with mega-cities already existing, and continuing to emerge in India, China, Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines.

Cities can provide positive social and economic benefits for city inhabitants, the cities themselves and for their countries. There is an undeniable link between a country\u2019s GDP growth and its degree of urbanisation, with many cities representing significant contributions to their country\u2019s GDP. In several OECD countries, one single metropolitan area accounts for between 33% and 50% of the nation\u2019s total GDP, for example Auckland, Tokyo or Brussels.21 There is a natural link between the economic development of the country, and the relative wealth and health of its\u2019 citizens.22 On the individual economic level, studies consistently show that the incidence of urban poverty is less than that of rural poverty for most countries23. At the city level, Jeb Brugmann notes that cities and enterprises benefit through economies of density, scale, association and extension24. This includes the proximity of multiple buyers and sellers, the reduction in transaction costs and the knowledge and finance availability that comes with proximity. As well as economic centres, cities are frequently centres of culture, creativity and learning, aided by the same principles of proximity and concentration of resources and exchange. Aggregated statistics and \u201caverages\u201d, however, do not reveal the disparity within cities, and the negative effects of urbanisation. Many urban centres in developing countries, have a proportion of 14 (UN Dept of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division 2009) 15 (UN-HABITAT 2008, 5) 16 (UN-HABITAT 2008, 5) 17 (Sanchez-Rodriquez, et al. 2005, 10), (UN Dept of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division 2009) 18 (Sanchez-Rodriquez, et al. 2005, 10), (OECD, 2010, 39) 19 (UN Dept of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division 2009) 20 (UN-HABITAT 2010) 21 (OECD 2010) 22 (UN-HABITAT 2008) 23 (UN-HABITAT 2008) 24 (Brugmann 2009) 15 their population living in slums, or informal settlements,25 and there is vast and growing income inequality, which leads to huge disparity in standards of health and wellbeing. As cities grow, there are growing environmental and social pressures within the urban boundary, in the hinterland that supports it, and globally. Some of these environmental pressures include pressure on resources such as land and water. These pressures lead to inequality of ownership and access, and the related health impacts of poor access to good quality water and sanitation. Social conflicts can arise over access to land and water within the urban boundary, and the hinterland (or peri-urban) areas. Pressure is placed on agricultural food systems, as more land is removed from agricultural production, and engulfed by the expanding urban area. Biodiversity is invariably affected as more habitat is removed to make way for displaced agriculture, and for urban growth. There is also the pressing concern of urban waste and pollution, from solid waste and wastewater, through to particulate air pollution and greenhouse gas pollution. This has a direct impact on the environmental condition, and the health and wellbeing of city dwellers, those in surrounding areas, and in the case of greenhouse gas pollution, globally. There is a large range of inter-related causes of these negative consequences of urbanisation, particularly in developing countries. Key causes that have been identified include: \u2022 Short-term municipal planning: The existence of short-term planning, including short- term development/land-use/spatial planning is evident, where the needs of a rapidly growing city in 10, 20 or 50 years are not adequately built into planning decisions. Planning decisions extend past the tenure of elected officials, and also the employment life of staff. Urban systems such as transport, water and sanitation are long-lived infrastructure systems, and require consideration of capacities and needs at least 50 years into the future. Not only does the planning need to be long-term, but to be integrated across different disciplines, which is a challenge for both developed and developing country cities. \u2022 Lack of capacity: Elected public officials and staff lack the knowledge, skill and required organisational systems and resources to undertake and effectively implement long term planning. Additionally, there is a lack of capacity of citizens to actively engage with long- term considerations, and be involved in planning.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5a3a7ee3-0470-44a8-a2bb-26acdb0fabee": {"__data__": {"id_": "5a3a7ee3-0470-44a8-a2bb-26acdb0fabee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0c37175a0e43f961c5b63dd417cdb06c8f81181343c8c81649df723d37d16b3b"}, "2": {"node_id": "77616b9b-6685-4a7b-83ee-20399bc1ae41", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2b14238bd40ead820ad15dd7d63a6f55e50a399ffd80eabf8c1e9562d5be8a4c"}}, "hash": "60c13a880670ce8bf9618c5308f8ac834390575134d4f31de966e02b94161945", "text": "\u2022 Poor governance: In many developing countries, there is clear evidence of poor governance, whereby decisions are made in a non-accountable, non-transparent and non- participatory manner, and can be seen to serve vested interests.

However, the local government must house a growing population, and requires funds for infrastructure development.27 These pressures, combined with short-term planning, lack of capacity and poor governance, lead to expanding urban sprawl in many developing cities. \u2022 Decentralisation and Devolution of Responsibility: Globally, there is evidence of increasing responsibility being delegated to local authorities; to be responsible for the local environment, infrastructure, economic and social wellbeing of its citizens. This may be a formal process of decentralisation, as is occurring in India and Indonesia, or a less formal 25 (UN-HABITAT 2008), UN-HABITAT defines a slum as a settlement in an urban area in which more than half of the inhabitants live in inadequate housing and lack basic services. Refer to the Glossary of this paper for an extended definition. 26 (Tyler, et al. 2010) 27 (Moench 2011) 16 devolving of responsibility. However, this increased responsibility is rarely matched with increased resources and funding to effectively carry out these growing responsibilities.28 This links very closely with the lack of capacity and poor governance, as the staff in local governments do not have the experience and capacity to take on the new areas of responsibility, and to engage effectively with their citizens on key long-term planning issues. 3.2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Cities The above-listed urbanisation benefits, negative aspects and their causes have a bearing on the contribution cities make to climate change, and how significantly they and their citizens are likely to be impacted by the effects of climate change. Satterthwaite29 notes it is not urbanisation per se, and the numbers of people in cities that automatically lead to greenhouse gas pollution and climate change, it is more a relationship with how these urban dwellers produce and consume goods and services. The International Energy Agency (IEA) concurs, noting it is the growing comparative wealth of inhabitants in Asian cities such as those in China, as well as access to energy services, contributing to above national average energy consumption.30 Globally, the IEA estimates that cities will account for more than 73% of the world\u2019s energy use by 2030.31 However, as there is no globally regulated method and framework for collecting and analysing greenhouse gas emission data from cities, this estimate is by no means precise.32 In growing urban areas, greenhouse gas emissions growth (using traditional point of production accounting methods) stems primarily from33: \u2022 Energy Supply: Energy is generally provided to cities by burning fossil fuels (such as brown coal), for electricity generation, heating, cooling, cooking, transportation and industrial production. This often occurs outside the municipal boundary (in large centralised electricity plants), but also at the distributed local level, through burning kerosene and diesel. As urbanisation increases, particularly in developing countries (where rural-to-urban migration is a key feature), a shift is evident from burning biomass and waste for energy production, to the more greenhouse intensive fossil fuel sources.34 The greenhouse intensity of the energy supply is related to the energy system supplying energy to the city, and the energy supply mix, that is, the percentage supplied by fossil fuels compared with less greenhouse gas intensive sources such as nuclear power, hydro power, solar or wind power. \u2022 Transport: Public and private transport systems grow as the city itself grows, and these are generally fuelled by fossil fuels. The proportion of journeys made by public transport, versus private motorised vehicle is a key determinant in emissions from this sector. 28 (Nurhadi 2009) 29 (Satterthwaite 2009) 30 (IEA 2008) 31 (IEA 2008, 12) 32 ICLEI \u2013 Local Governments for Sustainability developed a framework to guide the calculation of greenhouse gas inventories for cities \u2013 International Local Government GHG Emissions Analysis Protocol, www.iclei.org; UNEP, UN-HABITAT and The World Bank have developed the International Standard for Determining Greenhouse Gas Emissions for Cities. www.citiesalliance.org 33 (Satterthwaite 2009), (ICLEI 2009) 34 (OECD 2010) 17 While increasing urban density can reduce distances travelled, (as well as impacting mode of travel) and therefore reduce total transport emissions, urban sprawl (where the city boundary continues to expand rapidly outward, generally in a poorly planned manner) can exponentially increase this sector of emissions growth.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "78bb283c-046a-4d52-9ae0-0e46bb08f6df": {"__data__": {"id_": "78bb283c-046a-4d52-9ae0-0e46bb08f6df", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f1ed9bbb22759eb367d6e5a3abd7d044d47d90d079e96b5e82af83cc497018dd"}, "2": {"node_id": "29e80224-3797-4ef6-a1e1-c11123396da7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "94d46d717461cff70b7bcfe45e2b12d50d370d0643c1c2fbd94d90c93236eb3c"}}, "hash": "991a0df8398b9cd92b3314822042ffc2cdccb7eb4ec231886094b3de086602e7", "text": "A reliance on road transport to reach urban sprawl areas increases the need for private motorised vehicles, further increasing greenhouse gas emissions.

Emissions are therefore a factor of the greenhouse intensity of the power supply, the energy efficiency of the appliances and systems used, and of the behaviour of building occupants. The increasing wealth of some city inhabitants, and better access to energy services, leads to higher appliance ownership, and proportionately higher energy use36. In domestic buildings, such things which become commonplace as wealth increases include multiple flat-screen TV\u2019s in each household, computers, mobile phones, game consoles, electronic kitchen appliances, electronic toys and so on. Additionally, there is a trend towards smaller households in urban areas37, leading to higher per capita emissions to deliver the same services. \u2022 Waste and Wastewater: The increasing consumption of goods, currently leads to growing waste, and a growing population leads to increased wastewater. It was noted that the generation of waste over-rides population growth in some Indian cities.38 Emissions from this sector are related to not only the increasing volume of waste, but how the waste is managed. The types of systems to treat/dispose of waste and wastewater directly impact a city\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions profile. Paradoxically, it is the more affluent cities that have the resources to invest in better waste management systems. This is a particular area of interest for municipal governments in developing countries, due to the multiple benefits of effective waste management. \u2022 Industry: Growing levels of production and manufacturing of goods, and the greenhouse gas intensity of these industries, contributes to urban greenhouse gas emissions. Even though these goods may not be consumed in the local urban area, their physical production location is often in the economic hub of a city.39 More developed countries are moving to tertiary industries, such as finance, entertainment and tourism, with the result that developing countries are carrying the burden of the manufacturing industries greenhouse emissions. How cities address each of the above sectors as they grow directly impacts their greenhouse emissions profile. Many of these areas can be tackled independently of regional or national 35 (UN-HABITAT 2011) 36 (IEA 2008, Ch.8) 37 (UN-HABITAT 2011) 38 (Indian Network for Climate Change Assessment 2010) 39 (ICLEI 2007), (Satterthwaite 2009) 18 government policy, making cities very important in the climate change mitigation arena. Through concentrated and aggregated resources and proximity to target groups, cities have the potential to significantly mitigate their greenhouse gas emissions. This can be done through activating many of the levers at hand for city governments, such as planning, regulation, purchasing power, network facilitation, education and their civic leadership role. Box 1: Cities Connected to International Negotiations Since the early 1990\u2019s, Cities have been actively connected to global climate change negotiations through involvement in such organisations as ICLEI \u2013 Local Governments for Sustainability. ICLEI represents local governments at the United Nations (UN) Commission on Sustainable Development, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and co-operates with the UN Environment Programme and UN-HABITAT. ICLEI actively advocates for local government to be formally recognised for the role they can play in mitigating climate change, and for financial mechanisms to be open to cities to participate in their own right. Over 1200 local governments are members of ICLEI worldwide. Source: www.iclei.org The area of focus needs to be determined on a city-by-city basis. To determine the area of focus, cities must undertake a process of developing a robust baseline greenhouse gas inventory, establishing their emissions profile, and putting in place rigorous monitoring and reporting systems to assess the results of any initiatives. Cities engaged in programs such as ICLEI\u2019s Cities for Climate Protection program, or the Clinton Initiative\u2019 C40 program have been systematically tackling greenhouse gas mitigation for many years (see Box 1). However, participants in these programs attest that city energy data is difficult to find and often incomplete. The area of energy supply is one that is strongly related to national level policy levers. National policies that put a price on carbon, and favour alternative energy production provide a framework for cities to plan for renewable energy to supply their energy needs as they grow instead of fossil fuel use. This significantly alters the greenhouse gas emission profile for the city. Cities in China, for example, need to respond directly to the central government\u2019s targets relating to reduced energy intensity, thus facilitating the penetration of clean energy technologies. Also, the small town of Hepburn Shire in Australia, for example, has worked with its community to develop a local wind farm to supply a percentage of the city\u2019s energy needs.40 In this instance, the city", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "58722627-6a16-4a03-ba75-1127716dac58": {"__data__": {"id_": "58722627-6a16-4a03-ba75-1127716dac58", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d3717968627ea310760b997058f56ad6d7e065c3e651d48cfb46d89cd5859df4"}}, "hash": "d3717968627ea310760b997058f56ad6d7e065c3e651d48cfb46d89cd5859df4", "text": "is activating its civic leadership role in partnering with the community on a significant investment project. The sector of industrial emissions is one that is not under the direct control of city government\u2019s, but can be influenced by regulation and other activities. As cities rapidly expand and develop, particularly in developing countries, many aim to actively seek out and attract more businesses to their area, to propel future employment growth and ongoing development. Strategically planning to attract lower energy intensity industries like service industries, or other \u201cgreen industries\u201d, rather than high-intensity manufacturing industries will impact the industrial emissions output for a city. Mumbai in India for example, has transitioned itself from a significant textile manufacturing centre, to a predominantly serviced-based city,41 and cities in China are also actively facilitating structural change towards an enlarged tertiary sector.42 40 (Hepburn Wind 2011) 41 (Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai 2009) 42 (IEA 2008) 19 One of the major areas that impacts greenhouse gas emissions in cities is transport \u2013 particularly transport from private vehicles. It has been shown that the high population density of a city can positively impact greenhouse emissions through more people choosing public transport, or low energy modes of transport rather than private cars.43 To achieve effective transport emissions reductions, cities can plan to develop integrated transport systems that allow for significant public transport, walking and cycling use over private car use. Regulatory powers can be employed to encourage sustainable behaviour, such as London\u2019s Congestion tax to reduce car use in central London, and a greater reliance on walking and public transport. Cities are potentially able to impact the emissions from buildings in their municipality, by activating their regulatory powers and mandating minimum energy efficiency standards for new buildings as part of building codes and standards. As a leadership function, they can ensure, as a minimum, that all municipal buildings are demonstrating high levels of energy efficiency; this is a common practice for city governments globally. The City of Port Phillip in Australia for example is undertaking an extensive building retrofit program, over three years, that aims to ensure all government buildings demonstrate high energy efficiency features.44 An innovative example of where large scale, low-energy housing is being provided includes Dongtan Eco-City in China, near Shanghai. In Thailand, low environmental impact housing is being combined with low cost by providing homes through the re-use of shipping containers.45 A final area of influence and control for cities is that of waste. Effective waste separation and treatment processes can enable the reduction of highly potent greenhouse gasses such as methane, and significantly reduce a city\u2019s emissions. Proactive cities are going one step further, and capturing the methane gas produced by waste landfill sites and converting this to energy to power their municipalities, thus helping to address their energy supply mix, while also reducing their emissions. An alternative greenhouse accounting method for cities has been proposed, which is based on consumption of goods and services in the city, rather than point of source emissions.46 This is to correctly reflect the differing impact of wealthy city consumption patterns, compared with those in developing countries. With this method, there is a more direct correlation between the wealth of cities and the growth in their greenhouse gas emissions than population growth and greenhouse gas emission growth.47 For example, the greenhouse gas emissions per capita for people in wealthy developed countries of Europe, North America and Australasia are far in excess of the urban per-capita emissions of Asian cities. Targeting the way a city and its people consume goods and services provides another possible leverage point for reducing greenhouse emissions. To be undertaken effectively and efficiently, the climate change mitigation areas outlined above require long-term planning, municipal staff capacity and capacity of local private sector experts, strong governance, clear prioritisation of emissions reduction as an important area of activity, and financial and other resources to implement initiatives. However, as was outlined previously, the causes of many of the negative impacts of urbanisation in general also suggest that this will be a significant challenge for cities in developing countries. 43 (OECD 2010) 44 (City of Port Phillip 2010) 45 (SWITCH-Asia Network Facility, Burcu and Patrick 2009) 46 (Satterthwaite 2009) 47 (Satterthwaite 2009, 51) 20 Although the above review suggests general areas that cities may be able to target and influence, it needs to be recognised that as with many aggregated statistics, inequality is hidden in general, aggregated greenhouse gas profiles for cities.

It is therefore the patterns of consumption of its wealthier citizens that cities also need to target and influence, as well as improving city systems under the municipality\u2019s control, if cities are to meaningfully contribute to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. 4. THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON CITIES Irrespective of what an individual city\u2019s contribution may be to climate change, most urban areas, particularly those in developing countries, will be impacted by a changing climate. The impacts felt by cities will directly or indirectly relate to variations in climatic conditions such as temperature change, precipitation change, frequency and intensity of severe storm events, and sea level rise. 4.1 Vulnerability, Exposure, Sensitivity and Adaptive Capacity The field of climate change adaptation is a multi-disciplinary field drawing on fields of expertise such as social sciences, geography, climate science, hydrology, engineering, development and disaster risk reduction specialties, to name a few. Various frameworks have been proposed to conceptualise and assist to address vulnerability and urban resilience, each with a slightly different emphasis and interpretation of key components. One framework which has been proposed to assess a city\u2019s vulnerability to climate change impacts is one that considers the city\u2019s exposure to climatic change, its sensitivity to (or the degree to which it is affected by) that climatic change and its associated impacts, and the level of adaptive capacity it has built into its systems and people to prepare for, mitigate and cope with the impacts of the climatic change. This may be represented by the formula: Vulnerability = f (Sensitivity * Exposure * 1/Adaptive Capacity)49 This is not a static framework, as vulnerability varies over space and time, depending on the range of variables and inputs. Therefore, a city\u2019s vulnerability is also not static. Considering this framework, the geographic location of many cities predisposes them to significant exposure to a range of climate change impacts. A high proportion of cities, particularly mega-cities, are located along coastlines, near river floodplains or deltas,50 which according to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report is likely to increase their exposure to a range of risks, including coastal erosion, sea level rise and more frequent intense storm activity. Climate observations have established that there has been an increase in intensity of tropical cyclones, and that global average sea level has risen.51 IPCC projections suggest tropical cyclones will become more intense, and sea-levels will continue to rise in the coming decades.52 As cities develop and alter the natural workings of river ways and coastlines \u2013 through removal of coral reefs, 48 (Satterthwaite 2009) 49 (IPCC 2001, 89) This is the framework first presented by the IPCC in 2001, in Section 1.4.1 of WG2, TAR, then refined further by several authors. 50 (IPCC 2007a), (OECD 2010) 51 (IPCC 2007a) 52 (IPCC 2007a) 21 mangroves, alteration of coastlines and river banks, and decreasing areas of permeable surfaces, the exposure to these risks is exacerbated. The nature of cities is that they concentrate people and systems, making them more sensitive to any given impact, that is, they are likely to be impacted to a higher degree. The high density of the built environment and infrastructure in cities makes it likely to be impacted to a higher degree by extreme events such as storms, flooding and heat waves. Additionally, the large number of people concentrated in cities means that for any given impact, a higher number of individuals are likely to be affected than for less populous areas. In mega-cities in particular, where economic resources are highly concentrated, the disruption of \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d can have a significant financial impact not only on the city, but on the country more broadly. Cities\u2019 adaptive capacity relates to their knowledge, resources and ability to mitigate potential damages, take advantage of opportunities or cope with climate change challenges. Knowledge in this case relates to knowledge and understanding of city officials, the private sector, NGOs and citizens. It is the knowledge and understanding of these groups of what strategies to pre- emptively put in place to cope with climate change impacts, and what knowledge is drawn upon during extreme events or even during daily planning and activities. Resources relates to financial resources, appropriately skilled labour and materials. While ability can relate to the broad political system that either allows or inhibits action, the existing geography, infrastructure and culture of the city can also either allow or", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "361844dc-d995-4cf6-b248-c21b4ba229c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "361844dc-d995-4cf6-b248-c21b4ba229c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bf5562aed615780b486563605ca8df0dd4d1190a37efa3db7496a3d02592fcc4"}}, "hash": "bf5562aed615780b486563605ca8df0dd4d1190a37efa3db7496a3d02592fcc4", "text": "inhibit action. By functioning through a network of inter-related, interdependent systems, such as transport, communication, power, water and sanitation systems, cities can potentially be reducing their adaptive capacity to climate risk. If there is a failure in one system then there is the risk of subsequent failures in related systems. For example, a failure in the power system may lead to interruptions in transport, communications and water pumping. For interruptions/failure to be avoided, there needs to be the knowledge, resources and ability to design and build systems with the adaptive capacity to resort to \u201cback-up\u201d support systems, so they can work independently, or with alternative dependence if required. City infrastructure, which provides the basic services that allow people to earn an income and maintain health, including the drainage infrastructure, road and transport infrastructure, communications and building infrastructure is designed generally with certain climate patterns in mind (often based on past weather experience). Planning for the development and building of infrastructure to meet uncertain future climate needs requires long-term planning, and the capacity to integrate future climate uncertainty into planning decisions. Much of the existing infrastructure has not been built with future climate uncertainty in mind, and as climate adaptation planning is a relatively new field, infrastructure planning decisions are being made now without a solid consideration of future climate variability. Additionally, to upgrade or adapt existing infrastructure is costly, and as the benefits of this expense are not immediately perceived, then competing priorities for finance and resourcing can easily take precedence. In developing countries in particular, where urbanised areas are challenged by poor long-term planning, a lack of capacity and limited resources, this situation is compounded. Poorly informed design decisions now are building in future potential vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. For most cities around the globe, poor populations of men and women (see Box 2) within cities are considered to be the most vulnerable.53 This is in part due to a lack of resources and 53 (IPCC 2007a), (OECD 2010) 22 capacity to respond to climate changes (whether they be immediate disasters, or more gradual change), and in part due to their amplified exposure and sensitivity to the impacts. Box 2: Gender and Climate Change in Urban Areas Globally, very few studies have been conducted to disaggregate the contribution made to climate change based on gender, or the differentiated impacts from climate change based on gender. Some of the broader considerations include: Mitigation Energy Use: Women have a higher responsibility for unpaid \u201chome\u201d care activities, including cooking, cleaning and washing. They are more directly responsible for energy use in the home, and therefore, can be more effectively targeted to reduce home-based energy emissions, through choice of appliances and behaviour change. Mobility: With a lower participation rate in the formal economy, women\u2019s travel needs are less oriented to radial commuting in cities than men\u2019s. They may be making more frequent, local trips, which can be targeted in mobility planning to be less energy intensive. Waste: In developed countries, it may be the \u201cmen who take out the garbage\u201d, but women are still more responsible for household purchasing and consumption. Their choice of goods, and the levels of packaging influences waste volumes. Adaptation The capacity to respond to climate change impacts is a factor of knowledge (education) and resources to avoid/cope with impacts. In developing country cities, women still have lower literacy and education levels, and are employed in the lower wage informal sector, so have less resources to draw on. Policies and strategies need to directly target the gender dimensions of poverty to assist with adaptation strategies. Source: \u201cGender, Cities and Climate Change\u201d, Gotelind Alber, 2010 Poor settlements, whether they are informal or formal, have a higher exposure to many climate change impacts, as they are often located on lower level land that is already more prone to flooding, and is likely to be at higher risk from either sea level rise or storm events, such as the Dharavi slums in Mumbai,54 or the newer slum areas along the canals of Kolkata. The urban poor do not have the luxury of choice for where they site their homes, so are more vulnerable than those who theoretically could choose to live in a less exposed part of the city. The housing materials of the poor in cities are often less robust, therefore they are less likely to withstand extreme weather events and associated impacts. This increases the sensitivity of the poor, as the level of impact is proportionately higher than for those in more robust houses that may only receive a small amount of damage during extreme", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "adcf9c93-dff6-4e53-8199-251d59b72c93": {"__data__": {"id_": "adcf9c93-dff6-4e53-8199-251d59b72c93", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6b2906dfb3d7e43f439f44592d4f98695364230a0d994eee77bc8f42198abb2c"}}, "hash": "6b2906dfb3d7e43f439f44592d4f98695364230a0d994eee77bc8f42198abb2c", "text": "events. The provision of services, particularly to informal settlements, such as electricity/power, sanitation and fresh water are frequently inadequate compared with wealthier populations in the same cities. These services contribute to the adaptive capacity and level of sensitivity of the poor areas. The working poor in many cities are more likely to be engaged in activities that are outside, predominantly unprotected from the weather, which greatly increases their exposure to temperature changes, and such events as heat waves. For example, street vendors and rickshaw drivers in cities such as Mumbai, Bangkok and Phnom Penh must continue to work unprotected during extreme temperature days, in order to earn their livelihood. Alternatively, for some workers, their workplace is situated close to their home, and is itself severely impacted by any extreme event, for example, local markets or informal factories. Should these workplaces be closed for any period of time, then this directly affects the income and livelihood of the poor. If their workplace is on the other side of the city, they must rely on transport that may be impacted 54 (de Sherbinin, Schiller and Pulsipher 2009), (OECD 2010) 23 by extreme climate events \u2013 again, potentially threatening their income and livelihood. Thus for a variety of situations, the poor are more sensitive to potential climate change impacts, as any change may affect their income and livelihood. 4.2 Inter-related Impacts Changes in particular physical climate stimuli such as precipitation change, temperature change, storm intensity and frequency and sea level rise have been observed to different degrees around the world, and the trend in these changes is expected to continue.55 Cities\u2019 exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity to these stimuli is also varied, but there are some consistent underlying vulnerabilities. The interconnected range of impacts from climate stimuli affects natural systems, built infrastructure systems, socio-economic systems within cities, and the support systems such as agricultural systems outside cities. Together, these affect the development, health and wellbeing of cities and their inhabitants. Exposure to precipitation changes varies across the globe. Some areas, such as northern Europe and parts of northern and central Asia have observed increased precipitation in recent decades, and are likely to receive further increased precipitation in coming decades, while parts of Africa and southern Asia are likely to see a decrease in total precipitation.56 The impact of altered precipitation regimes on cities may result in an alteration in fresh water availability, indirectly impacting the functioning of sanitation systems and the health of city populations. Precipitation levels impact the agricultural areas providing food to cities, therefore an alteration in precipitation will indirectly affect city dwellers through its impact on the local food system, and potentially higher levels of rural-urban migration. Figure 1 illustrates a small portion of the inter-related impacts that may flow from decreased precipitation. Figure 1: Decreased Precipitation \u2013 inter-related impacts Source: Author, 2011 55 (IPCC 2007a) 56 (IPCC 2007a) 24 Through intensive storm activity, sea level rise or precipitation change, cities are increasingly vulnerable to flooding.57 As well as their increased exposure to these events, many city infrastructure and drainage systems do not have the capacity to adapt to the altered demands placed on them. They are generally long-lived, and many systems are already decades old. Particularly in developing countries, they may be poorly maintained, and are not designed to cope with the increased demands \u2013 not only from the climatic changes but also from the increased population needs they must service. Recent floods in Mumbai (2005), Jakarta (2007) and (the developed country) Brisbane (2010-11) have demonstrated this. The inability of water transport systems in particular to operate effectively, can lead to contamination of water storage and potable water systems by run-off, sewage and debris. This leads to the spread of pathogens, directly impacting the health of city-dwellers. Observed changes in temperature indicate the number of hot days and hot nights has increased, and future climate modelling suggests that this trend is likely to continue in the future, and that the frequency of heat waves will increase.58 Cities will be particularly impacted by increasing temperature, as they tend to have higher air and surface temperatures than rural areas. This is known as the urban heat island effect.59 This is caused by a variety of things, including the increased area of roadways, buildings and concrete surfaces that absorb sunlight and re-radiate heat, decreased vegetation cover which provides shade and the concentrated operation of heat- generating equipment such as air conditioners, cars and other mechanised transport. Measurements suggest that urban areas can be between 3.5 - 4\uf007C warmer than surrounding rural areas.

CLIMATE CHANGE IN URBAN ASIA Urban Asia is growing more rapidly than other parts of the world63, so it is appropriate to consider what its likely impact will be on climate change, and conversely, what the impacts of climate change are likely to be on urban Asia. 5.1 Production and Consumption in Asian Cities: Its Impact on Climate Change Dhakal notes the difficulty in comparing greenhouse emissions of cities, due to different accounting methods, the scope of greenhouse gases accounted for, emission source and even urban definition.64 From a greenhouse accounting perspective, using point of source accounting methods (currently the main greenhouse gas accounting method, as it aligns with international protocols), the sectors contributing to greenhouse gas emissions growth in Asian cities are: Energy supply, Transport, Buildings, Industry and Waste. An alternative approach to greenhouse emissions calculations for cities is the consumption approach, which relates a product\u2019s emissions to where it is consumed, rather than where it is produced. The following section discusses point of source emissions for Asian cities, however, also notes the disparity within cities, relating to consumption patterns of the wealthy, compared with those of the poor. The insights of both approaches can help policy makers target appropriate greenhouse gas reduction strategies, within their sphere of influence and control. Energy Energy consumption in Asia has grown over recent decades, closely mirroring its economic development.

In some cities, therefore, the poor are forced to pay high prices for relatively poor kerosene based lighting, or low quality biomass cooking fuels.67 In an attempt to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of their energy supply, some Asian cities are turning to alternative energy sources (see Box 3). China, for example, had a 20% energy-intensity reduction target by 2010 in its 11th Five-Year Plan. This target was delegated to provincial level (and consequently city level in some cases) to meet specific targets. To help meet the target, cities encouraged the greater penetration of lower emission natural gas to replace the use of coal in commercial and household sectors.68 The city of Rizhao, also in China has a focused drive on renewable energy, including electricity generation from methane gas from wastewater treatment, livestock dung and straw, solar powered street-lights, solar water heating and cooking devices.69 Box 3: A Medium-Sized City Setting the Standard Nagpur, a medium-sized city of around 2.5 million people in India\u2019s Maharashtra state is actively pursuing greenhouse gas reduction initiatives across many fronts, and is seen as a pioneer city in this space. As a member of ICLEI \u2013 Local Governments for Sustainability, Nagpur is a signatory city to the carBonn Cities Climate Registry. Through this registry, Nagpur has committed to report its GHG reduction commitments, GHG emissions inventories and climate mitigation/adaptation actions. Local Renewables Nagpur was selected as one of the original Indian model communities under the Local Renewables project of ICLEI. Actions under taken in Nagpur under the project: 1. Preparation of a city energy report 2005-06 - The collection of energy consumption data in Nagpur enabled the city to plot trends in their usage of energy. The percentages of various sectors and various fuels used in the city were identified. This identification of energy consumption in different sectors of the city helped Nagpur formulate a course of action to reduce future consumption and meet targets. 2. Development of a Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency policy document for Nagpur city. This policy was followed by the formation of a five-year action plan, which outlined ways in which Nagpur could achieve the targets set out in the city level RE-EE policy within the defined time span of five years. 3. In addition to this general policy, Nagpur also formulated a specific policy mandating the use of solar water heaters in residential and commercial construction and offering a 10% property tax rebate as an incentive for building owners to install solar water heaters. This amendment to Nagpur\u2019s byelaws became operational in January 2008. 4. Establishment of a Nagpur Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Resource Center (REEERC) 5. Short term projects in Nagpur - Energy audit of the NMC building complex in 2007, Solar Water Heater in a public hospital in Nagpur in 2007, Solar PV in the Nagpur Resource Center in 2008, Solar powered lights in the NMC premises in 2008, EE lighting in an NMC girls\u2019 school in 2010, and awareness raising activities. Apart from this many long term projects have also been undertaken.

Nagpur is one of the first cities chosen to be a Solar City to establish and implement plans for energy saving, energy efficiency and using renewable energy. Nagpur was selected by the Government of India in 2009 in the initial stages of the Solar Cities program to be developed as a \u2018Model Solar City\u2019, where the recommendations in the master plan will be implemented in order to serve as a best practice example for other cities to emulate. The target to be achieved under this project is 10% reduction in conventional energy consumption through adoption of renewable energy and energy efficiency measures.

Some cities in Asia have well functioning bus, skytrain and underground systems, such as Bangkok\u2019s skytrain and Hong Kong\u2019s MTR, with adequate capacity. Many Asian cities, however, rely on older bus services for public transport, that don\u2019t meet the capacity needs of the growing population. These are often poorly maintained, older-style diesel buses that contribute significantly to both greenhouse gas emissions, and urban air pollution. The area of transport emissions is one where there is an obvious disparity between the emissions generated by the poor, and those generated by the wealthy within a city. The growing middle classes in Asian cities are opting for privatised road transport, adding significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, and congestion troubles in cities (that interrupt the functioning of public bus systems). Access to well functioning rail and modern rapid bus transit systems is often too expensive for the poor, and even the cost of a commute on an older style bus system to and from work across the city substantially eats into the daily income earned. Municipal governments in Asian cities to date have not placed a high priority on pedestrian or cycle transport (the least-cost option for the poor), preferring to focus on motorised road transport instead. Those cities, such as Ho Chi Minh, that used to have high cycle use and cycle lanes (freely accessible to the poor), are slowly being transformed into motorised vehicle roads. Many paved roads in Indonesian cities don\u2019t even have footpaths.73 As congestion increases on the roads, it also takes longer for goods to be transported to destinations within and across the city. This adds further to the greenhouse gas emission profile from transport, as trucks idle in traffic, as well as adding to the cost of goods, further impacting on the poor. 70 (The World Bank 2006, 4) 71 (UN-HABITAT 2011) 72 (Lebel, et al. 2007, 64) 73 (UN-HABITAT 2010) 28 Some Asian cities are tackling their transport emissions, however. In China, cities like Chengdu and Suzhou have encouraged the use of electric bicycles. These low energy forms of transport are replacing traditional motorcycles and mopeds, with reduced greenhouse emissions and reduced tailpipe exhaust emissions. Delhi in India, identified that significant transport emissions in the city were due to old diesel buses. These have now undertaken a process of conversion to compressed natural gas, significantly reducing not only greenhouse emissions, but tailpipe polluting emissions as well. Further, they have introduced hybrid rickshaws, which are powered by solar-generated electricity, produced at a dedicated facility within Delhi74. To limit the number of cars on its roads, Singapore instituted the Certificate of Entitlement in the early 1990\u2019s. Essentially, residents must bid for the right to own a motor vehicle.75 Buildings Buildings contribute to greenhouse gas emissions in two ways: in their construction (through the embodied energy in construction materials), and through their lifetime use. It is estimated that 80% of a buildings\u2019 emissions are related to its lifetime use, which relates to its design, and the behaviour of its inhabitants. This is why the International Energy Agency believes that energy- efficiency standards in buildings could reduce greenhouse gas emissions across the globe by as much as 11%, when compared with a business as usual scenario.76 A significant construction material for commercial and residential buildings across most of Asia is concrete (it is durable, does not warp or rot in the humidity, and is relatively inexpensive), except in informal settlements, where construction materials are more varied. Concrete has high embodied energy, due to the manufacturing process. Increasing construction of high-rise commercial and residential buildings within Asian cities is anticipated to continue, and with it, the continued use of concrete. The design of domestic and commercial buildings, to suit the particular climate and environment, can influence emissions during the life of the building related to heating, cooling and lighting. For example, buildings with large numbers of uncovered windows facing the sun during the hottest part of the day add to air-conditioning requirements, and greenhouse gas emissions. The affluent in Asia\u2019s hotter cities are adding to emissions by installing air-conditioning.

As Asian city residents become more affluent, they are purchasing more energy- using equipment including TVs (multiple TV\u2019s sometimes), microwaves, mobile phones, computers, kitchen appliances, electronic games and toys and so forth. In Japan, TV ownership has increased from just over an average of 1 per household in 1970, to just under 2.5 per household in 2004.79 While in China, rural China averages 0.75 TV\u2019s per household, while the urban areas average 1.33 TV\u2019s per household.80 The emissions from the use of these products can be reduced by a) changing the energy supply mix to less greenhouse intensive sources, b) introducing efficiency labelling and standards, and 74 (UN-HABITAT 2010) 75 (The World Bank 2000) 76 (UN-HABITAT 2010, 21) 77 (UN-HABITAT 2010) 78 (Egan 1999) 79 (Harrington, Jones and Harrison 2006, 3) 80 (Harrington, Jones and Harrison 2006, 4) 29 perhaps most importantly, c) targeting consumer behaviour. In Malaysia and parts of India, central governments have placed varying forms of bans or phase-outs of incandescent light bulbs, to favour more energy-conserving LEDs and compact fluorescent lights.81 Both the Philippines and Thailand have energy-efficiency labelling and standards programs in place for domestic appliances.82 Industry Asia and its cities are currently referred to as the \u201cthe factory of the world\u201d, as they represent the world\u2019s manufacturing centre.83 As developed countries move to tertiary industries, developing countries in Asia pick up the manufacturing mantel. Direct investment from foreign multi- nationals has allowed for the relatively inexpensive expansion of production facilities in Asian cities. For example, Bangkok in Thailand has become an auto production and export hub, emerging in 2005 as the largest hub for automobile production in South East Asia.84 From a greenhouse accounting perspective, using point of source accounting methods, this manufacturing and production focus exponentially increases the greenhouse gas emissions associated with Asian cities, as many industrial processes are energy-intensive. From food processing and electronic components to footwear and textiles, cities across Asia are consuming vast amounts of energy, and emitting greenhouse gases to facilitate economic development for their regions. Cities have a role to play in regulating for environmental standards in industrial production, in attracting \u201cgreen\u201d industries, and encouraging energy efficiency and reduced energy-intensity production. The United Nations Environment Programme Geriap Project using the \u201cEnergy Efficiency Guide for Industry in Asia\u201d has worked with numerous industries across Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, China, Viet Nam and Sri Lanka to reduce their greenhouse emissions.85 Waste Greenhouse emissions from waste stem from the volume of waste, and the waste management method employed. In Asian cities, waste volumes are increasing with increasing affluence of cities\u2019 middle classes. Generally speaking however, the urban poor in Asia generate less waste. This is due to consuming fewer \u201cnon-food\u201d items, and the tendency to re-use and recycle a greater percentage of their waste. Municipal authorities are generally responsible for waste collection and management (even if this is contracted out to private entities), so can strongly influence the waste management component of greenhouse emissions. Unfortunately, the predominant disposal method for waste in Asian cities is still open dumping,86 and in cities such as Jakarta, open burning of domestic and industrial waste is common.87 Additionally, the slum areas of cities are poorly supplied with waste collection services, thus the rubbish is left to gather in canals, along roadways and in open ditches. The urban poor can however, play a significant role in waste management in many Asian cities. Extremely poor families sift through rubbish and retrieve reusable and recyclable items such as bottles and cans, and sell them to recycling facilities. In some cities, NGOs and community organisations have established profitable recycling groups, such as the Linis Grande (clean and beautiful) project in metropolitan Manila.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e22286a-3995-4908-a4dc-9f8adbd74038": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e22286a-3995-4908-a4dc-9f8adbd74038", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c1892561b4d9378a1efb91a64ff4fbe20d9b169b4712ddddc5717237e49a8f23"}, "2": {"node_id": "6b517c0b-3e93-4fc3-b7ea-10ac7f3fb760", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8a8e8bc9f009bec6bcd4039c180e5a83e61bcf90130b1dcb1a08ce11a77ee6ff"}}, "hash": "759d3ca13d5331a895f3fca60b17fdad0ff36fdf8581ea60a9e231138716076b", "text": "In Hanoi, waste pickers collected and sold 18 to 22% of 81 (Greenpeace International 2009, Malaysian National News Agency 2011) 82 (Egan 1999) 83 (UN-HABITAT 2010) 84 (UN-HABITAT 2010, 83) 85 (UNEP 2006) 86 (UN-HABITAT 2010, 20) 87 (Gawler 2011) 30 solid waste, while in Delhi, the figure is about 12 \u2013 15%.88 This significantly reduces the volume of waste to landfill, directly reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

By targeting the energy supply mix, building stock and operation, transport, production processes of industry and waste sectors, as well as targeting the behaviour of affluent consumers in cities, policy makers at both the national and local level can significantly mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from urban areas. 5.2 Impacts and Vulnerability Studies suggest90 urban Asia is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Changes in local climate have already been observed, including increased intensity of storm and cyclone activity, more frequent rainfall events, but with the number of rainy days and volume of precipitation decreasing, and longer duration of heat waves in many countries.91 For example, China has experienced a gradual warming over the past 50 years, and while the North-East and North of the country have seen a decline in precipitation in the last decade, there has been an increase in the West and along the South-East coast. Bangladesh has experienced an increase in temperature of about 1\uf007C in May and 0.5\uf007C in November for the period 1985 \u2013 1998; Sri Lanka has seen an increasing trend in February precipitation, but a decrease in June precipitation, while the Philippines has observed an increase in annual average rainfall in the last three decades.92 Asia has a significant proportion of its urban population located in coastal areas, more vulnerable to a range of climate change impacts.93 Generally, they are cities that are growing at a significant rate94 and experience many of the challenges of rapidly urbanising centres. That is, they have a large proportion of informal settlements, the provision of municipal services, such as water supply, sanitation and waste services is stretched, and their planning structures are more oriented to short-term priorities rather than long-term considerations. While the capacity of municipal staff to consider long-range planning and integrating climate change into their planning is improving, it is currently limited, they lack resources, and governance in some cities needs to be strengthened. Regional Climate Models, using IPCC generated scenarios, with a variety of additional regional data and socio-economic conditions included, have projected significant climatic changes, and the consequential impacts for many cities in Asia. While the IPCC scenarios and projections, and the methodology of downscaling global and regional climate data to cities produces very imprecise 88 (UN-HABITAT 2010, 150) 89 (Sabater 2009) 90 (WWF 2010), (Yusuf and Francisco 2009) 91 (Cruz, et al. 2007) 92 (Cruz, et al. 2007) 93 (McGranahan, Balk and Anderson 2007) 94 (UN Dept of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division 2009) 31 information, it can suggest trends to be considered, if not predictive thresholds. Coastal cities such as Dhaka in Bangladesh, Jakarta in Indonesia, Manila in the Philippines and Kolkata in India are particularly vulnerable. This is due to a combined function of their exposure to multiple impacts such as sea level rise, river flooding and tropical storms (all already experience severe flooding), the degree of impact predominantly due to the significant size of the cities, and their relatively low perceived adaptive capacity.95 For many cities in Asia, their perceived urgent climate adaptation need relates to flooding (whether this be caused by sea level rise, storm events or increased precipitation), and weather related disaster preparedness, as this is something they are already experiencing.96 However, other impacts are expected, including drought and heat waves. Each of these impacts has an interconnected range of impacts on health and livelihoods in Asian cities. The following section highlights some of the impacts identified for selected mega-cities in Asia. Flooding \u2013 from Increased Precipitation, Storm Surges and Severe Weather Events Cities participating in the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network (ACCCRN), and also the Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APN) have overwhelmingly identified flooding and associated water related issues as their priority area for adaptive action in the short term.97 For many, this is predominantly related to their recent and ongoing exposure to significant flooding events, for example, Mumbai (2005), Jakarta (2007), Can Tho (2010), Bangkok (2010), Ho Chi Minh City (annually) and Manila (2009).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "567b4d75-26d7-4d9d-ad21-b216af2205c5": {"__data__": {"id_": "567b4d75-26d7-4d9d-ad21-b216af2205c5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8c66cb50972a9347dbc5c7fb310fff9e4819ef5cbfc894d9e1bab2a7cbf6df08"}, "2": {"node_id": "03c7fa6f-b474-46e9-8e3e-9839da0be016", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "407c8c2e98659df56fba65c2b8f4aeeab3dd830a2bf3d09344fdb66b6c2475cc"}}, "hash": "0e1a3bfe3e1c277a78700492fe489eb83f8406eb3e5b505b7ab9f546dd095b35", "text": "One of the direct contributors to vulnerability to flooding is related to the cities\u2019 actual location: that is, on the coast, riverbanks and river deltas, or a combination of these.98 Cities such as", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1ffefb7e-e7a0-4b47-8ead-1b79d0cecddb": {"__data__": {"id_": "1ffefb7e-e7a0-4b47-8ead-1b79d0cecddb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "26bb649165b2c3fe1d99eaeea01c102f23642a558a017e2c6712bd1a3573aee8"}, "3": {"node_id": "cb23f708-d2a3-4fb7-864e-71e02b251e0b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "441242dad0e4ce278b037eb5a35fddf386fd1c6af058842c3893f9b39fe42fef"}}, "hash": "4382e111ca07345cf3a23f768fbd43bd9c78da85101ef78f20ef6c7824fcac9a", "text": "Kolkata (India), Dhaka (Bangladesh), Bangkok (Thailand), Ho Chi Minh City (Viet Nam) are all highly exposed to flooding due to this combination. Dhaka for example, is situated not far from the coast, a river delta, and between four flood-prone rivers99. For some, this exposure is further compounded by subsidence, with cities such as Bangkok, Shanghai, Kolkata and Manila all exhibiting extensive subsidence100 in recent decades.101 Exposure to flooding is further exacerbated by man-made alterations to the environment, such as increasing the coverage of impervious surfaces, which reduces the ability of the water to be naturally absorbed by the earth and flow to natural absorption areas and also increases the peak level and speed of water flows. Impervious surfaces also assist with funnelling water to low lying areas, further compounding flooding in these areas. Removal of mangroves and filling in and building over wetlands reduces the city\u2019s protection from tidal floods, and increases exposure. For some cities, upstream extraction of ground water is affecting the issue of subsidence as in Bangkok, and the alteration of river flows due to upstream dams also reduces silt loads, again contributing to the problem of subsidence,102 thus adding to their exposure to floods, particularly related to sea level rise. Those living in the informal settlements of Asian cities prone to flooding are particularly exposed, as these settlements are generally on marginal, lower-lying land. They have poor infrastructure to quickly drain excess water, so are therefore prone to water logging lasting for several days, even weeks following significant rain events and storms. The slum areas of Dhaka, for example, are 95 (WWF 2010) 96 (Moench 2011), (Tyler, et al. 2010) 97 (Tyler, et al. 2010), (Snidvongs 2009) 98 (McGranahan, Balk and Anderson 2007) 99 (UN-HABITAT 2008), (WWF 2010) 100 Subsidence relates to the gradual \u201csinking\u201d of cities\u2019 infrastructure, which can be caused by withdrawal of ground water (both within and outside the boundaries of the city), the weight of development, and sea level rise altering water table levels. Refer to the Glossary for further information. 101 (WWF 2010) 102 (Snidvongs 2009), (WWF 2010) 32 located on low-lying land, prone to frequent flooding, with poor infrastructure provision.103 The rubbish build-up in slum areas adds to the inability of water to drain out of flood-affected areas efficiently. Many of the mega-cities of Asia are the economic hubs of their countries, Ho Chi Minh City (accounting for 20% of Viet Nam\u2019s GDP in 2005), Bangkok (representing 44% of Thailand\u2019s GDP), Manila (32% of GDP for the Philippines in 2007) and also global economic hubs, such as Shanghai, which is rabidly becoming a global financial capital, as well as being the world\u2019s largest cargo port.104 As economic hubs, they attract and concentrate a significant population. Manila\u2019s average population density is 18,000 persons per sq km,105 while Shanghai\u2019s is 74,600 per sq km.106 These two factors combined increase a city\u2019s sensitivity to the impacts of climate change, as an interruption to the economic activity of the city has significant impacts on the country as a whole, and the number of people potentially impacted by a localised event is increased. For example, the tropical storm Bilis that impacted Shanghai in 2006 caused 3.4million people to be relocated, and damaged or destroyed over 900,000 homes.107 The incidence of flooding in Asian cities has immediate impacts on infrastructure, city systems and people, as well as delayed and indirect impacts. There can be immediate destruction of and damage to buildings, particularly those in poor or slum areas that are built of inferior materials, damage to road and rail networks, and damage to drainage, sanitation and water supply infrastructure. Energy and communications systems can also be directly impacted. Previous flash floods in Ho Chi Minh City for example, have destroyed entire sections of the city, and the Dhaka floods of 1988 inundated 85% of the city, impacting livelihoods, air travel and communications for several weeks108. The inability to access work and earn a daily income during such events is a significant impact on urban populations, especially poorer populations. For the poor, their place of work may be in close proximity to their home (local trading, or small factory worker).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cb23f708-d2a3-4fb7-864e-71e02b251e0b": {"__data__": {"id_": "cb23f708-d2a3-4fb7-864e-71e02b251e0b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "26bb649165b2c3fe1d99eaeea01c102f23642a558a017e2c6712bd1a3573aee8"}, "2": {"node_id": "1ffefb7e-e7a0-4b47-8ead-1b79d0cecddb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4382e111ca07345cf3a23f768fbd43bd9c78da85101ef78f20ef6c7824fcac9a"}}, "hash": "441242dad0e4ce278b037eb5a35fddf386fd1c6af058842c3893f9b39fe42fef", "text": "In this case, their place of employment is likely to be disrupted by the flooding inundating the slum area.

Delayed or indirect impacts can be compounded by many factors, such as the ability of the affected systems to return to normal functioning quickly, and the capacity of city officials and the population to avoid or adapt to impact areas. The health impacts on urban populations are significant, and generally unequally distributed, with poorer populations drastically more affected.109 Flooding of urban areas can compromise city water supply systems, through contamination by sewerage and debris, or by salt-water inundation if the flooding event was the result of a storm surge. This can lead to a range of water-borne diseases, increasing urban population mortality and morbidity rates following a flood event. Low and middle-income countries have reported an increase in such diseases as cholera and typhoid fever following flood 103 (UN-HABITAT 2008), (WWF 2010) 104 (WWF 2010) 105 (WWF 2010) 106 (de Sherbinin, Schiller and Pulsipher 2009) 107 (WWF 2010) 108 (Alam and Rabbani 2009) 109 (Bartlett 2008), (Kovats and Akhtar 2009) 33 events,110 and Bartlett notes that diarrhoeal illnesses caused by the contamination of piped water supplies and breakdown of sanitation systems can lead to a greater loss of life than the initial event.111 After the Mumbai flood of 2005, the prevalence of leptospirosis112 increased 8-fold113. As flood water pools and stagnates, particularly in those Asian cities where temperatures are generally high, the ongoing health impacts of vector-borne diseases such as malaria are increased114. For the poor, these health impacts are magnified, due to living in close-proximity to open drain and sewer systems, in areas that are likely to remain water-logged for longer, and being comparatively less well-serviced by health care. If flooding extends to the agricultural land surrounding a city, impacts are extended through disruptions to the food supply to the city, and potential transfer of contaminants into water storage and transmission systems. Urban centres in Asia generally rely on the peri-urban and hinterland, as well as imports from other countries for food. They do not produce food themselves (except for some small urban gardens). Any disruption to food supplies in the area (through flood, drought or other event), can lead to food shortages, and rises in prices. For the poor in Asian cities, this is a significant impact. The share of food expenditure (out of total expenditure) for many urban poor can represent a significant proportion of their household expenditure, for example, 53% for urban Indonesians in 2002115. Adaptive capacity to flooding across Asian cities is varied, but many urbanisation actions already undertaken by some cities are actually limiting their future adaptive capacity, or leading to \u201cmaladaptation\u201d to floods. Such actions include removal of (or lack of protection of) mangroves and infilling of wetlands and delta floodplain land for development (as in Dhaka, Bangkok, Manila and Kolkata116). Unplanned development and expansion into adjacent agricultural land (or sprawl) that does not take account of future flood risks and requirements when considering drainage and other systems contributes to the further vulnerability of cities. Even where the development is part of an overall master plan, if this has not considered climate change risks (as in the case of Ho Chi Minh City and Manila117), then there is a high likelihood of maladaptation (see Box 4). Box 4: Bangkok Flood Protection System \u2013 Adaptation for Some, Maladaptation for Others The concept of maladaptation is an important one to consider when planning adaptation initiatives. The UNDP defines maladaptation as: An action or process that increases vulnerability to climate change-related hazards. Maladaptive actions and processes often include planned development policies and measures that deliver short-term gains or economic benefits but lead to exacerbated vulnerability in the medium to long- term. An action that reduces the vulnerability for one group, may increase the vulnerability of another. Or, poorly planned adaptive measures may provide a short-term decrease in vulnerability, but over the long- term, lead to increased vulnerability. It has been suggested that the flood protection measures put in place to protect Bangkok, may actually be an example of \u201cmaladaptation\u201d. Large-scale engineering measures have been constructed in the Thai capital that include a flood embankment surrounding the city, and pumped drainage systems.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "84fd5027-6bdc-4c03-b24d-31c59383be91": {"__data__": {"id_": "84fd5027-6bdc-4c03-b24d-31c59383be91", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2f3d2651b6a204a621637c4569ef0ff54a76c56921f0a023790a9a2413c917f0"}, "2": {"node_id": "5bcb541a-5521-424d-9a20-1d33f0ab4580", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f9123160dcdf7f01ea8c989e1a154966084ee942a95e5cbbc4aac031bfe0dbfe"}}, "hash": "8cbcd212163061398956738d7647b093ba2135c463db4d3e8cceab3a59d814c6", "text": "However, during peak flooding events (as were experienced in 2006, and again in 2010), these systems reduced the 110 (Kovats and Akhtar 2009) 111 (Bartlett 2008) 112 Leptospirosis: is a bacterial zoonotic disease, commonly transmitted to humans by allowing water that has been contaminated with animal urine to come into contact with breaks in the skin, eyes and mucus membranes (http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cda-phlncd-leptospirosis.htm) 113 (Kovats and Akhtar 2009) 114 (Kovats", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "26bb725b-7b34-406e-8785-6d8b8842a41c": {"__data__": {"id_": "26bb725b-7b34-406e-8785-6d8b8842a41c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "81be978c9170b599e8c2b325f4b101c2be155ae61b64e7ca8800cb65d34f1055"}, "3": {"node_id": "170149f2-43ee-4522-84cc-726d2a82de3f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d7f25c04a03ed3060e16fc85418e6c2254162363c2fbcba24b812b8da086dd94"}}, "hash": "48d0d5ca24f094048fc5f7d12e42e1370509b9161cf788b49148af39c7235974", "text": "and Akhtar 2009) 115 (Dept. of Agriculture and Fisheries and Forestry 2004, 5) 116 (WWF 2010) 117 (Snidvongs 2009) 34 severity of the impact on Bangkok by allowing agricultural lands outside the embankment and north of the city to flood.

To compound this situation, the capacity of city officials in many Asian cities to undertake the integration of climate change considerations is currently limited,118 although several initiatives are underway to improve the understanding of the linkages between development planning and climate change. Ho Chi Minh city is building its capacity to understand climate change and its impacts through participation in the ACCCRN project, the APN for Global Change Research and as a member of the C40 Cities initiative. Other Asian cities of Bangkok, Beijing, Delhi, Dhaka, Hanoi, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Mumbai, Shanghai and Tokyo119 are also members of the C40 Cities initiative, and Jakarta, Bangkok, Shanghai and Mumbai also participate in the APN for Global Change Research.120 Access to financial resources is a key indicator of adaptive capacity, and cities such as Dhaka, and Kolkata have limited financial resources, compared with powerhouse cities such as Shanghai, Hong Kong and Singapore.121 In Bangkok, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration has planned for ongoing flooding in the city, and has been able to access resources to implement technical measures to mitigate these impacts. Recent infrastructure planning has included the installation of higher banks and pumping stations in the city to assist regulate canals, and water gates have been installed to prevent salt-water intrusion. Additionally, there are plans to grow mangroves to improve coastal storm surge protection, and to mitigate coastal erosion.122 An additional consideration of adaptive capacity is the community level understanding of climate change and its impacts. After recent storm events, residents of Manila have a higher understanding of the connection between climate change and city flooding,123 and Bangkok has implemented community-based emergency response training.124 However, overall community understanding of broader climate change science and issues is perceived to be quite low.125 Drought Exposure to increasing temperatures across Asia combined with variable and decreased precipitation, particularly when combined with increasing populations, has already led to cities experiencing drought and water shortages, and this trend is projected to continue.126 The IPCC estimates that minimum monthly flows in the Mekong delta will decrease by 26 \u2013 29%,127 exposing cities such as Ho Chi Minh City to reduced water access. Cities\u2019 exposure to the impacts of drought is made worse by uncontrolled groundwater extraction, increasing use of water by 118 (Tyler, et al. 2010) 119 (C40 Cities 2010) 120 (Snidvongs 2009) 121 (WWF 2010) 122 (Panya Consultants Co Ltd 2009), (WWF 2010) 123 (Snidvongs 2009) 124 (WWF 2010) 125 (Tyler, et al. 2010) 126 (Cruz, et al. 2007) 127 (Cruz, et al. 2007) 35 growing industries, contamination of supplies, and in the case of cities in Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Viet Nam, the altered flow impacts of upstream dams and power schemes in other countries. The poor in Asian cities are particularly vulnerable, as clean water supply to informal settlements and slums is frequently fragmented, and poorly maintained. With increasing water scarcity during droughts, the price of water increases, and access becomes more challenging, thus increasing the sensitivity of the poor to this issue. The health impacts not only relate to scarce water supply, but also water quality, as extreme low flows can lead to increased chemical and microbiological loads.128 Additionally, as water supplies decline, the functioning of the sanitation system is also compromised, increasing the risk of water-borne disease impacts, further increasing the hardship for the poor communities. Drought doesn\u2019t only affect the water supply for a city, it also impacts the energy supply for cities dependent on hydroelectric power, such as Manila, and the food security of the city if surrounding agricultural land is also impacted by drought.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "170149f2-43ee-4522-84cc-726d2a82de3f": {"__data__": {"id_": "170149f2-43ee-4522-84cc-726d2a82de3f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "81be978c9170b599e8c2b325f4b101c2be155ae61b64e7ca8800cb65d34f1055"}, "2": {"node_id": "26bb725b-7b34-406e-8785-6d8b8842a41c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "48d0d5ca24f094048fc5f7d12e42e1370509b9161cf788b49148af39c7235974"}}, "hash": "d7f25c04a03ed3060e16fc85418e6c2254162363c2fbcba24b812b8da086dd94", "text": "This then has serious health impacts, particularly relating to malnutrition, and livelihood impacts, as well as the potential vulnerability of the poor to food price increases.

As urban sanitation and water supply systems are improved, there will be an increase in potable water use, however, few cities combine this development with better localised capture, treatment and re-use of rainwater and storm water. Effective maintenance of water supply pipes and systems is required to reduce leakage and water lost from the system, but many cities do not have the resources to implement significant maintenance schedules. Heat Waves and Urban Heat Island Effect Cities across Asia have observed a trend of increasing temperature over the last decade, which is projected to continue.129 Cities in South Asia and South East Asia particularly are already exposed to high daytime temperatures. The built environment of concrete, heat-absorbing surfaces, heat generating equipment such as cars and machinery all contribute to the urban heat island effect, where cities can be as much as 10\uf007C warmer than their rural surrounds.130 Kovats notes \u201cheat is an environmental and occupational hazard.\u201d131 Although individuals in Asian cities may be more physiologically, behaviourally and culturally acclimatised to hotter temperatures than individuals in northern Europe or America, their tolerance for extremes is limited. The elderly, very young, or ill are particularly sensitive to these extremes. The poor who work in occupations that require them to be outside, such as labourers, rickshaw drivers or street vendors are unable to shield themselves from heat waves. Their adaptation mechanism may be to work slower, or take more frequent breaks. This can in turn affect their income generation and livelihood. A further health consideration is that increased temperatures shorten the development period for malaria and dengue fever carrying mosquitoes, significantly increasing the risk of increased 128 (Kovats and Akhtar 2009) 129 (Cruz, et al. 2007) 130 (OECD 2010) 131 (Kovats and Akhtar 2009, 165) 36 exposure for humans.132 The poor who cannot seal their homes against mosquitoes or afford the luxury of personal repellent or mosquito nets are particularly exposed. Extended periods of extreme heat can affect other systems such as power transmission lines, transport systems, communications and water supply systems and put a further strain on health services. In cities such as Melbourne and Sydney (Australia), where there is a growing reliance on air-conditioners in private homes during summer, extended periods of hot weather induce spikes in the electricity demand, which can cause blackouts across the city. An interruption to the power supply can then have flow on, indirect impacts to a multitude of other interconnected systems across the city. The urban heat island effect also contributes to poor air quality, a significant issue in Bangkok, Jakarta, Mumbai and many other Asian mega-cities. This includes particulate matter and pollutant concentration, as well as the distribution of allergens. The urban poor are particularly exposed, as they cannot retreat to sealed, air-conditioned offices and homes, where pollutant exposure is reduced. Urban street traders, rickshaw drivers and construction workers are continually exposed to poor air quality. Many Asian cities have recognised the risk of heat waves and urban heat islands, and have developed initiatives to counter these. Jakarta has a strategy to increase green-spaces across the city, including the planting and regeneration of mangroves in the North of the city; Bangkok similarly has a program of mangrove regeneration underway, and Shanghai is trialling a heat/health warning system.133 A community level response to increasing urban heat islands, is to install more air conditioners. This is often cited as a common \u201cmaladaptive\u201d measure, as while it decreases the vulnerability of some to the impacts of climate change, over time, the cumulative effect is to increase greenhouse gas emissions, and increase the effects of global warming. The combined effect of increasing urbanisation and climate change are likely to exacerbate many existing challenges in urban Asia. The following sections consider some of these challenges in relation to two mega-cites in Asia; Mumbai and Jakarta. 6. FOCUS: MUMBAI AND JAKARTA Two Asian mega-cities that are likely to experience significant impacts of climate change are Mumbai in India, and Jakarta in Indonesia. Yusuf and Francisco134 list Jakarta as the most vulnerable region in Southeast Asia. The criteria for selection of cities for the focus of this section of the report were: their exposure to multiple impacts, the population living in informal settlements, the access and availability of information relating to their vulnerability to climate changes, and the access to local knowledge of the policy and city situation. Both Mumbai and Jakarta are exposed to serious flooding, severe storms, drought, urban heat island effect and heat waves,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a43e55c7-0378-43d8-ba21-fe8792937ec4": {"__data__": {"id_": "a43e55c7-0378-43d8-ba21-fe8792937ec4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0f1601ee79a4f58777482ee81a2b302fa4232c15770bba07c0e7f747091c9190"}, "3": {"node_id": "a46da0e2-9aa0-45ec-9019-7e608e16dcb2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4a80aa587485ee0bb21d625ca57b452036339374f5b0e47b29011ae25b270fed"}}, "hash": "d7627210ee923b67357051158ca4e8a29b746caddd78ca08f7ee9e4bcc2b4272", "text": "along with the associated direct and indirect impacts of these conditions on city service provision, health and livelihood.

Some studies are in the process of being finalised (such as a World Bank study looking at the vulnerability of people to climate change in Kolkata), and technical studies concentrating on the range of potential future impacts, incorporating downscaled modelling and some hydrological analysis have been undertaken. However, studies that actually spoke to urban populations have not been undertaken. We found all studies were related to an existing problem or issue, with the future nature of that issue being considered in relation to future climate change. Predictably, the most pressing issues that were then researched related to disaster risk reduction; specifically flooding. In the case of both Jakarta and Mumbai, the cities experience annual flooding, but serious flooding incidents in 2007 for Jakarta, and 2005 for Mumbai, compelled follow-up research to be undertaken (see Appendix 3 for list of Jakarta and Mumbai studies reviewed). Finally, ICLEI \u2013 Local Governments for Sustainability has a South Asian office based in Delhi that could facilitate local research and policy access and review in India, which narrowed the field of candidate cities. Additionally, recent work by ICLEI Oceania in Indonesia enabled local researchers to be engaged to assist with locating and analysing field-based research papers (many in Bahasa Indonesia), and reviewing the local policy situation. Thus, the final cities chosen to investigate through field-based studies were Mumbai and Jakarta. The following tables outline the geographic, environmental, socio-economic and political situation of each of the cities. Section 7 presents a review of key national, regional and local city policies relevant to climate change, Section 8 investigates the two cities\u2019 contribution to climate change, while Section 9 considers the specific impacts of climate change that the two cities are likely to face, particular vulnerabilities and their adaptive capacities, based on field studies undertaken in each of the cities.

THE POLICY CONTEXT India and Indonesia both operate within a recently decentralised framework of government, where theoretically national level policies and strategies inform regional policies, which then inform and shape local city government policies. It has been noted that policies are often well crafted, but the challenge is in the implementation and enforcement of the policies. 165 (Government of Republic of Indonesia 2007, 41) 166 (Bakker, et al. 2006), (Kusumuwati 2011), (National Development Planning Agency, GoI 2007, Annex) 167 (City Mayors 2007) 168 (Kusumuwati 2011) 169 (Asian Disaster Preparedness Center 2010) 170 (WWF 2010) 171 (Mulyana 2010) 172 (Nurhadi 2009) 173 (Statistics Jakarta 2008) 174 (National Development Planning Agency, GoI 2007, 19) 175 (National Development Planning Agency, GoI 2007, 46) 41 A policy review was undertaken for both India and Indonesia, analysing key policies at the national, regional (where relevant) and local city level. At the national level, policies covered such areas as climate change, water, sanitation, transport, energy, education, poverty reduction, health, environment, forestry, trade, disaster management, air quality, housing and settlements, spatial planning, waste management and drought management. A complete list is included in Appendix 2. The regional and local level policies reviewed included such areas as green building, energy saving, air pollution, development and greenhouse gas reduction plans, investment and infrastructure, population, tourism, biotechnology, disaster management, water, forest, solar power policies and disaster management plans.

Overlaid with this was the particular impact on key human development considerations of livelihood, education, health and basic services. 7.1 Indonesia and Jakarta For Indonesia, several national level policies have been developed that specifically address climate change. These include the National Action Plan on Climate Change 2007, Indonesia Climate Change Sectoral Roadmap 2009, National Strategy and Action Plan on Urban Air Quality Improvement 2006, Energy Saving Policy 2005, National Energy Policy 2006 and the Spatial Planning Law 2007.

Additionally it identifies efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through strengthening the regulatory framework on energy efficiency, air pollution control, and capacity building to encourage Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects. Consideration of specific impacts such as sea-level rise is addressed through mangrove preservation, flooding through capacity building for an early warning system, and drought through the establishment of a school for farmers. The Indonesia Climate Change Sectoral Roadmap 2009 is an important piece of work, as it establishes a roadmap for mainstreaming climate change issues into national development planning. It establishes goals for both adaptation and mitigation activities for the next 20 years, covering areas such as waste, transportation, industry and water resources. Other policies, particularly older policies, do not specifically address climate change. These include the Poverty Reduction Strategy 2004 and the National Policy and Strategy on Housing and Settlements 2002. As these strategies are reviewed, Indonesia needs to ensure that climate change considerations will be integrated into them, so that they do not compete with, or contradict the aims of the newly developed climate policies. Policies such as the Community Based Water Supply and Environmental Sanitation Policy 2003 do not mention climate change specifically, however, their ultimate impact will be to reduce vulnerability by promoting the active role of the community in all water supply and sanitation 42 projects, while also encouraging water conservation and solid waste management (thereby reducing emissions). At the local city level, DKI Jakarta policies reviewed were Medium Term Development Plan 2007- 2012, Spatial Planning Policy 2030 (DRAFT), GHG Emission Reduction (low carbon city) DRAFT 2010, Green Building Policy (DRAFT), Control on Air Pollution (Local Regulation No. 2/2005), Electricity Saving (Governorial Decree No. 73/2008). All policies specifically addressed climate change, predominantly with the focus on greenhouse gas reduction. The Green Building Policy includes a pilot project of retrofitting city hall as a green building. The new draft Spatial Planning Policy, which is still in development includes adaptation measures for flood control, such as a large sea-wall construction and mangrove rehabilitation. On the combined mitigation/adaptation side, it promotes the extension of open green space in the city (which has a current target of 30% green space by 2020). Implementation of this last action will be particularly problematic, as Jakarta currently has less than 10% open space \u2013 and it is uncertain where the remaining 20% will be sourced. It is suggested that the majority will be plantings along roadsides, on small plots of vacant government land, and potentially private gardens in new developments. Attendees at the Climate Resilient Cities Identifying ASEAN Best Practices: Workshop and Exchange, Jakarta, January 2011 thought the Policy was unachievable, and had several concerns with the amount of large infrastructure (such as the proposed sea wall) and further development that was planned on reclaimed land in North Jakarta, which would increase water demand, and concern over relocation of the resident slum population.176 While the National and Local level policies appear solid and well crafted, with a growing understanding and integration of climate change, there is concern that the strategies to implement the policies are not being developed, and that enforcement is weak. This review did not analyse the implementation efficacy of each of the policies identified. Recent work by the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network suggests that the capacity of both city staff in Indonesia, and also the urban poor, to engage in climate change policy issues is not strong. Furthermore, interaction between city officials and NGOs (representing civil society) is not a regular occurrence. For policies to adequately and effectively address the needs of these groups, effective interaction needs to occur.177 7.2 India and Mumbai At the National level in India, several policies have been developed that will potentially have a positive impact on climate change adaptation and mitigation at the city level. These policies include, National Urban Sanitation Policy, Water Policy 2002, National Urban Transport Policy, National Urban Housing and Habitat Policy/Energy Conservation Building Codes, Energy Policy, National Environment Policy 2006, National Forest Policy, Foreign Trade Policy (2009 \u2013 2014), National Policy on Disaster Management, National Disaster Management Guidelines \u2013 Management of Floods, Cyclone Management Guidelines, Drought Management Guidelines, National Agriculture Policy, National Biofuel Policy but most importantly, the National Action Plan on Climate Change. The National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) is a significant piece of policy, including eight \u201cmissions\u201d. These missions, or directions, cover solar energy, energy efficiency, sustainable habitat, water, sustaining the Himalayan ecosystem, \u201cgreen\u201d India (focus on forests), sustainable 176(Gawler 2011) 177(Tyler, et al. 2010) 43 agriculture and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "899db430-4473-4ffa-9857-95652b13e161": {"__data__": {"id_": "899db430-4473-4ffa-9857-95652b13e161", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4e27f72bf32bda405f3136ffd20750ec81569ec9a75b074bd1b23b2a6f9007b3"}}, "hash": "4e27f72bf32bda405f3136ffd20750ec81569ec9a75b074bd1b23b2a6f9007b3", "text": "strategic knowledge for climate change. The National Mission on Sustainable Habitat is of particular relevance to cities. It aims to address the need of adapting to future climate change by improving the resilience of infrastructure, building community-based disaster management, and improving awareness of climate change and its impacts. On the mitigation side, it promotes energy efficiency, a modal shift to public transport and recycling of waste. The National Mission on Strategic Knowledge for Climate Change would establish a Climate Science Research Fund, but importantly, aims to analyse the status of socio economic (health, demography, migration patterns, livelihood) impacts of climate change. Cities are currently aligning their programs and budgets with actions under the NAPCC, and accessing both national and international funding to deliver against the outcomes of the missions. The National Policy on Disaster Management and the Cyclone Management Guidelines aim to increase the resilience of communities to disasters. Importantly, the National Policy on Disaster Management seeks to mainstream disaster management in development planning at all levels of government, drawing on technology, traditional wisdom and environmental sustainability principles. In India, city level governance can be heavily influenced by state level policies. As the capital of Maharashtra state, Mumbai does have a higher level of autonomy than some cities, but the state policies do still have an impact. The State Population Policy, for example, does not mention climate change specifically, but will help to improve the adaptive capacity of slum populations in urban areas by increasing the availability of health services to these areas. A contrary policy, the Industrial, Investment and Infrastructure Policy 2006 seeks to encourage employment and improve infrastructure. However, it does not discuss the need for infrastructure to be climate resilient, and it focuses on industrialisation to improve employment, which can have a multitude of negative environmental and social impacts if not pursued cautiously. The state level Housing Policy addresses a number of issues that could improve the adaptive capacity of those living in urban slums, by improving infrastructure such as roads, water supply, sanitation, transport and even slum redevelopment. While it does refer to the promotion of environmentally sustainable cities and townships, it does not refer to climate change specifically, which could have negative long-term infrastructure ramifications if not considered. Given that some of the climate change impacts for Mumbai are related to disasters such as floods and severe storms/cyclones, the State Disaster Management Plan, is an important document. It proposes to affect livelihoods by providing early warning systems, improve health and basic services by improving infrastructure, emergency evacuation procedures and providing cyclone shelters as well as improving community preparedness through community education. This management plan is linked to by the Mumbai Disaster Management Plan. As well as seeking to improve transport facilities and housing, it applies some very practical considerations by ensuring there are well-trained emergency response personnel, and that there is improved public communication and information systems during the entire disaster management planning cycle While many of these policies appear to be gaining some traction, and have implementation in place, there is still a perceived lack of engagement with the urban poor who may be affected by these policies, which therefore affects how well they will be received and implemented. Some groups are still marginalized, and are not able to participate in the process, whether this be due to cultural, or educational reasons. 44 8. PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION IN MUMBAI AND JAKARTA As seen in previous sections, cities can help directly and indirectly shape greenhouse emissions by how they influence consumption in their cities, and production processes. The following section outlines some of the drivers for consumption and production related to greenhouse gas emissions for Mumbai and Jakarta. The two key areas considered are energy supply and transport, as these are both the most significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions in the cities. Energy Access and Provision To encourage development, both India and Jakarta have undergone a process of building energy capacity to be able to provide reliable and efficient access to energy. In Maharashtra state (where Mumbai is located), approximately 95% of households use electricity for lighting in urban areas (which is an indicator of electricity coverage for the area), compared with only 65% for rural areas.178 Yedla notes that household energy consumption shift, relevant to income, follows the trend of \u201ccheapest and conventional (biomass) \ufffd cheaper and efficiency (kerosene) \ufffd most costly and efficient (LPG and electricity)\u201d. At the household level, the key determinants of energy demand are prices of fuels and appliances, the disposable income of the households, availability of fuels and appliances, cultural and particular requirements.179 Nationally, India still", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2b0190e9-aeb9-41c7-9a26-0968a69e5d15": {"__data__": {"id_": "2b0190e9-aeb9-41c7-9a26-0968a69e5d15", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "126a3531cec3765ad4f2a3f18c9d169cd134add77b4efe1f4d3ba5afe1cfbad4"}, "3": {"node_id": "b274e841-cf11-49c9-9545-48dba3d494e8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1e71179d38349a49874f86bd2e07b68cf7271a2bfe58c0ed3ef6fbd68d783e00"}}, "hash": "486b68a210ac4074d1899eb8af8f9d0fc888ddc2100bb6300f46f8acd1ba1704", "text": "relies very heavily on fossil fuels for energy production, with 2005/06 estimates suggesting 53% of total commercial energy supply is derived from coal, and 35% from oil.180 However, India\u2019s National Action Plan on Climate Change is seeking to change this, and increase the percentage of solar energy in the mix. A solar cities program is being conducted across many cities of India, but is targeting cities with populations under 5 million, so excludes Mumbai at this time (refer Box 3). The national Energy Policy also has a focus on lower-emission technologies, such as \u201cclean coal\u201d, nuclear and hydro-electricity and renewable energies. How these national strategies are implemented in Maharashtra state will effect the greenhouse gas intensity of electricity supply in Mumbai. Across Indonesia, electricity usage has grown significantly in the last decade, with 71.7 million MW being supplied by the state energy company in 1999, compared with 134.6 million MW supplied in 2009. In this time, household electricity use has doubled (27.5 million MW to 54.9 million MW), commercial/business use has nearly tripled (9.1 million MW to 24.8 million MW), while industrial emissions have only increased by 50% (31.4 million MW to 46.2 million MW).181 The primary energy supply for Jakarta (in 2001) was oil, representing 82.2%, while coal represented less than 1% and natural gas approached 17%.182 National level policies on climate change and the National Energy Policy encourage energy switching through activating the Clean Development Mechanism, and energy diversification, with targets set to achieve less energy intensity in the energy mix. If implemented, these policies will see a reduction in energy intensity in cities like Jakarta. Most large scale energy generation and supply projects require the investment of the private sector, as well as the Research and Development and innovative technology the sector brings to the area. Through its NAPCC, and other initiatives, India in particular is encouraging the private sector to be engaged in changing India\u2019s energy mix. 178 (Yedla 2010, 35) 179 (Yedla 2010, 14) 180 (Kumar , et al. 2009, 4) 181 (BPS: Statistics Indonesia 2009) 182 (Marpaung 2008) 45 Urban Form and Transport One of the conundrums for urban planners in cities such as Mumbai and Jakarta involves issues of urban density. Well-planned, dense agglomerations can reduce a city\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions through effective household energy supply (see above) and compact mass transport systems.183 However, both Mumbai and Jakarta have the double conundrum of extremely dense inner-city areas, combined with urban sprawl. Average density for Jakarta is 14,400 people per sq km,184 while Mumbai\u2019s population density is over 27,200 people per sq km.185 Partially as a response to such high densities, workers in both cities are increasingly moving to \u201csuburban\u201d areas, where housing prices are more affordable, but continue to work in the city centre. In Jakarta, 30% of people who are working in Jakarta live in the surrounding suburban areas.186 This has significant implications for transport systems, and the associated greenhouse gas emissions in these cities. Neither Jakarta nor Mumbai have adequately planned for rapid urban expansion in terms of transport planning, with both municipalities focusing transport planning efforts on providing newer, wider, faster roads. This emphasis leads to a modal shift towards private, motorised transport, and road freight as opposed to rail freight. Both Jakarta and Mumbai have witnessed significant private vehicle growth rates (See Tables 4 and 5). The shift to private motorised transport favours the affluent in these cities, who can afford to purchase and run a vehicle, and adversely affects the poor. Increased preference for car use on roads in Jakarta for example, has made it extremely difficult and dangerous to get around by cycle or walking (some parts of Jakarta do not even have footpaths). In Mumbai, ongoing road widening \u201ceats into\u201d footpaths, and like Jakarta, these are lined with obstacles such as vendors, potholes etc. Mumbai and Jakarta are both serviced by mass transport systems, incorporating both rail and bus services.

Studies that model future impact of climate change for both cities clearly identify flood as the predominant issue, in the case of Jakarta, this is seen as both a sea-level rise issue, and a river flooding issue; and in Mumbai, it is predominantly concern of future more frequent and intense precipitation events.191 190 Details of field-based studies are recorded in Appendix 3. 191 (Hallegate, et al. 2010) 47 Other impacts such as the increasing urban heat island effect and associated heat waves and air quality issues are on the radar for the local governments, but studies have not been undertaken at the community level to investigate attitudes and behaviour in relation to these effects. The local challenges and vulnerabilities of the research groups will be presented through the lens of their exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity to the impact of flooding. One study from Jakarta explored flooding due to a precipitation event, one looked at flooding due to sea-level rise, and one looked at a range of sea level rise impacts (including flooding) for coastal villages. The three Mumbai studies each explored the 2005 flooding event, but from different perspectives.

Takano and S. Sammadar - Floods Risk Reduction in Livelihood Risks: Thoughts and Insights from Mumbai (2010) Only one study, the IESR study in Kamal Muara village nominated a target group of fisherman as its focus. The other studies did not nominate particular groups of focus within these areas. That is, they did not particularly study the impact of flooding on women, children, the elderly or a particular ethnic or religious group. Rather, a random selection of households from the geographic location was chosen. Each location, however, had a significant proportion of poor people living in informal settlements, so by default this is the demographic focused on. Further details on each of these studies are presented in Appendix 3. Geographic Exposure of the Research Groups to Flooding Each of the six study sites was selected by the researchers because of their high level of exposure to flooding, whether caused by sea-level rise or precipitation events. The challenges faced by residents in the study areas included ongoing and projected worsening exposure to flood events from either more intense precipitation events and storms, or sea-level rise. The direct challenge of having to build on low-lying land, often reclaimed land on the banks of water ways added to their exposure. Lack of control over developmental planning decisions that contributed to their exposure such as upstream development along river ways, overdevelopment of natural drainage areas, poor waste management services, which led to rubbish clogging waterways and making exposure to flooding worse, poor drainage planning and maintenance which further compounded impacts of the flooding. As most participants cited being close to their workplace (across the various studies) as a reason for staying in a highly exposed area, inadequate transport systems (requiring residents to be in walking distance of their employment) is another factor that contributes to their exposure, but is out of their direct control. Each of these challenges is explored in relation to the study areas in more detail below. 48 For Jakarta, the study neighbourhoods are generally in the North, along the coast. The specific villages are, Kamal Muara, (IESR research), Kampung Melayu (Marschiavelli research) and Kamal Muara, Penjaringan and Pluit (Sentosa research). The IESR study modelling estimated that by 2100, sea level rise would likely inundate most of this area, as far as central Jakarta.192 For Mumbai, the settlements selected are generally found along the Mithi River. They are the Jari Mari193 Settlement in L ward, near Chatrapati Shivaji International airport, on the banks of the Mithi River and Prem Nagar in P South ward, next to Malad Creek in Goregaon, (Chatterjee research), settlements in the H East, H West, K East, K West, P South, P North, R South, R North, N, S and T wards in the suburbs of Mumbai (Hallegate research) and three settlements in the Dharavi slum in G North Ward, Prem Nagar, Parsi-chawl and Rajiv Ghandi Nagar (Takano and Sammadar research). Downscaled climate projections are unable to project with any certainty the future exposure change in rainfall events for Mumbai, however there is likely to be an increase in monsoon rains of 10 \u2013 30%, and sea level rise of 1.2mm per annum is likely to continue.194 Each of the locations has a relatively low elevation, and is close to a water body, so the population\u2019s proximity to the flooding entity increases its vulnerability. Compounding factors, generally of a man-made nature, increase this exposure. The research sites are located in highly built up areas that facilitate the quick run-off of water. In Mumbai for example, Hallegate notes that 40% of the urban storm water previously flowed through open lands, acting as a kind of holding pond.

The studies in Jakarta particularly noted that the encroachment of the houses, right up to the waterway edge also assisted with narrowing the natural drainage system, and compounding the flood effect.196 It was noted in the Hallegate study, that upstream building along the river catchment increased the speed and volume of water in the river system, therefore compounding the downstream effects.197 Leaving these areas and moving to less exposed places was a challenge for many residents. They predominantly selected to live/stay in these areas, because they were in close proximity to their work (or education, or transport to either of these)198, they had been there a long time (some areas over 20 years) and had a strong social support and connection with the location.199 Sensitivity of the Research Groups to Flooding Sensitivity was not specifically addressed as a separate issue in any of the studies. However, it can be interpreted as the degree the flood affected residents\u2019 assets (the impact on their home and belongings), their livelihood (through lost work days and lost income) and their health (through 192 (Institute of Essential Services Reform 2010) 193 Note, throughout the Chatterjee research paper, the Jari Mari Settlement is referred to as either Jari Mari, or Jarimari. We have chosen to use the Jari Mari variation for this paper. 194 (Nair n.d.) 195 (Marschiavelli 2008) 196 (Institute of Essential Services Reform 2010), (Marschiavelli 2008) 197 (Hallegate, et al. 2010) 198 (Takano and Samaddar 2010), (Hallegate, et al. 2010), (Marschiavelli 2008) 199 (Takano and Samaddar 2010), (Marschiavelli 2008) 49 injury and illness). The sensitivity to each of these issues is a factor of several socio-economic conditions. With a higher relative income, residents can reduce their sensitivity to flooding by building multi-level houses, with more sturdy materials such as bricks and concrete, with good storage for possessions. One study suggests insurance may be a preferable option. Multiple sources of income for the household spreads the risk of income loss during flooding events. The challenge of improved health is a combination of factors, such as understanding and awareness of good hygiene practices, and factors outside the residents\u2019 control, such as improved waste collection services and water and sanitation services. In both the Mumbai and Jakarta studies, it was noted that as the areas flooded annually during the monsoon season, there was a fair degree of tolerance for floods, they were \u201cperceived as normal\u201d200, and they were just \u201cperceived as an inconvenience for the general public.\u201d201 During both the 2005 Mumbai and 2007 Jakarta flood events, however, the impact was higher flood levels combined with longer duration. Houses in the Jari Mari and Prem Nagar settlement in Mumbai were inundated between 6 \u2013 12 ft202, while the Parsi-Chawl area flooded to approximately a maximum of 9 ft, with the inundation of houses lasting one to one and half days, and Rajiv Ghandi Nagar flood level was higher, (up to 15ft in a small number of cases) and lasted longer.203 In Kampung Melayu in Jakarta, flood waters reached 5 metres in some places, and lasted up to 15 days.204 However, even with such extreme levels of flooding, the residents of Prem Nagar, Parsi-Chawl and Rajiv Ghandi Nagar reported \u201clittle\u201d or \u201cno\u201d damage to their houses (39.1%/52.5%, 28.6%/70.9% and 36.5%/57.2% of respondents respectively).205 Houses in these areas were generally made in the pucca style, which is of quite sturdy materials such as brick, concrete and timber, some with multi-levels.

In Kampung Melayu (Jakarta), there was a significant percentage of residents who had built second levels on their houses, which reduced their sensitivity to flooding.206 The Takano study revealed there was a significant loss in durable assets, and in stored food.207 To replace these, and repair houses, residents either drew on their savings208 or drew on familial and other networks for finance, which then had to be paid back, or worked off if they were supplied by an employer.209 As many slum inhabitants earn a daily wage, any time away from work means no income for that day. In Mumbai, Takano found that an average of between 10 \u2013 30 working days were lost across the three study areas.210 Similar results were found in Kampung Melayu, where many of the residents worked in the local market that had been inundated, and took several days to be operational again.211 Fishermen in Kamal Muaru are exposed to high economic losses during 200 (Marschiavelli 2008, 38) 201 (Chatterjee 2010, 100) 202 (Chatterjee 2010) 203 (Takano and Samaddar", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b36f4a6d-0c9c-4717-bfc7-7378747f0952": {"__data__": {"id_": "b36f4a6d-0c9c-4717-bfc7-7378747f0952", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b833cbc79c156e59988e7c5a40b655b3fbc8141d690639355f317c865eb81ede"}, "3": {"node_id": "6b99cbfe-0a25-4468-a8d2-5fd90e798322", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4813dedf80a8f47da8c923f5217fb6d66253f6e7e0d894135ee092139e2cf72a"}}, "hash": "22ba1ad9bdad10ef45e8229bbf714bf970fd95f24c9e4ad509142ff14dcf76e9", "text": "2010) 204 (Marschiavelli 2008) 205 (Takano and Samaddar 2010, 113) 206 (Marschiavelli 2008) 207 (Takano and Samaddar 2010, 113) 208 (Hallegate, et al. 2010) 209 (Chatterjee 2010) 210 (Takano and Samaddar 2010, 111) 211 (Marschiavelli 2008) 50 storm events, when they are unable to go out and fish. To reduce their sensitivity, many are seeking second jobs, as motorbike mechanic for example.212 The impact of flood on health and livelihoods can be related to the level of basic services provided to slum areas. Takano\u2019s study compared three slum areas in close proximity, with similar average incomes, but each had a significantly different level of service provision. The following Table 6 taken from the study illustrates this. His conclusions were, that the impact on health and livelihoods was less for the residents in Parsi-Chawl, who had a generally higher standard of basic service provision. Table 6: Service Provision in Dharavi Slum Area Prem Nagar Parsi-Chawl Rajiv Ghandi Nagar Water Supply Source BMC Supplied water outside the house (shared by 4 to 5 households) 93% 36.9% 78.8% BMC supplied water inside the house 6.3% 63.1% 20.2% Buying water supply from outside 1.2% 0% 1% Total 100% 100% 100% Sanitation Facility Nearby Community Facility 82.3% 20.7% 58.2% Own Sanitation System 1.7% 79.3% 18.8% Open Filled Defecation 16.1% 0% 23.1% TOTAL 100% 100% 100% Source: Tatano and Sammadar, 2010, p 109. For the people of Kampung Melayu, in addition to seeing the cause of the flood as heavy rain further upstream, 27% thought garbage was a main contributor to the severity of the flooding213. Hallegate\u2019s modelling suggests that 1 in 200 year events such as the 2005 Mumbai flood are likely to occur 1 in 90 years under an upper limit climate change scenario, even without the increased urbanisation pressures on the city, and that the frequency of more intense storms in general is likely to increase. This suggests that the vulnerable populations in the study areas of Mumbai will have less time to recover between events, and there will be an accumulated sensitivity of lost assets, work days and savings (as they are ploughed back into more frequent house repairs). The sensitivity to health impacts is related to injury or death as a direct cause of the flood or extreme storm event, and also illness following the event. To avoid injury or death, residents need to be able to avoid being in the path of the storm or flood. This means having a safe place to go during the event, having early warning of the event, and understanding what is required when an early warning is received. In addition to having early warning, they need to have confidence in the accuracy of that warning. In both Mumbai and Jakarta, residents of the affected areas sought shelter first in their upper house levels, but then with friends and family, or in community provided centres \u2013 such as \u201cmosques, schools, government offices and health clinics\u201d214, as was the case in Kampung Melayu. As floods and storms are a regular occurrence, most areas in both Mumbai and Jakarta have some form of flood warning system. However, it was noted in Kampung Melayu there was mixed levels of confidence in the accuracy of the system.215 The residents noted also that though they may be given a warning as to the flood level that was 212 (Institute of Essential Services Reform 2010) 213 (Marschiavelli 2008, 38) 214 (Marschiavelli 2008, 39) 215 (Marschiavelli 2008) 51 approaching, there was no formalised understanding of what actions should be taken in such an event. It relied on individual\u2019s past experience of similar warning levels.216 The incidence of disease following an event, particularly water-borne diseases, appears to be high in these studies. This is related to how quickly the water can drain away from the urban area, whether drinking water supplies are contaminated or not, if sanitation and sewage systems were compromised, allowing effluent to flow into streets, houses and water supplies, and the knowledge and understanding of the population of correct health precautions in these situations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6b99cbfe-0a25-4468-a8d2-5fd90e798322": {"__data__": {"id_": "6b99cbfe-0a25-4468-a8d2-5fd90e798322", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b833cbc79c156e59988e7c5a40b655b3fbc8141d690639355f317c865eb81ede"}, "2": {"node_id": "b36f4a6d-0c9c-4717-bfc7-7378747f0952", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "22ba1ad9bdad10ef45e8229bbf714bf970fd95f24c9e4ad509142ff14dcf76e9"}}, "hash": "4813dedf80a8f47da8c923f5217fb6d66253f6e7e0d894135ee092139e2cf72a", "text": "The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai was quoted in the Takano Mumbai study, as recording 419 deaths due to flash flooding and landslide, while another 216 were killed due to illness following the flood.217 Chatterjee quotes Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) authorities as reporting 700 deaths218, while the Government of Maharashtra reported 447 deaths during the floods, as a result of drowning, landslides, a stampede due to a false tsunami warning, housing collapses and people trapped in vehicles.219 Chatterjee lists some of the diseases that were reported in the two weeks following the flood, including", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a73ce6ff-6e04-452a-9b3a-9bd5791e8c25": {"__data__": {"id_": "a73ce6ff-6e04-452a-9b3a-9bd5791e8c25", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cab9b7c32463a397c0f2fbb7897c9a88a7ca76069da289d2b1fb0b2897f1354c"}}, "hash": "cab9b7c32463a397c0f2fbb7897c9a88a7ca76069da289d2b1fb0b2897f1354c", "text": "gastroenteritis, hepatitis, enteric fever, typhoid, malaria, dengue fever and leptospirosis, collectively numbering in the tens of thousands of cases.220 The IESR study noted there was an outbreak of dengue fever after one flood event in Jakarta in 2008.221 No studies, however, commented on the adequacy of the health system to treat these cases, or the individual level and understanding of hygiene and health precautions. Faced with this array of challenges, as a result of their exposure and sensitivity to floods and storm events, residents undertake a selection of measures to shield themselves from the worst impacts. These will be explored in the following section. Adaptive Capacity The capacity of residents to adapt to extreme events such as floods and storms is a combination of their own resources, initiatives and socio-cultural networks, as well as the formal structures and processes within which they operate. Things that facilitate adaptive capacity include: \u2022 Education/understanding/knowledge of climate change and future risks; \u2022 Network of support during the event, and recovery after the event; \u2022 Resources to adapt \u2013 i.e.: build second storey or move; \u2022 Resources or access to resources to recover from event; \u2022 Formal local government or other frameworks and processes, such as appropriate and well- maintained infrastructure, and effective early warning systems. One very powerful coping strategy at both the individual and community level is knowledge and understanding. Residents who have lived in the study areas for some time, and have experienced extreme events, are better prepared for future extreme events. They know the hydrology of the floods, which areas will flood worst, what systems will be impacted, therefore how they need to prepare in advance. Sharing these understandings with neighbours, friends and colleagues provides a strong basis for adaptive capacity during events. These studies did not explore in great detail the perception or understanding of the communities to future climate risks in general, other than to glean their perceptions on whether they felt storm events and flooding were becoming more frequent or severe, or what they considered the causes were. 216 (Marschiavelli 2008) 217 (Takano and Samaddar 2010, 105) 218 (Chatterjee 2010, 96) 219 (Hallegate, et al. 2010, 14) 220 (Chatterjee 2010, 98) 221 (Institute of Essential Services Reform 2010) 52 At the individual level, several measures were undertaken by residents of the study areas to reduce their exposure and sensitivity to extreme events. Many of these were based on the aforementioned knowledge and understanding. Prior to a flood or storm event, residents prepared for the event by altering their physical structures to reduce their exposure and sensitivity to floods such as: building from solid materials such as brick, concrete, timber and so forth; adding extra levels to the house, so that valuable items can be stored upstairs away from flood waters; raising the floor level of existing houses and installing storage at higher levels in the house to remove possessions from harm\u2019s way. Residents in one study purchased more durable plastic furniture (rather than timber), as it was easy to move and to clean post a flood event.222 On the broader community level, residents of Kampung Melayu regularly cleaned the rubbish from the drains and riverbanks prior to the monsoon season to reduce the level of clogging.223 Other than the physical structures, residents reduced their sensitivity to impacts by having multiple income sources for the household. This may be through multiple people earning an income, or through one member of the house having a diversified income, for example, as a fisherman and as a motorbike mechanic224; or as a recycled factory worker and a small stall operator, or providing a house-cleaning service post the event225. Additionally, it was noted by some residents in Kampung Melayu that all children know how to swim from an early age, so if they are caught in flood waters, they have a chance of survival.226 During (and in the hours leading up to) the event, behaviour was more specific to the different locations. Sentosa noted that some residents of Kamal Muara, Pluit and Penjaringan increased supplies of food, fuel and water, while others chose to relocate to non-flood prone areas.227 Other coping strategies included: evacuating early to a community centre (particularly pregnant women, children and the elderly); moving possessions to higher levels of the house, or to neighbours\u2019 houses; relocating to family and neighbours on higher ground; placing clothing and other goods in plastic bags. In Kampung Melayu, it was noted that the community facilities were inadequate (poor sanitation and cleanliness), so people preferred to stay in their own houses, or go to family and neighbours.228 During the Mumbai floods, some workers", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "efe7cec3-202a-456d-8b67-f6040e0e1605": {"__data__": {"id_": "efe7cec3-202a-456d-8b67-f6040e0e1605", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ccf3f4f01b9d89f6e67cfb0f564c0b0b46bac588ed8b2adefac72d5ff00815b0"}, "3": {"node_id": "0e91cc28-59a3-4df1-a307-438b1ad2fff4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "81972ebe4e63ff9c9490ea2a87ea0ea6d7add903c3b5e9aaf5681f4e947b862b"}}, "hash": "f38989394500b1b46b0172897c66e0a304a5d11ce53614a77fcf2a4fa55b39cb", "text": "from the study areas were unable to return home, so stayed at their place of work (in relatively secure, well built buildings), while in Jakarta, pieces of rope were tied along particularly hazardous walkways to reduce the risk of injury to people travelling through fast moving waters.229 In both Mumbai and Jakarta, residents were however, uncomfortable with leaving their houses and possessions unguarded. They felt they would be robbed or further damaged if they were not there.230 Post the flood or storm event, people hired themselves out to clean and repair houses, and communities in Kampung Melayu collectively cleaned the canal and surrounding areas. Chatterjee particularly discusses the financial recovery mechanisms post the Mumbai 2005 flood. This included borrowing from family, friends, neighbours, local banks, self-help associations and employers to finance building repairs and to replace possessions. Chatterjee found that households drew upon an average of five of these mechanisms, whereas Hallegate found participants in their study region mainly used their personal savings to finance repairs and reconstruction.231 222 (Marschiavelli 2008) 223 (Marschiavelli 2008) 224 (Sentosa 2010) 225 (Institute of Essential Services Reform 2010) 226 (Marschiavelli 2008) 227 (Sentosa 2010) 228 (Marschiavelli 2008) 229 (Marschiavelli 2008) 230 (Chatterjee 2010), (Marschiavelli 2008) 231 (Hallegate, et al. 2010) 53 The capacity to mitigate extreme flood and storm events is not only a function of the individual\u2019s capacity, but also of the more formal social and government processes and structures in place. It has already been noted that the local communities perceive many things contribute to the flooding of their areas, which are under the control of government. Thus, adaptive capacity is reduced by: lack of properly planned and enforced land use and urban planning (which allows building on highly exposed areas such as riverbanks, over natural drainage areas, upstream intensive urban development along river ways); the clearing of mangroves and forests; poor provision of basic services such as water supply, sanitation services and waste collection services; poor maintenance of sanitation and water services that may be provided; poor disaster risk reduction planning (i.e. it is not integrated with development planning and does not necessarily take account of rapid urbanisation or climate change). The local governments in the research areas had undertaken some adaptive measures (although some may be perceived as unpalatable to some of the residents). This included removal of huts along the drains prior to the monsoon season232, establishment of early warning systems (of varying effectiveness), establishment of public kitchens during events,233 access to communications (through mobile phones or static lines),234 and disaster risk reduction strategies in place for some areas. Sentosa noted that the community worked with the government in the Penjaringan sub-district to construct a sea-wall and improve the drainage system. Chatterjee summarised the adaptive measures taken across Mumbai in response to the 2005 Floods (note these are not necessarily particular to the research areas) in Table 7.

The following section presents a menu of recommendations that policy and development workers may wish to explore further. We have broadly divided these recommendations into four categories: Knowledge/Information recommendations, Community Capacity and Local Government Capacity recommendations and International Donor Community recommendations. a) Knowledge/Information Urban Field-Based Studies: As highlighted very early in this report, there are very few studies being undertaken in mega-cities that adequately capture community understanding of climate change impacts, and their strategies to cope with these. The experience of local people during extreme events, or as climate impacts gradually affect them is extremely valuable, and is important to be captured and shared. Strategies to encourage broad based field research capturing a diversity of perspectives (not only of the poor) are required to inform appropriate policy and strategy development. City-Level Climate Modelling: Current approaches to city level modelling rely heavily on downscaling Global Climate Models or Regional Climate Models, and sometimes combining these with local climate data. This approach currently produces widely varying projections, which can make future planning even more uncertain for city officials and the community. Access to local data in Asian cities can be a significant problem, either because it is not available, or inter- departmental bureaucracy makes the process extremely complicated. City climate models also need to incorporate future development projections to adequately capture potential future impacts, which adds another layer of complexity and uncertainty to models. National governments are currently investing quite heavily in Regional Climate Models, and a strategy of further investment in approaches to developing appropriate city-scale data is highly recommended. This information will be able to not only inform pro-poor development strategies, but also pro-poor disaster risk reduction planning. 55 Communicating Climate: An additional aspect to climate modelling information, is the communication of this information. The language spoken by climate scientists is very different from that understood by city planners and the community. Climate scientists often do not understand exactly what information is required of them, and city planners misinterpret and misuse the information available. National investment in \u201cscience communication\u201d fields, that can be trans-boundary in nature would reduce the risk of inappropriate use of scientific information. b) Community Capacity Capturing and Sharing Experiences: Although this may fall into the knowledge/information area, it is also relevant to be highlighted here, under Community Capacity. The field studies showed clearly that previous understanding and knowledge of how to act prior to, during and after extreme events built the capacity of members of the local community. Capturing these experiences and sharing them to new arrivals to areas, between areas, even between cities and countries, will reduce the vulnerability of these groups, and may collectively improve the adaptive capacity of communities. There is a clear role for local NGOs and development professionals to facilitate this capturing and sharing of experiences. Integrating Climate Change into Current NGO Agendas: NGO\u2019s have a specific agenda that propels them, be it alleviating the suffering of children in poverty, assisting to empower women, improving environmental conditions or a combination of these (and other) priorities. For these NGOs, who work daily with the urban poor, to provide the best outcomes to their constituents, they need to fully understand the climate change landscape, and how it impacts their agenda. This would require significant resources to be invested in training and skilling local NGO and community development professionals, in what for some may be a whole new field. This relates strongly to the \u201ccommunicating climate\u201d recommendation above, as incorrectly communicated information confuses the climate change debate, and stifles potential adaptation measures. Community-led Initiatives: Actions identified and initiated by the community have a strong likelihood of building local level adaptive capacity. Such initiatives as waste reduction are a \u201cno- regrets\u201d policy, as should climate change impacts be more or less than projected, the community is often better off, emissions may be reduced, and adaptive capacity increased. Other initiatives such as locally developed social support networks, micro-finance or emergency management approaches are all worthy of further support, and again may fall into the remit of local NGOs. Strategies to support these initiatives should be encouraged. Community Understanding of Climate Change: For individuals in the community, the understanding of climate change is strongly linked to the understanding of the most recent climatic event \u2013 such as a flood, cyclone, storm surge etc. Facilitating the broader understanding of the community beyond emergency events is important. This recommendation is strongly linked to the Communicating Climate recommendation mentioned previously. Capacity to Engage: The formal engagement of the local community, particularly marginalised populations, in local government (even regional", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0d43a00e-24e2-454d-bf4b-d02adca33c52": {"__data__": {"id_": "0d43a00e-24e2-454d-bf4b-d02adca33c52", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "154b425c62b1e6319e8492420271fc3d04cef4005ab138cc93521d7656585df9"}}, "hash": "154b425c62b1e6319e8492420271fc3d04cef4005ab138cc93521d7656585df9", "text": "and national government) processes is particularly poor in developing countries in Asia. However, many NGOs work in the space of building community empowerment, to enhance the community\u2019s capacity to engage formally with government processes. Enhancing these processes, and ensuring the integrated understanding of climate change issues is recommended. This strategy links very closely with the strategy of integrating climate change into current NGO agendas. 56 Early Warning Systems: Early warning systems take many forms across Asia (for tsunamis, floods, heat waves etc). Ensuring that these systems are developed with community input and understanding is important. Communities need to know what is required of them when each particular \u201calert level\u201d has been reached. The studies suggested this step \u2013 which is the step between formal government processes and the community, is weak and needs to be strengthened. c) Local Government Capacity Local Government Understanding of Climate Change: Elected representatives and city staff need to have a good understanding of climate change, and how it is likely to impact their area of control, to be able to appreciate the importance of integrating climate change into their planning processes. Several organisations and networks, such as ICLEI \u2013 Local Governments for Sustainability, C40 Cities, Asian Cities Climate Change Resilient Network and others work in the region to facilitate improved knowledge and understanding of climate change implications, but being able to extend this reach to even more cities would be an advantage. Address Short-term, Non-integrated Planning: Cities in Asia are not the only ones that suffer from short-term planning horizons, and non-integrated planning. All cities struggle with these issues. The short-term election cycles of all levels of government complicate this issue, but staff, who are generally engaged past the election dates, can continue to build improvements in this area. Continuing to facilitate the development of tools, techniques and training to build the understanding and skills of local government staff to look longer into the future is a process that can be facilitated by the international community, and governance professionals. Governance Improvement Strategies: Engaging with communities around local government planning issues, in an open, accessible and transparent manner is a relatively new concept to local government \u2013 even in developed countries. For many Asian cities, this is counter to their cultural norms, and may be perceived as undermining the authority of local government. A long-term approach to improving the engagement culture, structures and processes for engagement, as well as the skills to undertake engagement is required, and is a strategy that can be facilitated by the international community and NGOs. Increase Perceived Importance of Climate Change: Local government priorities are determined by a combination of national priorities, and local realities. To overcome the problem of competing priorities, the perceived importance of climate change needs to be increased. Both India and Indonesia have recognised the importance of climate change at the national level. However, more needs to be done to ensure its relevance to the development agenda is cemented in place, and it is given suitable priority. At the local level, more needs to be done to raise the priority of climate change. This is predominantly a strategy of engaging with local elected members in an ongoing, consistent manner, to continuously identify the local realities of climate change, and to support them to feel that cities can do something about it. Decentralisation Capacity Improvement: The decentralisation processes underway in India and Indonesia have increased the scope of work, and the level of authority and responsibility for local governments. There is currently a knowledge, skill and competency gap to meet the new work requirements, as well as a financial gap. Local government staff not only need support in understanding how climate change is relevant to their roles, but also, help in building capacity to deliver on the increased range of responsibilities, and implement the policies that have been devised at higher levels. Facilitating training, support and networking in this area is an important strategy at the national level for countries in this position. 57 Additionally, reviewing the process of funding and resourcing for cities at the national level would be one approach to assist with local financing issues, and potentially reduce the likelihood of local level corruption. At the international level, streamlining some of the frameworks for funding would be another strategy. For example, it is an extremely difficult, lengthy process for cities in Indonesia to access the benefits of CDM projects, as they are predominantly a national government level mechanism. Standardised Greenhouse Gas Accounting: Guidance is available for cities to undertake an emissions inventory for their own operations, and for their broader municipalities.

There is also discussion of how to better allocate consumption methodologies in cities\u2019 accounting processes. Further work and consolidation of a standardised greenhouse accounting process for cities, recognised globally, would facilitate further action by cities on climate change mitigation. d) International Donor Community Donor Understanding of Importance of Funding City Climate Change Work: International donor funding agencies are only just becoming aware of the importance of cities in the climate change agenda. Facilitating understanding by donor agencies of the unique challenges and concepts of urban resilience to climate change is an important strategy to be undertaken. Additionally, assisting to develop a coordinated approach to ensure maximum, effective impacts is a strategy that agencies such as UNDP could lead. 11. CONCLUSION In an increasingly urbanised world, as international negotiations continue to falter (or progress slowly at best), the role that cities can play in reducing emissions is becoming more important. By using the levers at their control of planning, regulation, purchasing power, network facilitation, education and civic leadership, local governments can control and influence how energy is produced and consumed within their municipalities. The inherent nature of cities, of how they concentrate people and resources, can challenge this process, but also provides an opportunity. Even if strong greenhouse gas reductions were to take place immediately, climate change would still occur, and cities are likely to feel significant impacts of these. Many cities in Asia are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including Mumbai and Jakarta. There is an opportunity for cities to build their resilience to climate change, by reducing their exposure, decreasing the sensitivity of their communities, particularly their poor and marginalised communities, and improving their adaptive capacity. There is a role for the international community, national and local governments, as well as NGOs and civil society organisations to reduce the vulnerability of cities to climate change. Further research, better climate communications, improved community, NGO and local government capacity and coordinated international donor efforts are just some of the ways resilience can be improved. 58 12. GLOSSARY OF KEY TERMS The area of climate change mitigation and adaptation brings together many facets and areas of research and technical expertise, which each have a different \u201clanguage\u201d for their area of focus. For this reason, some key terms used in the climate change adaptation space are not clearly and consistently defined. For the purpose of this report, definitions used are generally aligned with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) definitions. Adaptation \u2013 Adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities. Various types of adaptation can be distinguished, including anticipatory, autonomous and planned adaptation.235 Anticipatory Adaptation \u2013 Adaptation that takes place before impacts of climate change are observed. Also referred to as proactive adaptation.236 Autonomous Adaptation \u2013 Adaptation that does not constitute a conscious response to climatic stimuli but is triggered by ecological changes in natural systems and by market or welfare changes in human systems. Also referred to as spontaneous adaptation.237 Planned Adaptation \u2013 Adaptation that is the result of a deliberate policy decision, based on an awareness that conditions have changed or are about to change and that action is required to return to, maintain, or achieve a desired state.238 Adaptive Capacity \u2013 The ability of a system to adjust to climate change, (including climate variability and extremes), to moderate potential damages, to take advantage of opportunities, or to cope with the consequences. 239 Climate Change \u2013 Refers to any change in climate over time, whether due to natural variability or as a result of human activities.240 Climate Change Impacts \u2013 The effects of climate change on natural and human systems.241 Climate Variability \u2013 Climate variability refers to variations in the mean state and other statistics (such as standard deviations, statistics of extremes, etc) of the climate on all temporal and spatial scales beyond that of individual weather events. Variability may be due to natural internal processes within the climate system (internal variability), or to variations in natural or anthropogenic external forcing (external variability).242 Exposure Unit \u2013 Represents the system considered to be at risk, and may be defined in terms of geographical extent, location and distribution of a variety population of receptors at risk.243 235 (IPCC 2007, 869) 236 (IPCC 2007, 869) 237 (IPCC 2007, 869) 238 (IPCC 2007, 869) 239 (IPCC 2007, 869) 240 (IPCC 2007, 871) 241 (IPCC 2007, 876) 242 (IPCC 2007, 872) 243 (UKCIP 2010) 59 Greenhouse", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a8ea9055-28b4-42bc-9121-48ee2c16c40d": {"__data__": {"id_": "a8ea9055-28b4-42bc-9121-48ee2c16c40d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "926dfca6fd3667c1d89e7a9b5a315a7f4b1d7333dd4f722a07917f1e36ca06e2"}, "3": {"node_id": "b087796f-a572-42ea-b46e-46fc387b4b40", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9419f34855642683b5fb630aa62d66be59b1cfe40a791931a222a8d2d343502d"}}, "hash": "e53f9ac158fb3095f34cae7d78e490b46a0106c648181f705383314713cac11b", "text": "Gas \u2013 Those gaseous constituents of the atmosphere, both natural and anthropogenic, that absorb and emit radiation at specific wavelengths within the spectrum of infrared radiation emitted by the Earth\u2019s surface, atmosphere, and clouds. Maladaptation \u2013 An action or process that increases vulnerability to climate change-related hazards. Maladaptive actions and processes often include planned development policies and measures that deliver short-term gains or economic benefits but lead to exacerbated vulnerability in the medium to long-term.244 Mega-City \u2013 There are varying definitions for a \u201cmega-city\u201d, UN-Habitat defines it as a city with a population of over 20 million people245 Others, define it as a metropolitan/urban area with a population in excess of 8246, or 10 million people.247 For this report, we are using the second figure of 10 million as the basis for defining a mega-city. Mitigation \u2013 An anthropogenic intervention to reduce the anthropogenic forcing of the climate system; it includes strategies to reduce greenhouse gas sources and emissions and enhancing greenhouse gas sinks.248 Resilience \u2013 The ability of a social or ecological system to absorb disturbances while retaining the same basic structure and ways of functioning, the capacity for self-organisation, and the capacity to adapt to stress and change.249 Sensitivity \u2013 The degree to which a system is affected, either adversely or beneficially, by climate variability or change. The effect may be direct or indirect.250 Slums \u2013 UN-HABITAT defines a slum as a settlement in an urban area in which more than half of the inhabitants live in inadequate housing and lack basic services. Further detail outlines a slum household as one where a group of individuals live under the same roof in an urban area who lack one or more of the following: 1. Durable housing of a permanent nature that protects against extreme climate conditions, and is built in a non-hazardous area. 2. Sufficient living space, which means not more than three people sharing the same room. 3. Easy access to safe water in sufficient amounts at an affordable price. 4. Access to adequate sanitation in the form of a private or public toilet shared by a reasonable number of people. 5. Security of tenure that prevents forced evictions.251 Subsidence \u2013 The sudden sinking or gradual downward settling of the Earth\u2019s surface with little or no horizontal motion.252 In the case of subsidence in cities, the term relates to the gradual \u201csinking\u201d of cities\u2019 infrastructure, which can be caused by withdrawal of ground water (both within and outside the boundaries of the city), the weight of development, and sea level rise altering water table levels. 244 (UNDP 2010) 245 (UN-HABITAT 2008) 246 (Davis 2004, 6) 247 (Sanchez-Rodriquez, et al. 2005, 12), (OECD 2010, 39) 248 (IPCC 2007, 878) 249 (IPCC 2007, 880) 250 (IPCC 2007, 881) 251 (UN-HABITAT 2006, 21) 252 (IPCC 2001, 386) 60 Urban/City \u2013 There is no agreed upon definition. The OECD notes they are often based on administrative areas defined by particular countries, but also where there is a density of greater than 150 inhabitants per sq km.253 Vulnerability \u2013 The degree to which a system is susceptible to, and unable to cope with, adverse affects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes. Vulnerability is a function of the character, magnitude, and rate of climate change and variation to which a system is exposed, its sensitivity and its adaptive capacity.254 253 (OECD 2010, 40) 254 (IPCC 2007, 883) 61 APPENDIX 1: CITIES AND POPULATION RANKING Global City/Agglomeration Population and Growth Rates City (English name) Country Population* Est.

Nunn For more than 25 years, Patrick Nunn worked at the University of the South Pacific and is currently at the University of New England. He has authored more than 200 publications including five books. In 2003 he was awarded the Gregory Medal of the Pacific Science Association and in 2007 shared the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to the IPCC. Email: pnunn3@une.edu.au ii Abstract Since being first settled by humans more than 3000 years ago, the Pacific Islands region has experienced innumerable changes in climate that have affected livelihoods, something that underlines the sensitivity of such comparatively small and resource-constrained landmasses to extraneous change but also helps explain why their inhabitants developed resilience strategies that remain important today. During the past 100 years, the region has been affected by increased temperatures and sea- level rise, together with other climate-linked changes including variability in ENSO periodicity and tropical-cyclone frequency. Owing to the increasing pace of globalisation in the region during the same period, together with growing populations and demands on island resources, it is difficult to isolate changes ascribable to climate change; some of the clearest of these are the increases in coral bleaching, incidences of coastal flooding and shoreline erosion. Despite knowledge about the causes and effects of climate-related environmental (and related) changes in the region, supported by considerable financial aid and other external assistance, the awareness of most Pacific people about climate change and the extent of community buy-in to appropriate adaptation agendas have been negligible. Many governments have been unable to effectively disseminate awareness about climate-change stressors and adaptive solutions; most community-level decision-makers are unable to make informed decisions about long-term adaptation to observed changes. Warming and sea-level rise are both expected to accelerate within the next 100 years or so, causing profound changes to environments, societies and development aspirations within the region. Re-location of people from vulnerable to less-vulnerable locations within the region is unavoidable and should be planned for sooner rather than later. International partners of Pacific Island nations should become more aware of the pathways for embedding effective adaptation in the region. Regional agencies and governments should challenge and re-define their roles in promoting and disseminating climate-change adaptation strategies within the region. Awareness-raising should focus on persons of influence in Pacific Island communities to allow them to make informed and sustainable decisions about the environments they occupy.

During their more than 3000-year occupation of these islands, people have developed an understanding of their natural environments, their production potential and their vulnerabilities, and the variations in these through time as forced by climate change. Within the past 150 years or so, globalization (through periods of both colonization and independence) has reconfigured human interactions with natural environments on many islands, rendering many of these less sustainable than in the past. In addition, within recent decades, Pacific Island countries have become part of the global community, now focused on development and economic growth, dependent on trade with other countries, and aid from these for most initiatives associated with improving environmental sustainability. Over the past 100 years, temperature has exhibited a net rise within the Pacific Islands region of about 0.6\u00b0C, as a result of which sea level has risen about 17 cm causing widespread coastal flooding and shoreline erosion. There has also been a measurable drop in sea-surface pH (more acid), which is implicated in coral-reef degradation, and a general increase in both the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones which has brought proportionately more destruction by wind and storm surge to an increasingly larger part of the region. Since the 1970s, ENSO has become stronger and more regular, currently occurring every 3-5 years and generally associated with a drought in the western tropical island groups. Within the past 10- 15 years, there have been accelerations in the rates of both temperature rise and sea-level rise. Responses to these changes have been generally inadequate, not least because of problems associated with recognizing them as regional (rather than local) and a product of climate change (rather than climate variability). Much international assistance to the region has failed to either increase awareness or produce appropriate and sustainable adaptation. Regional agencies represent national interests but have proved largely reactive not proactive in setting agendas for environmental sustainability. While generally adhering to international preoccupations around climate change, national governments in the Pacific region have generally failed to engage their populations in adaptation strategies. Most communities in the region remain largely unaware of climate-change challenges although many are actively responding to its manifestations. While it is desirable to drive adaptation to climate change at the community level, there are barriers to this associated with culture (particularly the perception of climate change as a foreign preoccupation) and belief systems (role of Divine providence in environmental futures) that lead to widespread denial of long-term climate- change projections. For the next 100 years, temperatures are expected to rise 1.4-3.7\u00b0C in the Pacific Islands region, which is thought likely to cause sea level to rise 120-200 cm by the year 2100. Warming is likely to have impacts on a range of livelihood factors, from food security to disease, while a sea-level rise of this magnitude will result in major changes to the habitability of Pacific Island coasts, where most people live today in this region. Coral-reef degradation will result from increased incidences of bleaching as well as ocean acidification. 2 The present high frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones will continue into the foreseeable future, as will the current ENSO periodicity. It is likely that food security in the Pacific region will be challenged from many directions by climate change over the next few decades. The probable loss of food productivity from nearshore marine ecosystems is perhaps of greatest concern. The aspirations of many Pacific Island countries to economic development are also likely to be stymied by climate change, particularly as the costs arising from changed geography (from sea-level rise) are absorbed. Over the next few decades, it seems unavoidable that large numbers of people will be displaced from their present homes and livelihood bases by sea-level rise and forced to re- locate these in less vulnerable locations elsewhere. It is argued that the key to reducing the impacts of such changes is effective communication of scientific agendas and appropriate adaptation options to a range of stakeholders. Recommendations are as follows. Recommendation 1: It is recommended that international partners of Pacific Island nations make far greater efforts to ensure the effectiveness of their assistance for climate-change adaptation. Recommendation 2: Regional agencies and governments should realistically examine the effectiveness of their present aspirations around climate-change adaptation, and re-define their", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c466ecc-6440-4304-a921-92a3536b1ef4": {"__data__": {"id_": "8c466ecc-6440-4304-a921-92a3536b1ef4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2bd7adf7e60d63df78a5d4220985d0076563b3716fa433d01a8f9c17e077792b"}}, "hash": "2bd7adf7e60d63df78a5d4220985d0076563b3716fa433d01a8f9c17e077792b", "text": "roles accordingly. Recommendation 3: Persons of influence in Pacific Island communities should be empowered to make informed and sustainable decisions about the environments they occupy. 1 Preamble Located in the world\u2019s largest ocean, which covers almost one third of the Earth\u2019s surface, the Pacific Islands comprise only a comparatively small land area. While this is indisputable when formally measured, it is worth noting at the outset that in most Pacific Islander traditions, the land is subordinate to the ocean in terms of its reputation as a sustainer of lives; many such traditions characterize the Pacific as \u201ca sea of islands\u201d (Hau\u2019ofa, 1993) rather than an ocean dotted with islands as it is viewed through most non-Pacific eyes (Ward, 1989). People began to occupy Pacific Islands more than 3000 years ago, crossing open ocean distances of more than 1000 km at a time when people elsewhere in the world rarely sailed more than 10 km offshore. This remarkable fact underlines the point that the Pacific Ocean has long been regarded by the people of its islands as friendly: as a provider, a sustainer, a constant in the development of their cultures. It could be that the point at which this view began to be undermined was at the first meeting about climate change in the Pacific Islands ever held; this was in 1988, at Majuro in the Marshall Islands, and it was opened by the President, Amata Kabua, who said \u201cIt is truly frightening to think that our ocean will turn against us. We have been sustained by the ocean for two millennia. It has been bountiful and continues to yield to us its bounty. We have learned that this harmony may be interrupted by the action of nations very distant from our shores. I hope that the appeal of the peoples of the Pacific can help convince the industrialized nations to discontinue their profligate contamination of the atmosphere.\u201d Since that time, the degree to which Pacific people, encouraged by global climate-change rhetoric, have turned against \u201ctheir\u201d ocean has been remarkable in turn. As Tamari\u2019i Tutangata, the Director of SPREP1 in 2000, mused \u201cAs a ten-year-old, I used to look at the sea with awe, at the seemingly endless supply of fish that I could harvest \u2026 now when I look at it, I wonder how far into the new millennium we will be before it overwhelms our coasts. What is there to celebrate about a new millennium if the northern group of the Cook Islands, or the many islands of Kiribati, Tokelau, Tuvalu, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands are about to disappear beneath the ocean?\u201d In today\u2019s Pacific Islands, the ocean is commonly an enemy, an aggressor threatening to attack the land, a false friend delinquent in providing the same degree of sustenance it provided in the past to the increasing numbers of people living along its borders. Yet as the traditional view has become dislodged, so a new era of realism, particularly amongst younger Pacific Islanders, has been born. Today the Pacific Islands and Ocean are discussed as objects of management, their drivers modelled, their processes simulated, their states projected from the present into the past and into the future. 1 Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme 2 It is in the context of this changed Pacific world that this report is presented. Climate change poses a formidable set of fundamental challenges to life in the Pacific Islands but, like most such challenges, they could be managed so that their impacts are minimal. Such management is commonly known as adaptation and for this to be effective, it is necessary for all people living in the islands (or having their interests at heart) to subscribe to and sustain effective adaptation strategies. Twenty years ago in the Pacific Islands region, as elsewhere, there was much despair around what kinds of adaptation to climate change would be effective and could be sustained. Today there is less of this; scientists are mostly agreed on the solutions needed to sustain livelihoods in the Pacific Islands in the face of future climate-driven stresses but there is increasing despair that these solutions will be adopted and sustained because of a lack of understanding and support from national and subnational decisionmakers (Alley, 1999; Barnett and Adger, 2003; Turnbull, 2004; Nunn, 2009b). In addition, owing to its conspicuous vulnerability to future climate change, the Pacific Islands region has come to the forefront of the world stage. In many quarters, it is envisaged as being on the \u201cfront line\u201d of climate change, \u201cthe canary in the coalmine\u201d, with entire islands apparently being", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e33b0736-5109-4e0c-a6c9-4b243b4a2b34": {"__data__": {"id_": "e33b0736-5109-4e0c-a6c9-4b243b4a2b34", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "86040fcf2316511442709d9ee607bd2ff637956b33c449d889908657817e2ebb"}}, "hash": "86040fcf2316511442709d9ee607bd2ff637956b33c449d889908657817e2ebb", "text": "destined to \u201cdisappear\u201d or \u201csink\u201d within the next few decades. Such hyperbole masks the reality of the situation of many Pacific islands which, while not iconically vulnerable in the sense that the atoll islands of Tuvalu have become (Farbotko, 2010), have still to meet profound challenges. 1. Setting the Scene: The Pacific Islands This section establishes a baseline for understanding climate-change impacts on the Pacific Islands and their peoples. Section 1.1 discusses the nature of climate in the region, particularly how it has defined the resource base, as well as the nature of past (long-term) climate change and (shorter-period) climate variability. Projections for future climate change in the region are presented. Section 1.2 looks at the islands\u2019 human inhabitants. People have lived for more than 3000 years in the Pacific Islands, developing subsistence lifestyles that remained little changed until the 20th century when nascent globalization began to have an ever-increasing effect. Understanding human attitudes towards the natural environment and the forces that make it change are crucial to developing effective strategies for climate-change adaptation. So in this section are explored culture and cultural diversity, the persistence and loss of tradition, and land tenure. All Pacific Island nations are \u201cdeveloping\u201d, some of them among the \u201cleast developed\u201d. All have traditionally democratically-based systems of governance. Most have economies that have registered negative annual growth for the last few years, a few slightly positive. Few Pacific Island nations are on track to achieve any of their Millennium Development Goals (MDGs); most Pacific Island nations have Human Development Index (HDI) scores that have increased slightly in the past decade. Projections for future changes in population, economy and governance are presented. 3 Section 1.3 examines the sensitivity to climate change of the Pacific Islands and their main livelihood-linked exposure. It begins by examining the last millennium and explains how climate-driven environmental changes did impact traditional societies in the region, identifying those traits that continue to compound the vulnerability and resilience of modern societies in the region. Special attention is paid to the last 100 years or so in which societies in the Pacific Islands region have evolved rapidly, generally amplifying their vulnerability to extraneous change. A general account of the sensitivities of the islands and their inhabitants to future climate change is presented. Section 1.4 focuses on the inherent resilience of natural and human systems in the Pacific Islands region. In the latter context, it is important to understand the cultural resilience of societies in the region, as well as the effects of external assistance (ODA) to their capacity to develop and sustain effective strategies for climate-change adaptation. 1.1 Climate change and climate variability in the Pacific Islands region When climate change is considered for the Pacific over tens of thousands of years, even longer, it is clear that the region\u2019s climate has varied significantly. During the coldest part of the last ice age (20,000 years ago), temperatures in the tropical parts of the Pacific may have been 3-4\u00b0C cooler than today; coral reefs were consequently less extensive and less diverse. Beyond the Pacific tropics, the cooling was generally greater. In addition to this cooling, sea level at this time was around 120 metres lower than today, which led to a strikingly different geography in many parts (Figure 1.1). Large islands existed where only (groups of) smaller islands exist today, something that would in turn have affected climate and ocean circulation. 4 Figure 1.1. Contrast in the geography of the Southwest Pacific Islands region during the past 20,000 years Source: Nunn, 2009a. Note: Map (a) shows the southwest Pacific region as it is today, Map (b) the way it appeared 20,000 years ago during the coldest part of the last ice age when sea level was 120 m lower. The difference is striking. Not only were there more islands 20,000 years ago, but those that exist today were larger and closer together. Some large islands like the Bellona Platform have disappeared altogether. The present climate of the Pacific Islands region was in place about 4000 years ago and, while comparatively minor changes have been registered since that time, the region\u2019s climatic configuration has remained essentially unchanged since. Each island in the Pacific Islands region is so small that maritime influences overwhelm its climate and have largely done so since those islands first emerged above the ocean surface. The general pattern of Pacific Basin climate is most easily understood by the presence of two gyres (large-scale systems of air and surface-water circulation). Movement in the South Pacific gyre is anticlockwise, with air and surface water being driven from west to east in the Southern", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eeb2bdaf-c5c2-4b9e-b1a9-40f3f75557a9": {"__data__": {"id_": "eeb2bdaf-c5c2-4b9e-b1a9-40f3f75557a9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e4e6b84d1543cdeabb2ea4fa46acb4ebe52f2ad29764d3ea9bdbf04431b3981a"}}, "hash": "e4e6b84d1543cdeabb2ea4fa46acb4ebe52f2ad29764d3ea9bdbf04431b3981a", "text": "Ocean, northwards off the west coast of South America, east to west across the tropical South Pacific, and then south to north off eastern Australia. Key elements in this gyre are the strong, generally stationary, high-pressure centre (anticyclone) in the Southeast Pacific (around Easter Island), and the seasonally-variable South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) that develops in the Southwest Pacific. 5 This convergence zone, where two air masses converge, is a zone of atmospheric instability, as is the longer Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) which extends across the equatorial Pacific between the two gyres. The seasonal movements of the ITCZ, where the two tradewind belts converge, are important in bringing rain to many islands in this part of the Pacific that might not otherwise receive sufficient rainfall to be habitable. Movement in the North Pacific gyre is clockwise, with air and surface water moving from east to west across the tropical North Pacific, north off the coast of East Asia and Japan, west to east in the northernmost Pacific, and south off the west coast of North America. The principal variations to this simple picture are caused by short-term climate variability, the understanding of which has improved substantially in the past few decades. The main causes of variability are inter-annual changes, the best-known of which is the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) which involves a breakdown of the gyres, especially in their low-latitude parts, resulting in drought and or unusually-high rainfall on different island groups, as well as sea-level changes that may be sustained for several weeks. There are other oscillations such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation that are less readily detectable than ENSO yet which have the potential to amplify or dampen its effects. The principal short-term climate phenomena to affect the tropical Pacific are tropical cyclones2; these are usually confined to the western tropical Pacific but become more frequent and develop beyond this region during ENSO- negative (El Ni\u00f1o) events. Tropical cyclones have the potential to severely impact livelihoods on Pacific Islands. Owing to the dominance of maritime influences in the Pacific Islands, most experience little seasonal variation in climate. The main cause of variation on many is the increased cyclonic rainfall during the high-sun season; on many equatorial islands, rainfall is seasonal because of the movements of the ITCZ. The widespread lack of annual climatic variation means that food-production systems in the Pacific Islands have not been as complex as in subsistence societies elsewhere. For while there have been periods of less (and periods of plenty), most island societies in the past 200 years or so have become accustomed to living in a period of adequacy. This view has been bolstered by the rich marine-food supplies that can be obtained from the coral reefs that surround many islands in the tropical Pacific. As noted above, marine foods have been a part of islander diets ever since people first ventured into this island world. Since that time, coral reefs (and their associated lagoons) have generally remained viable and productive ecosystems, although many are currently showing signs of stress associated with recent sea-surface warming. The past 100 years in the Pacific has seen a gradual rise in temperatures of about the same magnitude as elsewhere in the world. This warming has in turn driven (steric) sea-level rise. Most parts of the tropical Pacific experienced temperature rise of 0.6\u00b0C and sea-level rise of 2 Tropical cyclones are known elsewhere in the world as hurricanes or typhoons. 6 15 cm during the 20th century (Hay et al., 2003; Church et al., 2006). Both rates have accelerated within the past 10-15 years. If the relationship between climate change and people in the Pacific has been generally a sustainable one for the past 3000 years or so, the same cannot be said for the next 100 years or so. This is not solely a result of the likely rate of future climate change but also the heightened degree to which people in this region have become vulnerable to climate change. Over the past 100 years, most people in this region have altered their lifestyles, changing from traditional interactions with their environments (that were generally more sustainable by virtue of being more adaptable) to interactions that are less sustainable and more dependent on outside, even globalized, forces. One of the most widely-discussed examples of this comes from the deterioration of traditional food systems which has increased malnutrition and food dependency in the Pacific Islands (Thaman, 1982; Murray, 2001). Another good example has been the accelerated erosion of many Pacific Island beaches associated with both their mining (for aggregate) and the removal of associated vegetation,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "483258dd-04d8-4d12-b65c-27f7328eaf03": {"__data__": {"id_": "483258dd-04d8-4d12-b65c-27f7328eaf03", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0a6fda8869a50f440d81c34834d387af8dae18239f23f7a556fb594fe9722c8b"}}, "hash": "0a6fda8869a50f440d81c34834d387af8dae18239f23f7a556fb594fe9722c8b", "text": "especially mangrove forests (Wong, 2003; Thaman, 2002). A final example would be the myriad impacts of the growing importance of the cash economy in once almost wholly subsistence societies, something that had particularly visible impacts in the agricultural, forestry, mining and tourism sectors during the past 100 years (Murray, 2001; Connell, 2010). While there are no specific projections for the Pacific Islands region available for the next 100 years, it is clear that temperatures are likely to rise here (as elsewhere) by as much as 4\u00b0C by the year 2100 (2090-2099 relative to 1980-1999 \u2013 see section 2.1.a). This is expected to cause a sea-level rise of more than one metre, perhaps around two metres, above present levels by the year 2100. What is very important to note is that, whatever global action is taken now to mitigate the causes of this climate change, the effects of this are unlikely to have any significant impact on temperature rise and sea-level rise to AD 2100 (Overpeck and Weiss, 2009) and probably well beyond this time. How future warming will affect short-term climate variability is uncertain, although it seems likely that tropical-cyclone intensity will increase in the region in the future; recent modelling results suggest that there will be intensity increases of 2-11% by the year 2100 (Knutson et al., 2010). The same study suggests that there will be a decrease in the frequency of tropical cyclones by 6-34% within the same period although there will be \u2018substantial increases\u2019 in the frequency of the most intense tropical cyclones. There is little doubt that warmer sea- surface temperatures will increasingly expand the area of the low-latitude Pacific within which tropical cyclones form as the present century progresses. Some studies suggest that ENSO-negative (El Ni\u00f1o) events will become stronger in a warmer world. These projections pose a range of challenges for livelihoods in the Pacific Islands. But it is important not to regard these challenges in isolation. Climate change may not be the greatest threat to traditional lifestyles on some islands, where there is rapid population growth, deforestation, or other kinds of environmental degradation. 7 1.2 Peoples of the Pacific Islands: tradition and change The earliest people to settle in the Pacific Islands entered the region from its western tropical rim, from the islands off the coast of New Guinea. From there about 1350 BC, they voyaged eastwards, occupying each of the main island groups as far as Samoa and Tonga by 950 BC. There was probably a contemporaneous migration from the Philippines to the islands of Micronesia although this is less well documented. Once established in these islands, people gradually settled the remainder of the Pacific Islands, occupying all the main groups before the Pacific was known to people in Europe. There is irrefutable evidence that the ancestors of the modern Pacific Islanders crossed the entire ocean from west to east, reaching the west coast of the Americas in perhaps three places before 1513 when Balboa became the first European to sight the Pacific Ocean. It has been argued that favourable climates facilitated the west to east (against the wind) exploration of the Pacific by the first islanders (Anderson et al., 2006). It has also been averred that sea-level fall during the period of initial island settlement created the coastal environments that could sustain the pioneer settlers (Nunn, 1994; Dickinson, 2003). Specifically, it is clear that most Pacific Island groups were not permanently settled by people until the time at which island coastlines had emerged sufficiently for coastal plains to develop and fringing coral reefs \u2013 critical as a food resource \u2013 to begin growing at low-tide level. Given that the earliest Pacific islanders had had to cross such large ocean distances, it is little surprise that there are not only ancient traditions of seafaring and navigation but also that marine resources played such a major role in islander subsistence. Early Pacific people were clearly adept at obtaining food from the sea. Many classifications of Pacific people talk of Melanesians, Micronesians and Polynesians but these are properly references to the inhabitants of geographical sub-regions of this vast ocean and not culturally distinct groups of people. That said, there is livelihood diversity in the region that is attributable to the nature of the islands that particular groups settled. Perhaps the starkest example of environmentally-determined livelihood diversity is between the people of large high islands and those of smaller lower islands (atolls). The former generally have a far greater range of wild foods available to them, a far greater diversity of food production potential. The latter have generally to depend on seafood and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a8d1a78b-91e2-40da-bb86-0d0e28ee188a": {"__data__": {"id_": "a8d1a78b-91e2-40da-bb86-0d0e28ee188a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1b87b8e881b0b10c9882ee74bab2bf25be06ef97fd22ea833f09778d99d1e84e"}, "3": {"node_id": "8f74bc06-a358-4a7a-94f6-d9e618b4c6e1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d84088be65ea52b0980b21f3e80fc6d55a000a3e046de99d7434dd24350a056e"}}, "hash": "1c90f919e0470cff3dcf7009e6cb915daf478375b64241ea5c7772be265572e9", "text": "birds with agriculture being generally marginal and unreliable. The main reason for this is that atoll soils, having developed on a limestone bedrock base rarely rising more than one metre above mean sea level, are nutrient poor and thin. This helps explain why the terrestrial biodiversity of atolls is so comparatively impoverished (Thaman, 2008; Bridges and McClatchey, 2009) and why early experiments with agriculture were evidently far more challenging than on higher islands (Weisler, 1999, 2001). While the history of the Pacific Islands, particularly in the last millennium, demonstrates the development of polities and chiefdoms, there do not appear to have been any rigid land 8 divisions on particular islands for most of this time. It is this fact that made it comparatively easy for the first foreign settlers on these islands to own land; ownership was an alien concept so land was \u201csold\u201d by titular chiefs for far less than its monetary \u201cvalue\u201d. The other major impact of foreign settlement, mostly from the mid-19th century onwards in most island groups, was the massive depopulation as a result of introduced diseases to which most indigenes had no resistance. On some islands, 80-90% of the people are thought to have died, leaving empty whole settlements and huge tracts of once-utilized land. The first foreign settlers were thus encouraged by their impressions of empty (apparently uninhabited) islands to settle these and claim ownership of large tracts (Banner, 2007). All Pacific Island groups (except Tonga) were colonized by European powers during the 19th and 20th centuries, most becoming independent subsequently within the last 40 years. While a few benefits of colonization might be acknowledged (McNeill, 1999; Feyrer and Sacerdote, 2009), this was largely about exploiting the islands\u2019 natural resources, typically for plantation agriculture or mining, and the cheap labour represented by their inhabitants. Colonization not only resulted in quite fundamental landscape changes on the larger islands but also in changes to the people\u2019s way of life. Urban centres developed and have grown rapidly. Subsistence agriculture has become less important than cash cropping in many islands, especially in areas adjoining urban centres. As other forms of income generation have developed, particularly around tourism, mining, forestry and manufacturing, so people have become more aware of the monetary value of land. Once perceived as a provider for all who were in need, the land is now perceived as a personal (or communal) possession. The legacy of colonialism in most now-independent Pacific Island groups is a mix of private (individually-owned) and communal (group-owned) land, a situation that has gradually increased inequality. In some island nations, private land is so scarce (and so expensive) that few can afford to buy it; persons with no rights to communal land may therefore always have to lease land, which means that they have little interest in its sustainability. Another extreme is represented by Tonga where the vast majority of the land above the high-water mark is owned by the nobility; \u201ccommoners\u201d can hope only to be allotted land to farm or to live (Campbell, 2001; Halatuituia, 2006). The situation in most Pacific Island countries in which there is so little land privately-owned has been identified as a hindrance to development and to effective urban and rural planning (Connell and Lea, 2002; Crocombe, 1987, 2001). Most people in the Pacific Islands region live in rural areas, almost all along island coasts where there is an abundance of protein-rich marine food and fertile lowlands suitable for agriculture (FAO, 2008). Urbanization is increasing rapidly with a few countries having more than 40% of their population in urban areas. Most rural dwellers routinely subsist \u2013 at least in part \u2013 from foods (either wild or cultivated) obtained from their surrounding environment (Table 1.1). That said, \u201cbasic staples such as rice and wheat for flour are key substitutes of traditional diets that are now part and parcel of a Pacific Islander\u2019s daily diet\u201d (FAO, 2007: 9). 9 Table 1.1.

While there are indubitably problems associated with national governance, few governments in the region over the past half-century have been ruinously corrupt (Hassall, 2008). Most problems of governance are associated with the comparative smallness of the land areas and populations of some countries, particularly when matched with the total (land and sea) area they occupy. For example, countries like Kiribati have a population of some 108,000 persons spread across 21 islands (total land area of 811 km2 including 12 uninhabited islands) within a total ocean area (Exclusive Economic Zone) of 3.55 million km2. In such situations, it is very difficult for governments to service all parts of the country as they do the centre (Duncan, 2008). One weakness of all national governments in the Pacific Islands region is their emphasis on top-down centralized governance, something inherited from colonial systems (Hook, 2009). Not only does the geography of many countries, particularly the archipelagic ones, militate against the effectiveness of such a system of governance, but also the lack of sufficient funds to reach out to all their citizens as they aspire (Hassall and Kennedy, 2008). This situation means that many inhabitants of a country, sometimes even the great majority, feel little influence of central government (Duncan, 2008). While all Pacific Island governments aspire to growing their economies, there are obvious constraints to doing so. The foremost of these is that most island nations are so far from (continental) markets that anything they produce for export is almost certain to be too expensive to sell there unless favourable trade agreements are put in place.

Measures of poverty for many islanders are problematic because they often fail to acknowledge that a large majority of people are (at least in part) outside the cash economy yet still manage to live well and remain healthy. Human development indices for Pacific 11 Island countries are likewise questionable although they provide a crude measure of relative prosperity and development (Table 1.3) Table 1.3. Human development indicators for Pacific Island countries. Source: Prasad, 2008 This table ranks the countries of the Pacific Islands region according to their 2006 Human Development Index. The top performers (Cook Islands, Palau, Niue, Samoa) all have close links with metropolitan countries (New Zealand in particular) which allow their nationals unrestricted access that results in large amounts sent back to the home country in the form of remittances. Of the truly independent countries, Fiji is probably the highest ranked, its quality of life due largely to a comparatively healthy and diverse economy and an abundance of land for food production. It is noteworthy that the three bottom performers are all countries where malaria is widespread. Turning now to the future, it is clear that many Pacific Island countries have challenges that are not only more immediate than those associated with climate change but also potentially more damaging to the long-term development plans of these countries; these include population growth, loss of natural resources and ecosystem services owing to exhaustion or unsustainable exploitation, and limited economic growth owing to the distance to markets. None of these challenges can be considered in isolation from that posed by future climate change; indeed this will only exacerbate most such challenges by reducing livelihood opportunities and environmental productivity in many parts of the region. Population growth is one of the most widespread concerns, especially in those countries where \u2013 generally because of barriers to accessing metropolitan countries \u2013 there is comparatively little out-migration to balance high birth rates. 21st-century populations and population projections are shown in Table 1.4.

While there are clearly innumerable subtleties hidden within these data, it is worth noting that those countries with large rural populations and little access to metropolitan countries for employment are those that have the highest population growth rates. The best example is Solomon Islands where population is expected to double within a few decades. Countries with generally better-educated populations, especially those where there is widespread buy-in to population control measures, exhibit slower growth rates; Fiji is the best example. Countries where births are to some extent compensated by out-of-country migration show, as expected, low growth rates; examples include the Cook Islands, Niue and Samoa. Loss of natural resources and ecosystem services is becoming more widespread throughout the Pacific Islands region as these are traded for short-term profit. Good examples come from Solomon Islands where whole islands have been effectively stripped of their forest cover for export with insufficient regard for the continuing needs of the island people (Hviding and Bayliss-Smith, 2000). As island nations increasingly see opportunities for such transactions, it is likely that they will continue and that the associated, often irreversible, environmental degradation will become more widespread. While some economists are cautiously optimistic about some island economies, most are projected to continue to shrink or \u2013 at best \u2013 exhibit only sluggish growth over the next decade or so (Prasad, 2008).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "816fe502-0846-473d-a3c9-c9d934e222ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "816fe502-0846-473d-a3c9-c9d934e222ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b0e6776d863c8fdbc744555a6b494227d11843d7e113af8c7403fec038109868"}, "2": {"node_id": "ca567734-d68e-4153-b650-5bc78dcf2f6a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ec4b515b9e05da73e07019009ec34c2be757ef8b73d6456f5f1fc7a7c2e19460"}}, "hash": "18af46e1ebe686c511051d687e4e09861595a1dc722ec2b414d4fd70b4b9b5ba", "text": "The basic problem is neither the will to produce nor the availability of appropriate workers, but the cost of transporting products for sale to markets.

Tourism is the only economic sector in the Pacific Islands for which there is a consensus around potential expansion and revenue generation (Narayan et al., 2010) although often as much as 90% of the profits from island tourism ventures goes offshore (Singh, 2008). There are several regional groupings of Pacific Island nations at present, the largest and longest-lasting being the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) that is essentially the same as the Pacific Small-Island Developing States (Pacific SIDS) bloc at the United Nations. A more recent grouping is the Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG) that is pondering an economic role as well as a political one. While it is difficult to predict trends in future governance in the Pacific Islands region, there is the possibility of increased federation \u2013 perhaps even the emergence of a Pacific Islands Union (akin to the European Union). The first step in this direction might be the adoption of a single currency in the region (Jayaraman, 2007). The problem in the recent past of governments being unable to govern effectively or even being overthrown is expected to continue in the future, particularly as the populace becomes more aware and national governance becomes more complex, and even as problems associated with daily subsistence become ever more acute. It is likely that there will be an increased need for outside intervention in the governance of Pacific Island countries, intervention in terms of both peacekeepers (like the RAMSI mission in Solomon Islands) and finance to keep island economies afloat (as in the case of Nauru, the first failed Pacific state \u2013 Connell, 2006b). Most countries in the region could not remain viable in the sense of continuing to provide basic services to those of its population that enjoy them currently without routine injections of external funding (Gani, 2009).

Sensitivity of the Pacific Islands region to climate change The Pacific Islands are different from most other parts of the world when their sensitivity to climate change is considered. The most obvious expression of this is that islands by definition have much longer coastlines (relative to total land area) than larger landmasses. Thus, in terms of calculating likely or actual impacts of sea-level rise or increased storm- surge incidence on particular countries, clearly those with the longest coastline-to-land-area ratios will be more affected than others with shorter coastline-to-land-area ratios (like most continental countries). Within the community of islands, smaller islands have longer coastlines (relative to total land area) than larger islands. The measure of this is the insularity index (Nunn and Kumar, 2006) which is shown for selected Pacific Island nations (and others for comparison) in Table 1.7. Table 1.7. Characteristics of coasts in the Asia-Pacific region Source: NationMaster n.d. Pacific Island nations are listed in this table by their Insularity Index, so that Tokelau \u2013 a group of three atoll islands with long sinuous coasts and small land areas \u2013 comes out on top. Countries with larger islands like Papua New Guinea and Fiji understandably come out at the bottom of this table. The Insularity Index is a crude proxy for exposure to coastal impacts like sea-level rise. It does not of course allow resilience factors like coastal type (hard rock versus soft rock), vegetation and protection by mangroves and offshore coral reefs to be Tokelau 10 101 1010 142 1058 Federated States of Micronesia 702 6112 871 154 - Palau 458 1519 332 43 - Northern Marianas Islands 477 1482 311 168 - Marshall Islands 181.3 370.4 204 311 2038 Nauru 21 30 143 599 4773 Kiribati 811 1143 141 122 802 Tuvalu 26 24 92 435 1079 French Polynesia 3,660 2525 69 72 4959 Tonga 718 419 58 151 2182 Cook Islands 240 120 50 88 4998 Wallis and Futuna 274 129 47 57 1907 Niue 260 64 25 8 3543 Vanuatu 12,200 2528 21 16 2823 Solomon Islands 27,540 5313 19 18 1571 Samoa 2,934 403 14 61 5612 New Caledonia 18,575 2254 12 11 14,231 Fiji 18,270 1129 6 48 5551 Papua New Guinea 452,860 5152 1 12 2051 Group/Nation Land area (km2) Coastline length (km) Insularity index (coastline length/land area) x 100 Population density (persons per km2) GDP per capita (US$) 16 factored in. It is nevertheless useful for assessing relative vulnerability to future climate change in this island world. In the context of the Pacific Islands, environmental sensitivity to climate change is best separated from human (or societal) sensitivity. Environmental sensitivity includes not only the various components of the physical environment (such as land, soil, water, oceans) but also variables such as ground-surface temperature, sea-surface temperature, sea level, and precipitation. Human sensitivity is centred on subsistence, specifically a sufficient supply of the food resources needed to sustain a particular number of people per unit area. But under the umbrella of human sensitivity, there also needs to be acknowledgement of cultural sensitivity as well as resilience; the ability of a group of people to adapt to a particular change is a measure of their resilience.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "39352059-fd1b-4120-aea5-64c1c226dcd7": {"__data__": {"id_": "39352059-fd1b-4120-aea5-64c1c226dcd7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c9c457df49486a2f3bf1d29238ae938a11bcf8dce061c15c839c96dacf36f59b"}, "2": {"node_id": "5e906fb8-fa3d-49b6-bb14-2d8b4811f8be", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1e9924e2843b1945b3af3d46af29aeb6ef07c4c2e188a96ab2bf685e99107919"}}, "hash": "886ea7526dfa1351a2284b6b369d213036aba5af216b57edb09a245b46a1ea6b", "text": "Sufficient is now known about the Pacific Islands during the last millennium to be able to understand how their environments and societies responded to climate change (Nunn, 2007a).

Some examples of environmental sensitivity during the last millennium in the Pacific Islands occurred during the AD 1300 Event when rapid cooling forced a rapid sea-level fall (~60-80 cm) which transformed coastal environments. Embayments (bays) that had existed during the MWP typically became brackish coastal wetlands during the LIA; good examples come from Tikopia Island in Solomon Islands and Kosrae in Micronesia (Nunn, 2007a). As a result of this physical consequence, the environment exhibited several sensitivities. These included the loss of coral-reef bioproductivity associated with exposure (caused by sea-level fall) of the uppermost parts of reefs: the associated reduction in aeration and water circulation within reef-bounded coastal lagoons: and the drop in coastal water tables linked directly to the sea-level fall. All these environmental sensitivities are believed to have had profound consequences for coastal dwellers throughout the tropical Pacific Islands and are implicated in the subsequent widespread abandonment of coastal settlements for others in more readily defensible locations (Nunn et al., 2007; Nunn, 2012; Robb and Nunn, 2012). Human sensitivity during the last millennium was both directly climate-driven and driven through environmental proxies (such as coastal change). During the MWP, the periodicity of ENSO was comparatively low so that seasonal variations in weather were generally predictable year after year; this allowed human societies in the Pacific Islands to flourish and it is perhaps no coincidence that many developed increased complexity during the MWP, particularly in terms of the development of hierarchies and complex polities manifested by the development of larger-than-previous settlements and chiefdoms in many places (Nunn, 2007; Nunn et al., 2007). This situation changed radically and comparatively abruptly during the AD 1300 Event when cooling and increased storminess are likely to have affected tropical Pacific Islands. Yet the most important change at this time was the sea-level fall which, by exposing coral-reef surfaces and slowing lagoon circulation, reduced the amount of food 17 available to coastal dwellers in the Pacific Islands. The sustained nature of this change eventually led to a food crisis on many islands, resulting in conflict, and the abandonment of (exposed) coastal settlements in favour of those in more defensible locations, typically inland and upland or on unoccupied offshore islands. This situation continued for most of the LIA when temperatures were low and climate variability was higher than it had been during the MWP (Nunn, 2007a). As an illustration of climate-driven human sensitivity during the last millennium in the Pacific Islands, a general picture of settlement-pattern changes applicable to most island groups is shown in Figure 1.2. This shows that during the MWP, most settlements were coastal, becoming amalgamated as societal complexity increased. Following the AD 1300 Event and during the LIA, settlements were mostly inland or offshore, a geographical expression of human sensitivity to climate change. Figure 1.2. Changes in settlement pattern during the last 1200 years on many high Pacific Islands Source: Nunn, 2007a.. Note: Map A shows the situation at the start of the Medieval Warm Period, perhaps about AD 1000. Map B shows the situation at the end of the Medieval Warm Period, just prior to the AD 1300 Event about AD 1250. Map C shows the situation about AD 1500 during the Little Ice Age, after the end of the AD 1300 Event.. Since the LIA ended, temperatures and sea levels in the Pacific Islands region have been generally rising. While the net changes in temperature and sea level have been far less than is likely to have occurred during the AD 1300 Event (see above), these increases nevertheless demonstrated the sensitivity of both Pacific environments and societies (see Chapter 2 for more details). Examples of environmental sensitivities within this period of Recent Warming include increased coral-reef stress as a result of increased sea-surface temperatures, and accelerated erosion of sandy shorelines attributable to sea-level rise. For the foreseeable future (to AD 2100), environmental stresses are expected to increase in magnitude if temperatures and sea level rise as projected (Nicholls et al., 2011). For the tropical Pacific Islands, perhaps the least disputed environmental consequence of temperature 18 rise will be the impact on coral reefs. Corals are temperature-sensitive animals that often become bleached when sea-surface temperatures exceed 29-30\u00b0C for extended periods. It is predicted that most Pacific reefs will become largely devoid of corals by the year 2060 (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6534f189-270a-4ac5-a5f3-01e73f19cac1": {"__data__": {"id_": "6534f189-270a-4ac5-a5f3-01e73f19cac1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4ac4c6efaa7c219458a3f30529459a59a250a94f22eea74f91e833a4f828a874"}, "2": {"node_id": "b1d8655a-55f7-4ba7-a327-cde448add7f0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "56f7399de4699a112d4557855e9b5656c9413004a34c9bc11a0dc163551966cc"}}, "hash": "019e45d58f7c7a125067a1c89d8ad42f3da72b8d2d26776e526e53a561f483c8", "text": "The outcomes of this for coastal dwellers in the Pacific Islands who have traditionally (and today) depended routinely on coral-reef ecosystems for sustenance are immense and cry out for effective forward planning.

Most coral reefs comprise a living veneer of organisms (mostly corals) on top of a reefrock edifice that is built from the skeletal remains of dead corals and other calcareous organisms. Widespread and sustained coral death resulting from bleaching will not only lead to degradation of coral-reef structures but will also reduce the supply of (ground-up) coral sediment to nearby island beaches, encouraging their erosion. Yet it is the ecological consequences of widespread and sustained coral bleaching that are most worrying from a human standpoint, for once corals cease to live on reef surfaces these tend to become dominated by monospecific groups of algae (typically Halimeda in the tropical Pacific) which create ecosystems that are far less diverse and bioproductive for human purposes than corals (Coles, 2008). The implications are that when reefs become bleached for long periods of time, the types of food on which coastal-dwelling humans throughout the Pacific routinely depend on will disappear which will create food crises (Turner et al., 2007). Better-known examples of environmental stresses are the effects of sea-level rise on low- lying islands in the Pacific, especially those comprising (largely) the nations of Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Tokelau, and Tuvalu (Nunn, 2007b). Notwithstanding some signs of short- term resilience (Webb and Kench, 2010), it is likely that many of these will experience accelerated erosion of their coasts and some may be rendered uninhabitable by 2030 as a result of both the reduction in their land area and the shrinkage of the groundwater lens on which the populations of most such islands depend. The only adaptation option for some such people is to move to less-vulnerable off-island locations. When considering current human sensitivity to climate change, it is convenient to distinguish the effects of slow, year-by-year changes and those of short-lived extremes. The greatest and most visible effects on food production, economic development, and livelihoods in the Pacific Islands come from extreme events and, while supporting data are difficult to isolate, it is probable that increases in the frequency and intensity of droughts and tropical cyclones over the past few decades have had increasing impacts on these aspects of life in this region. Table 1.8 below shows disasters reported in the Pacific Islands from 1950-2004. It can be seen that tropical cyclones have by far the greatest impacts on people and livelihoods while other climate-related disasters have considerably smaller effects. 19 Table 1.8. Reported disasters in the Pacific, 1950-2004 excluding Papua New Guinea Source: Lal et al., 2009a. Yet these data disguise recent trends suggesting that flooding in particular has been increasing in frequency and impact over the past 20 years (Lal et al., 2009b; Nunn, 2009). Extreme events have serious, albeit generally short-lived, effects on food production, particularly in terrestrial environments. For example, during Tropical Cyclone Ami in 2003, Fiji lost over US$35 million in standing crops (Terry et al., 2004). The effects of recent climate change on other aspects of terrestrial (and nearshore) food production in the Pacific Islands are generally more difficult to assess, not least because increasing globalization has meant comparatively rapid dietary change, particularly a reliance on cheap imported foods rather than freely-available local foods that are difficult to obtain (in some places increasingly so as a result of climate change). The result of this has been a sharp rise in diet-related disease throughout this region (Popkin and Horton, 2001). Several changes have observed in the Pacific Islands in the nature of wild food production that are attributable to recent climate change. For example, in the Temotu Province of Solomon Islands, changes have been observed in the fruiting patterns of breadfruit, the preservation of which has been a key component of food security for these outer island people (Lal et al., 2009a). In Papua New Guinea, various wild varieties of coconuts, mango, betel nut and breadfruits have been observed as growing at increasingly higher altitudes over the past few decades (Allen and Bourke, 2008).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f57cdef-dd18-479f-b52a-739f2a7ad423": {"__data__": {"id_": "4f57cdef-dd18-479f-b52a-739f2a7ad423", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "43344f084e69348d0f10684cb43e0700670d2d50a74afb0f12c0b9f9a4d6a34d"}, "2": {"node_id": "f1228ce5-de3c-4878-97d7-05a806bbf6f9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "545e3363c474cf575c150bd9b01b683b4c557075814d8a8bdcfb57749149d926"}}, "hash": "1e08e2f4c471a17c0234fc676e639909b96e0cd0d25cded43967359babcac9c7", "text": "Windstorms (tropical cyclones and other storms) 157 1,380 2,496,808 5,903 Droughts 10 0 629,580 137 Floods 8 40 246,644 95 Earthquakes 17 53 22,254 331 Melanesia 110 1,130 2,115,332 1,655 Micronesia 26 123 260,662 3,074 Polynesia 71 494 1,041,012 1,797 Total Pacific Islands 207 1,747 3,417,006 6,526 Number Reported fatalities Population affected Reported losses (in 2004 US$ million) Others (incl. landslides, tsunami, volcanic eruptions, wildfires, epidemics) 15 274 21520+ 60 20 As might be expected, fish are central to Pacific Islander diets (Table 1.9).

Subsistence (or artisanal) fisheries in the Pacific Islands have, however, been affected by over- exploitation and the use of dynamiting or fish poison which produce short-term gains at the expense of long-term sustainability (Turner et al., 2007). This is in contrast to deep-ocean commercial fisheries, which have suffered from both rampant overexploitation by commercial fleets (often in collusion with island governments \u2013 Hanich and Tsamenyi, 2008) and climate change. It is considered that recent climate change has both contributed to a diminished stock of tuna, the principal deep-water fish caught, as well as a migration of the stock in the Pacific westward (Miller, 2007). Table 1.9. Current annual fish consumption in the Pacific Islands Source: Lal et al., 2009a A important additional source of stress on human systems in the Pacific Islands region is population growth (see Table 1.4) and urbanization. In most countries in the region where population is growing, there is also rapid urbanization (5-6% annually \u2013 Duncan, 2008) which is placing considerable strain both on governments to provide services and on existing infrastructure to accommodate increased traffic flows. While supportive data are generally lacking, it is possible that climate-change impacts on rural food-producing systems in the Pacific Islands have driven increasing numbers of people over the last two decades to move to urban centres.

A compelling set of data from Vanuatu is shown in Table 1.10 below. These data show a rise in water-borne and insect-borne diseases during periods of frequent tropical cyclones, suggesting a causal link that has implications for the future. Table 1.10. Incidence of water-borne and insect-borne diseases in Vanuatu (2001-2006) and the numbers of tropical cyclones affecting this country Source: Lal et al., 2009a. Note: Costs are in Vatu. These figures suggest a connection between disease and cyclone frequency, which has implications for the future. An important question to try and answer is \u201care certain groups of people in the Pacific Islands region more vulnerable to climate change than others?\u201d The answer at current levels of understanding has to be an equivocal \u201cNo\u201d yet this is largely because most people in the region are vulnerable to climate change, and all groups have the potential to have their livelihoods severely affected by future climate change. It is tempting to posit that Pacific Island people who occupy high islands or the interior parts of larger islands are less vulnerable to climate change. The effects of Tropical Cyclone Heta on the high island of Niue in 2004 illustrate that even such islands are not immune from such extreme climate events (Holland, 2008). People in island interiors whose subsistence depends only very marginally on marine foods might also be regarded as somewhat immune, yet most of their food is from rivers or grown on river floodplains which are also affected by extreme climate events (Nunn, 1998). Yet environment and livelihood are causes of uneven vulnerability to climate change. Perhaps the most vulnerable are people in urbanized atoll environments while those people least at risk are those occupying the interiors of high islands where there is greater livelihood diversity than in most situations. Clearly many of the current concerns around human sensitivity to recent climate change are also concerns for the future. Short-term impacts resulting from climate-related disasters, notably tropical cyclones, are likely to continue but it is probable that longer-term impacts resulting from slower climate change will become more visible and, most importantly from a response perspective, less contested.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1db24f0e-8ab1-47b7-b78d-91cdd1a39def": {"__data__": {"id_": "1db24f0e-8ab1-47b7-b78d-91cdd1a39def", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "02ed325c4d7580ccf2aafe03498ca8c392128d9d54fe64511392e14e65ad0554"}, "2": {"node_id": "ba8e0c36-22ae-45fb-b471-72738749365e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7b49e90b5ed2d0f7fe53a41c230df27799158b7441a0f3301335589bfa2e2035"}}, "hash": "1fa23afc2c67a35fb134e07fec682d65a6a81077b60e3aef1e590be5d50720e8", "text": "While there will be massive impacts from future climate change on a range of food- production systems and economic drivers, there will also be effects on disease that are 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 Number of tropical cyclones 2.00 1.00 4.00 1.00 1.00 Total malaria cases 21,494.00 35,217.00 43,414.00 41,903.00 33,277.00 26,111.00 Dengue fever cases 20.00 15.00 122.00 21.00 2.00 7.00 Water-borne diseases", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "13be8fed-e95d-4ac8-a16d-2f550eec6877": {"__data__": {"id_": "13be8fed-e95d-4ac8-a16d-2f550eec6877", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "88e3a6c9f9335dbe0eaf049b2f5650b0de36d55e2f533f4e63ae31d906b6befc"}, "3": {"node_id": "f5526238-2829-496d-a859-66908488638e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a42161d5f8448446c72e8c77dd111ce46004117c1a0dba0a54d5c702cb123ac0"}}, "hash": "e544c2130d5caf117b2db1d7e66e3a2c48d125eb5b361819946df6c3fb6b3462", "text": "807.00 1,721.00 1,679.00 2,780.00 2,057.00 1,713.00 Diseases from polluted water contact 29,081.00 40,509.00 41,403.00 64,218.00 61,483.00 48,085.00 Fish poisoning 580.00 683.00 811.00 854.00 898.00 786.00 Total costs (low) $24,395,440 $36,521,790 $40,499,570 $51,923,370 $46,469,240 $36,511,530 Total costs (high) $30,544,270 $44,037,445 $48,252,925 $62,965,800 $57,051,160 $45,059,250 22 currently difficult to demonstrate. These include the spread of diseases carried by organisms (usually insects) whose habitat ranges expand or shift as a result of climate change. A good example is the expansion laterally and upwards of the malarial mosquito in high island countries like Papua New Guinea where highland populations have traditionally been immune from its influence. Another example of direct human sensitivity to future climate change in this region is the effect of increased warmth on human comfort. 1.4. Resilience of the Pacific Islands region to the effects of climate change There is a tendency, particularly in the popular media, to overplay the negative effects of climate change on the Pacific Islands region, and to downplay its resilience. This is important because it has given rise to a victim syndrome and widespread despair in many Pacific Islands about their presumed inability to adapt to future climate change (Farbotko and McGregor, 2010). This in turn is sponsoring a culture of denial amongst communities in parts of the region: a belief that the changes they are witnessing are short-term climate variability not long-term climate change (Lata and Nunn, 2011). Many Pacific Island leaders routinely plead for assistance at international meetings on the unquestioned assumption that their countries are powerless to manage the challenges posed by future climate change without massive injections of cash to drive adaptation. Both these beliefs are flawed for, while Pacific Island countries may indeed be uncommonly vulnerable to many aspects of future climate change, many environments and communities (human groups) are also uncommonly resilient. Perhaps the most fundamental aspect of environmental resilience in the Pacific Islands region comes from its natural production systems. Many of the ocean waters around Pacific Island coasts have been overexploited but with appropriate management their sustainable productivity can be restored (Johannes, 2002; Thomas, 2002; Aalbersberg et al., 2005) which attests to their innate resilience. The land is more problematic but there is little doubt that forests that are not logged continue to maintain the land in its present form and provide ecosystem services more effectively than forests that are logged, even selectively. The landscapes of deforested areas in the Pacific Islands change quickly, often to the point where they are unable to support a replanted forest (Lomo, 2001). The key to realizing this aspect of environmental resilience is informed and sustained management, perhaps for biodiversity conservation (Tisdell, 2008), perhaps for carbon sequestration (Kingsford et al., 2009). The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) has been used to develop afforestation/reforestation (A/R) projects in parts of the Pacific Islands, notably in Fiji and Papua New Guinea. Such projects have the potential to increase these aspects of environmental resilience (McGregor, 2009). Most aspects of resilience of the Pacific Islands region directly involve its inhabitants. In terms of human interaction with island resources for subsistence purposes, it is clear that despite increasing urbanization, there is still ample land in most high-island nations to sustain the subsistence needs of its existing population. In most archipelagic countries, most outer 23 islands have experienced out-migration over the past 50 years that has rendered some islands almost empty (Connell, 2010). Yet their potential for sustaining much larger numbers remains and could be part of future national (and sub-regional) adaptation strategies. While many depopulated islands exist in larger archipelagos in the region, the only example in which a government has attempted to systematically relieve population pressure on the centre by re-locating people to the periphery comes from Kiribati, where there has been deliberate subsidised re-location from (overcrowded) Tarawa Atoll to outlying large Kiritimati (Christmas) Atoll (Locke, 2009).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f5526238-2829-496d-a859-66908488638e": {"__data__": {"id_": "f5526238-2829-496d-a859-66908488638e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "88e3a6c9f9335dbe0eaf049b2f5650b0de36d55e2f533f4e63ae31d906b6befc"}, "2": {"node_id": "13be8fed-e95d-4ac8-a16d-2f550eec6877", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e544c2130d5caf117b2db1d7e66e3a2c48d125eb5b361819946df6c3fb6b3462"}}, "hash": "a42161d5f8448446c72e8c77dd111ce46004117c1a0dba0a54d5c702cb123ac0", "text": "Another aspect of resilience arises from the innate characteristics of Pacific Island societies, namely their emphasis on communal living and support that may have evolved as an adaptation to adversity in the past (Campbell, 2006). This mutual support system is most clearly manifested by the response of the community to a disaster that strikes one part of it (or a neighbouring community). Assistance is usually immediately extended and sustained as long as needed; it may extend beyond mere material assistance and labour to the adoption of orphaned children and the giving of land free of charge to newly-landless families.

Another long-standing aspect of resilience found in most parts of the Pacific Islands region is the tradition of community decision-making. While in places this has been weakened since foreign colonization by the establishment of centralized government, it is precisely the failure of central government in many island countries to effectively reach all parts that has strengthened the determination of communities, especially in a country\u2019s peripheral parts, to develop and sustain strategies for their future development. So any future plans for climate- change adaptation in the Pacific Islands region should recognize this trait yet also bear in mind that such communities are not always able to make decisions that are in the best long- term interests of their constituents (Nunn, 2009b). The specific issue is that such communities are usually understandably focused on short-term needs rather than long-term sustainable interactions with a particular food-production system, for instance (Turner et al., 2007; McGregor, 2009). Finally we might consider the nature of most people living in the Pacific Islands today. Most are more aware of the vagaries of the natural environment than any urban dwellers because they subsist from this; this means that they are therefore more receptive to information about how and why the natural environment may change in the future, and what they can do about this. And most Pacific Islanders are literate: educated well above the average for most \u201cdeveloping\u201d countries (Table 1.11). 24 Table 1.11. Adult literacy rates (English) in Pacific Island countries Source: Smith and Long, 2000. This last fact has many implications, including an improved ability to comprehend the need for effective adaptation to climate change as well as the ability to understand and drive (at individual and communal level) appropriate adaptation strategies. Should climate change create significant numbers of environmental refugees from the Pacific Islands region, the fact that these are comparatively well-educated people should aid their successful absorption into other societies, although other adjustment challenges will emerge (Bedford and Ho, 2003). The last major aspect of resilience to be considered is around external assistance (aid). The dependence of Pacific Island nations on external assistance is shown in Table 2.1 below; many commentators have concluded that this degree of dependence is too great to truly enable recipient countries to determine their own directions, especially if these conflict with those of donor countries (Barnett, 2008); in other words, aid to Pacific Island nations \u201cin effect remains budget aid\u201d (Gani, 2009: 118). There are other negative aspects to this degree of dependency that refer specifically to climate change. These include the tendency to uncritically adopt (environmental) policies and legislation from donor countries, to accept inappropriate (often unsustained) adaptive solutions from donors, and to allow strategies to be developed by the international donor community which inhibit in-country community buy- in (Nunn, 2010). Among the many examples, the focus on developing policy and legislation to address environmental issues is perhaps the best example of wasted effort in that these Melanesia Fiji 91.6 93.8 89.3 Fijian, Fiji Hindi Papua New Guinea 72.2 81 62.7 over 700 languages Vanuatu 90 French, Bislama, others Micronesia Federated States of Micronesia 83 many others Palau 92 93 90 Palauan Polynesia Samoa 97 Samoan Tonga 100 Tongan Literacy Male literacy Female literacy Other language 25 tools \u2013 so effective in \u201cdeveloped-country\u201d contexts \u2013 prove generally impotent in the Pacific Islands context. This is largely because legislation can be ignored because it can be neither effectively disseminated or enforced (Alley, 1999; Turnbull, 2004; Nunn, 2009b). This particular situation is illustrated in Figure 2.5. Yet, despite such negative aspects of external assistance, it is clear that Pacific Island nations cannot do without this is they are to adapt their people\u2019s livelihoods to future climate change with minimal disruption. The fact that donors continue to be willing to support Pacific Island nations in this way makes them highly resilient. 2. The Last Hundred Years: Adapting to Climate Change Many things have changed in Pacific Island nations during the past hundred years or so. Most nations have emerged from being colonies to being independent democracies. Most have become increasingly urbanized. Populations have increased. Commercial agriculture and fisheries and forestry have increased sharply in importance. Unprecedented demands have been made on the islands\u2019 natural resources, resulting in land degradation, water and air pollution. Against this background of comparatively rapid environmental and socio-cultural change has been climate change.

Climate change has affected every part of the region within this period, underscoring the fact that it is undiscriminating in its general effects, that it is no respecter of national or geographical boundaries. Of course, in its specific impacts within this period of time, climate change has had more measurable impacts on those ecosystems and human systems that have been simultaneously stressed by other factors. Conversely, climate change has had less tangible impact on more resilient and more healthy ecosystems and human systems. This chapter describes the nature of climate change in the Pacific Islands region over the past hundred years or so, its environmental and human consequences. Section 2.1 explains how climate has changed, focusing on the principal variables including and driven by temperature change. As part of this, it explains how observed climate change has been interpreted by key stakeholders and some of the associated controversies. Section 2.2 looks at how key monitored variables have accelerated recently in this region but also explains the uncertainties around the interpretation of particular datasets. Section 2.3 discusses the effects of recent climate changes in the Pacific Islands region, divided into effects on natural environments and effects on human systems. Emphasis is placed on the effects of climate change on food-producing systems on land and in the ocean. Section 2.4 is devoted to the human responses to climate change in the Pacific Islands region, ranging from those of the international community, regional agencies, national governments, 26 community leaders, and individual decisionmakers. The agendas of non-government organizations are also discussed. The adequacy of these responses is reviewed. Section 2.5 is a case study from two islands in Kiribati intended to describe the effects of two outer-island communities which are grappling with the effects of climate change on their livelihoods. This case study illustrates the nature of international, national, and community priorities. Section 2.6 focuses on the ways in which culture and (religious) beliefs have been used to deny the reality of climate change and to undermine the credibility of future climate projections for the Pacific Islands region. Section 2.7 is a case study of Nadi Town in Fiji which is intended to illustrate the threats posed by flooding to a medium-sized settlement in the Pacific Islands region and the possible responses being discussed at various levels. Section 2.8 examines available datasets to determine whether recent observed changes in climate variables are truly a consequence of climate change or whether they could be classified as climate variability. Many decision-makers in the Pacific Islands region have argued the latter, and many communities regard climate variability as the principal reason for the changes they have observed. Section 2.9 is a case study from a densely-populated river delta in Fiji about community perceptions of the cause(s) of increased river and ocean flooding on their traditional lands and the solutions that they perceive to be most effective. This case study is intended to illustrate the misfits between community-level perception of climate change and national priorities and scientific understanding. 2.1. Observed climate change in the Pacific Islands region There is abundant evidence of climate change in the Pacific Islands region in the past hundred years. The principal observed variable is (ground-surface) temperature, the changes in which are assumed be similar to those in nearshore sea-surface (not deep ocean) temperature, for which there are far fewer datasets. Recent data on sea-surface pH (alkalinity- acidity) are also available. Sea-level datasets are available for most parts of the region. Precipitation datasets are also available yet, owing to the spatial variability of precipitation on many islands, it is sometimes difficult to translate these data into a regional picture. Data are also presented for ENSO and tropical cyclones. 2.1.a. Temperature The period of Recent Warming, in which we are still living, began in the Pacific Islands region about AD 1800 when the Little Ice Age ended. Since that time, there has been a net increase in temperature throughout the region. Some of the least controversial data come 27 from proxy sources, such as coral-core palaeoclimate records that use oxygen-isotope analysis to determine past sea-surface temperatures (Figure 2.1).

These data are in broad agreement with those quoted by the IPCC (AR4) of 0.56-0.77\u00b0C for southern hemisphere land areas in the period 1901-2001. The Pacific Ocean has warmed during the past 60 years or so. For the period 1955-1996, the upper 3 km warmed by 30%: more in the North Pacific (37%) than the South Pacific (16%) (Levitus et al., 2000). Direct measurements of sea-surface temperature also show that the Pacific has warmed over the past century (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999), something confirmed by the IPCC (AR4) which found that southern hemisphere oceans had warmed 0.68-0.69\u00b0C in the period 1901-2001. 2.1.b. Sea-surface pH (alkalinity-acidity) It has become clear in the past decade that the uptake of anthropogenic carbon (CO2) from the atmosphere by the ocean has caused it to become increasingly acidified (Doney et al., 2009). Between 1750 and 1994, there was a decrease of 0.1 in the pH of the global ocean (Raven et al., 2005). Increased sea-surface temperatures may also have decreased pH. An increase in the amount of dissolved CO2 in seawater means that there is a concomitant decrease in the amount of dissolved CaCO3 which is taken up, particularly in tropical oceans by plankton and reef-forming organisms. Thus the effect of lowered ocean pH is that more energy is required by these organisms to extract CaCO3 from seawater to build their skeletons, which on coral reefs translates into slower reef-growth rates. CaCO3 deposition in tropical oceans is estimated to have decreased 6-11% from pre-industrial levels (Kleypas et al., 1999). At the same time, because the ocean water has become more acidic, rates of CaCO3 dissolution increase; on coral reefs, this means that coral skeletons are subject to more rapid dissolution. Both effects imply significant problems for corals and other calcifying organisms in the ocean. 2.1.c. Sea-level change During the period of Recent Warming, there has been a net rise of sea level in the Pacific Islands region (Church et al., 2006). Several long-term series are shown in Figure 2.3 to illustrate this. 29 Figure 2.3. Records of recent sea-level change in the Pacific Basin Source: Nunn, 2007a.

Change in ENSO frequency and intensity Currently, ENSO-negative (El Ni\u00f1o) events affect the Pacific Islands every 3-5 years. They last as long as 18 months and vary in intensity. While earlier variations in ENSO periodicity, which measures the frequency of El Ni\u00f1o events, have been detected, the period 1920-1960 was one characterized by irregular and weak ENSO. Since 1970, there has been a shift to strong and regular ENSO (Nunn, 2007a). 2.1.f. Change in tropical-cyclone frequency, intensity and geographical spread Tropical cyclones develop in the Pacific Islands region usually only in ocean areas where sea- surface temperature is more than 27\u00b0C. In most years, this condition is met only in the western Pacific warm pool. During El Ni\u00f1o events, another warm pool may develop farther east. During the past few decades, the western Pacific warm pool appears to have expanded eastwards as a result of sea-surface temperature warming. This may explain the observed increase in tropical-cyclone frequency in the Pacific Islands region within this period (Nunn, 1994) as well as the steadily increased incidence of tropical cyclones reaching countries in the central South Pacific (like Niue and Samoa) that have traditionally regarded themselves as beyond the geographical reach of these phenomena. 2.2. Recent acceleration of key variables There is good evidence that within the past 10-15 years, there has been an acceleration in the rates at which temperature and sea level have been rising in the Pacific Islands region and elsewhere (Merrifield et al., 2009). 31 In looking at the previous century, the IPCC (AR4) identified two periods of temperature rise. The earliest (1910s-1940s) showed a total of about 0.35\u00b0C while the more recent (1970s to 2006) showed a total of 0.5\u00b0C. The IPCC also found that there had been a an increasing rate of warming within the past 25 years with 11 of the 12 warmest years on record having occurred within the past 12 years. This trend has continued since 2007 when the AR4 was issued. This global trend is also reflected in Pacific Islands datasets (Mataki et al., 2007b). In terms of sea-level change, satellite altimetry data (available since 1992) have consistently shown faster rates of sea-level rise than the average for the past century. A good example is the figure of 3.1+0.7 mm/year obtained by Cazenave and Nerem (2004). The suggestion that this represents a recent acceleration in the rate of sea-level rise is supported by recent trends, albeit short-term, obtained from tide gauges in the Pacific Islands; for example, the gauge at Lautoka (Fiji) is showing a recent rise trend of 3.2 mm/year, well above the range of projections of the IPCC in AR4. In a general sense, it is likely that tropical-cyclone frequency has increased in the Pacific Islands region in the past few decades as temperatures have increased, but it is difficult to demonstrate this unequivocally because of large natural variability. Empirical studies have found that since 1970 (when a strong ENSO period began) there have been more tropical cyclones worldwide, particularly in the North Pacific and in the Southwest Pacific (IPCC, AR4); in the latter region, the numbers of severe tropical cyclones doubled between 1975- 1989 and 1990-2004 (Webster et al., 2005). In addition, the average intensity of tropical cyclones has increased in these regions, with the number of category 4 and 5 storms increasing by 75% since 1970 (IPCC, AR4). 2.3. Effects of recent climate change While it is clear that recent climate change must have had innumerable and varied effects, there is inevitably some controversy around identifying these with certainty because of all the other factors that might have caused (or at least contributed to) these effects. With such caveats in mind, this section attempts to identify the nature of impacts of climate change on Pacific Islands within the past 100 years. 2.3.a.

As noted earlier, most reef-building corals live in shallow ocean water which warms and cools every day. Corals are also very temperature-sensitive, able to live comfortably between 20-29\u00b0C. Should the sea-surface temperature exceed 30\u00b0C for an extended period of time, corals are liable to eject their symbiotic algae (which give them their colour) and die (becoming bleached). Coral bleaching is a phenomenon which has been witnessed increasingly in the tropical Pacific since the early 1970s and is largely attributable to the increased sea-surface temperatures (Figure 2.4). Figure 2.4. Sea-surface temperatures AD 1860-2100 for Tahiti incorporating ENSO effects compared to the thermal tolerance of corals (dashed line) Source: Based on Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999; Nunn, 2009b. Note: Note how for the first 100 years of record, sea-surface temperatures in Tahiti never rose above the coral tolerance limit, so there was no bleaching. Yet beginning around 1970 when mean sea-surface temperature had begun rising, temperature maxima during El Ni\u00f1o events reached above the coral tolerance limit and resulted in bleaching. By around 2050, it is expected that mean sea-surface temperature around Tahiti will have reached close to the coral tolerance limit, so that bleaching episodes will become annual occurrences. The effects of recent coral bleaching in the Pacific Islands have centred around the loss of species diversity and habitat on the affected coral reefs (Coles, 2008). On most reefs, there has been little or no recovery of corals and the reef surface has become colonized by algae. The implications for those people who depend for sustenance on such reefs and the linked ecosystems they support (such as shallow lagoons) have been immense (FAO, 2008). 2.3.b. Sea level The effects of sea-level rise on Pacific Islands over the past century are far less controversial today than 20 years ago when scientists were readier to deny the region-wide nature of sea- level rise and attribute its apparent effects at particular places to local factors, such as sand mining or the construction of artificial structures along the coast. Today it is clear that the 33 effects of sea-level rise have been felt along most Pacific Island coasts for most of the last century and have been particularly apparent within the last 30 years. This discussion of the effects of sea-level rise is divided into its three principal effects: (i) coastal flooding (inundation), (ii) shoreline erosion, and (iii) groundwater salinization. (i) Coastal flooding (inundation) Since sea level has been rising in the Pacific Islands region throughout the past century, one would expect the lowest-lying parts of the region\u2019s coast to have become slowly flooded (inundated) within this period. While there are local factors that may mask this effect (such as increased coastal sedimentation), it is clear that there has been an increase in coastal flooding in most parts of the region. Much of the evidence is anecdotal and regrettably little has appeared in the published literature. Some exceptions are Mimura and Nunn (1998) who gave examples of inundation from Fiji\u2019s coasts, Rasmussen et al. (2009) who worked on smaller outer islands in Solomon Islands, and Nunn and Mimura (1997) who gave examples from throughout the region. (ii) Shoreline erosion As the mean sea level rises along sandy shorelines, so their equilibrium profiles change (the Bruun Effect). Sand is moved from the upper (back-beach) areas to the sea floor where it accumulates. The main effect of this is erosion of beaches as a result of sea-level rise, something that has been observed in every major Pacific Island group (Kaluwin and Smith, 1997; Nunn and Kumar, 2006). In certain circumstances, shoreline erosion can proceed very rapidly; several coastal communities in Fiji have reported losses of as much as 30 m of land in 30 years (Mimura and Nunn, 1998). Much has been made by the media recently of work on atoll-island coasts (Webb and Kench, 2010) which shows that some are actually growing (prograding) rather than eroding. This is a consequence of local factors, specifically the movement of sediment within an atoll lagoon or along an island\u2019s perimeter, and is not a reason to deny the impact of region-wide sea-level rise on shoreline erosion, now and in the future.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9cfdc179-6684-422c-b349-4f2b47977164": {"__data__": {"id_": "9cfdc179-6684-422c-b349-4f2b47977164", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "20ef48be36a8c460131e94cdab432a7f75ac405d0d9c4d5826fcde2416574fdf"}, "2": {"node_id": "a48101cf-2686-4d7b-81b0-5be3e5113b99", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cf35b56239b5ae06470204a9de53c4c32d06bfd31bc603fe0ae0e3c9d2662306"}}, "hash": "199db9b72a31a374731221fe1aff47507fb6adffb53dc3fd1dbd58f9781baa8a", "text": "At this point it is also worth pondering some of the effects of shoreline erosion.

Owing to their soft-sediment composition, these coastal plains are permeable and maintain a freshwater lens within them that is important to plants growing in these locations. As sea level rises, so saline (sea-) water penetrates into these coastal plains reducing the horizontal extent and thickness of the freshwater lenses. This means that the roots of many plants in these locations come to tap into saline not fresh water, which means that most cannot survive. Good examples come from Fiji where sugar cane is a favoured cash crop in many coastal lowland areas; sugar cane will not grow well when the groundwater is saline, so many farmers have reported poor crops in recent years in such places (Barnett, 2011). Examples also come from atoll islands where, owing to the absence of any higher ground for agriculture, groundwater salinization has serious consequences for whole-island subsistence (Lobban and Schefter, 1997). Explicit links between salinization and sea-level rise are apparent in such locations; the example of Niutao Atoll in Tuvalu was discussed by Webb (2007). As explained in the case study in section 2.5, much of the groundwater salinization on atoll islands occurs when large waves cross over these low-lying islands dumping saltwater on top of the freshwater lens, rendering it unsuitable for agriculture for some time. It has been argued that the loss of freshwater lenses from salinization associated with sea-level rise is the most serious climate-linked threat for people in atoll nations like Kiribati (Hunt, 1996). Loss of traditional sources of potable water on such islands is having a disproportionate impact on females whose usual role is to obtain this water (Kallmeyer, 2008). It is worth expanding on some of the effects of salinization on freshwater lenses on atoll islands, not least because these effects are currently threatening the sustainability of human life on some such islands (White and Falkland, 2010). Freshwater lenses in such locations are found at levels that are controlled by sea level, so that as mean sea level rises, so does the water table (the surface of the freshwater lens) which can produce freshwater flooding on atoll-island surfaces. Mean sea-level rise will also enable increased penetration of saline groundwater into freshwater lenses, causing them to shrink laterally. These kinds of natural salinization effects can be exacerbated by groundwater extraction on atoll islands, besides a number of other polluting activities including fertiliser and pesticide use, and waste (White and Falkland, 2010). 2.3.c. Tropical cyclones While there is evidence that the frequency and possibly the intensity of tropical cyclones has been increasing in the Pacific Islands region over the past few decades (Emanuel, 2005; Webster et al., 2005), there has been no attempt to relate this to the increasing impacts (in both human and monetary terms) of these events (although see Table 1.10). Between 1950 and 2004, the Pacific Islands region experienced 207 natural disasters, of which tropical 35 cyclones comprised 76% of all natural disasters (Lal et al., 2009a). Yet tropical cyclones accounted for 90% of the total costs of these disasters and 79% of the fatalities. It is only at the national scale that the economic cost of natural disasters like tropical cyclones is clearly visible (Holland, 2008). For example, the Pacific Island nation of Samoa reports average economic impacts during disaster years of 46% of GDP. When Tropical Cyclone Heta hit Niue in 2004, it led to losses of more than five times GDP in that year. 2.3.d. Extremes It has become increasingly clear over the last two decades that the most serious manifestations of climate change in recent years in the Pacific Islands region (as elsewhere) are associated with extremes. These are not extreme events (like tropical cyclones) but extremes of key variables (like temperature or precipitation or sea level). It is these extremes that are having the greatest impacts on human and environmental systems because they represent maxima of particular variables that are associated with increased (rising) means.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "abf521d7-7818-4115-bef9-a87a015c1be1": {"__data__": {"id_": "abf521d7-7818-4115-bef9-a87a015c1be1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d274de874586176ef9ade106d1ca83bfacaa430c1ca757a5441c088b60eb52ce"}, "2": {"node_id": "db9f134e-20b3-4f19-8acd-6cf8ee469a4e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c3479e27f51c579989ff1d66e74c76fb25dd1896d8cb5d69f15c35bdc0874378"}}, "hash": "469b1e8fdfcd8f4638aa8492cf369d09f1a1dcfdb2217541b7835c5fc3d332c2", "text": "In the case of temperature, extremes are manifested as prolonged periods of high temperature (heat waves) that have effects on all living things.

Prolonged periods of above-average temperature may force environmental system across particular thresholds resulting in long-term system change. A good example from the Pacific Islands region is provided by the record of sea-surface temperature from Tahiti (illustrated in Figure 2.4). Before the early 1970s, sea-surface temperature maxima all fell below the upper temperature tolerance threshold for corals (the broken line in Figure 2.4) but after this time, owing to the rising mean sea-surface temperature, the maxima began increasingly to exceed this threshold, in this case causing coral bleaching. Prolonged periods of intensive rainfall can also force long-term change, particularly as landslides, but more often cause only temporary disruptions. The case may be different with prolonged periods of high or low sea level, which in the tropical Pacific are typically associated with El Ni\u00f1o events. In cases where sea level dips below its present level, the impact on shallow-water ecosystems (like coral reefs) may be only temporary but, should the event continue for weeks rather than days, is likely to have much longer-term effects (Chowdhury et al., 2010). The point about extremes is worth bearing in mind when we consider the debate about whether or not recent environmental changes are indicators of climate change or climate variability (see section 2.8). For with most variables, the greatest extremes occur infrequently, certainly not regularly. So once what is labelled as an extreme event begins to occur regularly, perhaps every year, then it is a sign of climate change. This is what is happening with floods in Nadi Town (Fiji) where what was considered to be an extreme event (perhaps a 1 in 50 year flood) in 1990 is now occurring every 1-2 years (Lal et al., 36 2009b). This is a clear sign that the mean has shifted, so that probabilistic labels for such events are becoming increasingly meaningless and unhelpful as a planning tool. 2.4. Responses to the effects of recent climate change Until about 25 years ago, there was hardly any understanding among people in the Pacific Islands that their environments were being affected by climate change. This is not to say of course that people had not noticed change occurring and responded to it. While there are no known examples of response to temperature change on the islands themselves, the earliest incidences of coral (-reef) bleaching in the tropical Pacific in the 1970s and 1980s led to a flurry of research that recommended a reduction in human impacts on the worst affected reefs (Glynn, 1993; Constanza, 1999). This contributed to the increase in the numbers of marine protected areas in the Pacific Islands region (Johannes, 2002; Bartlett et al., 2009). The most widespread and noticeable effect of climate change along Pacific Island coasts for the past century has been sea-level rise to which people have responded in many ways. The most effective of these has been retreat: moving (that part) of an affected settlement inland, sometimes upslope, and out of immediate danger. There are examples of this that have been documented (e.g. Nunn, 1990; Nunn and Mimura, 1997). The response of many other communities has been to build, often with national or international funding assistance, artificial structures to protect unstable shorelines. While those structures that have been properly engineered, typically in urban areas in the Pacific Islands, have usually succeeded in maintaining the shoreline, those in more rural parts have often failed (Mimura and Nunn, 1998). The problem is the uncritical emulation by rural communities of urban solutions (something that has been called the \u201cseawall mindset\u201d by Nunn, 2009b); most such structures endure for 18-24 months before collapsing. Repair is often expensive, ineffective and eventually discontinued. More than 25 years ago in the Pacific Islands, the widespread belief that coastal flooding and shoreline erosion were local (not region-wide) problems meant that local solutions were usually sought (Kaluwin and Smith, 1997). Within the past 25 years, the increasing appreciation of these problems as region-wide and having a global cause has changed perceptions. For some time, a few Pacific Island countries eschewed adaptation of any kind because they believed that, as the unwitting victims of climate change, it should be the countries that caused the problems which should come up with the solutions to them.

There are often considerable variations in the ways that particular actors have approached issues of climate change in the Pacific Islands region; it is impossible to capture all this variation in this paper. (i) Responses by the international community While those countries that once had colonies in the Pacific Islands have maintained ties (France still has colonies), it is Australia and New Zealand that have been the major providers of aid to independent Pacific Island nations within the past 25 years (Table 2.1). In the last decade, other countries, particularly in East Asia, have been major contributors of aid as has the European Union. Table 2.1. Aid per capita (current US$) to selected Pacific Island Countries Source: Gani, 2008. It is difficult to estimate the amount of aid that has come into the region in the past 25 years for climate-change adaptation and mitigation, but it has probably been several hundred million US dollars; this includes bilateral aid, assistance to multiple countries through regional agencies, and contributions held for this purpose by the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and others. Much of this money has been to assist Pacific Island nations meet their obligations under particular treaties, such as the Montreal Protocol and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Some of the money has been spent on mitigation projects, particularly around renewable energy and reafforestation, but most has (especially in the past decade) gone on adaptation. Policy and legislation have been developed in most island countries with the intention of enforcing environmental sustainability, innumerable attempts made at in-country capacity building, and large numbers of pilot projects run and reported on. While worthy and sincere, most of these initiatives have failed to either inform Pacific Island people about the need for long-term sustainable adaptation or to develop and mainstream appropriate solutions throughout the region.

It is worth examining briefly why this substantial investment has failed to deliver. Policy and legislation are effective tools for persuading people in richer (\u201cdeveloped\u201d) countries to support climate-change adaptation, but the truth is that in poorer countries, especially those that are archipelagic in nature, most rural dwellers are either unaware of national policy and legislation or can choose to ignore it (Duncan, 2008; Nunn, 2010; Figure 2.5).

This fact has not gone unobserved by some donors who have recently substituted \u201ccapacity development\u201d for \u201ccapacity building\u201d. With assistance from UNDP/GEF (Global Environment Fund), most Pacific Island countries have undertaken National Capacity Self Assessments, which are worthwhile exercises for long-term capacity planning. Yet tensions remain around the fluidity of staffing in key areas of Pacific Island governments, particularly the numbers of government employees, usually in non-revenue generating areas, who are funded entirely by aid (Duncan, 2008; Gani, 2009; Hook, 2009). Finally, because of the short-term cyclicity of donor funding, most money for on-the-ground adaptation has been spent on pilot projects in usually unrepresentative locations in the islands. Often community buy-in to these projects is high because they involve large sums of money reaching groups that are typically only partly within the cash economy. Yet as soon, as the money dries up, as it invariably does at the end of the 2-3 year projects, community support often tapers off rapidly. There seems to have been little genuine concern on the part of donors funding pilot projects to embed effective and sustainable adaptation solutions (Nunn, 2009b). (ii) Responses by regional agencies Since many Pacific Island governments are too small to have a full range of experts within them, the model in the region for the past 40 years has been to have inter-governmental regional agencies undertaking work on behalf of member governments. The principal agencies charged with environmental work are the Secretariat for the Pacific Regional Community (SPREP) and the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC), recently subsumed within the Secretariat for the Pacific Community (SPC). Both SPREP and SOPAC have suffered over the years from high staff turnover, employing persons from outside the region who often have little experience or understanding of its environments and cultures. But the main problem from a climate-change perspective is that these agencies have 40 been largely reactive not proactive. They have translated international priorities into national responses often without questioning whether this was the correct approach for the Pacific Islands region4. Regional agencies have tended to view themselves as the mouthpieces of their member governments; for example, articulating their views for additional assistance for climate-change adaptation often without asking whether they should rather be encouraging greater ownership of climate change by governments. (iii) Responses by governments Most Pacific Island governments have acted in unison over the past 25 years in their responses to global initiatives. This is something largely orchestrated by regional agencies and international donor partners and is not necessarily what either the governments or their peoples want or believe; examples include the ratification of international treaties, the meeting of their obligations under these, and the subscription to the unrealistic 1.5\u00b0C global average temperature rise target at the Copenhagen climate summit (Nunn, 2009b; Farbotko and McGregor, 2010). Even today, there are huge gaps between the understanding of most Pacific Island government decision-makers about climate change and their counterparts from larger countries. Much policy and legislation around climate change in Pacific Island countries is often nothing more than a diluted version of what obtains in larger, richer countries. Climate change is not a matter of electoral dispute. Most national representatives from Pacific Island nations subscribe to the positions of those larger richer countries that contribute most to their recurrent budgets. It takes a courageous leader to make a stand against such a position and few do. As a recent FAO report concluded, \u201cOverall, PICs\u2019 [Pacific Island countries\u2019] response to climate change so far can be described as being, project-based, ad hoc and heavily dependent on external resources. Competing priorities, lack of national government commitment, limited capacity and the dominance of international priorities over national ones in the climate change agenda are some of the common justifications for such feeble response\u201d (FAO, 2008: 14). Most donors have assumed that any assistance for community-level (grassroots) adaptation to climate change in the Pacific Islands must be channelled through national governments. The implication of this is that top-down approaches to adaptation are effective which they manifestly are not in the Pacific Islands (Duncan, 2008).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f5a10036-bfd0-48e6-bfb6-882625fb6882": {"__data__": {"id_": "f5a10036-bfd0-48e6-bfb6-882625fb6882", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c30bdd48ae8ba96feca74cdf9cf41e02de8bf1ae196267113430eac60c2f2192"}, "2": {"node_id": "9cc8dfb6-5e4c-4fe5-bb2d-f42e33fbd5c0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "69932f9216b9c1cdd74770eea914ffbbc86f821906786f2e8d4658778160ea09"}}, "hash": "363c879d56d4a7aad79f2b7ce4ef5a2aa01f63a396766e087e877bac4ef6f1ce", "text": "Especially in the larger, archipelagic nations, there is little effective outreach by national governments beyond the main centres.

A recent survey of outer-island communities in Fiji, Kiribati and Vanuatu found that most had no understanding of the term \u201cclimate change\u201d although many reported environmental changes consonant with its effects (Nunn, 2008). Recent work on communities in the Rewa 4 One feature of the response to climate change by Pacific Island countries has been \u201cthe dominance of projects led by regional organizations over projects led by individual countries and territories\u201d (FAO, 2008: 14). 41 Delta in Fiji, about 25 km from Suva, the capital city, found that only 50% of people had heard about climate change; of those, 56% believed that the cause of climate change was the will of a divinity (Figure 2.6 - Lata and Nunn, 2011). Figure 2.6. Results of questions about the awareness of climate change and its causes Source: Lata and Nunn, 2011. Note: A. Answers to the question \u201chave you heard about climate change?\u201d and, if yes, \u201cfrom where?\u201d B. Of those who have heard of climate change, answers to the question \u201cwhat do you believe to be its (principal) cause?\u201d It has long been acknowledged that most Pacific Islanders involve divine will \u201cin support of a wide range of private and public goals, including national ones\u201d (Douglas, 2002: 8). That said, Pacific Island countries have often been vocal in international meetings about climate change and its potential to become a security issue in the region. The Pacific Island nations have been the dominant force in the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) group that often votes as a bloc on climate change issues in the United Nations and sponsors meetings on behalf of the region. 42 (iv) Responses by community leaders Beyond the main (urban) centres in Pacific Island nations, most environmental decision- making is the principal responsibility of the communities who occupy and generally subsist from the land. While most such communities are largely unaware of national and international priorities around climate change, many are also scornful of receiving advice from government (Duncan, 2008; Iati, 2008). Both these conditions reinforce the importance of community-level environmental decision-making in the modern Pacific Islands, something that has been recognized for some time but rarely acted upon by those with power at national, regional or international level (Alley, 1999; Nunn, 2009b; Barnett and Campbell, 2010). As an illustration, it was found that on three outer islands (Bellona, Ontong Java, Tikopia) in Solomon Islands, the people had developed the following adaptation solutions (Rasmussen et al., 2009). Coastal protection \u2013 A few frail and informal structures, perhaps made from sticks or uncemented piles of rock, had been placed along eroding shorelines at the fronts of houses. Construction methods \u2013 When tropical cyclones threaten Bellona and Tikopia, emergency shelters are rapidly constructed in designated places for shelter; traditional building styles and materials are used. Caves are also used. On the atoll islands of Ontong Java, house floors are raised above expected flood levels. Food supply \u2013 After a cyclone has destroyed crops, the following strategies are adopted: (a) plant fast-maturing root crops, (b) preserve food using traditional fermentation, (c) exchange with people on neighbouring islands and clan members elsewhere, and (d) place more emphasis on fishing to counter loss of other foods. Water supply \u2013 Rainwater tanks are now ubiquitous in these islands obviating the need to access dugout wells or depend on coconuts during droughts. Re-location \u2013 There is a long history of exchange between these outer islands and others in Solomon Islands; it is an accepted response to climate stress. Remittances \u2013 In times of hardship in particular, financial and other assistance from clan members elsewhere is given to the people in these islands. On Ontong Java, remittances are \u201cthe most important coping strategy in response to climate-related impacts on food availability\u201d (Rasmussen et al., 2009: 10). Community-level governance in most (parts of most) Pacific Island nations generally follows a traditional model, one that has evolved over long periods of time usually in order to moderate social issues rather than environmental ones (Iati, 2008). For this reason, the decision-making outlook is usually short-term and reversible rather than long-term and sustainable with respect to resources or environmental management strategies.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e054e982-02a4-48b7-aafd-541bc106ecf6": {"__data__": {"id_": "e054e982-02a4-48b7-aafd-541bc106ecf6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "64682e1a473eaadbc77c65bc4e5c9a74432b9f1a8f69a56b5f094a235df20882"}, "2": {"node_id": "ccc7fe6a-5a00-43ad-885a-701427897a4d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2cb31f5899c61392fdf14d2c36fbdcdbe7fa56be93db83ebb49283ef63c6b73b"}}, "hash": "f08b4c7359e5fcda054dae380f4bcfc7b1817c581bd67e40f12774186c80ba7b", "text": "But perhaps the most important factor to consider is that such traditional decision-making is typically hierarchical with a single unelected (often hereditary) leader having the final say.

While this type of decision-making may be unsuited per se to the modern Pacific Islands region, it is its application to environmental decisions that is of concern here. Most such community leaders lack formal education because of their age. They also lack exposure because, ironically, they command greatest respect from their peoples by having remained in the community rather than spending time outside it. They make decisions based largely on perceived precedent \u2013 what they believe happens elsewhere \u2013 and these are often uninformed. Finally, while such leaders may listen to advice from others \u2013 typically other elderly males \u2013 they often make decisions without such inputs (Nunn, 2008, 2009b).

Widespread examples include the decision to build seawalls, to clear vegetation that \u201cblocks\u201d a community\u2019s view of the sea, to reclaim land, or to uproot fledgling mangroves (Nunn, 1990, 2000). The imperative for better-informedcommunity- level environmental decision-making is the key to successful and sustainable climate-change adaptation in the Pacific Islands. There are signs that this is happening with major aid donors like Japan signalling their intention to boost aid directly to Pacific Island communities. In addition, many non- government organizations are becoming active at raising awareness about climate change in rural parts of Pacific Island countries; among these are the Christian churches, which in 2009 articulated a helpful position in their Moana Declaration5 and others like OISCA that sponsor coastal mangrove replanting schemes as an alternative to seawall construction. 2.5. Case Study: Beru and Butaritari Islands, Kiribati Beru and Butaritari are both comparatively densely-populated atoll islands in the Republic of Kiribati. Like most islands in the group, they are experiencing the effects of climate change as well as threats to traditional livelihood sustainability (Locke, 2009). All details in this section come from the unpublished report by Nunn (2008)6. Most people on these outer islands in Kiribati grow or hunt/catch much of the food they consume. While they are concerned about overexploitation of key (nearshore marine) resources, this is something they feel that they can manage and that effective management will correct. Where the people of these islands are less confident is in the effects of climate change, which in these islands pose three main problems \u2013 coral bleaching (only on Beru), groundwater salinization, and shoreline erosion. 5 Online at www.oikoumene.org/resources/documents/wcc-programmes/justice-diakonia-and-responsibility-for- creation/climate-change-water/pacific-church-leaders-statement.html 6 Available online at www.apn-gcr.org/en/products/ project_reports/2007/CBA2007-03NSY- Nunn_Final%20Report.pdf 44 On Beru, several instances of coral-reef bleaching have been noted over the past decade and the local fisherfolk, who have an intimate knowledge of their nearshore marine resources, have noticed that such reefs rarely recover fully after they have been bleached. It may be that, in addition to higher sea-surface temperatures, bleaching is associated with pollution which is less readily diluted and dispersed on this dry island than on wet Butaritari. Groundwater salinization on both islands is associated less with the reduction in size of the freshwater lens beneath the surface and more with wave overwash during storms and, increasingly, during high spring tides. At these times, waves can run across the entire island, which in some places is only a few tens of metres wide, and dump salt water on top of the fresh water lens. The salt water takes long to disperse but until this happens it affects the roots of the crops being grown on the island surface. This is more of an issue on (dry) Beru than (wet) Butaritari because the high rainfall on the latter island recharges the freshwater lens more often than on Beru. Both islands have experienced worrying shoreline erosion over the past 20 years but this has generally been regarded by the inhabitants of these islands as a local problem requiring local solutions. This is not only because the people are generally unaware of what is happening elsewhere in the Pacific Islands region but also because they observe some coasts growing (prograding) while others are being eroded.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "721cc6a2-8fec-42ce-b6a7-11411b325aa9": {"__data__": {"id_": "721cc6a2-8fec-42ce-b6a7-11411b325aa9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "20a0533d9ba4bdd877fe6859d4789c0537907bc86cbc55d92eb0fa7d7060395a"}, "2": {"node_id": "835be4c7-8fae-4fdd-82f0-6adf9c5b032f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d2d4ce7949cd9a5d7b1ed399fe091544ff5dab00edb92f4fa495fba6f9e3ae94"}}, "hash": "d6603408fbf82046da841a3c6e064684bdc15843f0d286ce5ba5f57ef414c063", "text": "This is a normal condition on atoll islands and makes the identification of the effects of recent sea-level rise often more challenging than on the coasts of higher Pacific Islands (Webb and Kench, 2010).

The response of central government has been unsatisfactory in the view of the islanders, with reports having not been acknowledged or acted upon. This is not solely a criticism of central government, but also a reflection of the lack of appropriately qualified government personnel who can help. The World Bank funded Kiribati Adaptation Project (KAP) was intended to address such problems, particularly the issue of equity of adaptation, but its first phase focused only on Tarawa Atoll; outer islands have yet to receive any benefits from it. The upshot of this is that the people of these two islands have been largely forced to find their own solutions to these problems, which is something that largely involves the respective Island Councils. These are male-dominated, headed by the unimwane who has the power of veto over Council decisions with which he disagrees. On Beru, the Island Council has approved the construction of artificial shoreline-protection structures in several places and also initiatives to restore \u201clife\u201d to the reefs off the eroding shorelines in the belief that this will reduce the problem. Since Beru is farther from Tarawa than Butaritari, traditional mores are better entrenched and the Island Council still has final say over environmental decision- making. 45 Being closer to Tarawa and therefore marginally better informed about the causes and solutions of environmental problems, the people of Butaritari have placed less faith in the Island Council than those of Beru. The Butaritari people have discussed problems, particularly of shoreline erosion, at village level and developed their own strategies. One example comes from the village of Ukiangang where shoreline erosion was recognized as a climate-linked problem requiring a long-term sustained solution rather than a short-term response. So the Ukiangang people banned sand mining from the affected beach and built a solid seawall. The important point here is that this decision represented a departure from traditional procedures, one that was stimulated by dissatisfaction with these. It may represent a trend that will increase in the future in the Pacific Islands region as traditional governance is increasingly acknowledged by the affected people as impotent to develop appropriate solutions and sustain them. 2.6. Culture, belief, and denial: excusing adaptation inaction A dispassionate outside observer might look at how many hundred million dollars have poured into the Pacific Islands region over the past 25-30 years and wonder at how little effect this money has had in raising awareness about climate change and both developing and sustaining appropriate adaptation options throughout the region. It would be correct to conclude that much of this assistance has been wrongly directed and used to fund initiatives that were ingenuous in their conception and were not sustainable (Nunn, 2009b). Yet it would be wrong to conclude that Pacific Island people are not able to rise to the challenges posed by future climate change. As with anywhere in the world, the process of stakeholder engagement in the Pacific Islands will be successful only if it is filtered through the cultures and traditions of the people involved (Seacrest et al., 2000). A good example is language; most Pacific Island people speak English as a second, sometimes a third, language so both their ability and resolve to communicate in English for long periods of time can sometimes be strained. Yet almost all outside communication with Pacific Island people about climate change has been in English; almost nothing has been translated into vernacular languages with the understandable result that climate change is regarded by many Pacific Island people as a foreign concept. This view is strengthened for many people in the Pacific Islands when they learn of the causes of climate change and are told that they \u2013 the islanders \u2013 were not the cause of it. All such communication has discouraged the ownership of the climate-change challenge by Pacific Island people over the past 25 years. The issue of ownership is an important one at national level for, as long as Pacific Island nations depend almost wholly on external (aid) funding to underwrite the costs of climate- change adaptation, the less effective this will be. This is because nations will only fund adaptation strategizing when external funding is available, not when it is not. And such nations will continue to allow inappropriate solutions for adaptation (ranging from policy development to seawall construction) to be foisted upon them because they are at no cost to 46 themselves. The only way to mainstream effective and sustainable adaptation in the Pacific Islands is for the region\u2019s governments to declare their ownership of the climate-change challenge by funding the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "70df0a7d-6ffe-4b76-a150-8b1b615700c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "70df0a7d-6ffe-4b76-a150-8b1b615700c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a6eea6fff8bb10f4af3eeab3a0f4fc9769ce8991a06b77108c72750d17b63e2b"}, "3": {"node_id": "78e28b6b-0d7d-42e2-a385-b8edfd76392d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "248f5f2531ed42812b1d5cfb7dd681518ecffb371279307dd636b0c70dd07480"}}, "hash": "109a2d2004dddd8dc397bdf13caa12ce5b944924f24eab6189bdea69f9b14364", "text": "costs of this adaptation from their own resources (Nunn, 2009b). Another cultural filter that many outsiders in the Pacific Islands fail to understand is the innate indisposition of subsistence-based cultures to plan too far ahead, especially at a time when traditional subsistence foods are becoming scarcer. This is perfectly understandable; in such a context, the imperative for an individual is to acquire enough food at the end of each day to feed himself/herself and his/her dependents. In the face of that, any considerations about long-term sustainability of food resources is secondary, something for academic discussion not daily action (Pollock, 1992; Novaczek et al., 2005). But the \u201cshort-termism\u201d that is characteristic of many Pacific Island people is perhaps cultural, explaining a preoccupation with short-term gain and a lack of interest in what might happen a year or a decade hence. Short-termism helps explain why long-term strategies for climate-change adaptation are unlikely to be successful in the modern Pacific Islands (Nunn, 2009b) and why various manifestations of climate change are actually regarded by stakeholders as climate variability (see next section) despite often overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Another cultural filter that is common to all Pacific Island societies is religion; for any outside group (such as the international climate-change community) that wishes to mainstream a message about climate change effectively, it is necessary to acknowledge religious beliefs. Religion may be regarded as a hindrance to effective understanding of climate change but it is also an opportunity (Donner, 2007; Takesy, 2004). As a hindrance, it could be argued that religious beliefs invite scepticism about scientific messages (like the reality of climate change) and encourage complacency about the need for responding appropriately. Certainly many communities in the Pacific (such as those in the Rewa Delta \u2013 section 2.8) are reluctant to admit that climate might be changing because they are god-fearing people who keep their religious obligations, for which reason they are confident that the divinity would not allow something as fundamentally affective as climate change to damage their livelihoods (Mortreux and Barnett, 2009). Throughout the Pacific Islands, from top-level national government to community level, religious beliefs pervade environmental decision-making and are often used as excuses for inaction. It is also worth noting that there is invariably a conspicuous misfit between stated government aspirations for dealing with climate change in Pacific Island countries and the will of civil society. Understanding that both entities are driven largely by differing agendas is important, but more so is the realisation that there is a massive gulf between science and society in this region. Effective solutions to climate-change challenges in the future must involve partnerships between governments and civil society, and must blend scientific solutions with the priorities of island peoples. Such a blended approach is widely recognized as key to successful adaptation (Mataki et al., 2007a; Iati, 2008; Mertz et al., 2009). 47 In summary, there are many reasons why climate-change effects and futures are being denied in Pacific Island countries today. There are cultural reasons - the perception of climate change as an alien concept and a foreign preoccupation; the deeply-rooted emphasis on short- term goals; and the widespread belief that a divinity will protect devotees from the worst effects of climate change. Denial is becoming widespread, particularly in the media (Iati, 2008; Nunn, 2009b). In common with much education (formal and religious) in the Pacific Islands, denial is simply required to be stated as factual by someone with authority (not supported with evidence) for many readers to agree with it. The views of extreme climate- change deniers from elsewhere in the world frequently get aired in the Pacific Islands media. 2.7. Case study: Nadi Town, Fiji Decision-making for most townships in the Pacific Islands is also deficient, largely because these medium-sized settlements fall into a gap between the largest urban areas, which receive disproportionate attention from national government and external aid donors, and smaller rural settlements which generally have a greater inherent adaptive capacity (Mataki et al., 2007a; Hassall and Tipu, 2008). A good example is that of Nadi Town in Fiji, which is expanding largely because its role as a national tourism hub. Nadi had experienced floods of increasing frequency and magnitude over the past decade or so that have had significant economic impact on both the town and surrounding agricultural area (Lal et al., 2009b).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "78e28b6b-0d7d-42e2-a385-b8edfd76392d": {"__data__": {"id_": "78e28b6b-0d7d-42e2-a385-b8edfd76392d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a6eea6fff8bb10f4af3eeab3a0f4fc9769ce8991a06b77108c72750d17b63e2b"}, "2": {"node_id": "70df0a7d-6ffe-4b76-a150-8b1b615700c6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "109a2d2004dddd8dc397bdf13caa12ce5b944924f24eab6189bdea69f9b14364"}}, "hash": "248f5f2531ed42812b1d5cfb7dd681518ecffb371279307dd636b0c70dd07480", "text": "Many explanations for this flooding have been advanced but it is plausible to suppose that the major contributory cause is sea-level rise (Figure 2.7). 48 Figure 2.7 Nadi Town (Fiji), an example of a town that will be severely impacted by sea- level rise in the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "58dbfb97-b9f7-43de-a7e3-66e408172beb": {"__data__": {"id_": "58dbfb97-b9f7-43de-a7e3-66e408172beb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d92a0f80e45cc3dcbaec2303ac378008bd5c5d3d0d35c87a62b4a890d45680f9"}}, "hash": "d92a0f80e45cc3dcbaec2303ac378008bd5c5d3d0d35c87a62b4a890d45680f9", "text": "next few decades Source: Nunn, 2010. Note: A. Nadi Town was built more than 100 years ago at a time when roads were few in Fiji and trade depended on sea transport. In the early years of Nadi\u2019s development, the location appeared sustainable because there were few floods owing to well-vegetated catchments. Sea level was lower than today so that sea flooding, particularly during storms, was not as much of a problem as it is today. A broad mangrove forest existed along the shoreline, adding to the resilience of the location. The fertile well-watered coastal lowland was ideal for commercial agriculture. B. Today the situation of Nadi Town is quite different. The hinterland is largely deforested so that floods have become more frequent and attain higher average magnitudes than they did 100 years earlier. Lowland river channels have become choked with sediment. Sea level has risen significantly. Much of the former mangrove forest has been removed, often for tourism or for infrastructure purposes. Like all river deltas, the land on which Nadi is built has been subsiding as a result of sediment compaction, de-watering (groundwater extraction), and possibly structural (geological) downbowing. Despite all these problems, Nadi Town is growing and becoming more prosperous. C. Thirty years from now, large parts of Nadi Town will be permanently underwater. The main reason for this is that sea level will be significantly higher so that town drains will be unable to carry flood waters away. Many rivers will be in a permanent state of flood because of the higher sea level. Storm surges will have far greater impact than they do today. 49 This places Nadi Town in the same group as other delta (and similar) towns and cities worldwide, including Shanghai (China), New Orleans (USA), and Venice (Italy), all of which have experienced similar problems in the past to those that Nadi is facing now (Syvitski et al., 2009). These problems were addressed for these cities largely by building extensive and expensive artificial structures to protect urban areas that are today well below sea level. Nadi is not yet in this situation but may be so in a few decades time. The cost of building and maintaining artificial structures around Nadi will prove prohibitive so that the only viable long-term solution for Nadi Town is for its vulnerable parts to be re-located. The national government is reluctant to entertain this option because of the expense involved, so spend millions of dollars dredging the river channels around Nadi, and are considering whether or not to divert the mouth of the adjacent Nadi River away from Nadi Town. None of these solutions are likely to provide more than the temporary easing of the flood problem for Nadi Town. A more recent initiative is the GEF Pacific IWRM Nadi Basin Demonstration Project which aims to manage flood risk in the Nadi Basin. Its goals, as currently defined, include flood management, early warning systems, river channel enlargement and diversion, but no mention of re-location of people from the most vulnerable areas. The Project is predicated on the belief that the cause of increased flooding in Nadi over the past decade is river-channel sedimentation not sea-level rise. The Nadi Town Council and the Nadi Chamber of Commerce are the main decision-making bodies for Nadi Town and, although they are aware of the likelihood that sea-level rise is exacerbating the flooding problem and that it will not go away, they are reluctant to plan Nadi\u2019s future with this in mind. Part of the reason for this is that, because visitor arrivals to Fiji are increasing, Nadi is growing more prosperous and so future development plans are preoccupied with increasing revenue generation still further; there is an understandable reluctance to acknowledge and deal with such a profound problem in such a situation. But another part of the reason is that the costs of re-location, even partial re-location of the most vulnerable areas, are unthinkable to local decision-makers. To them, re-location could be considered only if national government developed a suitable site and put financial incentives in place to encourage re-location. As seen above, national government is not likely to undertake such a project, so it may be sensible for a foreign aid donor to step in and underwrite the base costs of Nadi re-location. In this way, the efficacy of such a solution may be demonstrated and encourage other similar-sized towns to follow suit. Yet even though national and sub-national decision-makers in Nadi are generally reluctant to accept that much of Nadi will have to be re-located eventually, individual stakeholders (especially small-business owners) are often more far-sighted.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f50e7606-324d-46f6-8281-397584859d83": {"__data__": {"id_": "f50e7606-324d-46f6-8281-397584859d83", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "863268bf77e186c7dbda4c08c7057ad17ccb6d01fb4eef81080de16b69ff36ee"}, "3": {"node_id": "f6cd3efb-1294-46d3-9972-ec8276a33f80", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aed7dcb467dbd4bfe7d0786be45e79de67d2e506fdb0d893afa51f4e11eb6540"}}, "hash": "e646c20d4b03569b4c9ff2d5bd459424a8b0deb8172db7b75916766c7d04544b", "text": "Some, particularly those worst impacted by flooding in recent years, have been considering re-locating to higher ground. Whether this creates momentum that will eventually obviate the need for action by national or sub-national decision-makers is of great interest to those concerned with planning the region\u2019s future. 50 2.8. Climate change or climate variability? Much inaction in the Pacific Islands to implement effective climate-change adaptation strategies arises from the belief that the climate is not changing per se, simply manifesting its usual variability. This view of observed changes in particular climate and climate-linked variables is commonest at community level (including individual stakeholders) but also widespread at sub-national (district) levels (Mataki et al., 2007a; Nunn, 2009b; Lata, 2010). For subsistence communities, accustomed to routine interaction with the natural environment that surrounds them and equipped with traditional lore about its productivity, it is understandable that variations will be observed (Weber, 2006). Land occasionally disappears, land is sometimes flooded, river channels have been known to dry up, wild-food resources sometimes vanish from particular places or appear elsewhere. These happenings are well known to the people who inhabit such environments, much discussed in community gatherings where their most extreme manifestations are routinely recalled. So there is a lot of hesitation among such communities to admit that their observations in recent years are evidence for (long-term and irreversible) change rather than (shorter-term and reversible) variability (see next section). Sub-national decision-making (local government) in Pacific Island nations is generally sympathetic to many local issues, including environmental ones, but handicapped to respond appropriately due to both a lack of funding and a lack of expertise (Mataki et al., 2007a; Hassall and Tipu, 2008). A good example was reported from Shefa Province on Efate Island in Vanuatu where environmental concerns (mostly increasingly frequent seawater flooding) of coastal settlements were not effectively answered by provincial government (Nunn, 2008). The specific issue was that calls for assistance in stopping logging (causing reef degradation) and helping coastal communities resist shoreline erosion and sea flooding were made with the agreement of all district authorities but were stonewalled by provincial authorities which were the only ones with access to the necessary funding and expertise. Examples from Kiribati and Fiji are given in the case studies above. To counter the view that it is climate variability that is being experienced in the Pacific Islands region rather than climate change, it is most persuasive to look at single variables to demonstrate long-term trends of change (signals) that are distinct from shorter-term variability (noise). It should be noted that to separate signal from noise, it is generally necessary to have at least 30 years of regularly monitored data; any less than that and there is a danger that erroneous trends will be recognized (Pugh, 2004). Three variables are discussed below in some detail to demonstrate that observed changes constitute climate change not climate variability: temperature, sea level, and tropical-cyclone frequency/intensity. Other variables exhibit similar trends but the long-term signal is more difficult to isolate. 51 2.8.a. Temperature Figure 2.2 shows temperature data series of more than 30 years for four Pacific Island locations. In each, it is possible to identify long-term trends (shown as broken lines) that are distinct from the noise. These show that for the past 50-100 years, temperatures at these stations have been rising, a clear indication of climate change distinct from variability. The implications of this are twofold. First, it would be expected that the direct effects of this temperature change (0.56-0.77\u00b0C from 1901 to 2001) would have impacted Pacific Island environments and societies. Yet, as explained above, because of simultaneous changes to these systems during the past 100 years, the direct effects of temperature change have been generally more difficult to isolate. It is only in with the associated rise of sea-surface temperature and its widespread effect in causing coral bleaching (illustrated in Figure 2.4) that there is clear evidence for the impact of temperature rise on Pacific Islands. Second, there is a well-understood causal link between temperature change and sea-level change (Vermeer and Rahmstorf, 2009) so it would be expected that, as temperature has been rising, so too has sea level. Thus the empirical evidence for sea-level rise (illustrated in Figure 2.3) from the Pacific is exactly what would be expected had temperature been rising during the same time period (see below).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f6cd3efb-1294-46d3-9972-ec8276a33f80": {"__data__": {"id_": "f6cd3efb-1294-46d3-9972-ec8276a33f80", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "863268bf77e186c7dbda4c08c7057ad17ccb6d01fb4eef81080de16b69ff36ee"}, "2": {"node_id": "f50e7606-324d-46f6-8281-397584859d83", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e646c20d4b03569b4c9ff2d5bd459424a8b0deb8172db7b75916766c7d04544b"}}, "hash": "aed7dcb467dbd4bfe7d0786be45e79de67d2e506fdb0d893afa51f4e11eb6540", "text": "There is also a causal link between temperature rise in parts of the Pacific and tropical-cyclone frequency which helps explain the observed increases in tropical cyclones in these areas over the past few decades (see below). 2.8.b.

There is no mistaking the long-term trends in each of the datasets plotted underlining the point that, as for temperature, there has been a serial change in sea level superimposed on significant variability. A strong correlation exists for the Pacific between sea-surface temperatures and sea level (Chowdhury et al., 2008) demonstrating the validity of the expectation that, if temperatures are rising, then so too is sea level (see above). 2.8.c. Tropical-cyclone frequency/intensity Several aspects of tropical cyclones in the Pacific, specifically its Southwest and North parts, show strong correlations with sea-surface temperatures (Emanuel, 2005; Mertz et al., 2009) although these correlations are not as clear as for sea level (Knutson et al., 2010; Yeh et al., 2010). As sea-surface temperatures have been rising since the 1970s, so too have the frequency, intensity, duration and spatial reach of tropical cyclones increased. 52 2.9. Case study: Rewa Delta, Fiji An intensive study of climate-change perceptions among the inhabitants of the Rewa Delta, the largest in the Fiji Islands archipelago, allows insights into the gulf that exists between scientific imperatives and community priorities in a representative rural community in the Pacific Islands (Lata, 2010; Lata and Nunn, 2011). The results are also applicable to subsistence coastal and delta communities elsewhere in the \u201cdeveloping\u201d world. This case study is intended to illustrate both the degree to which such communities understand and interpret what is happening to their surroundings, and how this in turn informs their preferred adaptation options. Figure 2.8 shows a map of the Rewa delta, most of which is less than 4 m above mean sea level. The delta is composed of sediments carried downstream from the centre of Viti Levu Island by the Rewa River. Throughout the past 150 years or so, there is evidence that river channels have shifted within the delta while, for most of this time, the delta front has been growing seawards. This has changed in the past 20 years, with many signs that the delta front is being eroded. Figure 2.8. The Rewa Delta (Fiji Islands) Note: Study sites within the delta are shown; Nausori is the only town while Muanaicake, Muanaira and Laucala villages comprise the traditional community of Vutia. Source: Lata and Nunn, 2011. Almost all people in the delta subsist to some degree from wild foods or crops grown locally. In order to understand the nature of changes that such people have observed in the natural environment, surveys were carried out in the Vutia community, a group of three traditional 53 villages \u2013 Laucala, Muanaicake, Muanaira. The locations of these villages, which house some 900 people, are shown in Figure 2.8. What was found was that the observations of the Vutia people about what was happening to their environment were almost exactly the same as scientists would have predicted for such an area. Foremost among the environmental impacts was increasingly frequent inundation of lands that had traditionally been only occasionally flooded. Associated with this, the Vutia people recognized that seawater was penetrating into the freshwater lens in which they have grown their crops for generations, a largely unprecedented occurrence. And then the Vutia people recognized that the river was changing in ways that were also beyond their experience (and those enshrined in their oral traditions), namely that the river was becoming ever more turbid, that channel-floor sedimentation was increasing, shoreline and river-bank erosion was becoming more widespread, and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 favoured fishing grounds were becoming unproductive. The Vutia people had responded to these changes in various ways. In response to inundation, they had raised their dwellings and the cement paths connecting them. In response to salinization of croplands, they had adopted a raised-field system that creates perched water tables. And they had responded to bank erosion by building protective structures (stick-and- wire fences backfilled with domestic garbage), to the loss of fishing grounds by sailing farther afield but also trading crop surpluses for seafood. And they have been requesting the provincial council for many years to find a sustainable solution to these problems.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8b2e8b48-4773-4047-b8b9-dea6dd2f8803": {"__data__": {"id_": "8b2e8b48-4773-4047-b8b9-dea6dd2f8803", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "33dd0f50fbc6c2f56e7c0036ef2fca32b009fe17b5a3f476870265f8573247fc"}, "2": {"node_id": "47c1b7d7-414a-484d-bc1d-fbd9623ac1fd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f5418aa7e76a993974aabeecdbaa7a23a4c2f672817091e3d0f4e792ae3f2f3e"}}, "hash": "ef33077e7c695c79c3cfe3ed9f33e3d17f1e07a5508cec693559eced37156ae9", "text": "For the Vutia people, a sustainable solution would be a return to normality, for they firmly believe that the changes they are witnessing are but a temporary aberration and that within a few years normality will be restored.

But finally and possibly most importantly, the world view of people in Vutia prevents them from conceptualizing climate change and its consequences in the same way as visiting scientists do. The Vutia world view is one that is filtered through one form of Christianity, which teaches that the world was created for the benefit of humans and that it is unthinkable to suppose the world no longer functions for this purpose. Over the next hundred years (see below), it is almost certain that the Rewa Delta will shrink markedly in size and that many currently-occupied settlements will be drowned, their inhabitants forced to move elsewhere (see Figure 3.1). How this impacts their current world view will be instructive for people in comparable situations elsewhere in the world. 3. The Next Hundred Years Much of the media hyperbole that currently surrounds the issue of future climate-change impacts on Pacific Island nations suggests that they are on the \u201cfront line\u201d of climate change, entire islands may \u201csink\u201d or \u201cdrown\u201d, whole countries may \u201cdisappear\u201d (Connell, 2003; 54 Farbotko, 2010). While regrettable, this kind of rhetoric has forced world attention on countries in the region, particularly those atoll groups (in Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Tokelau and Tuvalu) where indeed entire islands are likely to be abandoned by their human inhabitants within a few decades. But planning for the future cannot proceed on the basis of exaggeration, so this chapter is intended to explain what might happen in this uncommonly vulnerable region over the next 100 years. Section 3.1 explains how the climate of the region is projected to change by the year 2100, particularly with reference to five key variables: temperature, precipitation, ocean acidification, sea-level change, and tropical cyclones. It also explains uncertainties around these projections and their implications. Section 3.2 looks specifically at the effects of projected 21st-century climate change on food production in the Pacific Islands region. It focuses on the traditional food-resource bases for Pacific Island peoples, their key vulnerabilities but also the opportunities. It is important to understand that climate change is only one of a number of future stressors on food resources, so that any prediction of its impacts must factor these in as well. Section 3.3 examines the likely effects of climate change on the future economic development of Pacific Island countries, arguing that much depends on the degree to which they anticipate the necessary adaptation solutions. Discussions are given of the effects of climate change on tourism, agriculture and the other principal revenue-generating activities in the region. Section 3.4 proposes that large numbers of coastal dwellers and activities will have to re- locate from vulnerable to less-vulnerable locations over the next few decades in the Pacific. There is a discussion of the timetables for re-location and some of the key issues involved. Section 3.5 is based on the assumption, currently quite reasonable, that in most situations the need for communities and/or key infrastructure to be re-located will not be anticipated sufficiently far in advance to prevent disruption to livelihoods. In such a situation, there are likely to be flashpoints7 associated with extreme events of extreme duration that will see communities and/or key economic activities in distress. This section attempts to predict where these flashpoints might be situated. Section 3.6 argues that the single most important key to effective and sustainable adaptation by Pacific Island people to the challenges of 21st-century climate change lie with effective communication by scientists of scientific agendas. Learning from the problems around such attempts at communication over the past 25 years, it is clear that for future communication to succeed it must acknowledge various cultural and linguistic protocols. 7 In this context, a flashpoint is defined as a situation in which a climate-driven natural disaster causes rapid loss of services and livelihoods, rapidly increases food insecurity, and has a high chance of leading to civil disorder. 55 3.1. Future climate change in the Pacific Islands region While acknowledging that our understanding of the Earth\u2019s climate is imperfect, great confidence can be placed in projections from the IPCC and other groups of credible scientists, given that global climate models can successfully simulate recent climate change. Yet there will always be elements of uncertainty associated with future projections; much of this uncertainty is around the effects of interactions between changing climate variables. At present, most projections of future climate change are linked to particular variables and this section follows this by presenting projected 21st-century changes in temperature, precipitation, ocean pH, sea level, and tropical-cyclone incidence. 3.1.a.

Note: These figures represent regional averages of temperature and precipitation projections from 21 global models for the A1B scenario. The frequency of extremely warm, wet and dry seasons is also shown. Temperatures are projected to rise 1.4-3.7% by 2100 compared to 2000, perhaps slightly more in the North Pacific than the South Pacific. Extreme warm seasons will become twice as frequent as they are today within this time period. This increased warmth will have implications for many aspects of life in the Pacific Islands region. Perhaps the most extreme will be the increasingly regular bleaching of coral reefs (perhaps an annual event by 2055 \u2013 see Figure 2.4) that will eventually see most shallow-water coral reefs dieback and be replaced by less diverse algal reefs, with massive consequences for nearshore marine ecosystem productivity (Guinotte et al., 2003). Warming will also impact many other aspects of food production in the region, as discussed in the following section. The implications of warming on disease distribution and human comfort are difficult to predict precisely but these are clearly variables that will need to be monitored closely as the century progresses.

While being touted only as a possibility, it is now clearly important for planners and policy-makers to revisit their previous assessments of the impacts and adaptation needs of their countries. In the Pacific Islands, a 4\u00b0C temperature rise would have massive and profound impacts on the entire gamut of human and environmental systems. One broad-brush study suggests that around two million people could be displaced from the locations (not necessarily the islands) they currently occupy in the Pacific Islands in such a scenario (Nicholls et al., 2011). 3.1.b. Precipitation Although precipitation is highly variable, the projections (Table 3.1) suggest a slight overall increase. There are however high degrees of uncertainty around these projections (-4% to +19%) and they also suggest that there may be significant changes in precipitation seasonality (for example, -17% to +17% in the North Pacific in March-May). While it is not necessary to discard these projections, they are clearly of limited use as they stand for the purpose of predicting impacts of precipitation change on the region. What is slightly more apparent is that extreme wet seasons will increase quite significantly (35-40%) over the next 90 years while extreme dry seasons will probably become less frequent (Table 3.1). 3.1.c. Ocean pH In the past decade, it has been increasingly realised that ocean acidification is perhaps more of a threat to coral reefs (and other calcifying organisms) than coral bleaching (Doney et al., 2009), although this has not become any less of a threat to food supplies (see section 3.2). Increasing ocean acidification (decrease of pH) in recent years is thought to have reduced rates of calcification and increased seawater dissolution of existing marine organisms (Kleypas et al., 1999).

This will pose challenges to Pacific Island nations far greater than those that they have become accustomed to contemplating. Most coastal plains will be permanently flooded and 57 those people and activities that are currently located thereon will have no option but to re- locate. The principal implication for climate-change adaptation planning in the Pacific Islands region is that, while livelihoods in some low-lying areas might have been able to adapt to a sea-level rise of less than 1 metre, they will not be able to do so when confronted by a sea-level rise of twice that amount. Of particular concern are atoll islands, which by definition rarely rise more than 2 metres above mean sea level and are composed mostly of materials (sand and gravel) that are readily eroded by waves. Some work on Tuvalu atolls has concluded that there are already signs of significant erosion of their superficial (sediment) cover which may herald the end of human habitability on affected islands (Dickinson, 1999, 2009). In the latter paper, current projections of 21st-century sea-level rise were used to estimate the years when particular atoll clusters in the Pacific region would effectively become uninhabitable (Table 3.2). The reasoning was based on a comparison with the time when these islands likely became habitable, a time marked by the emergence of dry coastal land suitable for human settlement. Table 3.2. Years when selected clusters of Pacific atolls will have become uninhabitable Source: Interpreted from Dickinson, 2009. It is emphasized that these kinds of predictions are fraught with uncertainty and that it is likely that islands will become practically unable to be permanently inhabited long before the times shown. That said, this Table does show which groups of atoll islands are more sensitive to this than others. Those in the central Pacific and in the Caroline Islands (belonging to both the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands) appear to be the most vulnerable while those in the main group of Marshall Islands, Tokelau, and parts of French Polynesia (Tuamotu Archipelago) appear least vulnerable. Yet the clear message of this table is that, even by this comparatively crude method of assay, no atoll group in the Pacific is likely to be habitable by the end of the century. And it is worth noting that Atoll cluster Earliest date Latest date western Caroline Islands 2050 2100 central Caroline Islands 2060 2120 eastern Caroline Islands 2050 2100 Marshall Islands 2080 2160 Kiribati-Tungaru chain 2070 2140 Tuvalu 2070 2140 Tokelau 2080 2160 Phoenix Islands 2070 2140 northern Cook Islands 2050 2100 Line Islands (Kiritimati) 2050 2100 northern Tuamotu Archipelago 2070 2140 Society Islands 2070 2140 southern Tuamotu Archipelago 2080 2160 Gambier Archipelago 2070 2140 Cook-Austral chain 2050 2100 58 Dickinson (2009) used the IPCC AR4 estimates to produce his figures not the considerably higher ones that have been produced since that time, by Nicholls et al. (2011), for instance. Were these figures applied to Dickinson\u2019s metric, it is likely that 20-30 years would need to be shaved off each of the years in Table 3.2. 3.1.e. Tropical cyclones Since tropical cyclones develop only where sea-surface temperatures exceed 27\u00b0C, it is likely that more tropical cyclones will develop in any one season when the region within which sea- surface temperatures exceed 27\u00b0C expands. It will also be expected that tropical cyclones will endure longer and be able to attain high intensity more frequently, as well as reaching places that have historically been unaffected (or only rarely affected) by them. Specific research on Pacific tropical cyclones suggest something slightly different (Webster et al., 2005; Knutson et al., 2010). They suggest that it is the intensity of tropical cyclones that will increase in the rest of the 21st century. The total number of tropical cyclones will decrease although the number of the strongest such events (Category 4 and 5) will increase and endure longer. These projections are not good news for Pacific Island nations, and it is now more opportune than ever for them to consider increasing resilience to tropical cyclones, especially in their most vulnerable parts and peripheral areas. 3.2.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2a3ae614-e215-49b4-b888-489fd0434e3f": {"__data__": {"id_": "2a3ae614-e215-49b4-b888-489fd0434e3f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "128febb4a2cb21898c922893373044d4e1f4218b8a4a6d7f72856bb103cc4b9e"}, "2": {"node_id": "826ebfef-99aa-495a-aeb9-79539fe3ea1c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "30c3d58bbc881e3048726a34f4a529d18816baf977510789d7ed66974d96cfe1"}}, "hash": "3050f945f97b8cb44e59a7a45a43d33a539c7a33399835e840254c00f84d65e8", "text": "3.2.

One good example is the giant swamp taro (Cyrtosperma chamissonis) that is more tolerant of saline groundwater than other species of taro and, indeed, most traditional root crops in the Pacific Islands. There is clearly potential for introducing salt-tolerant species of other crops that are being developed and introduced elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region (Molina et al., 2008). Rather it is precipitation that is the major concern for Pacific Island agriculture and the level of uncertainty implicit in the figures in Table 3.1 is unhelpful for planning purposes. The conclusion of that Table, that extreme warm (and to a lesser extent, wet) seasons will increase 59 in frequency during the 21st century, has an important message for agriculture planners. There should be more efficient use of water, increased planting of shade trees and more use of agroforestry: all solutions that earlier generations of Pacific Islanders utilized and deserve to become more widely known (Clarke and Thaman, 1993). In the same vein, the response of Vutia villagers (section 2.9) to groundwater salinization was to construct raised-field systems, as their ancestors had done, which is a solution worthy of wider dissemination. The other major effect of sea-level rise on terrestrial food production in the region is the loss of (often highly productive) land. In some countries, entire coastal plains may be rendered unusable for agriculture within a few decades, underscoring the need to start planning now for alternative food-production systems. These might include fishponds \u2013 to counter losses of marine foods from nearshore ecosystems (see below) \u2013 and the spread of both subsistence and commercial agriculture to higher land where this exists. The productivity of marine ecosystems on which modern Pacific Island peoples depend for food will be severely impacted in the next few decades. The imperative is then to try and re- create such ecosystems elsewhere \u2013 perhaps in well-managed shallow lagoons or, more feasibly, in artificial ponds on land either linked to the ocean or not (Bell et al., 2009). For many Pacific Islanders, sea food has traditionally provided the protein components of diets, so that such ponds could be managed to provide protein foods such as fish and crustacea. The combined effects of coral bleaching and increased rates of CaCO3 dissolution on ocean food productivity are likely to be profound for most of the Pacific Islands region, especially its warmer parts (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007). Several analyses are in broad agreement in that most coral reefs in Solomon Islands and Vanuatu will be pushed beyond their normal environmental limits for the foreseeable future by 2030 (Coles, 2008) The impacts on ocean- food resources, not just for subsistence dwellers on Pacific Islands, have been thoroughly discussed (Phinney et al., 2006) and calls made for urgent restorative actions, especially for coral reefs (Dodge et al., 2008). The issue for food productivity is not around coral reefs per se but, arguably more importantly, around the associated ecosystems, particularly reef-bordered lagoons, that supply most of the subsistence foods that Pacific Island people obtain from marine sources. While it is difficult to isolate the effects of climate change on ecosystems that are already being unsustainably managed in many parts of the region (Aalbersberg et al., 2005; Novaczek et al., 2005), it is clear that climate change will impact both the numbers and the diversity of marine organisms present in these ecosystems (Cheung et al., 2009). Mangrove ecosystems may be severely impacted by rapid 21st-century sea-level rise although there are studies, empirical and theoretical, that imply otherwise (Nunn, 2000; Alongi, 2008; Ellison, 2010). It is possible that some existing mangrove fringes, particularly around the mouths of large rivers (where sediment supply to the littoral continues), will be able to move inland as sea level rises, maintaining their important role in food production for coastal dwellers. Pacific Island governments should recognize this possibility and re-double their 60 efforts to conserve mangroves and re-plant viable communities along appropriate parts of island shorelines. 3.3.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6b0c2901-40ec-4044-93bf-b655b3fe05a0": {"__data__": {"id_": "6b0c2901-40ec-4044-93bf-b655b3fe05a0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fc8a29c5103492ebe86286a12063dbf3dca8a21366459a41fce8a7879570c31e"}, "2": {"node_id": "e4f58a0d-50d9-427a-b480-7ad058040eed", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4a2157324997488a82fa0ae282a2083e9510f66bfe7a31325fb0e7474d96de8a"}}, "hash": "9750a37b56f578be7c8d0dd3809ab5374c2504e87bdffdd9842a014638167b68", "text": "3.3.

For this reason, it makes sense for Pacific Island governments to invest heavily now in anticipatory adaptation. This might involve relocating communities and activities and infrastructure now that might otherwise be underwater by mid-century, and examining present development trajectories critically to see how they might be adapted in future. For example, in countries where commercial agriculture is an important revenue generator, it is worth trying to extend such agriculture to higher ground rather than concentrating almost solely on lowland areas. This move might involve governments developing infrastructure in the often sparsely-populated and developed inland parts of islands in countries like Fiji and Samoa to encourage people to commence farming in these areas. In such higher-island countries, the prospect of massive re-location of (near-) coastal dwellers to higher ground inland is something that will not only be very costly but also very disruptive to economic development if it is carried out at the last possible moment. Far better in terms of economic impact if Pacific Island governments develop strategies for staggered retreat, moving so many people and activities every few years, so that costs are spread more evenly over the next few decades. This is a process that must involve governments, sometimes even the entire region, because of the nature of land tenure in Pacific Island countries (Crocombe, 1987). Communities cannot simply move from the coast to a site inland that they do not own. Most such communities, being only partly within the cash economy, would be unable to afford to lease such land, so the only option is for governments to negotiate such arrangements country-wide. It will undoubtedly require investment, perhaps even compulsory purchase of large tracts of land that are currently in private hands (Duncan, 2008). The situation for low-island countries in the Pacific region is quite different. Whereas their prospects looked grim under a 21st-century sea-level rise of 59 cm (IPCC AR4, 2007), these look far worse under a sea-level rise of 1-2 metres within the same period (see section 3.1.a). It is very difficult to see how any atoll island that rises no more than 2 metres above sea level today could remain habitable with a sea level 1-2 metres higher: a situation anticipated for Tuvalu by Dickinson (2009) and quantified in Table 3.2. Difficult as it may be, the inhabitants of atoll islands in the Pacific \u2013 which include most inhabitants of Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Tokelau and Tuvalu \u2013 need to understand the inevitability of re-location from their present locations, perhaps 20-30 years hence. They also need to understand that 61 the economic costs involved (as well as the potential losses of sovereignty and culture) can be minimized with early anticipatory action, especially at a time when the global community has established a multi-billion dollar Adaptation Fund that such countries can access. Sovereignty of countries that expect the \u201closs\u201d of entire islands could be assured by \u201cfreezing\u201d current baselines: in other words, allowing for future sovereignty to be based on existing national boundaries (Yamamoto and Esteban, 2010). Cultural conservation is potentially easier to achieve once it is accepted that culture is neither space-specific nor historically unchanging (Duncan, 2008; Lilley, 2008). Many expatriate Pacific Islander communities flourish in other Pacific Island nations and in metropolitan Pacific Rim countries. Economic development in most Pacific Island countries is projected in the basis of increased revenue generation. While there are clearly limited opportunities for future extractive industry, production industries that meet niche needs in richer countries, as does Fiji Water (Connell, 2006a; Reddy and Singh, 2010), might be developed by Pacific Island governments. In many Pacific Island nations, manufacturing and other industries have been deliberately located in industrial parks, typically located in low-lying (sometimes reclaimed) areas; clearly in the absence of effective shoreline protection, these areas will be under threat from future sea-level rise.

Many Pacific Island countries depend on ocean fisheries for foreign revenue and there is huge demand for Pacific Ocean fish. A recent study looking specifically at the vulnerability of national economies to the effects of climate change on ocean fisheries concluded that the Pacific Island nations sampled (Fiji, French Polynesia and New Caledonia) were, like other Small Island Developing States (SIDS) included in the analysis, highly vulnerable (Thresher et al., 2007; Allison et al., 2009). This study intimated that the same result would have been obtained for other Pacific Island countries had adequate baseline data been available. What this means is that ocean fisheries in Pacific Island nations are under threat, first because they are currently being managed unsustainably and, second, because future climate change will re-organize ocean fish stocks in ways that may see far fewer ocean fish available in Pacific Island waters. 62 3.4. Climate-forced migration and re-settlement Given the recent upgrading of projections of future sea-level rise (section 3.1.d), it is now almost certain that large numbers of people (and infrastructure and activities) will need to move from the vulnerable locations they currently occupy to others that are less vulnerable. This will involve a lot of expense and, in a world where land is often at a premium and communally owned, a lot of negotiation. But if re-location is carried out in advance, much of the expense and the inconvenience can be reduced (Nunn, 2009b, 2010). The projections in Table 3.2 suggest that Pacific atoll islands have at least 40 years before they are rendered completely uninhabitable. But it is likely that they will become so long before that time, as a result of increased groundwater salinization (similar to that described in Kiribati \u2013 section 2.5) and shrinkage of the freshwater lens on which most atoll islanders depend. A recent prognosis suggests that as many as two million people might be displaced from their present locations in the Pacific Islands region during the 21st century if no effective protection is put in place for a 2 metre sea-level rise (Nicholls et al., 2011). In April 2009, Pacific church leaders issued a statement on resettlement (re-location) as a direct consequence of climate change; this was the Moana Declaration. This statement was farsighted in that it was the first statement by any Pacific leaders to focus on re-location and the associated practicalities. Among its elements were the following. 1. Undertake immediate measures to identify available land and other appropriate resources for the purposes of relocating and resettling all forced climate migrants, both those displaced internally as well as those likely to seek resettlement in other countries; 2. Carry out intensive public consultations with Pacific communities affected and will be affected by rising sea levels or other consequences of climate change, with a view to developing viable and practical plans to protect the rights of forced climate migrants, in particular their housing, land and property and related rights; These two calls capture the main secular issues around re-location in the Pacific Islands region and are worth examining in slightly more detail here. With reference to (1), the call is for individual countries to identify land and resources for climate migrants to be resettled. This will involve governments at all levels working with landowners to, first, identify vulnerable communities and, second, to identify places to which they might be re-located within their own country. That this process might also involve other countries is quite possible; resettlement of people between countries in the Pacific Islands region has many precedents and the experiences of these migrants might be sought in order to understand how best to manage the process in future. Yet this call also implies that some migrants (also known as environmental refugees) may have to be resettled outside their Pacific Islands region, which will require negotiations with appropriate countries. 63 With reference to (2), this acknowledges that the people who will be forced to re-locate are the victims of a process beyond their control and that, in consequence, their property and their human rights must be protected. Again this is something for governments and regional agencies to develop, but (2) also talks about public consultations. These are critically important to remove much of the anxiety that currently exists around climate-change forced migration, the rights and expectations of migrants. It is essential that such consultations are carried out in culturally-appropriate ways and vernacular languages so that the affected people are encouraged to buy-in to the process rather than view it as a", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eb129af4-7879-47fd-ad74-0f2331fa5bc5": {"__data__": {"id_": "eb129af4-7879-47fd-ad74-0f2331fa5bc5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b6cebc47a158ba385def8ecd08903d4bd744f8b3c96b8cd586aedd561f099f0f"}}, "hash": "b6cebc47a158ba385def8ecd08903d4bd744f8b3c96b8cd586aedd561f099f0f", "text": "foreign preoccupation that is being overstated (see section 2.6). The inevitability of large-scale migration from affected areas is not yet widely accepted in the Pacific Islands region. It seems likely that an increase in the amount of scenario development, as in Table 3.2 and as shown for the Rewa Delta in Figure 3.1, may help bring the imperative of re-location to the wider community. Yet given the degree of scepticism and even outright denial that permeates the communities of the region, it will probably take a major incident (or a series of them) to bring the need for re-location of vulnerable communities to the front of the public psyche and government agendas. 64 Figure 3.1. Threats to the Rewa Delta (shown in Figure 2.8) from sea-level rise calculated on the basis of present-day topography Source: Shoreline defined by mean low-water spring tide level (Fiji Datum), and realistic sea-level rise scenarios based on Vermeer and Rahmstorf (2009). Figure updated from Lata and Nunn (2011), full details in Lata (2010). Filled circles are settlements with more than 200 occupants at present, unfilled circles are settlements that are predicted to be below sea level at the times shown. None of these comments are intended to trivialise the human traumas and the financial costs of re-location and resettlement, only to demonstrate their inevitability given our current understanding of how Pacific Island environments are likely to change in the future. There is likely to be a need for some Pacific Island people, displaced from their present settlements, by rising sea level to re-locate to Pacific Rim countries like Australia and New Zealand. While this process is unlikely to be largely problem-free, the presence of sizeable 65 Pacific Islander communities in cities like Auckland and Sydney does mean that in-country support for migrants is likely to be adequate (Bedford et al., 2007). 3.5. Resettlement flashpoints The major incidents alluded to at the end of the preceding section may take many forms. What is important is that public perceptions of these incidents will be sufficient to convince many people that climate change is really happening and that individual (and communal and national and regional) adaptation is unavoidable. It follows that the incidents will have to be (perceived as) without historical precedent and/or cause an unimagined degree of disruption to what are popularly perceived as \u201cnormal\u201d activities at a particular location. There are of course many permutations of circumstance that may meet these requirements but such an incident would perhaps need to have the following attributes. \uf0b7 It would not have to be a familiar occurrence, however extreme its effects. Thus it would probably not be the impact of a tropical cyclone, which are familiar if not annual occurrences in many western Pacific Island groups. Neither too could it be associated with a non-climate cause like tsunami or earthquake. \uf0b7 It would have to have an unprecedented effect, either in terms of its impact or its duration. If impact, then it might involve the flooding of a well-known coastal (or delta) settlement to an unprecedented depth, causing unprecedented disruption to livelihoods of the affected people, possibly to the extent that they declare that can never re-create their livelihoods at that location. If duration, then it could be that such a coastal settlement (or even a large stretch of inhabited coastline) is flooded for a month rather than a week, with the result that its inhabitants also declare that they will never return. \uf0b7 It would have to be widely noticed by people within the country (or countries) where the incident occurred, but also beyond. It would have to attract the attention of aid donors who might encourage the need for a long-term strategy like re-location. But the incident would have to receive enough publicity within the Pacific Islands region for many groups of people to re-examine their scepticism, even their denial, about climate change and its projected impacts. Given that these are perhaps the main criteria for an incident to have a region-wide impact on people\u2019s perceptions of climate change and the attendant need for adaptation, it is worth examining where such an incident might occur and what its most attention-grabbing attributes might be. It is likely that within the next ten years or so, a tropical Pacific atoll island will be impacted so severely by a storm that the island itself will be rendered uninhabitable and the people will have to be moved elsewhere permanently. But atolls are globally perceived as unusually vulnerable and there is a tendency among the peoples of higher Pacific Island groups to regard themselves as far less vulnerable \u2013 even", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e3fb1d73-0cce-4e72-9f6d-5a2121564d29": {"__data__": {"id_": "e3fb1d73-0cce-4e72-9f6d-5a2121564d29", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "40ef08da0a3824e61b458d53756ee3b8a9c62bfa9cd72baf4ed2eca35f161c40"}}, "hash": "40ef08da0a3824e61b458d53756ee3b8a9c62bfa9cd72baf4ed2eca35f161c40", "text": "though this view is somewhat fallacious (Nunn and Mimura, 1997). 66 It seems likely that the incident may be a storm impact, not associated with a tropical cyclone sensu stricto but perhaps rather a slow-moving tropical depression, that affects a major low- lying urban centre, such as Nadi in Fiji (see section 2.7), Nuku\u2019alofa in Tonga, Apia in Samoa, or even Suva (Fiji), the largest city in the independent Pacific Islands. The associated flooding might necessitate the closure of the urban centre for more than two weeks. 3.6. Effective communication \u2013 bridging the divide between science and society The failure of many initiatives over the past 25 years intended to develop and sustain effective adaptation to climate change can be attributed in large part to the misapprehension of the pathways of environmental decision-making as well as a naivete about how to communicate scientific imperatives around climate change effectively to Pacific Island people (see section 2.4). For the future, it is essential that such errors are not repeated for the imperative of effectively communicating climate change issues to people in this region is becoming daily more pressing. To encourage ownership of climate change (especially adaptation agendas) by Pacific Island people, at national and community levels, it is necessary to translate information about the science and impacts of climate change into appropriate vernacular languages. Translation in this context does not simply mean translating words but also ensuring that the concepts are effectively communicated; for example, the phrase \u201cclimate-change adaptation\u201d is one that many second-language speakers struggle to comprehend, yet it is something that Pacific Island people have been doing (without giving it such a label) for generations. In addition to translation, appropriate cultural avenues of communication must be utilized for discussions of climate change. These include appropriate cultural settings as well as other strategies to encourage buy-in, especially at community level. One of these strategies, tried and tested in a Pacific Island context by Veitayaki et al. (2003) and Aalbersberg et al. (2005), is participatory community risk assessment (van Aalst et al., 2008). A similar approach is Participatory Learning and Action (PLA), which has also been successfully trialled in a rural Pacific Islands situation (Terry and Khatri, 2009). The basic approach of both is to engage communities who are experiencing problems with environmental management, perhaps manifested as diminishing food resources or faecal pollution of water sources, and facilitate the identification of solutions by key members of those communities. Scientific information is offered to the communities to help inform their decision about which of several possible solutions is to be adopted, but since the purpose of such methods is to ensure sustained community buy-in of a particular solution, it is critical that outsider knowledge is not imposed on community decision-making, at least without umprompted invitation. The gender dimensions of climate change in the Pacific Islands have only recently been acknowledged as important (Lane and McNaught, 2009). Surveys reported in this work find that gender awareness of particular aspects of ecosystem fragility are widespread in the Pacific Islands. Clearly, if such awareness is factored in to adaptation strategies, then they 67 are likely to be more effective and sustainable than they might otherwise be. Yet the awareness of gender roles and the desire to increase gender sensitivity among Pacific Island communities must be done within culturally-appropriate ways if it is to be successful and not run the risk of generating a backlash from communities. It is clear that there also needs to be increased communication between climate scientists and social scientists for the Pacific islands region. Few climate scientists, aware of the nature of future climate projections and their impacts on physical environments, are communicating effectively with social scientists, who understand better the likely effects of these projections on people in this region. Improved communication between the two types of scientist would be a first step to more effective engagement of key stakeholders in the region, both in governments and as representatives of civil society. 4. Production, Exchange and Consumption: a broad outline To understand the range of adaptation options and strategies available to human societies in and around the Pacific Islands region, Table 4.1 identifies and weights the principal sources of production, exchange and consumption. Table 4.1. Principal components of production, exchange and consumption in the Pacific Islands region Each of these three components is discussed further in the following subsections. 4.1. Understanding production in the Pacific Islands For the purposes of this discussion, production is defined as the use of resources to generate goods and services.

Given that most such resources are not processed (or processed only slightly) within the region also loses value for the region. There are some exceptions, such as the crushing of sugar cane in Fiji (which would otherwise make sugar export uneconomical). Yet given the abundance of fresh produce (fruit and vegetables) grown in the region, it is unfortunate that there are so few region-based enterprises that add value to these before they are exported. Much the same is true for commercial fisheries, which are generally in deepwater and operated by foreign fishing fleets that pay host countries only nominal licence fees (Hannesson, 2008). In a few countries, notably Fiji and American Samoa, there are fish processing facilities that produce end products like canned tuna but these are few compared to the numbers of fish caught. There is a burgeoning market for the export by air of rapidly frozen fish species, especially to Japan, something that illustrates well the ways in which production is undervalued in the Pacific Islands (Swartz et al., 2010). There is good evidence that deepwater fishing activities in parts of the Pacific Islands region are unsustainable and will inevitably lead to a reduction in future fish production (Bell et al., 2009). One component of commercial agriculture and fisheries that is important to note is the trend for small-scale farmers and artisanal fishers, particularly in peri-urban areas, to produce surpluses for sale to urban dwellers. This aspect of this sector is poorly understood but is likely to be implicated in the increasing decline in the production potential of such places and their increasing vulnerability to weather-driven changes and price fluctuations (McGregor et al., 2009). Forestry is an activity that continues be a way in which production in the Pacific Islands region benefits Pacific Rim countries (to which wood is exported) far more than those where it is produced. The rampant deforestation of many islands and island groups has caused widespread concern (Hviding and Bayliss-Smith, 2000). Replanting of logged forests occurs in a few places, while initiatives like REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries) hold out hope that fewer forests will disappear in the future in this region. Loss of forests not only exposes the land often leading to rapid degradation but also removes a whole range of ecosystem services for local subsistence dwellers, who commonly gain little from their logging (Lomo, 2001). In efforts to boost Pacific Island economies, some countries have developed small manufacturing sectors that usually import primary products (such as cloth) from elsewhere and add value to them (by making garments) before exporting them. The success of such activities is usually contingent on favourable trade agreements with destination countries, something that can be withdrawn at will (Gani, 2010). Mining is perhaps the best example of high-cost production in the Pacific islands region since almost all the products of mining in the islands are exported with often no or minimal in- region processing. Examples range from the phosphate mining on Nauru and Banaba islands (Cox, 2009), which has left most of the landscapes unable to be utilized for any other purpose, through nickel mining on New Caledonia to gold mining throughout the region (Connell, 2010). Future prospects of increased offshore mining throughout the region are unlikely to prove any more beneficial to Pacific Island nations. 69 The least wasteful production sector in Table 4.1 is subsistence agriculture and fisheries which, by definition, have low environmental impacts and short distances to consumers. This is not to say that this sector does not have stresses associated particularly with unsustainable demands on particular systems or their inadvertent degradation (Thaman, 1982; Popkin and Horton, 2001; FAO, 2008). Tourism is a growing sector in some countries of the region but is in many ways a mixed blessing because much of the value of the production (sun, sand and sea) is exported. This is not only because most of the largest and most profitable tourism enterprises have offshore owners but also because most of the material used to enhance the tourism experience (from deckchairs to food) is also imported to the region (Singh, 2008; Narayan et al., 2010). Opportunities for reducing the loss of production from the Pacific Islands region are comparatively few and require the agreement", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6a1dfe48-dd54-458c-8c82-ca0742c0d0b6": {"__data__": {"id_": "6a1dfe48-dd54-458c-8c82-ca0742c0d0b6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3a9329f2515d0c39aca9acf04ea08278bfcfcf02ba5be991ea63f710f4389ba4"}}, "hash": "3a9329f2515d0c39aca9acf04ea08278bfcfcf02ba5be991ea63f710f4389ba4", "text": "of multiple countries, both within and outside the region, which seems unlikely. Perhaps the best opportunities lie in adding more value to exports so that they receive a higher price in their destination countries, but the cost of infrastructure associated with this value-add is prohibitive for many countries. With this in mind, the more helpful strategy for the future, especially with the threats from climate change increasing, is to conserve natural production systems to ensure that they continue to help sustain the peoples of the Pacific islands for the foreseeable future (Connell, 2010; Barnett, 2011). 4.2. Understanding trans-ocean exchange in the Pacific Islands The Pacific Ocean is the largest in the world. As the largest carbon sink on the planet, there is global interest in keeping it healthy. Yet inevitably the Pacific Ocean is crossed regularly by numerous ship and air traffic that both uses energy and, through pollution, contributes to the depletion of the health of this vast ocean. This is something that is insidious and little discussed, yet is clearly important to this region\u2019s future. Examples include the transport of airborne pollutants across the region from continental source areas (Wang et al., 2009) and the transport of waterborne viruses in ships\u2019 ballast tanks (Leichsenring and Lawrence, 2011). 4.3. Understanding consumption in the Pacific Islands Most people in the Pacific Islands region depend in part on the consumption of imported foods every day (FAO, 2008. The trend away from locally-produced foods is one that has been noted for some time (Thaman, 1982; Barnett, 2007; McGregor et al., 2009). In addition, increased food insecurity has resulted from the loss of traditional knowledge among communities in many parts of the region about food preservation and storage techniques that were likely to have been developed as ways of withstanding prolonged food shortages (Mercer et al., 2007; Nunn, 2009b; Barnett and Campbell, 2010). 70 Besides food, many other items are imported into Pacific Island countries simply in order to sustain life and livelihoods. The disproportionately high costs of importing such goods and the general lack of government revenue to pay for them often means that most capital projects are aid-funded. This in turn creates a condition of involuntary dependency for many island countries to which there is no alternative if they are to remain supplied with hospitals and highways, besides many other things (Duncan, 2008). Power is a conspicuous example of consumption that has generally high costs in all Pacific island countries (Mishra et al., 2009), despite the continuing promise of renewable energy development using sun, wind, waves, water or locally-manufactured biofuels (Mala et al., 2009; Cloin, 2007). Future consumption is unlike to improve across sectors with concerted regional consensus for change and considerable sustained support from traditional donor countries. 5. Recommendations for Reducing Impacts of Future Climate Change Given the lessons of the recent past, it is possible to issue several recommendations (in bold throughout this chapter) that are thought likely to bring about effective and sustainable adaptation to projected climate change in the Pacific Islands region. It is worth dwelling for a moment on what is intended by \u201ceffective\u201d and \u201csustainable\u201d adaptation. Adaptation must be effective in the sense that it is the right solution for the particular aspects of climate change that a nation or community wishes to adapt to. For example, it is neither simply enough to uncritically transpose adaptive solutions from a continental to an island country nor from a \u201cdeveloped\u201d to a \u201cdeveloping\u201d country. Such adaptive solutions must be tailored to the particular environment. They must also be designed in such a way that local stakeholders buy-in to their implementation and understand how they are expected to solve particular problems. Adaptation must also be sustainable in the sense that Pacific Island governments and local communities must be able to sustain adaptive solutions for the foreseeable future. This requires that such people comprehend these solutions and that they have the resources (financial/material and human) to sustain them indefinitely. For example, artificial shoreline structures may be unduly expensive for a (largely) subsistence community to maintain whereas a replanted mangrove forest along the coastal fringe would not be. This chapter is organized by the key stakeholders in climate-change adaptation in the Pacific Islands, namely international partners (section 5.1), regional agencies and national governments (section 5.2), communities (section 5.3), non-government organizations (section 5.4), and individuals (section 5.5). 71 5.1. International partners: effective interventions and assistance There is no doubt that international assistance (aid) will continue to flow into the Pacific Islands over the next few decades to help underwrite the costs of climate-change adaptation. Some of this aid will", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fd422710-7d40-4801-8398-8416d5bbbaa1": {"__data__": {"id_": "fd422710-7d40-4801-8398-8416d5bbbaa1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d764ee73cc9dc528972d519f12168e1845bb200b60132f126e5dfa85d3b9ca69"}}, "hash": "d764ee73cc9dc528972d519f12168e1845bb200b60132f126e5dfa85d3b9ca69", "text": "be bilateral, flowing from one country to another. Some will be for the region as a whole, directed largely through regional agencies or international bodies (such as the GEF). The latter aid will include many traditional flows but also far larger sums through initiatives like the Global Adaptation Fund for developing countries that was established post-COP-15 in 2010. As the problems posed by climate change become more serious and widespread in the next 20-30 years, so international partners will likely become more concerned about making a difference than they appear to have been up to this point. To this end, Recommendation 1: It is recommended that international partners of Pacific Island nations make far greater efforts to ensure the effectiveness of their assistance for climate-change adaptation. This would involve understanding the pathways of environmental decision-making in the Pacific Islands region and intervening where this can be most effective. At this point in time, this might seem to involve less assistance directly to regional agencies and to national governments, which generally have a poor track record of delivering effective and sustainable adaptation, and more directly to communities where almost all environmental decision- making in this region is currently carried out. There might be less emphasis on capacity- building through formal qualifications and more emphasis on empowering community leaders to make sensible and far-sighted decisions about the environments they control for the benefit of the people who live there. Most of the communication for empowerment should be in vernacular languages, use familiar concepts, and acknowledge cultural mores. There should be less emphasis on financing and more emphasis on action assistance. International partner countries might consider training cohorts of appropriately-educated people to go and live for prolonged periods in vulnerable communities and guide their thinking about effective and sustainable adaptation. International partners might also be able to intervene strategically. One example is around re-location of vulnerable communities. In many situations, neither governments nor community leaders are seriously considering re-location because of the prohibitively high costs involved. Were an international donor able to underwrite the costs of identifying and developing the site for such a community to move to, it might encourage the government to adopt re-location as a long-term adaptive strategy and, more pragmatically, for the community in question to start to re-locate. Once other communities had witnessed this occurrence and comprehended its long-term benefits, it might encourage them to follow suit. 72 5.2. Regional and national (government) action With a trend towards increased regionalism in the Pacific Islands, the time is ripe for regional agencies to be invested with a greater power of self-determination, allowing them to develop proactive agendas, particularly around climate change. External (ODA) funding of their core budgets would allow them to assume a stewardship role for the environments of the Pacific island nations and become independent (to some extent) from a focus on short-term goals. As long as these regional agencies remain subordinate to member governments, they will continue to be largely reactive and ineffectual in developing and implementing long-term and sustainable adaptive strategies. For the purposes of environmental management in the face to climate change, regional agencies should be encouraged to think beyond political boundaries more than they do. There are many commonalities among island types and environments within the region that transcend political borders. For example, the problems faced by atoll islands in Kiribati are much the same as those in Tuvalu. Regional agencies should also be at the forefront of new approaches to embedding effective and sustainable adaptation to climate change. National governments must themselves ponder their roles in climate-change adaptation for their constituents. These governments must be encouraged to think long-term and their citizens must be effectively engaged so that they understand why governments may have to pursue policies that appear anti-development. In larger and archipelagic Pacific Island countries, governments should be prepared to relinquish some of their aspirations about mainstreaming effective and sustainable climate- change adaptation throughout their countries, and should support the efforts of their international partners to reach out directly to communities. In such countries, national governments still have important roles in helping their citizens understand and buy-in to adaptation. Recommendation 2: Regional agencies and governments should realistically examine the effectiveness of their present aspirations around climate-change adaptation, and re- define their roles accordingly. 5.3. Community-level action For most of the Pacific Islands region, the only road to effective and sustainable adaptation for climate change during the 21st century is for local-area communities (and civil society more generally) to be given the information they need to make informed decisions about their preferred long-term interactions with the environments they occupy.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1791b3ce-05bf-4979-9fe0-8c4b9832119a": {"__data__": {"id_": "1791b3ce-05bf-4979-9fe0-8c4b9832119a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2a5b33d9ffb661e7345bb39ac658777eed64217bc2476257457082d6d60b442f"}, "3": {"node_id": "1a2fa127-907c-407b-a8ae-cc63eb403867", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2e301da4a9e05d8f16d101eda1db63265716773b42603642094cff4571b5d5fc"}}, "hash": "4c3ee8c4f655200395786ad6fbc78603de56635f8186043c4db868b26b04ffb7", "text": "There seems no chance that in most island countries, national or sub-national top-down governance will ever become strong enough to ensure this kind of adaptation. Given the hierarchical nature of most Pacific Island societies, it is sensible to target \u201cpersons of influence\u201d (such as community leaders like \u201cchiefs\u201d, religious leaders, school teachers, as 73 well as private sector leaders) within particular communities and instruct these persons in appropriate ways about what is happening and what is likely to happen to their environments. Emphasis should be placed on community participation in decision-making yet the instruction must also include scientific knowledge about future climate change. Recommendation 3: Persons of influence in Pacific Island communities should be empowered to make informed and sustainable decisions about the environments they occupy. In this context, it is also important to harness the natural inbuilt resilience of Pacific Island societies (discussed in section 1.4) ensuring, for example, that there is encouragement for maintaining traditional support networks based on kinship. Tradition can also be called upon to develop strategies, perhaps informally or through traditional forms of legislation, for giving land to family groups who lose their (useful) land as a result of sea-level rise, for example. 5.4. Role of non-government organizations (NGOs) Many of the needs of the region for climate-change adaptation may not be readily accomplished because they lie outside the normal areas in which governments, regional agencies, and their international partners operate. While it is hoped that this may change in the next few decades, NGOs have a potentially significant role to play at least in the interim. This role could involve the translation and communication of information about climate change to stakeholders utilising appropriate media, especially radio. The most effective communication in Pacific Island societies remains face-to-face and NGOs (including religious organizations) are well placed to undertake this. International partners might well help underwrite the costs of particular NGOs undertaking this kind of work, which would in turn require the NGOs to jettison some of the more partisan parts of their agendas around climate change and work more closely with regional agencies to ensure that everyone is delivering a similar message. 5.5. Individual understanding and action Most people in the Pacific Islands presently have an imperfect understanding of climate change and its potential to adversely affect their livelihoods over the next few decades. For optimal adaptation to occur, this situation needs to change: awareness needs to be raised. There are several ways of accomplishing this. All groups discussed in sections 5.1-5.4 have the capacity and the ability to help raise awareness among Pacific Island people about climate change; there is potential for targeting females and youth. There is also a role for formal inculcation in school and university 74 syllabi. There is also a need for printed material in appropriate vernaculars, as well as material utilizing other audiovisual media. The public media have a huge role in raising awareness about climate change in the Pacific Islands region, a role to which they appear to have been largely indifferent. These media should become better-informed, less subordinated to their foreign counterparts, and less sympathetic to marginal (fringe) interpretations of climate-change futures. Many organizations can work together to give Pacific Island people an improved understanding of the vulnerable environments they occupy and how these might change in the future. 75 Bibliography Aalbersberg, W., Tawake, A. and Parras, T. 2005.

The authors wish to thank Christian Roth, Liana Williams and Tanya Jakimow (CSIRO); Sharmin Afroz, Khodeza Hossain and Ishtiaque Shams (SERDI) for their valuable input as well as the HDRU team at the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and Mozaharul Alam at the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) for greatly improving the report. ii Abstract The study addresses the variation in adaptive capacity of farmers located in Asian deltas due to different forms of resource availability and institutional governance as well as physical location. The data presented in this paper suggests that adaptive capacity is highly volatile and depends on a vast number of factors and influences even in a general area considered \u2018vulnerable\u2019. The analysis shows that the specific set of resources available to communities differentiate potentials for adaptation. Institutions govern the availability of resources and thereby determine the level of adaptive capacity of a community or household. The analysis concludes that any future strengthening of adaptive capacity needs to take current adaptation into account in order to create ownership among beneficiaries and become effective. Finally, a framework for policy interventions is introduced that targets four main areas influencing institutional adaptive capacity (a) households, (b) government, (c) community and (d) markets. Key words: climate adaptation; adaptive capacity; deltas; smallholders; Bangladesh; Cambodia; climate change.
