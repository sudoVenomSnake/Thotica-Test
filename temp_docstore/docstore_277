Exchange offers can be part of corruption, as can threats, and \u2018throffers\u2019 (making people offers they cannot refuse). The resources used to corrupt people can range from goods and money through to violence. Indeed, there is a tendency in research to systematically ignore the coercive character of many corrupt exchanges. One reason for this is that the standard definition of the misuse of office for private gain, implicitly rules out misuse for self-protection and in response to coercion. In my view it should not. Conclusion: I do think embezzlement after a certain point is a type of corruption we want to capture, but I do not think it should be made the core of a definition of corruption (as it tends 67 to be). While there is some discomfort in the fact that the core I identify (involving transactive relations between three agents) seems to exclude embezzlement, the definition is proposed as capturing a typical view of what happens when the use of public office becomes systematically distorted. For the reasons outlined here and elsewhere I do not believe we will find a perfect definition that provides necessary and sufficient conditions for identifying all cases of corruption, as the example of treason suggests. But I do think the definition I proposed steers us to search for what is most essential to the concept, even if we need to add cases that do not meet all the conditions but meet some and are consistent with the idea of a systematic distortion in the exercise of public office. This exchange persuades me, however, that the definition should stress the key components of my view (listed as three in the original note), and should see these as identifying the core of corruption. We should thus either resist having a one sentence definitional summary of these three components (such as that given in the paper), or should hedge it in more openly with reservations, so that it reads something as follows: Corruption in politics occurs where a public official (A), acting in ways that violate the rules and norms of office, that may involve personal, partisan or sectional gain, harms the interests of (B) (the public or some sub-section there-of) who is the designated beneficiary of that office, to benefit either themselves or (C) a third party who rewards or otherwise incentivises A to gain access to goods or services they would not otherwise obtain. Ramachandran AL Ramasamy, National Information Technology Council (NITC), Malaysia, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Ramachandran AL Ramasamy responds to Charmaine Rodrigues on broad awareness-raising media tools. Ramachandran agrees that radio is a proven cost-effective tool in Malaysia too, but is not yet used enough for anti-corruption. I fully agree on Charmaine Rodrigues pertinent point that nations are at different levels of readiness as far as embracing e-media is concerned. Naturally, differing policy and programme strategies as well as options are needed in building the envisaged information and knowledge-rich societies underpinned by a knowledge-driven economy. In fact even within a country there is great disparity in access to information.

Shufflers, Starters and Sleepers towards addressing the emerging concern on Bridging Digital Divide that Government of Malaysia has adopted as an important policy thrust in the current Ninth Malaysia Plan (2006-2010). This classification entailed not only contemporary media such as internet, computer, mobile phone but also traditional media that includes radio, television and fax. Perhaps, similar classifications of nations could be generated to not only address the issues and challenges of emerging disparities on access to ICT connectivity and information but also for formulating strategies in combating corruption from the international perspective. Returning to Charmaine\u2019s point I concur that radio has been the cheapest and most effective tool for disseminating information to the masses, besides providing entertainment. Indeed, in Malaysia almost 95 percent (if not all) households have radio and television coverage and these two forms of media have been playing an aggressive role in disseminating information to the masses even in the rural and remote parts of the country.

Recently by chance I happened to watch a local TV programme showing actual clips on how workers can get a medical certificate even if they are not sick. In fact, the programme host herself disguised herself as a worker seeking a medical certificate from private clinics in a bid to illustrate the corrupt practices that medical professionals exercise. Surprisingly such practices are rampant in the country. I am not aware how many doctors would have watched that particular programme, but those who did (in particular doctors and public subscribing to such irresponsible practices) would have received a strong signal that the media is playing an innovative role in combating corrupt practices. Phil Matsheza, UNDP Bureau for Development Policy, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Phil Matsheza questions whether it is possible to curb corruption by controlling just corruption\u2019s \u2018demand\u2019 side (public officials) or just the \u2018supply\u2019 side (private sector, citizens). Phil then notes a growing concern that corruption perception indices skew the true picture of \u2018demand\u2019. \u2018Perception\u2019 tends to reflect everyday familiarity with petty corruption rather than grand corruption because this is what the general public is exposed to in their reading and viewing. An implication for 69 the poor (at least those to whom distribution strategies reach) is that grand corruption could have a comparatively greater impact on resources available for distribution. My contribution will focus on the demand and supply equation. Can you curb corruption by controlling just one side of this relationship? There is a growing concern that corruption perceptions are influenced by the demand side. One popular case involves Lesotho, a small African country which successfully prosecuted a number of companies from several of developed countries. The countries in which these companies are domiciled did not take any action against their companies participating in bribery of foreign officials. Although these countries have all ratified or acceded to the OECD Convention, they failed to take any visible action against these companies. I do not have any example from Asia in this regard. The question of whether to put more emphasis on demand or supply might be influenced by the nature of the corrupt activity, resources and the nature of the transaction. With petty corruption, it is easier to deal with the supply side by, for example, setting up traps. Rounding up traffic police who demand bribes, or other officials who demand bribes for duties they are supposed to perform anyway, can lead to a dramatic fall in bribe solicitation. A major crackdown of the demand side can have immediate results but if not sustainable, the situation will recur again. Those who have been involved with grand corruption know that the numbers tend to be few but the sums involved are large. These instances tend to be more sophisticated and thus can take years to trace. The perpetrators are usually politically connected and a fair amount of resources and inside knowledge is needed to prosecute the suppliers. Instances of successfully prosecuting grand corruption cases are isolated and we remember these cases precisely because they are rare and isolated. One problem with perception indices is that they tend to reflect the level of petty corruption, primarily because that is what citizens encounter in their every day lives. Unfortunately this can lead to a tendency to underplay the role of grand corruption which numerically could lead to more leakages of resources than petty corruption.

I think that we can say that the AP-HD Network has a good deal of intellectual firepower! It is evident however that there is still a need for conceptual clarity on the definition of corruption. Contributors have shared their concerns over the commonly accepted definition, including its overly legalistic nature, its dependence on the Weberian concept of the civil service (bureaucracy), its relationship to culture, its restriction to the public sector, and so on. The issue of culture was raised and discussed at length during the Pacific stakeholders consultation in November 2006 but figured only marginally in the East Asia and South Asia consultations (although this does not necessarily imply that culture is not important in these sub-regions). Indeed, many stakeholders from the Pacific were concerned by the tension, if not outright conflict, between \u2018introduced\u2019 systems and institutions and indigenous ones. The perception was that it is the competition for authority that generates cultural tensions. The East Asia consultation was more concerned with issues of implementation and strict enforcement (legislation, formal anti-corruption agencies), while state capture and the role of NGO\u2019s featured prominently in the South Asian Consultation, which was held in February 2007. Usaia Ratuvili, writing from Fiji, raised the \u2018cultural aspect of reciprocal gift giving\u2019 which is in conflict with the legalistic notion of corruption but it also fosters a \u2018welfare mentality\u2019. Particularly in the small Pacific islands, it is difficult to disentangle culture from other aspects of life: the small population means that everyone knows everyone or has a personal relationship with almost everyone and so it is like one big family. Fayyaz Baqir, while admitting the need \u2018to know the cultural context\u2019 of corruption, argues that the \u2018question is not what corruption is and what it is not\u2019. The crucial issues, he says, \u2018is to 71 decide on which side of it we are on\u2019. Yet this perspective requires a clear understanding of what corruption is or is not. Just as important, is to think about what it is, that enables one to decide which side of the fence one should be on? How do we know what is right and what is not? One way or the other, it seems the issue of culture creeps into the definition of corruption. This may well be for the simple reason that corruption is also a social category. As such, any definition of it cannot be universalized. Others outside of this forum have argued that the fascination with corruption is but another attempt to impose a western notion onto societies that are different in terms of culture, levels of development, history and colonial legacy, and dependence. Mark Philp, attempting to bring conceptual tidiness to a fuzzy concept, writes: \u2018The result is that what counts as corruption depends on certain objective aspects of a situation ... and on the (local) norms and rules that structure public office.\u2019 While he did not mention the word \u2018culture\u2019 in his contribution, I suppose that \u2018values and norms\u2019 have their roots in culture. It seems likely, therefore, that Philp\u2019s notion of corruption is not free of cultural influences. The discussion thus far has focused on the concept of corruption and the means employed to take on this pathology. If I am not mistaken, not too much has been said about the end goal, but there is the idea of \u2018zero tolerance\u2019 of corruption. Does this imply zero corruption? Even if conceivable theoretically, is zero level of corruption possible - or even desirable in practice? Can an argument be made for a level of corruption that is consistent with the structural features, norms and values of a society? Is there something like a \u2018natural rate of corruption\u2019 ? I would like to return to the contribution made by Mark Philp. In my view, he has added a good deal of conceptual clarity to an elusive issue, but I have a few issues and concerns. I fully agree that not all misuse of entrusted power constitutes corruption but only a \u2018particular type of misuse\u2019 - i.e. those that \u2018distort the political process\u2019. For the purposes of the APHDR, we will need to distinguish clearly corruption from crime. Since breaking the law is an important aspect of a crime, is \u2018misuse\u2019 the same as breaking the law? When does the line between corruption and crime become blurred? Second, it would seem that \u2018political corruption\u2019 mostly finds expression in grand corruption and state capture. It seems that rule-breaking (beyond misuse) is involved in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8224fb15-4888-47db-a1ba-6347b9b40f36": {"__data__": {"id_": "8224fb15-4888-47db-a1ba-6347b9b40f36", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Transforming Corruption through Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "711156f5b22ce1d7ba4ae7be1488ccc272c254d71237e35dc6870bd8d89d9afa"}, "3": {"node_id": "330ce332-8186-452d-bf3c-3e43ebd197cf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a70d6737eabd846b5a3701a9e7ccd8179ff279159f554b7327e4227345b5b3cd"}}, "hash": "377621455fda3a7b997684854d9a3b0b710325968b625c3a163ec1f57b38d39f", "text": "the former; for the latter, manipulation to legalize illegal processes is apparently more important. Even so, one wonders about the extent to which legalistic ideas are influenced by culture. Of course, there are many societies (and cultures) where jurisprudence has its roots in their own traditions and culture. Political Economy 72 Asia Pacific Human Development Network Third, Philp tells us that \u2018three actors are involved or affected by corrupt activity\u2019 but it would seem that the intended beneficiary of the office (the power of which is being misused) is a sleeper party, which is perhaps difficult to identify (it is the public?); this party may not even know that its benefits are being compromised. Thus, while the \u2018triadic relation\u2019 is useful analytically it also requires a clear identification of intended benefits and beneficiaries, which complicates the issues. Is this really a useful distinction in practice? Finally, Philp makes the important point that a corrupt act may be done not only for private gain but also for partisan or sectional interests. This is a useful clarification. My last point revolves around the supply-and-demand issues raised by Bill Tod and Ajit Mishra. One strand of the \u2018demand\u2019 argument (Tod) centres on the empowerment of stakeholders to reduce corruption. We agree and have even come up with the label \u2018voice and choice\u2019 to draw attention to the need to empower poor people to demand change. The question is: how does one do this? Does it require simultaneous and sustained action on other fronts? Do we really have to wait until the long term for the benefits to arrive? (Iam reminded about what Lord Keynes said about the long-run) Ajit also prefers that we \u2018concentrate more on the demand factors\u2019. However, he bases his argument (unlike Tod, who derives his from the need to \u2018secure good governance\u2019) on the near impossibility of implementing anti-bribery laws at the international level and on the imperatives of global competition. This perhaps a valid argument but it fails to factor in the \u2018corruption equation\u2019 - the cross-border (and cross-continent) aspects of corruption. While Switzerland (and other banking off-shore havens) may be clean, it facilitates corruption in other countries. In other words it is a \u2018legal facilitator\u2019 of corruption. Many corrupt Third World politician and business persons have perfectly legal, inflated overseas accounts. The CPI - and other like measures - do not capture this aspect and thus absolve legal facilitators from their role in facilitating corruption in other countries. Of course, one can argue that this is still within the domain of the demand side of the argument, but the demand exists only because off-shore havens provide the supply. To sum up, I think that it would be a mistake to allocate only a minor significance to the \u2018supply of corruption.\u2019 Could it be that the 19th century French economist, Jean-Baptiste Say, is still wrong: demand creates its own supply! 73 R. Sudarshan, UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Sudarshan questions the view that corruption is endemic to Asian culture. If, as he suggests, we accepted that people are mostly honest, we could develop a very different analytical approach. Sudarshan recommends that we should be less preoccupied with structural-functional features that facilitate giving and taking. It is more useful to focus and study the behaviour of individuals who practise integrity. For example, one could study how and why honest political leaders survive and examine where the norm is to elevate self interest over public good. Is the norm insufficient cause where there is capability? Does capability make these leaders less influenced by cultural perceptions of \u2018normal\u2019 practice?

Why not focus on the behaviour of individuals who do not engage in these practices. The Comparative Research on Poverty Group, based in Bergen, reverses the usual analysis of why people are poor what their coping and survival strategies are?; and what can be done to eliminate poverty?; It asks: why are some people rich?; how do they get richer?; and what can be done to limit their power when that is held responsible for \u2018producing poverty\u2019? Indeed, the concept of human development is a similar kind of reversal of the traditional thinking about economics - \u2018Wealth is not the good we seek, we seek it for the sake of something else\u2019, Political Economy 74 Asia Pacific Human Development Network said Aristotle, and the first HDR proceeded to examine some of those things that human beings seek, for which wealth could be a help. The drift of my thinking is that we should perhaps focus a bit more on individuals\u2019 motivations and behaviour, instead of structural features of economies and polities, and on institutional factors that have a bearing on corruption, and ask: why and how some people remain honest in otherwise corrupt environments? This is not to deny that certain institutional/structural factors (e.g. variants of democracy, political institutions, voting turn-out, political stability, level of economic development, size of unofficial economy, trade openness, public sector wage rates, etc.) are involved in fostering or discouraging corruption. Other factors cited as additional causes of corruption are population density, geography, mineral wealth, state formations, colonial legacies, social heterogeneity, inequality, religion, media and political culture (see Gerring and Thacker 2004). However, restructuring institutions and structures will not help unless it also has an impact on changing the behaviour of individuals. That is why asking \u2018how is it that some people remain honest when all around them others are engaged in corruption?\u2019, could give a clue to motivations and behaviour, particularly in areas vulnerable to corruption. In India, a rather surprisingly large number of civil servants are honest, and they are the ones who have welcomed the Right to Information Act, and supported the resistance to dilute the legislation. Even some politicians are reputedly honest and incorruptible - notably prime-ministers Dr Manmohan Singh, and before him Pandit Nehru, Lal Bahadur Sastri, and Morarji Desai. In Pandit Nehru\u2019s first Cabinet, T.T. Krishanamachari was the Finance Minister. He was, for a while, also the Treasurer of the Indian National Congress. There are reported accounts of his policy of refusing to accept cash contributions to the party, insisting on cheques, at a time when banking was poorly developed in the country, in order to avoid the risk of filling the party coffers with \u2018black money\u2019. TTK, as he was known, as also the only Finance Minister to resign from office, when a corruption scandal involving the Life Insurance Corporation (state-owned, and under Finance Ministry control) and a businessman call Mundhra, came to light. How, and why, do political leaders like the ones mentioned survive (or not survive) in what is admitted to be a corrupt quagmire? Are decisions to engage in corrupt behaviour primarily influenced by personal understanding of what constitutes corruption, and perceptions of how widespread corrupt activities are in the respective settings of individuals? 75 There was, allegedly, a close relative of a former prime minister of India, who helped exporters of rice to the Soviet Union get the required permits and quotas, and payments made for the purpose were considered by him, and his counterparts in the Soviet Union trade mission, as commission payments. It is another matter that the traders who exported the rice found the money to afford these commissions by exporting to Russia low-priced \u2018Patna\u2019 rice, labelled as high-priced \u2018basmati\u2019 rice, assuming that the Russian consumer would not know the difference, anyway. As Ray points out, culture certainly has an influence in this story. The \u2018Indian commission agent\u2019 was alleged to have accepted briefcases filled with currency notes only on days that were considered auspicious for the Lakshmi \u2013 known as the Goddess of Wealth in the Hindu religion.

The principal policy implication that I am trying to emphasise is the importance of \u2018critical insiders\u2019 (followers of the faith, who are leaders disposed to reform religiously sanctioned practices that are inconsistent with, say, international human rights norms), and their role in educating the public about what is right and what is wrong. One might also hazard the view that people, who follow \u2018The Book\u2019, in the practice of their faiths, are more likely to have a firm belief on ethics that could influence their behaviour in this life, whereas adherents of faiths that have the doctrine of Karma could consider postponing their good behaviour to a later life. Cross-cultural differences in the definition of corruption, and individual disposition to engage in corrupt behaviour, should therefore be taken more seriously. Phil Matsheza, UNDP Bureau for Development Policy, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Phil Matsheza reflects on Roy Laifungbam\u2019s thoughts on the cultural, nature of corruption, and whether corruption is culturally relative, or a universal phenomenon where pan- human norms and standards can be applied. Phil notes that the UN Convention against Corruption Political Economy 76 Asia Pacific Human Development Network asserts it is indeed universal. This surfaces, Phil notes, in a 14 country study where individuals could readily identify corruption. Despite its universal qualities, it was visible to them in the localised ways corruption distorts local cultural norms. I have enjoyed reading the contributions by Roy Laifungbam. In short the question is whether corruption is culturally relative, or whether it is a universal phenomenon which can be regulated by universal norms and standards? I do not come from Asia and I have only briefly worked in Central Asia and I heard exactly the same argument Roy eloquently makes. What I mean to say is that in Asia, corruption is a way of life. The negotiations for the adoption of the United Nations Convention against Corruption established that corruption was a universal phenomenon and no country was free from it and nor is any culture free from it either. The concept of corruption has the same principles and values that we find in good governance, democracy and human rights such as: o Transparency o Accountability o Participation o Integrity o Inclusiveness o Non-discrimination These are principles that underpin governance and I think they are found in all cultures. I was once involved in a research to assess whether people in a particular region covering 14 countries, felt that corruption was a cultural phenomenon. The results of the study showed that the people could identify corruption primarily because they considered it an abuse and a deviation that was taking advantage of cultural norms meant to serve different purposes.

Any corruption is or should be, both illegal and prosecuted if we are to have any chance of wiping out the practice. If companies lost their trading licences for offering illegal bribes that would serve as a huge disincentive for offering them. On the other hand if people went to jail for both offering the bribe and for accepting it then this would provide a disincentive for accepting it. I think the true difficulty with corruption is that we accept that it is now a normal part of everyday life and that allows it to thrive. We must insist that consumer nations prosecute illegal practices and that supplier nations equally go after their side of the offence. To do less is to accept that the practice is beyond our control. Phil Matsheza, UNDP Bureau for Development Policy, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Phil Matsheza responds to Mark Philp\u2019s discussion on defining corruption, noting that \u2018systematic distortions\u2019 play a part in UN-viewed parameters of \u2018corruption\u2019. Phil concurs with the broader suggestion of Mark\u2019s definition but beyond political dimensions, needed primarily because corruption does not always fit easily into the political category. I would like to comment on Mark Philp\u2019s argument. It is true that when we talk of corruption, we are considering systematic distortions and patterns to some extent. The United Nations Conventions against Corruption (UNCAC) avoids defining corruption for many reasons. When one looks at national legislations, most do not define corruption but components of corruption such as embezzlement, fraud etc. The TI definition is not a legal definition and it has been accepted, that while it captures most elements of the phenomenon Political Economy 78 Asia Pacific Human Development Network of corruption, as Mark rightly observes it is not all encompassing. Here are some further thoughts: 1) Embezzlement is usually both an ordinary crime and a corruption crime depending on the nature, circumstances etc. 2) Mark\u2019s definition does highlight an area that is usually lost in defining corruption. But it also leans more towards political corruption, a field that is gaining increasing importance. However since not all corruption will fall under this category, it is not comprehensive enough. 3) I have made earlier contributions on \u2018corruption and culture\u2019 and will not repeat them except to underscore that UNCAC looks at corruption as a universal phenomenon and not as a culturally relative concept. I would like to thank Mark for a discussion I found very stimulating and thought provoking.

I have been following with avid interest the e-discussion on corruption. It is a complex and intricate phenomenon with endless dimensions to it including socio-economic, political, cultural and religious threads. Corruption has many connotations. To some it is misuse of authority for vested/personal interests, lack of integrity or moral perversion while others view it as being in a state of progressive putrefaction. Call it by any name; it is a vice, a curse and an evil which no society in the world can claim to be free from. Across nations and continents, it has its tentacles have penetrated in all political and social systems, slowly and gradually causing the moral and social decay of human existence. Apart from its disastrous consequences on the moral health of a human being, the malice of corruption is also clearly responsible for causing conflicts, political crises, military interventions and the failure of social services to the poor and vulnerable people of the societies of the world. The military coups in Pakistan\u2019s troubled history always cited corrupt practices of politicians as key factor justifying military interventions. Similarly most of the Social Actions Plans (including 79 SAP I, II in 1990s), aimed at social and economic amelioration of poor in Pakistan\u2019s society, failed to achieve the sublime goals mainly due to the prevalence of corrupt practices and lack of accountability mechanisms.

Closing message Dear Colleagues, Thank you for your interest and contributions to date, which add a lot to the preparation of the Asia Pacific HDR on corruption. There are around 430 persons in this discussion network. Approximately half are in the various field, regional, and HQ offices of UNDP and other UN agencies. For the other half of us \u2013 academics, and practitioners in other development agencies \u2013 hopefully the discussion is adding familiarity to what Human Development Reports do. HDRs are distinctive in the genre because they provide analysis. They have a clear aim to stimulate debate on policy, which is done through unravelling assumptions in strategies for development. Over the past 4 weeks, the discussion raised issues that were focused on the problem of corruption for the poorest people. The discussion ranged from corruption vs. official negligence/petty crime, parliamentary vs. presidential systems of government, regarding systemic resilience to corruption, distortion of public decision-making processes as a core characteristic of corruption, avoiding a narrow Political Economy 80 Asia Pacific Human Development Network focus on just political sites of corruption, seeing corruption as an issue of social practice beyond governance, the value of awareness-raising in resistance to corruption, radio vs. e-media, and lessons learned from integrity practiced by political leaders who refuse corruption. Special thanks for all your contributions to Part I. Shortly, the discussion will turn to Part II on corruption in the social services (education and health). A follow-up message will give further details. I look forward to your continuing interest! Jim Chalmers 2.4 Offline Discussion Mark Philp, University of Oxford, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Mark Philp urges further clarity on what \u2018a culture of corruption\u2019 is. There are, he suggests, certain qualities in the idea of cultures of corruption applicable to every cultural setting. In other words, corruption has clear universals, common across all cultures. And it is important to see this universality as a starting point for recognising corruption whatever country it is \u2018culturally- entrenched\u2019 in. I have been reading Daniel Jordan Smith\u2019s book Culture of Corruption about Nigeria (2007), and it seems to me there is a lack of clarity there, and in some of the contributions to the net discussion, about when corruption can be predicated. My view is that it must be something that those involved can recognise (even if they tend to deny it) and that it involves using some position for purposes that are not part of that position\u2019s recognised responsibilities. So we cannot call a culture corrupt just because it does things differently from us; but we can, in so far as those involved are aware that their conduct does not fit with their own sense of the purposes of the office or position of trust. My sense is that what defines a \u2018culture of corruption\u2019 is that it is one in which there are norms and expectations of a whole range of positions of trust and offices, but that the incentives are such that people wanting services from these cannot rely on these official expectations but are forced to resort to other types of incentives. The result is a culture in which what is done, and what ought to be done, part company pretty systematically. Jim Chalmers, Facilitator AP-HDNet, wrote: Mark points out that there is a universal dimension to corrupt behaviour despite the differences in how different cultures express this.

Mark bases this on the idea that there are official expectations (trust and rights associated with provision of public good) connected with public offices, and, at the same time, there are unofficial expectations (associated with personal gain, which extends to allies). I agree with Mark\u2019s next suggestion that a culture of corruption can be explained (universally) by the predomination of unofficial expectations over official ones, where the causal factor is greater incentives i.e. public officials/allies gain more from the pursuit of personal gain than provision of public good. My questions or responses are related to programming implications, needed to transform a culture of corruption. I have just a couple of thoughts at this stage, in order to point to possible further inquiries. First, is democracy a possible causal variable in transforming a culture of corruption? The evidence I have seen suggests that democracy is a precondition of anti-corruption but is insufficient in itself. This is particularly evident if the democratic electoral process is taken as an indicator of democracy. In particular situations in the election cycle, re-election has been shown to be a disincentive for integrity. A 2005 UC Berkeley study of Brazil mayors in their second and final term, found there is significantly more corruption compared to similar municipalities where mayors are in their first-term (Ferraz and Finan 2005). Second, moving to the more hidden if fundamental element of your triadic agency concept (i.e. the 3rd party - usually the poor or most vulnerable citizens - whose entitlement to the public good is stripped by the other 2 parties\u2019 corrupt transaction). My question is: are there sufficiently powerful incentives that could be constructed on the side of the 3rd party to transform a culture of corruption? There is a study that finds corruption could have declined in Italy since 2000, as a result of a \u2018change in incentive whether or not to be corrupted (coming) from an authority that is not part of the game (the jurisdictional power)\u2019. This concerns novel interpretation of civil liability rules in Italy (1999) allowing private agents to appear before the court to demand reimbursement for damages suffered as a result of illicit behaviour of the public administration (see Giuseppe Di Vita 2006). If I interpret Mark accurately to be saying that a \u2018culture of corruption\u2019 is primarily a problem of the entrenchment of distrust on the demand-side, due to the power of incentives in favour of private interest over the provision of public good, then from a programming perspective we need to consider what novel incentives/disincentives it takes to shift this culture. Political Economy 82 Asia Pacific Human Development Network Phil Matsheza, UNDP Bureau for Development Policy, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note. Mark\u2019s discussion raises questions about possibilities of transforming cultures of corruption. Phil Matsheeza\u2019s following contribution has invited inputs in this regard, namely: which kind of anti- corruption institutes are the most effective? Are they: 1) Single institutes with powers to prevent, prosecute and investigate? 2) Single institutes with mostly preventive mandates? 3) Multiple units and mandates interspersed in different government departments and institutions? Under what circumstances are these institutes most effective? Are there any recommendations of which model works better in a particular political environment? First of all anti-corruption institutions are provided for in Articles 5 and 6 of UNCAC. One of the key issues in article 6 is: \u201cEach State Party shall grant the body or bodies - the necessary independence - to enable the body or bodies to carry out its or their functions effectively without undue influence.\u201d We have a number of models in Asia and indeed globally of these institutions. We have the so called Hong Kong-based models with powers to prevent, prosecute and investigate with some variations. These are one stop institutions which are becoming popular in some parts of the developing world. In such circumstances the general bureaucratic framework will have succumbed to corruption and related ills and one illustrious institution will be trying to improve the governance delivery capacity of other institutions. Some jurisdictions do not allow the independent anti-corruption institutions to prosecute while others do so, on delegated authority from the Prosecutor General. I have observed that in Central Asia most of the anti-corruption institutions are government departments with mostly preventive mandates. In Western Europe, anti corruption units and mandates are scattered across different government departments and institutions but they are rarely stand alone institutions.

Moreover, I have been working on a paper on corruption and peacekeeping that takes the definitional material a bit further (and draws on some of the pieces I sent in) and I am happy to circulate that if it would be useful. It certainly raises the paradox that corruption is a function of rules and norms of office, which suggests that it may not be ever reduced to zero; but it also considers what types of corruption might be most harmful. My own current concern is with the claims about \u2018cultures of corruption\u2019 \u2013 where it seems as if two sets of claims are being made about norms and rules. One is that people operate with certain expectations of public office, and they operate with a range of other expectations and norms about how to deal with the fact that those in office do not respond to their expectations. What interests me is the issue of how articulate that first set of expectations is, and how far they are effectively sidelined and rendered irrelevant by the need to make the system work for oneself. Additionally at what point do we simply say, \u2018that\u2019s how things are done around here\u2019 (for example, through patron client relations, familial networks, and so on) \u2013 \u2018so that it is not corruption, just the standard way in which allocations and distributions of goods and services are made\u2019. In part, my interest arises from seeing attempts to impose regulation from outside that become subverted by more traditional forms of exchange. Sometimes these traditional forms have high levels of legitimacy, and sometimes they are associated with relatively high Political Economy 84 Asia Pacific Human Development Network levels of fatalism about the need to truck and barter with a system (as is the case for many in former soviet states). My guess is that a number of South Asian cultures may have elements of each. Jim Chalmers, Facilitator AP-HDNet, wrote: Mark, your comments urge zeroing in on what types of corruption are most harmful. I want to pick up on this with a related topic which is \u2018who causes most relative damage, givers\u2019 or takers\u2019\u2019 and \u2018why\u2019? I would also like to take a closer look at the economic formations of these decisions that fail to accept the norms and values of public office. Mark, you seem to suggest, and I would agree, that it is the takers who are the primary agents in the failure to respond to official expectations. This in effect implies that it is behaviour on this side of transactions (takers) that raises the likelihood that the other side (givers) will react (in a relatively secondary if very significant manner). The question this raises is: while this is probably true in most poor countries, is it because the economic formations of corruption are shaped, largely, by \u2018the scarcity of wealth available for investment in public goods\u2019?

Would one expect a shift in the relative damage caused by takers in poor countries if this indicator (constraints) was outweighed by \u2018commoditization\u2019 of public goods? This can be seen to have happened in rich countries where market forces (which magnify the \u2018givers\u2019 role), prevail over other economic indicators. For example, in the education sector in rich countries the growing demand for access, increase in private education providers, commoditization of many aspects of education, and financial constraints that institutions face, place new demands on takers\u2019 decisions to act outside expected norms of office. This refers to a likely change in demand that would affect the behaviour of the supply-side of corruption, but which, importantly, requires a re-orientation of emphasis onto the givers, since currently most emphasis in poor countries is on the side of the takers. More specifically, this shift would be well addressed through emphasis on niches within the \u2018givers\u2019 category, which in education could include students in wealthy families who are in the market for fraudulent accreditation and access to education. Mark Philp, Oxford University, wrote: I am not sure that the concept of givers and takers is the best way forward. That really describes who gains in the relationship, but misses a number of possibilities - such as symmetrical exchange. A piece in Kotkin and Sajo\u2019s handbook (2002) looks at some of this in more detail. Basically it uses the three agent definition and distinguishes between A-led and C-Led forms of corruption - with B being the victim. It also tries to explore how different types of corruption 85 (who initiates etc.) might be responded to with different types of corruption control. What it fails to do is to ask what circumstances are likely to produce the different types of corruption. My sense is that it will depend on the strength of the state, the capacity of non-state organisations to compete with the state in terms either of legitimacy or the control of wealth or violence. It is however difficult to answer all questions simultaneously! Anyway, see what you think. Anuradha Rajivan, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo, wrote: The key players seem to be: Givers, Takers, Facilitators (often legal - like accountants and lawyers - who can provide creative legal ways to be corrupt), Objectors, and Bystanders (passive). All categories can be corrupt and for different reasons. For example, objectors can become whistle blowers because they are disgruntled about division of spoils. Jim Chalmers, Facilitator AP-HDNet, wrote: Lenses: Although it might seem clear that corruption impedes human development, the case needs to be articulated, given that it is also possible to argue corruption could promote human development. Hence the lenses of viewing corruption in terms of vulnerability of different human lives and different political systems, focussed on the intersection of social practice (including governance) and economic lenses. The social practice lens is trained on equity, empowerment, capability, rights, and productivity in terms of whether institutions in the public, private and civil society sectors are able to deliver efficient, transparent, accountable services within the law. The economic lens investigates the extent to which governments are able to intervene in the market to constrain corruption and hence calculate the vulnerability of different political systems to corruption. Actors: Multiple actors with motivations equally multi-faceted and ambiguous can be categorised in terms of givers and takers, plus those who resist, endure or are incognizant yet lose some entitled social good, as well as those who facilitate a corrupt practice.

Anuradha Rajivan, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo, wrote: I guess it all comes down to what we want to call corrupt but how do we avoid going round in circles? I feel an uncomfortable gap somewhere.

This is more common 87 than a \u2018good Samaritan\u2019 coming forward in public interest. Would that not be corruption? Then combating it is to have institutions that dissuade collusions to stick. We need to have checks and balances as well. Legal subversion of \u2018intent\u2019 of the law: sometimes the law is deliberately against public interest, e.g. a diamond company gets mining laws changed to further commercial interests by colluding with the concerned minister, to the disadvantage of local communities.

It would bring a shift in the usual definition (\u2018misuse of entrusted power in decision-making for private gain\u2019) making it \u2018the use of entrusted power for public good\u2019. Is this adequate to explain that motivation/intentionality thus have inspirational value for advocacy purposes? First, on the level of visible actions, \u2018the use of entrusted power for the public good\u2019 boils down to \u2018escalating public good over one\u2019s private interest\u2019. Note the continued existence of private interest-one has simply chosen to not escalate it above public interest in using entrusted power. So on the everyday level of public office activities, there are variables of \u2018entrusted power\u2019, \u2018decision-making\u2019, \u2018private interest\u2019, \u2018public interest\u2019, and \u2018transparency\u2019.

Process wise, one has made choices on the merits of each case without discrimination on the grounds of ethnicity, sex, religion or origin etc; and one has further exposed the decision-making processes by declaring private interests that have potential to collide with public interest; further one has put to one side sectoral and regional interest. How useful are these operational characteristics when it comes to motivation? What is the role of duty vs. moral/emotional/imaginative intelligence? First, in \u2018integrity\u2019 the bribe or inducement is not the prime mover in influencing performance or an action.

Kant/Nussbaum appear to prefer acting shaped by emotional intelligence versus acting only from abstract/objective \u2018duty\u2019 because it allows room for personal commitments. But emotion is just as fallible and undependable as objectivity. So intentionality based on emotion is enough in itself; the motive of duty is still critical because emotions are fallible as much as \u2018duty\u2019 is. Ultimately, intent behind any action is about decision-making based on an inherent capability, which in turn needs to be fostered. This shifts the onus onto investing in public goods that develop capability in all human lives, rather than focusing on specific (corrupt) actions she/he might take in the line of duty-though we are left with the social-historical facts that corrupt actions have magnified effects on those with fewer opportunities to develop capabilities. Ramesh Gampat, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo, wrote: Dear Jim, Thank you for some interesting thoughts in your last message. In effect, I believe that you are saying that the focus on integrity requires flipping the definition of corruption around: \u2018the use of entrusted power for public good\u2019, which boils down to \u2018escalating public good over one\u2019s private interest\u2019. How does one motivate this new focus? You suggested duty, moral imperatives, emotional intelligence and reasoning (\u2018acting only from abstract/objective duty\u2019) and argued that these are all \u2018fallible and undependable\u2019. Your preferred motivation is \u2018inherent capability - [which] shifts the onus onto investing in public goods that develop capability\u2019. I hope that I have done justice to the main drift of your argument. I would now like to step outside of economics and take a fresh look at these issues. In so doing, I\u2019ll be drawing upon some exciting new research in evolutionary psychology, primatology and cognitive neuroscience (the study of brain-behaviour relationships). Because we may not be all familiar with this body of research, it may tend to be long-winded. At the outset, I interpret \u2018public good\u2019 as synonymous with \u2018greater good\u2019 of society. The essence of both terms seems to be the same: suppressing \u2018personal good\u2019 to the extent that it 89 is inconsistent with the greater good. The pursuit of both - personal and public good - seems to require a utilitarian approach. Recent research into how the brain functions suggests that the consistent pursuit of utilitarian ends is not possible unless we all become a \u2018Phineas Gage\u2019. Phineas Gage was a 19th century construction foreman, who worked on laying the track for the Rutland and Burlington Railroad in Vermont, USA. He was athletic, graceful, precise in his dangerous work, most efficient and capable. One day, a slight distraction caused him to miss a step in the blasting sequence and an iron tampering rod, measuring 3 feet 7 inches, entered his left cheek, piercing his skull and his brain, before exiting at high speed through the top of his head. One hundred and fifty years later, it was determined that Gage suffered damage to that region of his brain known as the Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (VMPFC), an area of the forebrain where social emotions, such as compassion, guilt and shame, arise. Gage survived and even went back to work but, while his basic cognitive, intellectual and language skills remained intact, his ability to reason - particularly within a social context - and make decisions was seriously impaired. Indeed, he was no longer Gage: his character changed; he became undependable, foul-mouthed, ill-manner, anti-social and given to extravagant schemes that were never followed through.

For this reason, because it requires little computation, the emotional system triggers a fast, reflexive response; it provides a shortcut to what is right in situations requiring immediate action, thus enhancing the survival of the species (especially when it lived in the vast open savannas). The rational side aids us when deliberation and calculation are advantageous. Scientists do not yet understand how the two systems interact or how one supersedes the other when they dictate contradictory course of action. Political Economy 90 Asia Pacific Human Development Network In experiments, patients with damage to their ventromedial prefrontal cortex almost always favour a utilitarian approach to answers to specially designed questions, favouring the greater good regardless of the means required to achieve such ends. A typical question: would you take one human life to save many? The obvious answer seems to be \u2018yes\u2019 - but what if your choice also meant you would be sacrificing your own child? Many patients with damaged VMPFC said that they would smother their own baby to save a group of people; those with intact forebrain often said that they would not do so. One key conclusion from this: moral decision making has an emotional component. Human moral judgement does not generally depend upon reasoning (emotional or cognitive); instead, people engage in moral reasoning to justify their condemnations. And, in truth, if pressed are unable to justify their condemnation, a phenomenon psychologist have dubbed moral dumbfounding. (For more, see the wonderful book - Hauser 2006). The point of the Gage detour is to underscore the emerging belief that a purely rational being (homo economics, that strange species of humans characterized by unbounded rationality in decision making) will be unable to make any decisions at all; that such a person will not only be antisocial but will threaten its own survival (as did Gage, who eventually died at a relatively young age). Nevertheless, the case of Gage (and, of course, others who have suffered damage to their VMPFC) has led to an increasing appreciation - at least in cognitive science - that emotions are an integral part of decision-making. Emotional signals in decision making bias the organism to avoid decisions that will lead to negative future outcomes and promote decisions that will lead to positive future outcomes. In this manner, the neural basis for the production of emotional signals impels the organism to behave in ways that promotes the achievement of long-term survival within a given environment (other brain regions are recruited in the process). In other words, we cannot conduct our daily life - in a way that promotes the \u2018public good\u2019 - without depending upon our emotions. Emotions may be fallible and undependable, but we cannot live decently without them (indeed, a question mark will hang over the survival is the species). It follows, too, that the development of capabilities and functioning cannot take place without emotional development, and choices will be irrelevant, if we are unable to make decisions. Nor would capabilities be of much use if we were to rely only on reason. The utilitarian vision, at the personal or societal level, is almost impossible without sound emotional development; the relentless pursuit of utilitarian objectives is possible only with a damaged VMPFC. Where does this leave us? Plato\u2019s Menon begins thus: \u201cCan you tell me, Socrates, is virtue taught?\u201d The answer of Socrates is that virtue is not taught but \u2018recollected\u2019, where the act of 91 recollection is a gathering of one\u2019s self together, a retreat into one\u2019s soul. However you take this, there is increasing evolutionary/genetic evidence that humans are hard-wired for morals reactions (this does not mean that culture/nurture are not important) and that moral reasoning is a post hoc act intended to justify moral judgement. This together with the emerging finding that it is difficult to pursue the public good without sound emotional development leads me to the view that the best restraints against corruption are legal deterrents. That is, the best approach is to make corruption a high- risk, low-pay off activity. I also believe - and this follows to an extent from the above - that too much energy and time have been expended on definitional issues; corruption is too complex and treated as too convenient an issue to be nailed down definition wise. Last Saturday morning (23 June), I was watching an interesting programme on CNN (360 degrees with Anderson Coopers). Apparently, the US Congress has an interesting allocation of funds, called \u2018earmarking\u2019. These are funds allocated to senators without", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5a58e895-ac94-4db2-98e7-53b27da1dc6c": {"__data__": {"id_": "5a58e895-ac94-4db2-98e7-53b27da1dc6c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Transforming Corruption through Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ccd323e5744f8b07dd3efb7246c60e48af3a4f9a15166f90a8bab4338bd7ddaf"}}, "hash": "ccd323e5744f8b07dd3efb7246c60e48af3a4f9a15166f90a8bab4338bd7ddaf", "text": "scrutiny of the requests, without need for reporting or monitoring; funds that are meant to develop projects in their districts/states. Recent investigations into how ear- markings have been used, as well as use of other funds, have shown that senators/congressmen have abused the power entrusted to them for private gain. Some have been charged and sent to jail. But this abuse of public office is not called corruption; it is called a crime and that\u2019s what the senators/congressmen have been charged for. Thus, irrespective of culture or the focus on investment climate (as is clear from the popular measures of corruption), the same act is labelled differently in different country or even in the same country, depending upon whims and fancies. It is also my view that the current preoccupation in trying to come up with a universal definition of corruption is unlikely to yield pay- offs commensurate with efforts invested, nor is the issue likely to be settled any time soon (in any case, all common definitions are more or less impositions - hacked out in the west and imposed on the rest). We should, instead, aim to find out how corruption is understood by Asians and work from there, ignoring the fact that corruption was designed by the west, whose companies need foreign markets to stay competitive, to gauge the business climate in the rest. Mark Philp, University of Oxford, wrote: I have some sympathy with Ramesh\u2019s frustration, which is not to say that I agree with the conclusions he draws. My sense is that the appeal to psychology is as mistaken as the appeal to homo-economicus. What\u2019s needed is more of an appeal to homo sociologicus \u2013 with an eye to the other two \u2013 Political Economy 92 Asia Pacific Human Development Network and to an understanding of the way that different societies and cultures will have different degrees of impact on the emotional integrity of individuals \u2013 so that in some the high level of integration of a culture will make breaking social norms much more of a deviant act that needs a psychological explanation, than in other cultures with relatively weak integration where the contrast between self-interest maximising strategies and conformity to public office norms will be more striking and where conceptions of integrity will be looser and psychological accounts of deviance less compelling. It just is the case that in some cultures it is rational to act corruptly \u2013 as in Nigeria. In other cultures more demanding explanations are required. This also ties to my more general worry that a discussion of integrity will tend to generate Socratic standards, whereas non-corrupt behaviour can be variously motivated (where that motivation need not be especially attractive or desirable, it just does the trick sufficiently in that context). The other point of disagreement concerns throwing in the towel on definition. The reason for persevering with issues of definition is that we have to try to get clear how far the phenomena that we are describing are in certain ways similar or of a particular type. To abandon that aspiration is to abandon the idea that a consistent object of explanation and understanding is being picked out. And to abandon that is to abandon the possibility of coherent explanation or understanding, or indeed coherent discussion! My sense, reading the many pieces submitted in the web discussion is that people are working with a wide range of views as to what constitutes corruption and that their speculations about what might cause corruption are only of interest, strictly speaking, when they are talking about the same thing. In so far as some relied on western norms, others on local standards, and still others on a variable mix of the two, we are unable to make any generalisations about what causal factors may underlie the various phenomena that they identify. Without a clear definitional framework we risk incoherence. Clearly, I have an interest here, since I am arguing for a particular way of understanding corruption \u2013 centred on the subversion and distortion of public office. But the thrust of my case is not that this is the only possible way of defining corruption, so much as it being one way that gives us a relatively clear set of criteria for identifying cases that have a basic similarity in that they undercut the use of public and politically legitimated means of allocating benefits and burdens within a political system, so that the cases are interestingly similar as cases in which political mechanisms do not do the work that they are meant to do.

The causes of corruption will still vary \u2013 some states make demands that cannot be met and result in people using covert means of exchange and 93 allocation as means to conform to central demands; other states are too systematically weak in relation to competing social and economic norms and mores. But we can begin to break down the phenomenon into various sub-types and we can begin to think relatively systematically about the ways in which given instances are similar or dissimilar to each other. It may be, of course, that Asian corruption is a distinct subspecies, and that would allow us to follow its internal definition and logic and would allow us to treat this \u2018type\u2019 of corruption as the object of explanation. But I have real doubts about that \u2013 not least because a great deal of the language of corruption has been developed throughout the world in part as a result of the surge of interest on the part of western financial and political institutions that has then been brought to bear on societies and political systems that are seen as in some ways dysfunctional. So we need alert antennae to identify what people mean when they talk about corruption. We need to do some work on what they say \u2013 recognising that in some cases (such as the earmarking case) the refusal to call the activity corrupt has political motivation rather than making real definitional sense; while in other cases too much is being absorbed under the concept so that there is nothing coherent to its content. And we need to be aware that, in a similar way to what has happened in Central and Eastern Europe, the term has become increasingly appropriated for political purposes in a way that proliferates accusations, muddies the water pretty systematically, and is, in itself, damaging to the creation and enforcement of norms for political conduct. So, if the contributions that people make to this ongoing discussion are going to be contributions to a common theme, we cannot, in my view, duck the question of defining corruption. And, because of that, we ought to try to make people articulate much more clearly and systematically what they understand by the term and how it is being applied in their particular context. Jim Chalmers, Facilitator AP-HDNet, wrote: One can imagine trying to blend the strengths of Mark\u2019s and Ramesh\u2019s meditations. Because defining what \u2018corrupt\u2019 behaviour is unavoidably means judging whether an action is legitimate and appropriate, there is an inevitable sociological component, as Mark suggests. But what kind of sociology, beyond structures like \u2018integration\u2019 (integrated by what means, external, internal values?) It becomes important, then, to avoid focussing on seeking to identify structures of incentives that make corruption more likely/unlikely (e.g. social integration). This is primarily because such an approach yields overly-narrow economic consequences of corrupt acts, and it vastly underestimates outcomes for the poor. Additionally such structures abstract Political Economy 94 Asia Pacific Human Development Network away from the social-political underpinnings of decision-making (the economic relationships where incentives originate), as well as the origins of the meanings, values, and social emotions that actors see in these incentives, perhaps as Ramesh has argued. What then is a meeting point? The political economy approach is useful because it puts emphasis on production (and thus people\u2019s relationships) rather than on exchange. That is conventional economics assumes people come together to satisfy their consumption/exchange desires in a forward-looking manner (rational choices?). Since the focus is on the poor in this discussion, when we talk about decision-making in the context of production relations (uneven power), poor persons invariably do not have rational choices. Their preferences happen in deprived/ oppressed social circumstances. Ultimately, the end goal is a (poor) person\u2019s wellbeing. Hence, it is not possible to imagine her/his good consisting in the satisfaction of informed preferences without asking what are the actual choices (vs. counterfeit preferences), and invoking contexts of power/production to explain these. Plus, understanding the judgment of corruption is much more than identifying a particular abstract norm that characterizes a specific situation. This means that in order to know which norm to apply and how to interpret it for the case in question, we need also to know much more about the social emotions and codification/ cultural representations (Asian, Melanesian, Western?)

Are they the same thing? If not, how do they differ (even when context is factored in)? Mark, I am not arguing for an abandonment of the search for a definition but am against a definition that is applicable to all countries at all times. This is what I meant when I said that we should focus on Asia to understand how Asians themselves understand corruption?

Highlighted is the problem of \u2018ghost schools\u2019 that siphon off too-scarce resources and create pockets of poverty and embezzlement at all levels of the system severely constrains education for all. Further plaguing poor communities is the prevalence of predators in areas of semi-urban and rural health services, involving fraudulently-qualified providers. In addition properly-qualified doctors in the public system often illegally moonlight in private practices. Under-the-counter payments are also common, sometimes just to get care. The issue debated on the AP-HDNet, of the detrimental impact of corruption on health and education, is of crucial significance. Indirectly corruption is root cause behind the failure of public services to local communities, including access to primary education and primary health care. The creeping malice of corruption has played havoc with the delivery systems of basic necessities and has further perpetuated poverty and impoverishment of the communities. In the case of Pakistan it is interesting to explore the link between corruption and the poor delivery of education and primary health care services to local communities. Pakistan\u2019s first Education Census exposes an ugly side of corruption prevalent in the education sector (Government of Pakistan 2005). The census revealed that of a total of 164,579 public sector schools in the country 12,737 educational institution are \u2018non-functional\u2019. This is a euphemism for ghost schools. This implies that nearly 7.7 per cent of schools exist on paper only. What repercussions do ghost schools have on the overall access to primary education? Firstly since nonexistent schools are siphoning off funds from the education budget (to fill some unscrupulous people\u2019s coffers) the functioning education institutions are as a consequence deprived of funds they badly need. Secondly it leads to the creation of pockets of poverty and illiteracy in different regions in the country. 101 The continuing existence of ghost schools is also indicative of the higher authorities\u2019 inability or unwillingness to tackle this issue. The problem is not a new one and has plagued Pakistan\u2019s education system for a long time. The other dimensions of corruption undermining the education sector include unjustified absenteeism by teachers and the massive embezzlement of funds from the top to the bottom levels of hierarchy. On another front, the primary health care sector is also not spared from the ill effects of corruption. Quacks or non qualified health care providers who pass themselves as qualified and provide services that they are not qualified to provide for a price, dominate healthcare delivery in semi-urban and rural areas of Pakistan. \u2018Quack\u2019 doctors thrive particularly in those communities that are too poor to pay for the cost of proper health care services.

However, most of the publicly employed doctors are seen operating lucrative private sector clinics while working in hospitals and often use the public sector leverage to boost their private practice. The consequences of these corrupt practices are fairly severe, as underscored by a high maternal mortality rate (MMR) of 400 per 100,000 live births and infant mortality rate of 73 per 1,000 live births. Half or 50 per cent of the population is illiterate and 75 per cent of the population still earns less than $2 a day. Pakistan is paying a high price for the institutionalization of corruption. What are the possible solutions available? To combat corrupt practices in service delivery including of education and health, it is imperative to: strike a balance between demand and supply; strengthen monitoring mechanisms through active involvement of local communities; hold leaders accountable; devolve authority and resist the vertical implementation of social programmes without consultation with the local communities. While there is no magic wand to totally eliminate corruption from society, it is possible to minimize/reduce its devastating impact on the lives of the poor sections of society. In order Health and Education 102 Asia Pacific Human Development Network to make a meaningful difference to the lives of vulnerable and disadvantaged, it is essential for policy makers to develop a zero tolerance for corrupt practices in delivery of education and health care to communities which would also consolidate global efforts to combat poverty in the world. Sonia Gomez, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Sonia Gomez writes on the crisis in health services caused by mislabelling and other fake practices in the pharmaceutical trade. One survey in SE Asia provided clear evidence that more than a third of \u2018artesunate\u2019 anti-malarial drugs contained none of this active ingredient. According to estimates, Indonesia\u2019s pharmaceutical market contains 25 per cent fake drugs; in India the estimate is 20 per cent of the market, and in the Philippines, nearly a third of drug outlets carry fake drugs. To combat this, legislative efforts have been introduced to make counterfeiting drugs a crime against human security. Pharmacorruption: Counterfeit drugs in Asia The counterfeit drug trade is of particular concern in Asia and the Pacific not only because of the volume of drugs produced in the region, but more due to the high levels of corruption prevalent at many stages of the pharmaceutical supply chain. Corruption and therefore compromise of drugs occurs from the point of manufacture- where active pharmaceutical ingredients are siphoned off and sold, while substitutes (sometimes toxic substances) or insufficient amounts of active ingredients are used in their place- to regulation, where regulatory bodies are bribed to approve new drugs without meeting standards and finally to the point of sale, where drugs can be repackaged, or adulterated. Adulterated anti-malarial drugs are just one example of the results of the $75 billion fake drug trade. A recent survey in Southeast Asia showed that among 104 tablets presented as the anti- malarial drug artesunate, 38 per cent did not contain any of the active ingredients. International health officials are concerned that fake antibiotics and anti-retroviral drugs will soon be leaking into the market (for more information see the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention n.d). Defined by the World Health Organization, a counterfeit drug is \u201da medicine, which has been deliberately and fraudulently mislabelled with respect to identity and or source.\u201d Counterfeiting can apply to both branded and generic products and counterfeit products may include products with the correct ingredients or with the wrong ingredients; without active ingredients; with insufficient active ingredients or with fake packaging. Substandard drugs can have serious impact on public health. They jeopardize treatment, making sick people more unwell and in some extreme cases, even result in death. Watered 103 down vaccines leave children more vulnerable to deadly diseases, and open the door to epidemics. In Cambodia in 1999, counterfeit anti-malarial drugs were responsible for the deaths of at least 30 people. In 2006, 11 people died in China after being injected with drugs containing toxic ingredients. In the case of anti-malarial drugs, insufficient quantities of active ingredients, besides failing to heal unsuspecting patients, can also cause drug resistance in malaria parasites. Counterfeit drugs also take a heavy toll on the pharmaceutical industry in terms of cost. The extent of the problem in Asia is troubling. In Indonesia, the International Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Group (IPMG) estimates that counterfeit drugs make up 25 per cent of Indonesia\u2019s $25 billion pharmaceutical market. In India, estimates show that about one in five strips of medicine sold is fake, and that", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "57cf9b39-8170-4b91-b7b0-9a5ec139ae99": {"__data__": {"id_": "57cf9b39-8170-4b91-b7b0-9a5ec139ae99", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Transforming Corruption through Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d7920c30290dc72edc7b20cd5046c06b609e1940103a215fb121c58d2b6fe83f"}}, "hash": "d7920c30290dc72edc7b20cd5046c06b609e1940103a215fb121c58d2b6fe83f", "text": "counterfeit drugs have grown from 10 per cent to 20 per cent of the total market, and in the Philippines, 30 per cent of drug outlets carry fake drugs. China, one of the region\u2019s largest pharmaceuticals producers, recently made sweeping reforms following investigations of corruption in the nation\u2019s regulatory body, the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA). The former SFDA director was tried and sentenced to death for taking over $850,000 in bribes in the form of cash and gifts for approving hundreds of drugs and medical devices, some of which proved to be fake. The SFDA has addressed concerns over high levels of corruption, with reforms. Drug safety inspections across the country have been stepped up, and SFDA officials have been ordered to divest themselves of the 3.5 million shares they held in pharmaceutical companies. SFDA\u2019s anti-corruption campaign also introduced eight rules, intended to prevent its officials from engaging in corrupt activities [Concern about the rising counterfeit drug trade is so great that the World Health Organization last year established IMPACT (International Medical Products Anti-counterfeiting Taskforce) to combat corruption and crime in the global pharmaceutical market. For more information see World Health Organisation. n.d]. One of IMPACT\u2019s key objectives is to encourage countries to recognize counterfeiting drugs as a crime against human security, and to introduce legislation that deals specifically with the issue. With rising concern about an increasingly sophisticated counterfeit drug trade, governments are under pressure to take the issue seriously and introduce more stringent accountability mechanisms in the manufacture, regulation and distribution of drugs, and to educate health professionals and the public on the issue. Corruption in the pharmaceutical industry, unless checked, will continue to cost lives. I look forward to reading members\u2019 views on this issue! Health and Education 104 Asia Pacific Human Development Network Nabeel Salie, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Nabeel Salie emphasises that funding constraints contribute towards undermining the delivery of social services in Sri Lanka, making corrupt practices systemic. When salaries are intolerably low it creates a major tension in personal decision-making and enhances private interest over public good. The delivery of social services is clearly undermined by corruption. This being established, the more pertinent question would be to address as to why this situation prevails. In terms of education and health service delivery, funding constraints have played a significant role in the deterioration of these systems resulting in corrupt practices becoming systemic, where bribing a school principal to gain admission to a school or paying a nurse to jump a queue to see a doctor, have become common practice. What is important to note is that there need not be a queue if there were more doctors and there would be no reason to bribe the nurse if she was adequately compensated for her work. For example, in the Sri Lankan judiciary, the pervasive effects of corruption have been clearly documented in a recent macro study that underscores the issue of poor remuneration of employees. This leaves much room for bribe taking given the high cost of living and that salaries cannot sustain a decent living standard. It must be noted that I am not trying to justify bribe taking but just highlighting what seems to be the most obvious reason as to why it is taking place. This is clearly evident in a study conducted by the Marga Institute which shows that bribe- taking is particularly rampant (32.3 per cent) at the lower levels (court clerks). At this level one could argue that it is purely pecuniary corruption. However, if a judge or lawyer takes a bribe and his judgment is going to be altered as a result, I classify this as intellectual corruption where despite knowing the law he/she yet twists it for personal gain. Redressing the imbalances caused by corruption can only be achieved with a more aware civil society which feels the compulsion to become inclusive in the reform process rather than take an apathetic approach as a result of being left in the dark about its rights. Unless this takes place, governments will continue to be unaccountable to those they serve and those they serve will remain unaware of their dues. Thus budgetary priorities for example will continue to be on defence spending or the importation of luxury vehicles for parliamentarians rather than on much needed medicines or text books. More importantly inaction will result in complete systemization of corruption reaching a point of no return. 105 Pact Cambodia wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Pact Cambodia provides a comprehensive explanation of how corruption affects education in Cambodia.

Pact calls for the active involvement of communities in school management as part of an envisaged decentralization change in which CSOs, together with independent teacher unions could play a crucial role in monitoring and evaluation. Corruption in education in Cambodia is prevalent mainly in urban schools. In rural areas, corruption occurs chiefly in secondary schools. The prevalence is attributed to several factors: 1) Low salaries for school teachers when compared to those working in the private sector. Average salaries for Cambodian teachers have declined in absolute terms and value from $100 in 1970 to $40 in 2007. 2) The public spending in education is only 2.5 per cent of the GNP, far below the 5 per cent adopted by other countries. 3) Low and slow spending of the approved budget. Corruption appears in several forms such as: o Selling of public land, schools and sport facilities. o Kickbacks for procurements and construction, especially at the central level. o Adjustment of examination results at secondary level and diploma mill at tertiary level for some private universities. o Deployment of teachers. o Collection of daily or monthly fees from children. o Printing and distribution of books and learning materials, and o Delayed payment for teachers. This corruption has an impact on low school completion rates at the primary level (42 per cent) and a low enrolment rate at the secondary level (34 per cent net enrolment). It creates a culture of graft and corruption in the entire society. It is useful, but not adequate, to impart moral and value education to children, teachers and principals. What is required are changes in the salary structure and active involvement of communities in school management. At the same time, good role models from the Prime Minister to school principals are needed. The decentralized authorities and CSOs can play a very important role in removing barriers. All budgets should be decentralized to schools and communities. Bottom-up control is always Health and Education 106 Asia Pacific Human Development Network better than top-down control. School boards should be established by communities and be free from political parties. Other recommended measures are: 1) Adjust the salary scale to the pre-war level by increasing education spending from 2.5 per cent to 5 per cent of the GNP. 2) For secondary level education, formal tuition fees should be legalized to ensure its transparency. 3) Training of 8000 school principals on school and resource management. 4) Empowerment of communities in running the schools. 5) Support independent teacher unions or associations and CSOs to monitor the education sector. 6) Passage and enforcement of the anti-corruption law. Donors must play a more active role in this regard by channelling funds to the communities and schools, rather than concentrating it with the central ministries. The donors must not support corruption, directly or indirectly. Donors should be held accountable too if their funds are misused by their client authorities. Ramesh Gampat, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Ramesh Gampat questions the explanation of corruption. He explores the beginnings of the hypothesis that corruption is traced to shortages (under-spending, under- valorisation of human resources) in the supply of education and health. He further questions whether this linkage (higher levels of spending and lower levels of corruption) is compounded when there exist too much red-tape together with high levels of illiteracy, and, seemingly, when inequality predominates. Ramesh tests the proposition with empirical evidence: countries with low levels of corruption have relatively high levels of investment in health and education. Medical investigators in NE China have found that where demand outstrips supply of blood-boosting drugs this has led to the production of fakes. Ramesh\u2019s work challenges neoclassical economics: it operationalises corruption in sites of workplace relations (productivity) rather than further upstream in market interactions. This is evident in how it allows for the complexity of nature and of human inventiveness to \u2018fill spaces\u2019 that corruption opens up. For example, if teachers\u2019 pay is too low and under-valorised, then non-rational behaviour (often found in corruption), can be predicted. Ultimately, Ramesh\u2019s work suggests that a sectoral approach could work in curbing corruption \u2013 as against the notion that only a national approach adequately captures complexities of human behaviour that underpin corruption. 107 Some people believe that the focus (that is, looking for ways to control corruption) on sectoral corruption is somewhat misplaced, because it is difficult to unambiguously define a sector in a complex modern economy primarily because there are always spill over effects from one sector on another.

While this is an interesting issue, my main purpose here is to explore empirically the relationship between the level of sectoral spending - in the present case, health and education - and corruption. This is a tentative, exploratory effort as corruption is a complex and highly contextualized phenomenon and a meaningful study of it cannot be reduced to a two- dimensional analysis. With the above understanding, it seems plausible that corruption will tend to thrive in a situation where the supply of health and educational services is severely constrained by shortages. We explore this hypothesis using data from World Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators database and Transparency International\u2019s (TI) Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI). Note that the figures show the reciprocal of the CPI, which makes CPI readings more intuitive: lower values mean lower levels of corruption; high values imply higher levels of corruption. The data on public spending on health and education are given as a share of gross domestic product (GDP). The dataset covers 117 developed and developing countries, including 21 from the Asia-Pacific region. The results are displayed in figures 1 and 2. Both figures are scatter plots but I have dropped a trend line - in effect, a regression line - that plots the relationship between the CPI and government spending on health (figure 1) and CPI and government spending on education (figure 2). According to the data, there is an inverse relationship between public spending on health and corruption. Higher levels of spending on health are associated with lower levels of corruption. The same relationship although present between spending on education and corruption, is weaker. How does one explain this relationship? Our research to date (validated by the three stakeholders consultations in the Pacific, East Asia and South Asia) suggests that shortages of these two public goods boosts corruption, especially when it is coupled with red tape and a high rate of illiteracy and perhaps high levels of inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient.

Corruption and Spending on Health Figure 2. Corruption and Spending on Education 109 In the case of health, this situation creates, among other things, \u2018corrupt space\u2019 for fake pharmaceuticals. Recently, for example, medical investigators have found batches of a fake blood- boosting, human albumin, drug in north eastern China. Human serum albumin, made from human blood plasma, is used to treat shock due to blood loss, burns and low protein levels due to surgery or liver failure. It is believed that high demand for the drugs led to the production of fakes. According to the WHO, 38 per cent of 104 anti-malarial drugs available in pharmacies in South East Asia do not contain any active ingredients. And according to a TI 2006 Global Corruption Report, for every 10 percent increase in corruption, immunization rates drop as much as 20 percent; waiting time in public clinics increases as much as 30 per cent and children are one-fourth as likely to complete their courses of vaccination. Other causes of corruption in the health sector include the need to pay a bribe for admission to hospitals, diagnostic services and surgical procedures. In all of these cases, the underlying cause can be traced to shortages, which frequently led to flourishing private practices and sub- standard quality of services. There are many causes of corruption in the education sector, some of which have been discussed on the Network. These include shortages of classrooms and thus bribes for admission; the emerging concept of \u2018pay for performance\u2019 where schools blackmail parents into paying a bribe for the promotion of their children; forced bribes for the issuance of certificates and a certain percentage deduction (by schools) for scholarships awarded by various government bodies and philanthropic organizations. According to the data, a higher share of public spending on health and education would decrease shortages and perhaps red tape as well. Indeed, the data shows that countries which have low levels of corruption also invest relatively high shares of their GDP in health and education. If this is in fact true, then a sectoral approach to curbing corruption will apparently work, casting doubt on the issues raised in the opening paragraph. Or could it work more effectively if a national (or a more holistic) approach were to be taken to curb corruption? Your views would be much appreciated.

The program gives the custody of schools to communities in remote areas. This has resulted in greater awareness of education for all, and towards this end, the Health and Education 110 Asia Pacific Human Development Network removal of officials implicated in school fraud. \u2018Even communities notorious for corruption\u2019 have since ceased this practice. I would like to cite the case of Leadership for Environment and Development (LEAD) Pakistan on dealing with corruption in education. LEAD Pakistan is a premier and an internationally recognised non-profit organization, working to create and sustain a global network of leaders committed to promote change towards patterns of economic development that are environmentally sustainable and socially equitable. It is a vibrant global network, with 13 country and regional programmes in Asia, Africa, Europe, North and South America. It started functioning in Pakistan in 1995 and over the years has evolved into a dynamic and one of the leading capacity building organizations in the country, having access to a body of LEAD Fellows within Pakistan as well as internationally. Set up with financial support from the Rockefeller Foundation, it is LEAD International\u2019s largest country programme, which has an annual budget of Rs. 140 million. LEAD Pakistan carries out a range of activities, and forges partnerships with organizations having similar mandates of strengthening the sustainable development processes and mechanisms. LEAD initiated its project entitled Democratized Education Management and Ownership (DEMO), in September 2004 and this was completed in April 2007. The project was sponsored by USAID under its Education Sectors Reforms Assistance programme and Public Community Partnership component and was LEAD Pakistan\u2019s first major field based project in the education sector. LEAD Pakistan implemented DEMO in two districts of Sindh, Khairpur and Sukkur. The project planned to unleash a democratization process, by enhancing community ownership of the school improvement and management systems in approximately 3,000 government primary schools in Sukkhur and Khairpur. This was done by strengthening civic institutions such as the School Management Committees (SMC) through training. Simultaneously, the project mobilized the community to participate in SMC related activities. The demands of the community were articulated through School Improvement Plans which were realized with the provision of grants worth $2,100 for each school. Thus community participation was ensured while developing School Improvement Plans (SIP) through the democratic forum of village assemblies, a forum which was used as a platform throughout the project to solicit the community\u2019s opinion on every decision regarding their school. Based on the school improvement plan, that was reviewed and approved by the Project Support Unit; each school was given grant of $2,100 (Rs. 126,000). A total of 2,357 schools directly benefited from 111 this project. Four thousand grants were disbursed, amounting to approximately $4.01 million (Rs. 240,673,382). All these 4,000 grants were completely administered by the communities. DEMO enhanced the tripartite relationship between schools, communities and government structures. A social mobilization strategy was designed, keeping in view the major players: the political government, the district administration, education department employees and the communities. The communities, once involved in the decision making process of the school through village assemblies realized their responsibility. Henceforth the community contributed by donating plots or other material, and volunteering labour for construction work. The DEMO team reached the remotest of the areas. These remote and needier communities were more responsive and willing to undergo change. They were also more responsible in completion of tasks. The communities were not conservative in terms of religion. No community refused to accept USAID Funds. They were not against the education of girls. They wanted to educate their daughters and needed female teachers or separate girls\u2019 schools. Effective mobilization helped in overcoming these barriers as well. As a result they became prepared for schooling their girls in boys\u2019 schools where even the teacher did not belong to their community. The community took measures to ensure the proper use of funds. They removed chairpersons, teachers, education supervisors who were implicated in the misappropriation of school funds and education. Even communities notorious for corruption never embezzled a cent from the grants given to them since they were aware that they would be questioned on the use of the money and had to present the accounts in the village gathering. Cash grants worked as the catalyst for SMCs practical training in core and functional capacities and provided SMCs an opportunity to practically demonstrate their achieved capabilities and build their confidence. Identification, planning and implementation of school improvement initiatives helped SMCs/communities in exploring and acknowledging their potentials and productive capacities.

This reduced the alienation aspect that the community used to feel regarding their school before. Health and Education 112 Asia Pacific Human Development Network However there still exists a missing link between the community and school in many places where the community is not mobilized and at times unaware of their role as custodians of their local school. The SMCs are still at their infancy stage and there is room for improvement. For example the selection of SMC members still takes place by the education department requesting the head teacher to nominate names. Hence the persons close to the teacher become members. SMC selection needs to take place in a public forum in front of the entire community. Li Jing, UNDP China, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Li Jing provides a comprehensive description of anti-corruption initiatives in the health sector in China following the \u2018despatch\u2019 of the former Commissioner of China\u2019s State Food and Drug Administration. With exposure and despatch of the case Zheng Xiaoyu, former Commissioner of China\u2019s State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA), corruption in the public health sector in China has captured a lot of global attention. Here I would like to share some of my views and comments focusing on the causes of corruption in this sector and hope it helps provide a reference to similar cases in other countries in this region. How corruption occurred in the public health sector China launched a public health reform programme around the mid 1980\u2019s of the last century. One principal feature of the reform programme was the market orientation of public health infrastructure and facilities (mainly hospitals at all levels) and the decrease in or even withdrawal of government medical allowances that covered the majority of urban population. This reform resulted in highly increased medical prices for both hospital care and medicines. In mid-2006, a report from a government think tank acknowledged that this reform had not been successful. In fact, since then the government has launched another round of public health reforms that aim to increase coverage of health insurance of the general population, including both rural and urban residents. Another aspect of this issue is the excessive power wielded by the SFDA in approving and registering new medicines. As the first commissioner of SFDA, Zheng promoted two reforms: 1) retrieving the power of approval and registration of new medicine, and centralizing this power at the SFDA level, 2) enforced certification of GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) of pharmaceutical companies. Both these initiatives were considered to be positive reforms that would help to regulate the pharmaceutical producing and marketing processes. However, 113 the key problem was that approval had been centralized at the SFDA level and monopolized by a few key officials who were all associated with Zheng, without a sufficient checking and balancing mechanism. On the other hand, the market economy in China allows pharmaceutical companies to set prices of new medicines produced by these companies. Therefore, these two mechanisms combined created a large space or loopholes for rent-seeking practices. Through bribery and speed money to Zheng and his associates, some pharmaceutical companies could expedite the SFDA approval process of so-called new medicines (most of which were actually counterfeits of other medicines - local or abroad) at the high prices they suggested. Corruption also takes place at hospitals with doctors. Medicine dealers hired by pharmaceutical companies would bribe the doctors through commissions, so that they would prescribe and recommend overpriced medicines of these companies to the patients. In this way, doctors share part of the twisted profits from medicines but the patients will have to bear much higher prices of such medicines. This again increases the burden of medical costs on the patients, who are poorly covered by public health insurance schemes. In other words, a poorly regulated market for pharmaceuticals plus a centralized but unchecked administrative approval authority has generated huge space for rent seeking and thus corruption. The government response The government has defined corruption involving the private sector as commercial bribery and has therefore launched a campaign Combating Commercial Bribery since 2005 as a response. The main measures include: enforcing self-examination, self-corrections, investigating and punishing commercial bribery cases.

Key areas of this campaign include infrastructure construction, state-owned land property transfer, pharmaceutical purchase and government procurement. Statistics show that from August 2005 to June 2006, a total number of 6,972 commercial bribery cases were investigated, involving $245.375 million. Health and Education 114 Asia Pacific Human Development Network More specifically in Zheng\u2019s case, the government has launched large-scale investigation among SFDA staff who suspected of having been involved in this case. Flying inspections and resident inspector mechanisms are being conducted on suspected pharmaceutical companies. It has been announced by the SFDA spokesman that all approved medicines licenses will have to be re-issued. It is also said that all GMP certificates will need to be re-issued subject to a new round of certification process. To handle the situation in hospitals, the Ministry of Public Health has called for separation of prescription-writing from medicine purchasing, so that hospitals and doctors do not benefit directly from selling of medicines thereby effectively cutting off doctors\u2019 motivation for commission-taking. However, since the process involves several stakeholders, it is still fairly difficult to implement such suggestions on a large scale with the exception of a few cases of local piloting. Response from the public At the end of May 2007, Zheng was sentenced to a death penalty by the Court. It is true that this sentence is more severe than some of the previous cases involving officials of similar or higher level. Additionally it is fairly evident that the processing of this case was more expeditious than many previous cases. From a legal perspective, as a country that basically applies the civil law system, it is difficult to predict whether this sentence will set precedence for future cases. However, a clear message from the prosecution of Zheng\u2019s case is that the central government intends to strengthen criminal penalty measures on corruption cases involving high level officials, particularly in the areas that affect the daily lives of the population - in this case public health. Although the general response to this sentence from the public through the media and internet is positive and welcoming, people are still concerned about lack of long-term mechanism to control corruption in such areas. Some scholars also pointed out that the law, instead of the intention of the government, is and should be the only reason for this sentence. Existing problems and UNDP China interventions As indicated above, many of the government measures to fight corruption are still inherently on an ad hoc basis. Long-term and institutional approaches have to be developed to address corruption issues in a sustainable way that is within a legal framework. UNDP China\u2019s new cooperation with China\u2019s Ministry of Supervision will try to explore innovative ways for anti- corruption and government integrity, through increasing the government\u2019s transparency mechanisms through e-government systems, strengthening legislation on anti-corruption, establishing and enhancing government accountability systems and promoting public participation. 115 Dr. Chitra Khati, Armed Forces Medical Services of India (Ret.), India, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Dr. Khati laments the lack of anti-corruption measures in India\u2019s public health service. Much greater systemic vigilance is urgently required to support the clinicians\u2019 due diligence. Otherwise it remains impossible to differentiate between a malarial death from disease burden as opposed to a delay in initiation of treatment, drug resistance, poor drug quality, or poor compliance. I am a new member with almost 25 years in Indian Government service and firsthand experience of both the good and the bad. Corruption in health care defies definition primarily because there is virtually no vigilance. Clinicians are bogged down by the sheer volume of day to day work and are also held responsible for vigilance. Many patients get better, some get worse and when clustering of \u2018cases gone wrong\u2019 occurs, alarm bells ring. When a concerned young clinician tries to make a report after some such event, he is given a set of forms that are difficult to fill or even advised to procure these forms from the higher officials. Records of objectivity/ proof are asked for. Without those no action is taken on the report and at times the clinician is taken to task for false allegations/ wasting organizational time!

Record maintenance is sub-optimal and there is almost no clerical or dedicated office staff, and at all times the next 10 to 20 patients are always waiting with serious problems to be addressed. All these factors make monitoring an impossible task. Finally there is a crying need for effective and adequate empowered vigilance and follow up to identify real problems and take effective action.

This report also records changes to public service delivery with the introduction of devolution to the local government system in Pakistan. I would refer to two excellent publications from U4 Anti Corruption Resource Centre on: 1) corruption in the education sector; and 2) corruption in health sector (see U4 Anti-Corruption Resource Centre 2006a; 2006b). These two publications contain excellent information on the nature and extent of corruption in these sectors as well as documentation of practical good practices on what has been done to address the corruption issues in several countries. The social audit of governance and delivery of public services: Pakistan 2004/05 provides an evidence of citizens\u2019 satisfaction with public services including health and education. There are some interesting facts on how corruption manifests itself in terms of low satisfaction with and use of health services. There is also evidence of unofficial \u2018prices\u2019 being paid to avail the supposedly free health services.

To transform this, Herman suggests, people need to start separating the parts of social identity belonging to the practice of political, ethnic and faith beliefs. The lack of institutional licensing control for imported drugs and other pharmaceutical products into the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) poses serious problems concerning the quality and safety of the drugs entering the country. The absence of a central clearing house for imported drugs allows drug importers to market inferior quality drugs at high prices. The importing pharmacies some of which are owned by or operating in partnership with foreign pharmaceutical companies are able to offer prescription drugs to publicly-owned hospital and local clinics at very high prices which poor patients end up paying, some of whom have limited health insurance and some of whom have none. It is not possible to detect any counterfeit drugs or inferior quality drugs. 117 In a country where no one knows whether the imported drugs are safe or not except the importers themselves, sellers have tremendous edge in price setting and in bribing health officials to buy their drugs at attractive low prices which already incorporate high marked-up prices. The foreign-owned locally based pharmacies are at great advantage as they control the supply of drugs that are needed by the hospital and the clinics.

In FSM, it is generally accepted that all people belong to their government, to their traditional system, and to their churches. They need to be able to separate the roles they play in the different organizations they belong to. They need to know that it is their government that can protect their rights and they need to know that it takes honest and responsible people to safeguard their rights.

I have been away for some time but I have been enjoying the discussions. I think Ramesh\u2019s argument is correct. I think that the relationship between increased expenditure in the education and health sectors and corruption is correct if increased expenditure results in availability of good health facilities and drugs across the board. Where expenditure is limited to a few hospitals or where drugs are available in a few places that will create demand for the limited places or drugs, this then can increase the opportunities for corruption, despite increased expenditure. Expenditure alone is no guarantee that corruption will be reduced if it is not accompanied with fair distribution and access. I assume that this is understood in Ramesh\u2019s argument and probably in the figures. Taryn Vian, Boston University, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Taryn Vian probes the complexities of the hypothesis advanced by Ramesh Gampat on supply shortages and underpaid workers as drivers of administrative corruption. Taryn points to research from Cambodia showing mitigation of informal payments through health reforms associated with user fees. More broadly, Taryn urges a contextualized approach to the political economy in order to better understand non-rational behaviour that seems to be at the core of a \u2018culture of corruption\u2019. The previous discussions have described important types of corruption in the health sector, in particular counterfeit drugs (Sonia Gomez\u2019s contribution) and informal payments (Hasna Cheema\u2019s contribution). Several postings have mentioned the issue of underpayment of workers and shortages of supplies as vulnerabilities to corruption. Ramesh Gampat\u2019s contribution is especially perceptive, situating corruption in workplace relations and the human inventiveness in filling gaps. In particular, I appreciated Mr. Gampat\u2019s use of language, describing how under- spending on health by governments creates \u2018corrupt space\u2019. This recalls the work by Peter Berman and colleagues at the Harvard School of Public Health, who discuss decentralization reforms in terms of \u2018decision space\u2019, accorded to managers. Supply shortages and underpaid workers are indeed high on the list of drivers of administrative corruption in the public health sector. A research study on informal payments in Albania, 119 involving qualitative interviews with 151 public citizens, doctors, nurses, and administrators, highlighted the fact that citizens and public providers often perceived that providers had no choice but to engage in informal payments to be able to feed their families (Vian et al. 2004).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fec5eec0-a476-444c-9455-f39aa57899da": {"__data__": {"id_": "fec5eec0-a476-444c-9455-f39aa57899da", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Transforming Corruption through Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "12538af99f82033297d622d3108ce9fdbb726b1873186fb6aff6b41953024d7f"}, "2": {"node_id": "38223a6a-09ff-4abf-89b3-24ab94193e80", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e388e24fae981569c16ef78599264145297353fad71b0db05ac34ce25d4a3381"}}, "hash": "bc9fffa5f08e1639e76cb1c8939384784df919e8513c9069db82187b995076b1", "text": "2004).

It thus becomes important to probe what these factors are. 1) Informal payments may be driven by patients as well as providers. Research in several countries has shown that the fear that one might miss the opportunity to get the best possible health outcome, and a belief on the part of patients that health is extremely important and worth any price, can drive patients to offer informal payments to clinicians. In countries where public sector quality of care is weak, some patients may seek quality assurance through informal fees. The solution to informal payments must therefore include systemic improvements to assure patients that providers are being held accountable to high standards of care. 2) Traditions of giving a gift to express gratitude can create ambiguity in informal payments. When is a payment a gift versus an informal fee? It really boils down to intention, which is very hard to measure (see Table 1). Policy makers and providers may argue that informal payments are simply gifts and cause little harm. Research to document actual perceptions of citizens can dispel this notion and thus can help stimulate policy reform. 3) In some health systems, health care providers must make payments to people in higher level positions, in order to retain their jobs. This type of corruption was suspected in Azerbaijan (USAID 2005). If clinicians are sending a portion of their pay (formal or informal) up the ladder to their supervisors, then simply increasing salaries will not reduce corruption. Some other reasons for the rising prevalence of informal payments are the lack of deterrents (allowing the behaviour to appear \u2018normal\u2019), social norms influencing providers (in Albania, doctors in training saw their University professors taking informal payments), and the growth of capitalistic values (suggesting that health is just another commodity in the market, to be sold by clinicians and purchased by patients). Evidence from studies suggests that the practice of informal payments for health services is more frequent in large towns and cities, and higher amounts seem to be requested from villagers who go to cities to seek specialized care. Informal payments are less common in areas where there is greater social cohesion, including rural areas and smaller urban communities. The Health and Education 120 Asia Pacific Human Development Network community ties between providers and residents in rural areas and smaller urban communities seem to deter informal payments, both because providers would be embarrassed or feel loss of professional reputation if people were to know they were accepting informal payments, and because it is common to exempt from payment people who are well known to the provider. In addition, since there is less medical technology available in smaller urban or more rural communities, thus there is less benefit (in terms of access to quality services) to be derived from making an informal payment. Cambodia has some promising examples of how informal payments can be mitigated through comprehensive health reforms related to user fees. For example, a 2004 article published in the journal Health Policy & Planning documents the experience of Takeo Provincial Hospital in Cambodia, a 157 bed hospital which had high rates of informal payments but was able to reduce them. According to surveys done in 1996, the estimated monthly revenue from informal payments was $13,750, about 5 times the monthly hospital payroll and about 45 per cent of the total budget. Through a series of reforms that included policy changes at the MOH level, enabling official user fees with fee retention, the hospital was able to bring the payments out from under-the-table. The informal payments were replaced by formal payments, which were more predictable and smaller, on average, because the burden was shared more fairly. Admissions went up by 50 per cent; outpatient visits initially increased then had a steady decline. Some of the decline in outpatient visits was attributed to private sector competition, but could also be due to incentives to hospitalize, as that provided income for salaries. Monthly income from user fees was 32-37 per cent of total revenue. Government financing increased over time, and external donor aid was pared back. Almost all of the user fee revenue was used to pay personnel bonuses. These were 5-10 times the government salary of the workers. Patients paid less, effectively, with the official fees than they had with the informal charges, and the fees were consistent and predictable. The unequal benefits to providers were now shared across staff (Barber et al. 2004; Soeters and Griffiths 2003).

Corruption in the pharmaceutical sector is a major obstacle to access medicines. Despite the scientific advances made in the development of new medicines and in improving human health during the past decades, most essential medicines remain unavailable, unaffordable, unsafe or improperly used in many parts of the world. This health crisis has many complex causes, including poverty, under-investment in health systems, war, and corruption in the pharmaceutical sector. The pharmaceutical sector is highly vulnerable to corruption and unethical practices. This is due in part to the high market value of pharmaceutical products and associated financial interests; the complexity of the processes on regulating and procuring pharmaceuticals; the involvement of several different actors, and the asymmetry of information and market failures. Corruption in the pharmaceutical system can lead to severe health and economic consequences. For instance, corruption in the pharmaceutical regulatory system can result in marketing approval for medicines that are necessarily rational - in terms of safety, efficacy, quality and price.

Recognizing this problem in late 2004, the WHO initiated the Good Governance for Medicines programme, which offers a technical support package for tackling unethical practices in the public pharmaceutical sector. The goal of the Good Governance for Medicines programme is to curb corruption in the pharmaceutical sector through the application of transparent and accountable administrative procedures and the promotion of ethical practices among health professionals. Tackling corruption in the pharmaceutical sector requires a long-term strategy. The WHO has identified a three-step approach: o National assessment of the level of transparency and vulnerability to corruption of key functions in medicines regulation and supply management systems. o Development of a national programme on good governance for medicines, with the aim of increasing transparency and accountability in the pharmaceutical sector and promoting ethical practices, through a wide national consultation process. o Implementation and promotion of the national programme on good governance for medicines. From 2004 to 2007 the project was gradually introduced in 10 countries: Bolivia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malawi, Malaysia, Mongolia, Papua New Guinea, Philippines and Thailand. Assessment of the level of transparency in national medicines regulation and public sector pharmaceutical procurement systems was conducted in all 10 countries by national assessors, using the WHO transparency assessment tool (World Health Organisation 2007). Information collected from Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand (the first four countries that conducted the assessment) revealed that although they have different public sector procurement and medicines regulation profiles, they have some common strengths and weaknesses (World Health Organisation 2006). For example, all have transparent (written and publicly available) Standard Operating Procedures for procurement, but none requires a conflict of interest form to be completed by members of the registration or selection committees. Health and Education 124 Asia Pacific Human Development Network The focus is now to consolidate on-going efforts in the 10 countries that are already part of the programme, and, at simultaneously extend the programme to new countries and regions. Selection of new countries and activities will be planned in response to requests from governments and in collaboration with WHO Regional Offices. Fayyaz Baqir, UNDP Pakistan, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Fayyaz Baqir describes a public-private sector partnership for delivery of primary healthcare, implemented elsewhere in the world before being established in the rural Punjab province of Pakistan. It resulted in a considerable increase in the number of people being treated. The dynamics encompass selected representatives (elected Councillors, teachers, women, students, professionals, minorities) serving to integrate community interests. Their priority tasks are managing human resources (salaries) and supply of medicines. Fighting corruption in the health sector: Case study of a public-private partnership for delivery of primary healthcare service in rural Punjab Background In August 1999 an initiative to improve health delivery systems commenced in the rural district of Lodhran in the Punjab province of Pakistan, with the establishment of three Basic Health Units (BHUs). These BHUs were taken over from the Punjab Government (GOP) by the National Rural Support Programme (NRSP). The three BHUs were run by one Medical Officer (MO) engaged by the NRSP at an enhanced salary. A \u2018Revolving Fund\u2019 of Rs. 100,000 was created using private resources, with the purpose of maintaining a store of high quality medicines. Patients had the option of purchasing medicines from this store or receiving free medicines that were supplied by the Government at all BHUs. The Fund revolved as much as twenty two times during 36 months thus showing a strong public preference for quality medicines. The turn-out of patients at the three BHUs also registered a quantum increase while it was being managed by the NRSP. This initiative is not as novel as some are apt to think. There are at least 8 similar experiences elsewhere in the world which the World Bank has studied and documented. At present the Punjab Rural Support Programme (PRSP) is attempting to implement it in the Punjab. The initiative is indeed the first of its kind in many ways in Pakistan and the scale of it is truly without parallel. Based on the success of the programme in Lodhran it was expanded to rest of Punjab as The Chief Minister\u2019s Initiative for Primary Healthcare (CMIPHC). The CMIPHC is now launched in twelve Districts. To expand to more districts will require major capacity building at the PRSP as at the present stage it would be unable to cope with additional areas. 125 Numbers clearly show that many more people, compared to the past, are now receiving medical assistance at", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eadf57e8-9ee4-4d15-a672-71b6d77a2add": {"__data__": {"id_": "eadf57e8-9ee4-4d15-a672-71b6d77a2add", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Transforming Corruption through Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "21de21c3b57c2ae1d88f03a425c7824f14d82ce47cd50fc7a783d6495416f4d1"}, "3": {"node_id": "329e952f-42e4-4f5e-a81f-9cef522ccd49", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "40397abdf1bdfc885fd2ea36d99c12bd46676ede83b7a384a5baaf47ee00a56f"}}, "hash": "c1bcf243f404f4f754ee1701f7ac3837466c2830f1371a4a0c1d33c5fa75dd46", "text": "these facilities. This, in itself, should be a sufficient raison d\u2019\u00eatre for any such FLHF. The numbers are also an indication of the client satisfaction. During the twelve months of 2005, the number of patients receiving medical assistance from the FLHFs managed by the CMIPHC in these 10 operational Districts was 13,501,269. The highest during the year was in the month of August when 1,553,600 new patients received medical assistance at these facilities. In the same month, prior to the CMIPHC, the comparable numbers were 562,252. Community support A new activity at the FLHFs that PRSP envisions as the most effective way to ensure that a service delivers the desired volume and quality is to assign an appropriate role to the beneficiaries and the stakeholders in its delivery. There can be no greater assurance of the desired volume and quality, on a continuing basis, than this linkage. The CMIPHC is, therefore, proceeding to organize a \u2018Support Group\u2019 attached to every BHU. Each Group comprises carefully selected persons who represent important interests like elected councillors, teachers, women, students, professions, minorities, etc. The Group meets at least once a month and integrates the BHU with the community that it is intended to serve. It is the responsibility of the Group to ensure that the BHU is enabled, at all times and on a continuing basis, to provide a wider and better range of services. A member of the DSU staff arranges, attends and minutes all meetings. It is clearly evident that numerous new possibilities are emerging as the \u2018Support Groups\u2019 gradually mature into operation. It is most reassuring to see the enthusiasm and energy of the community and the ready support it is providing. So far, the following Support Groups have been organized. Simultaneously work on the establishment and making groups operational continues at a rapid pace. Medicines One key reason behind the FLHFs being dysfunctional is believed to be the mismanagement of medical supplies. One of the first priorities with the CMIPHC was thus to ensure the availability of the required range of medicines of acceptable quality at all the BHUs/RDs at all times. So far, the initiative has had only partial success. One reason behind this is the extreme pressure of keeping all BHUs/RDs adequately supplied given the vast number and ever increasing number of patients. In a bid to alleviate this, efforts have been initiated to evolve a fresh list which meets needs better. Health and Education 126 Asia Pacific Human Development Network Almost all medicines/materials are purchased relying on \u2018Rate Contracts\u2019 concluded by the government(s) and reputable government institutions. As a policy, the initiative aims to improve the price in the \u2018Rate Contracts\u2019. The cushions prudently built into the prices for the public sector buyers, make it possible to lower the prices for the CMIPHC. Financial cost of the CMIPHC PRSP had, at the start of the CMIPHC, sought funding from the Government of Punjab for the management of the initiative, on the basis of expressly designated needs for capital, salaries and non-salary expenses at the PSU and each DSU. The CMIPHC is ensuring that the average \u2018cost of management\u2019 of one BHU (2 RDs are assumed to be one BHU) does not exceed the upper limit of Rs. 2,000 per month. The \u2018cost of management\u2019 of healthcare in a district, as provided in the district budget, includes funds for salaries and non-salary expenses on the management and supervision of BHUs/RDs, RHCs, THQ Hospitals and one DHQ Hospital. Clustering is not an article of faith with the CMIPHC as some may tend to believe. It is the result of local realities at the time the initiative enters a District. While some BHUs are being served by one medical professional in clusters of 3, a large number are arranged in clusters of two or are being managed singly by a Medical Officer. The arrangements vary across towns\\villages depending on the relevant local conditions. The availability of professionals, medical and paramedics, to serve in remote villages is a serious issue. As of January 1, 2006 the CMIPHC was working with 191 clusters of 3 Facilities, 133 clusters of 2 Facilities and 153 MOs operating with a single facility.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "329e952f-42e4-4f5e-a81f-9cef522ccd49": {"__data__": {"id_": "329e952f-42e4-4f5e-a81f-9cef522ccd49", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Transforming Corruption through Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "21de21c3b57c2ae1d88f03a425c7824f14d82ce47cd50fc7a783d6495416f4d1"}, "2": {"node_id": "eadf57e8-9ee4-4d15-a672-71b6d77a2add", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c1bcf243f404f4f754ee1701f7ac3837466c2830f1371a4a0c1d33c5fa75dd46"}}, "hash": "40397abdf1bdfc885fd2ea36d99c12bd46676ede83b7a384a5baaf47ee00a56f", "text": "Rui Yang, Monash University, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Rui Yang provides an exhaustive account of education corruption in China.

Let me begin by saying I enjoyed reading nearly all the previous postings. I learned more about the situation in countries like Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and India. I also found it difficult to argue against Ramesh\u2019s hypothesis, which was, as indicated by the facilitators\u2019 note, endorsed by Phil. I also agreed with Li Jing\u2019s brief description of China\u2019s anti-corruption initiatives in health. 127 I want to add two contributions to this discussion: the major form(s) of corruption in education provision in China, and some fundamental factors related to this issue in China, and their implications for other countries as well. Corruption in education provision takes a variety of forms in China. However, at present, illegal charges remain the most prevalent form of corruption. Education in China is among those industries with ancillary fees and illegal profiting. In 2001, Liaoning investigated fee collection activities in 85 secondary schools and ferreted out 130 million Yuan in unauthorised and excessive fees. In 2002, Shanghai audited 150 schools and found 7,240,000 Yuan in illegal fees. In 2003, audits of nearly 3,000 primary and 1,500 secondary schools in Jiangxi uncovered 125 cases of illegally collected fees worth $2 million. Nationwide, the government uncovered over $20 million worth of illegally collected school fees. In 2004, authorities disciplined 2,488 people in the educational field, and dismissed 359 school principals. Illegal charges are greater in higher education. The national government audited 18 institutions in 2003 and found 868 million Yuan was illegal. This was equivalent to 14.5 per cent of all their charges and a 32 per cent increase over 2002. In order to generate income, many universities have recently been resorting to developing \u2018university towns,\u2019 which have branch campuses of public universities that operate as private businesses. These towns are located in many parts of China, and are primarily found in the wealthier areas. In 2004, 249 university branch campuses were established, with an intake of 680,000 students. Many of the \u2018university towns\u2019 have financial irregularities. The Oriental University City in Langfang, Hebei, for example, owed a scandalous 2.2 billion Yuan in debt. Illegitimate education-related fees are undisguised and justified by the belief that education undertakings can be commercialised to pursue the biggest profits. Rampant illegal fee collection in education is both profiteering and an abuse of public power. Availability of education at all levels does not necessarily mean accessibility for many poor youngsters if they and their families do not have the capacity to pay in the first place. The most detrimental effects of illegal profits impact an estimated 300 million schoolchildren and their families. Many parents are forced to tolerate education profiteering due to their strong desire to see their child get ahead in life. They cut back on food and clothing and spend much of their household income on their child\u2019s education. In rural areas the ratio is much higher. This enormous burden redirects a large chunk of their family income into education costs, a large portion of which does not fund education but instead enriches corrupt officials. As many families find it hard to save, their children\u2019s \u2018free and compulsory\u2019 state-provided education is under threat. Health and Education 128 Asia Pacific Human Development Network Many of those involved in illegal charges justify their actions by quoting the \u2018market principle,\u2019 arguing that their school prices should conform to the market, and claim that \u2018beneficiaries must invest in their own education\u2019. A direct result of the increase in education costs and the illegal charges is that disparities in educational inequality is widening between social classes and urban-rural communities. Inequalities in educational opportunities are epitomized by the gap between enrolment and admission rates at various stages of schooling. The gap widens at higher levels of education, assuming the shape of an inverted pyramid. By 1986 when the Law of Compulsory Education was passed, primary and junior secondary education (which is compulsory in China) had already been universalized in urban areas. In contrast, compulsory education had not been universalized in 10 per cent of rural areas by 2000. The admission rate to senior secondary schools increased from 40 per cent in 1985 to 55.4 per cent in 1999 in urban areas, while it decreased from 22.3 to 18.6 per cent during the same period in rural areas.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "479356bc-05d9-4703-86ae-8c72cd1c9f6c": {"__data__": {"id_": "479356bc-05d9-4703-86ae-8c72cd1c9f6c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Transforming Corruption through Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8a92a9c2ce8402a053958ae62e0171243eaebef39701e6cbb2128e0bb35c4917"}, "2": {"node_id": "ba64f53e-f033-4d8f-98cb-e37205264c74", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0e3305533564490086859448029dc198500eee468e44fc768596259d1c323c95"}}, "hash": "20a8aa28e8a4e9e3285be0d995131594a9d6ba201b551c588f1c35cdc019b172", "text": "In the field of higher education, the urban-rural inequalities are even more pronounced.

The disparities became more pronounced between 1994 and 1997. There is an inverted pyramid shape of the disparities among different social strata in Chinese higher education: the more prestigious the institutions, the lower percentage of the rural students. Children from family backgrounds of factory workers, professionals and civil servants were respectively 5, 25 and 37 times more likely to receive higher education at average institutions in 1980 than their peers from countryside. Overall, the opportunity ratios for peasants to send their children to ordinary Chinese higher education institutions in comparison to workers, civil servants, businesspeople and professionals were 1:2.5:17.8:12.8:9.4. The ratios turn into 1:4:31.7:22.6:17.4 for the first-tier national ones. Generally, rural children are 5 to 6 times less likely to be able to receive higher education than their urban counterparts. The profiteering also shakes the foundation of China\u2019s education and deprives many children of their right to education. It challenges some longstanding Chinese traditions of education, including the student-teacher relationship, the purpose of education, and attitudes towards knowledge. Education was highly valued in the Confucian tradition. The fundamental purpose of education is to cultivate students\u2019 moral character, and teaching is more than a job, indeed it is seen as a vocation. Such a perception has been seriously undermined by the ongoing commoditisation of education. Since commoditisation of education adds a financial element to the qualifications of attending private schools and public and private universities, it also 129 pertains directly to the role money plays in getting into education in the first place, which blocks opportunities for many aspiring poor to start with. This situation leads to two key observations. First, it is important to point out Chinese government\u2019s inaction. The Chinese state has always been strong in education, even against a backdrop of rhetorical decentralisation and devolution for years. As policy can also be defined as what governments choose not to do, the state\u2019s inaction shows its role in promoting commoditisation of education, in view of the dramatic current situation. For years, government expenditure on education has fluctuated between 2- 3.5 per cent of GDP, a far cry from what has been recommended by the UNESCO, and lower than the 4 per cent promised by the government in its 1993 Programme. The percentage plateaued around 2 per cent during the 1990s when commercialisation of education was rampant, reflecting the government\u2019s tacit consent to it. As a result of the reallocation of educational resources based on a principle of financial capacity to pay fees, China\u2019s public education contributes to social divides, instead of promoting equity and equality. Second, the commoditisation of education is not simply a technical change in the management of the delivery of educational services. It involves changes in the meaning and experience of education including, what it means to be a teacher and a learner. It changes who we are, our relation to what we do, and the framework of possibilities within which we act. It is thus a process of social transformation, a change that is part of a more general set of movements in the social terrain. With the emphasis on the lucrative nature of the education business, its effect is detrimental. Developing (not accidentally, non-Western) countries will benefit from the prevailing neo- liberal form of globalisation only if they possess what most of them manifestly lack \u2013 sound institutions. Without the necessary support of institutional infrastructure and socio-cultural traditions, the commoditisation of education affects them even more seriously. Poor people within these countries have been particularly disadvantaged due to the combination of the shortage of democracy and widespread corruption in these societies. For example, The Bretton Woods institutions have always included in their advice package to Nigeria, the need to reduce government overheads by making Nigerians pay for their education. They suggest that the introduction of market forces into education will raise the performance of the education system. This premise, however, has been based on faith rather than hard facts. Health and Education 130 Asia Pacific Human Development Network After a decade of school reform initiatives informed by the faith, increasing empirical studies suggest those policies have a stratifying effect, by social class and by ethnicity, even when they are explicitly designed to remedy inequality.

We have seen that health and education are relatively strong drivers of administrative corruption; yet, chief among these are political and economic factors, in all their various cultural expressions. These drivers are directly associated with under-investment by governments, as Ramesh Gampat has observed. One critical outcome concerns wages, that are too low to enable officials to make a decent living; and this increases the likelihood of demand for unofficial payments. Yet, those who have to pay up are still vulnerable to fake, unsafe medicine as well as to inadequate education outcomes for their children. These past 2-weeks have seen increasing agreement on the power of a \u2018contextualized political economy approach\u2019 to help clarify the varieties of corruption. It is an approach that challenges neoclassical economic theory on multiple levels. Importantly, it traces its starting point not to exchange dealings but to workplace relations, where production happens, and where wage levels have an impact. This raises a question about ensuing exchange transactions, whether the \u2018informal\u2019 exchanges invariably required between doctors-patients or teachers-parents are rational in character, as neoclassical theory would have us believe. Alternatively, are these simply dealings between persons maximizing their respective interests? This is unlikely, according to views that have been expressed. This past fortnight has demonstrated that much more needs to be learned about the complex kind of logic/coherence that is evident when social goods are in short supply. In a day or two we will turn to a different set of variables, concerning the provision of water, sanitation, and electricity services. What distinct drivers of demand operate in these situations? What patterns of reasoning show up? We will send a separate email with further questions to help guide discussion. 131 Meanwhile, we appreciate your continued interest. Special thanks for all your contributions. Please make your views known in the next phase of this very challenging investigation. All the best Jim Chalmers 3.4 Offline Discussion Dieter Zinnbauer, Transparency International, wrote: Corruption in the health sector In 2006, Transparency International made corruption in the health sector the special focus of its Global Corruption Report. It is encouraging to see that the topic of corruption and health continues to be the focus of informed exchange as a facet of human development in the Asia- Pacific region. We hope the following excerpts from the 2006 report might help to shape this debate, and encourage those seeking more detailed information to access the full publication from our website (www.transparency.org/gcr). Most importantly, the report reveals that corruption has devastating effects on health systems around the world. Money lost to corruption could be used to buy medicines, equip hospitals or hire badly needed medical staff. The diversity of health systems worldwide, the multiplicity of parties involved, the paucity of good record keeping in many countries, and the complexity in distinguishing between corruption, inefficiency and honest mistakes makes it difficult to determine the overall costs of corruption in this sector around the globe. But the scale of corruption is vast in both rich and poor countries. The report also finds that certain characteristics make all health systems \u2013 whether public or privately funded, in rich and poor countries \u2013 vulnerable to corruption: o An imbalance of information prevails in health systems. Health professionals have more information about illness than patients, and pharmaceutical and medical device companies know more about their products than public officials entrusted with spending decisions. Making information available can reduce losses to corruption. o The uncertainty in health markets \u2013 not knowing who will fall ill, when illness will occur, what kinds of illnesses people get and how effective treatments are \u2013 is another challenge for policy-makers, as it makes it difficult to manage resources, including the selection, monitoring, measuring and delivery of health care services and the design of health insurance plans. The risk of corruption is even higher in humanitarian emergency situations when medical care is urgently needed and oversight mechanisms are often bypassed. Health and Education 132 Asia Pacific Human Development Network o The complexity of health systems, particularly the large number of parties involved, exacerbates the difficulties of generating and analyzing information, promoting transparency, as well as detecting and preventing corruption. The relationships between medical suppliers, health care providers and policy-makers are often opaque and can lead to distortions of policy that are bad for public health. The report also indicates that the Asia Pacific region has experienced both setbacks and triumphs in the struggle against corruption in the sector. In 2006, Cambodia\u2019s health record was amongst the worst in Asia, with the region\u2019s highest maternal mortality rate, and a", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "465ad212-5365-4d42-96c0-edb8cb0c0a89": {"__data__": {"id_": "465ad212-5365-4d42-96c0-edb8cb0c0a89", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Transforming Corruption through Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "648107efc499656f8b5e51073137f905ce279c23321c7e75ea3b824c1a7d4bca"}, "3": {"node_id": "73ee3107-921e-459d-b49b-e5d4cab8ceeb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "834731dedf03aa8aee0f030ef47c0d7ca54b2401f0202e70e6b40b9542a5f304"}}, "hash": "864379b442721fdcfc4409856e7545f8ea39251c8f11bf26761bff5d92f5a198", "text": "staggering rate of infant mortality. \u201cSuch a poor state of health exists despite money pouring into Cambodia\u2019s health sector over the past decade to reconstruct a heath system that was systematically decimated under the Khmer Rouge regime (1975-78) and underfunded in subsequent years. Researchers, health workers and administrators interviewed in July 2005 said it was widely assumed that between 5 and 10 per cent of the health budget disappears before it is paid out by the Ministry of Finance to the Ministry of Health. More money is then siphoned off as funds are channelled down from the national government to the provincial governors and to the directors of operational districts, and then to the directors or managers of local hospitals and clinics.\u201d \u201cA study of health care delivery in the Philippines finds that poor and middle-income municipalities report longer waiting times at public clinics than rich ones, and a higher frequency of being denied vaccines when corruption is rampant. Corruption affects health policy and spending priorities\u2026Corruption in public clinics is also more likely to deter households living in poor municipalities and forces them to opt for self-medication.\u201d Despite these challenges, the region also shows causes for hope. In India the leading manufacturer of diagnostic machines which check for life-threatening blood diseases refused to participate in corrupt activities. Despite the time and money lost in legal battles and stalled processes, Suresh Vazirani, the company\u2019s founder, has never paid bribes to further his business. When a politician suggested it would be \u2018an opportunity\u2019 if he and Vazirani pocketed part of the World Bank aid the politician had received to improve health care, Vazirani replied: \u201cYes, and is it an opportunity if we land up in hospital needing urgent care ourselves?\u201d 133 In Thailand, the Rural Doctor\u2019s Forum (RDF) exposed corruption in the procurement of medicine and medical supplies. In addition to publicly petitioning the prime minister to investigate corruption in the health sector occurring within the government, the RDF also formed a coalition with other NGOs to fight corruption in medical supplies. These brief glimpses demonstrate that corrupt practices continue to pose a dire threat to the health sector in the Asia-Pacific region. Nevertheless, the integrity and determination demonstrated by many individuals in the region also gives cause for hope.

The WSE sector is marred by corrupt practices including bad administration, poor management of scare resources, negligent conduct, and financial embezzlement, mainly at the higher administrative levels. Additionally the delivery mechanisms including devolution, privatization is exposed to political driven motive and profit based proclivities. The WSE sector, in Pakistan, is confronted with multiple dimensions of corrupt practices. In the Water and Sanitation Authority (WASA) for instance, there are serious allegations of millions of rupees being taken by senior officials, from the salaries of the sweepers and being distributed as bribes amongst sanitation officials. The sanitary workers are deprived of their meagre monthly wages as officials take a portion of their salaries as a bribe for them to remain absent for 10 to 15 days or as many days as they wish. The sanitation officials in return mark the absent staff members present in the attendance register. Similarly in the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) the malicious practices ranging from electricity theft, meter-tampering, fiscal embezzlement, shrouded procurement deals to the utter negligence of the maintenance of physical infrastructure are common. To fully comprehend the gravity of the situation, it is imperative to examine the role of local governance structures (local district and municipal administrations), decentralization and privatization in facilitating the malaise of corruption in WSE sector in Pakistan. With the promulgation of LGO-2001, the responsibility for the delivery of water and sanitation has been decentralized to the \u2018Tehsil\u2019 tier of local government. The Tehsil Municipal Administration (TMA) has been introduced with primary aim of assuming responsibility for the planning and implementation of water supply and sanitation services. Regrettably, the local governing structure\u2019s performance is affected by corrupt influences including elite-capture of local constituency, poor administration and embezzlement of meagre resources for water and sanitation programmes. 139 What are the consequences of institutional and administration corruption in WSE sector for Pakistan? Only 54 per cent of the population has access to sanitary latrines (86 per cent urban and 30 per cent rural). Almost half of the population does not have access to clean drinking water. The crossing over of water and sanitation pipelines gives rise to solid waste disposal and drainage disarray posing a threat to human lives.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e6d08b8a-4c3b-4618-ac74-9e3964b7fa5c": {"__data__": {"id_": "e6d08b8a-4c3b-4618-ac74-9e3964b7fa5c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Transforming Corruption through Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "902dc8a559366ded481721ce66bfb774c377b8cd8ed4959e6bd9b804c4899e61"}, "2": {"node_id": "41453745-e86a-4257-a5b8-5e5c31ce01d4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "59095ddc66759d52c463b0681331c471fe0c948292b5b3f5b4db938e8ed58de3"}}, "hash": "85fd061c536e5dd0de56954936c1c3f2bc3a47b92d384dfc32a8c1c556b2460a", "text": "The role of private multinational companies in delivery of water, sanitation and electricity to developing countries tends to be monopolistic and profit driven.

The World Bank is at the forefront of imposing conditionalities on developing countries, which includes the opening of the water sector to foreign multinationals. This collusion between World Bank and private multinationals only adds to the daily sufferings of millions of impoverished communities in developing countries exposing them to ill health and deprivation of fundamental human needs. In this mayhem, it is imperative to highlight local best practices which minimize the ill effects of corruption. Community Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) is one of these practices which aims to create creative awareness on the negative impacts of open defecation. The CLTS approach involves no subsidy as it only promotes an attitude of external expectation and dependence. Neither does it prescribe latrine models. Rather it encourages the initiative and capacity of the community. The CLTS approach was first pioneered in 1999 by Kamal Kar working with the Village Education Resource Centre (VERC) in a small community of Rajshahi district in Bangladesh. Since then the approach has continued to spread within Bangladesh and has been introduced in a number of Asian and African countries including Pakistan. As the delivery of WSE has become one of the primary functions of the local governing structures, it would be essential to put in place stronger accountability and monitoring mechanisms to hold local leadership accountable for any financial or institutional wrongdoing. Dr. Gurpreet Singh, Municipal Corporation of Delhi, India, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Dr. Gurpreet Singh concurs with recent comments that the issue is multifaceted and includes issues such as supply and demand imbalance, monopoly providers, etc. Gurpreet notes Social Services: Water, Sanitation and Electricity 140 Asia Pacific Human Development Network that for many well-heeled persons, corruption is a leverage situation, they are happy to conserve. But this ought not to prevent citizens from doing something about it by insisting on more space for public participation and third party monitoring through the media and civil society organisations, through decentralisation, enforcement of rule of law, and transparent decision-making processes. The issue of corruption in public services like health, education, electricity, water supply etc. is multifaceted. The prime reason of course is the demand and supply imbalance. Another reason is that historically there has been only single player (government) for most of the time, leading to a monopoly situation. Another reason for corruption, particularly in health is the desperate situation in which people find themselves when they are sick and suffering. In the absence of an adequate safety net, for most population belonging to lower and lower middle class, the situation is ripe for exploitation. A rather disturbing trend is that corruption has become institutionalised and is now more or less accepted in society. People expect officials to be corrupt and people with adequate resources offer bribes on their own to get their work expedited or for bending of rules in their favour. For many people, with adequate resources, corruption is good as they can exploit the situation in their favour. Most of the time there is no large-scale social protest or movement against corruption. This leads us to another important issue \u2013 as to what can be done? Or in other words even with the existence of the demand and supply gap, what mechanisms should have been established to prevent corruption? And the single most important answer is- good governance. The institutional mechanism needed for this includes the enforcement of rule of law, transparency in decision-making, decentralisation, use of instruments like a citizens charter, public participation, third party monitoring through good instruments like the media, NGO sector etc. Even though we are a committed democracy with a well-written constitution many of these intuitional mechanisms are still evolving. All of us need to contribute to this evolution. Ramesh Gampat and Niranjan Sarangi, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Ramesh Gampat shares his cross-country statistical assessment on the WSE sector done with Niranjan Sarangi, which shows: 1) community access to sanitation is lower at higher levels of corruption (and vice versa); 2) improved access is causally related to government 141 effectiveness, and 3) investment to expand supply is inadequate without associated actions. There is thus a need to address areas such as lack of awareness of rights and prices, collective action problems, asymmetric information, etc. Without a combination of such actions, unequal power relationships and inequalities appear to thrive. As a result the linkage between access and corruption could surge from a problem of corruption to even greater inequality.

With the assistance of my colleague, Niranjan, we have assembled data for 97 countries, including 17 from the Asia Pacific region. Data on WSE were obtained from the 2006 Global Human Development Report. For corruption, we used Transparency International\u2019s 2006 Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI). The CPI has been transformed [by taking the reciprocal so that the values ranges from zero (highly clean) to 1 (highly corrupt)], so that higher values reflect higher levels of corruption and vice versa. Scatter plots were done for access to sanitation and corruption, access to water (for consumption, not productive, purposes) and electricity consumption and corruption. To capitalize on space, we show only the plot for the former but the trend line is significantly similar for the other two (water and electricity), except that the R square is much higher in the case of electricity consumption and corruption. The overall evidence for the entire WSE \u2018sector\u2019 is clear. The cross- country results show a strong and direct relationship with corruption, as gauged by the CPI. For example, access to sanitation is lower at higher levels of corruption and vice versa, as can be seen from figure 1 (if you are interested in the other figures, please send me an email). There are, however, some exceptions. For example, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ghana and Madagascar are relatively clean (transformed CPI vales of less than 0.32) but yet have low access to sanitation (less than 32 per cent of the population), while Trinidad, Belarus, Honduras and Uzbekistan are relatively corrupt (transformed CPI values of over 0.4) but yet have relatively high access to sanitation (over 80 per cent). Why is there such a strong relationship between WSE and corruption (even though the CPI is more a reflection of the receptivity of the \u2018business climate\u2019 to international capital) and how is corruption manifested in the WSE sector? As with health and education, it seems that demand supply imbalances, lack of awareness of rights and prices, collective action problems, asymmetric information, all of which encourage unscrupulous behaviour, are at the heart of corruption in the WSE sector. Could it be that these factors strengthened or created conditions for unequal power relationships and inequality (of assets and income), which, in the absence of effective anti-corruption measures, allowed corruption to flourish? Or perhaps the relationship Social Services: Water, Sanitation and Electricity 142 Asia Pacific Human Development Network could run from corruption to inequality? As to the nature of corruption in WSE, it would seem that petty corruption is pervasive. Here are some quick facts and figures: 1) Lack of access to clean water is estimated to cause 5 million deaths worldwide each year. 2) Report card surveys in Bangalore, India, found that approximately a third of the city\u2019s poor had to pay a bribe to get a service or to solve a service-related problem. 3) According to TI, more than 60 per cent of consumers in India report irregularities in their electricity connection processes. 4) Thampi (2002) reported that, in Pakistan, 92 percent of the households using public education services reported the payment of bribes averaging 4,811 rupees ($86). 5) In Bangladesh, revenues are collected for only 55 per cent of the power generated. Corruption and mismanagement account for about half of the total system losses. 6) World Bank data suggests that 20-40 per cent of water sector finances are lost to corruption. At one of our meetings, a rather interesting story was related by a colleague. According to him, somewhere in an Indian city, the water inspector was called to checkout a problem in a high- rise that literally rose, like the proverbial beanstalk, in the middle of a slum, that was deprived of safe water and sanitation facilities and where electricity connections could only be had by Source: UNDP 2006; Transparency International 2006. Figure 1. Corruption and Access to Sanitation 143 stealing or paying a huge bribe (in relation to earnings). As the inspector was leaving, the yard boy, who lives in the slum surrounding the spanking high rise, said to him: Sir is the water problem fixed? Are the people on the 40th floor getting an adequate supply of water? Pushing his chest out, the inspector responded: \u201cYes, of course. The problem is now fixed.\u201d The yard boy paused and looked onto the ground, to the feet of the proud inspector.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9461214d-1563-4d32-b9ef-39fc21ee2a6e": {"__data__": {"id_": "9461214d-1563-4d32-b9ef-39fc21ee2a6e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Transforming Corruption through Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b99242766a19e971982d307aaaed7dd5e085c5114a8844f4a73d4ba667ac6190"}, "2": {"node_id": "6c6ea2f6-d4c6-49f8-ab73-856b284fd74a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2bbfe87e3966e62d746b7eff6bc9483010cf446a4dfc322304f64c6dc5ec312e"}}, "hash": "55d70769fbcda4532bcce9edf948ccea54fe99a38ff98044704a3e2dec102332", "text": "Then he asked: \u201cSir, how come the water flows up to the 40th floor but does not even flow to our hovels on the ground?

Hasna also correctly raised the issue of the structure of governance and its importance to WSE. To test this conjecture, I used data from the 2006 Global Human Development Report and World Bank governance indicator on government effectiveness. Government effectiveness measures the quality of public services, the quality of the civil service and the degree of its independence from political pressures, the quality of policy formulation and implementation, and the credibility of the government\u2019s commitment to such policies. The index values vary between -2.5 to 2.5 with higher values corresponding to better outcomes. The scatter plot for water, sanitation and electricity shows a strong positive relationship to government effectiveness, especially for access beyond 70 percent (see figure 2; the other figures can be obtained from the author). Two implications stem from this result: 1) even with present infrastructure, access to WSE could be improved if government effectiveness is improved, and 2) investment to expand supply will not solve corruption by itself. In conclusion, the evidence seems to support the emerging consensus that corruption is a complex and multi-dimensional phenomenon that has to be tackled by a sustained, multi-pronged strategy. My own opinion on this, which draws on evolutionary psychology, primatology and neuroscience, is that moral restraints are not as effective as legal deterrents. Strong reliance on moral/ethical values raises a number of troubling issues, including the implication that countries with lower levels of corruption (mostly in the West) have higher moral and ethical values than highly corrupt countries (which are mostly poor). Biswajit Padhi, SRUSTI (Society for Rural Upliftment & Socio Technological Initiative), India, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Biswajit Padhi writes that India needs more civil society actors dedicated to helping people. Under such circumstances they are less likely to be cheated by public servants. If there is a lesson, Biswajit says, it is that people can check corruption, if supported in efforts to understand and Social Services: Water, Sanitation and Electricity 144 Asia Pacific Human Development Network become aware. But right now there are too many laws and checks and balances, and this obstructs the fight by poor people against those bullies who raise bribes whenever government schemes increase public entitlements. I agree with Gurpreet on many points. But in India - corruption prevails primarily due to limited choices available (to the people/subscribers/consumers) and more importantly because of the sheer numbers of our population. An example of this view is given below. Recently, the government introduced a scheme termed Janani Surakshya Yojana where incentives are given to women who deliver their babies in hospitals. The immediate fallout of this has been that doctors in government hospitals have raised the amount of bribes to match what people can now afford to pay. This is possible because over a period of time we have kept the majority of our population illiterate and subjugated to the whims and fancies of government servants, who are \u2018empowered\u2019 because of their capacity to dole out government scheme benefits (all government grants are considered doles by people and not as their right). Source: World Bank 2007; Transparency International 2006. Figure 2. Access to Sanitation and Government Effectiveness, 2004 145 It is indeed ironic that despite so many checks and balances in the system, corrupt people have found ways to dodge and indulge themselves. Are so many checks and balances really necessary? Perhaps what is actually needed is something else. For instance, in India we have not been able to yet take full advantage of internet technology to spread the message and to end / check corruption. I suggest that internet could be used to spread awareness about the different government schemes available. But this requires another supporting player: there must be a civil society organisation to upload available information to the net. Aside from internet, in low literacy areas, we need more civil society organisations involved in translating such information into the vernacular language in order to disseminate it through folk media or literature. We did a campaign on National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) in a very limited way, but the results were a great success. We not only persuaded people to demand jobs and their entitlements but were happy to note that the panchayats were too scared to ignore the demands of the people. The Right to Information (RTI) was also very effectively used. However, such campaigns need to be scaled up and sustained on a continuous basis if they are to be successful.

A common woman or man will find it very difficult to fight the corrupt with so many laws and rules in place. Since the poor lack the resources to fight a bully, dedicated organisations independent of government control should promote such causes. Thus, a serious effort must be made to increase literacy which in turn will give voice to the people. Many vested interests, like politicians, and touts in villages, do not want their bases to be eroded by educating people. Because the state of Orissa had a flawed policy of not producing enough medical practitioners in the latter part of 19th century, we now have a situation of too few doctors and several vacant posts. Government doctors take advantage of the situation to indulge in corrupt practices, fully knowing the government\u2019s helplessness in initiating action against them. If a lesson is to be learned from this, it is that we can check corruption in many government run institutions, be it in health or education. Herman Semes, Transparency Micronesia Inc., wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Herman Semes points to personal enrichment and private resource use and other forms of out-of-sight favouritism that contribute to the stagnation of public WSE monopolies in the Federated States of Micronesia. Social Services: Water, Sanitation and Electricity 146 Asia Pacific Human Development Network WSE is provided by government-owned utility corporations that monopolize the provisioning of the services in the Federated States of Micronesia. Rates as established by the utility corporations are reviewed and approved by the government rate control agency. Members of the rate control agency do not have the technical capabilities to thoroughly review the rates as established by the utility corporations. Members could easily be convinced or bribed by the professionals in the utility corporations to approve rate increases. As government-owned companies, they are expected to provide WSE services to all citizens who need their services. These companies are designed to operate on a commercial basis, to be self supporting and at the same time be able to expand their services to the public. Currently however many people have no access to WSE. However, these government monopolies are operating without any evidence of growth supported by internally generated revenues. Costs of operation are relatively very high compared to other government entities. Its management teams are among the highest paid government servants in the country. While it may appear legitimate to have high salaries, it was obvious that its professional management team were again very influential in convincing the Board or decision makers to agree to such high salaries. Past board members admitted that they were given benefits by the management, such as free power and water which is clearly a form of bribery to win support of the board members, especially the influential ones. The public remains unaware of the financial status of these corporations, which are intentionally kept under a tight lid. The management continues to blame the spiralling cost of fuel as the principal factor contributing to the high cost of operations. The top management take long off- island trips for purposes unknown to the board and the public. Employees who are responsible for reading electrical and water meters are known for not doing actual reading but taking the average of previous readings to formulate bills. This is clearly demonstrated by the fact that consumers whose water meters have been submerged underground for long time continue to get a water reading appearing on their statements. A very unusual situation occurred when a meter reader could not reach a customer\u2019s residence because of dogs. Instead he tried to use mirror to get the reading of the meter which was quite far from where he was. The customer was watching as the meter reader was doing this. The customer later got his bill. He did raise the matter with management later. In these non-profit government-owned corporations, employees are getting free services in addition to their legitimate compensation. There is apparent favouritism in providing the services to the people. High level people in society receive preferential treatment compared to ordinary citizens. 147 As is clearly apparent, there are corrupt activities such as bribery, grease payments, and improper use of resources occurring in these corporations which are not apparent to the public. Other activities that the public remain unaware of are rate setting, salary increases, extra benefits for board members and staff, favouritism, travel, use of equipment, etc. All of these contribute to the utility corporations not being able to grow and expand their services to the general", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "367ab2c5-df47-4e99-9434-95c67a7e432a": {"__data__": {"id_": "367ab2c5-df47-4e99-9434-95c67a7e432a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Transforming Corruption through Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a34f7ae52dcdc1808bdf0e27e13141e5409e2babe892fb3df255f4644e4db2de"}, "3": {"node_id": "a6f7e0aa-67aa-44b8-ae55-3ffeea09b0a2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "84481b9d6d0a74abccc54b3c00ed4cf8421668fae9f7691739b493bc95559964"}}, "hash": "48540cb9cc4827f4f0f80573ffd4b832fc3c11ff59f94f43d85a4c822f20676d", "text": "public while a few continue to capitalise on this and enrich themselves from these operations. Sergio Feld, UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Sergio Feld refers to the issue of \u2018illegal connections\u2019 in WSE. I have read with interest the excellent comments and what struck me was that the one element missing from the discussion was the role of the poor and under-served themselves, in both exacerbating and potentially, curbing corruption related to the delivery of water, sanitation and electricity. I am referring to the issue of \u2018illegal\u2019 connections. I am putting quotes around illegal because we tend to see access as a matter of right, and hence any practice that seems to correct delivery failure may be ignored. But, more often than not it is a chance for corrupt practices. Illegal water connections account for much of the non-revenue water and poor utility performance (Elshorst and O\u2019 Leary 2005). In the face of poor service, the rich are the first to pay for and get illegal connections and the poor soon follow in a frenzy which is rather a tragic situation. But attempting to rectify this problem is not impossible. Mr. Ek Son, head of the Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority (PPWSA), received the 2006 Magsaysay Award for his work in improving the governance of PPWSA. One of the key activities he introduced and actively pursued was the control of illegal connections through inspections, penalties and education. The improved efficiency of the utility allowed for raising salaries and curbing employees\u2019 own corrupt tendencies (Chan 2006). Biswajit Padhi, SRUSTI (Society for Rural Upliftment & Socio Technological Initiative), India, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Biswajit Padhi raises the issue of privatisation of water resources and corruption. Water is a precious resource. But of late the government in Orissa, being dictated to by the World Bank, is trying to privatise it. Water since time immemorial has been a common property Social Services: Water, Sanitation and Electricity 148 Asia Pacific Human Development Network resource and it should remain that way. Efficient use of water can be promoted by taxing the corporations who exploit it for commercial purposes, and there are several ways to do that without privatising it. Why I am trying to say this is that once it is privatised there will be limited access to a product which has wide and regular uses - which will be main reason for promoting corruption in that sector. I need feedback from the enlightened colleagues on this. Closing Message Dear AP-HDNet members, As we move to wrap up this sub-section on Water Sanitation and Electricity, and then head on to the next subject of corruption in \u2018Special Development Situations\u2019, I value the opportunity to say how much your continued involvement is appreciated. It probably seems like a lengthy expedition to a pond where many others have drunk before us. But what we are taking in is uncommon. We have shed more light on a key recognition that anticorruption is a multifaceted problem. Respondents rarely if ever engage in a quixotic search for single core reasons why corruption happens in this sector. Instead we have heard how a blend of public awareness and collective action on rights and prices are essential to contest unequal power relationships. In turn, we have heard how inequalities are inflamed by corruption\u2019s ruinous effect on access; indeed, the problem of access could explode into much broader inequalities unless supply and demand imbalances and stagnant monopoly situations are countered with equal force. And overwhelmingly, respondents see \u2018equal force\u2019 as the prerogative of citizens, not governments or donors. Yet, support by development actors is essential in order to further develop citizens\u2019 capability to resist \u2013 support such as insisting on more space for public participation, third party monitoring through the media and civil society organisations, and through decentralisation, enforcement of rule of law, and transparent decision-making processes. None of these things can work in isolation, but together they could bring about more capability and human freedoms. Special thanks to all your contributions.

To give you a preview of some of the findings for the report, an analysis of the impact of corruption in water infrastructure provision in low-income countries estimates that the bribes paid for winning infrastructure contracts and covering up sub-quality work alone raises the price of sustainable water connections by 25 to 45 per cent. The report will bring together contributions from practitioners and researchers to analyse corruption risks with regard to water pollution and environmental sustainability, drinking water and sanitation, irrigation and agriculture, as well as hydropower. As we have learnt in the commissioning process, one of the main challenges is to really identify and isolate the corruption dimension from the multiple broader policy failures in this sector that leave more than one billion people without safe access to drinking water. Pinpointing the dynamics of corruption in this sector is not only an analytical challenge but has important ramifications for practical policy work and designing appropriate anti-corruption strategies. Although we have already commissioned most contributions, we are still very eager to learn about interesting case studies, new empirical assessments and innovative strategies to combat corruption in these water-related areas. Any pointers to such information are greatly appreciated and can be sent to dzinnbauer@transparency.org And I would like to take the opportunity already now to invite you to visit the report on our website or obtain a hardcopy from Cambridge University Press, when it will be published in mid 2008.

Will corrupt officials exploit the changed environment, or will donor affinity be shaped by \u2018strategic means transforming the end\u2019? Earlier discussions have highlighted the pervasiveness of corruption in the societies of the region and the fact that the price of corruption is mostly paid by the poor. When such a society is confronted with a disaster (be it one caused by nature or political/civil upheaval) and falls in an SDS, one can contemplate on the extent of the aggravation the new parameters will have on an already existing problem. Will the new emergency erase previous efforts at fighting corrupt practices in the various sectors of the economy and will the sudden institutional weakening and/or the breakdown of law and order promote expediency at the detriment of efficiency? Will the donors be more inclined to turn a blind eye on corrupt practices in order to expedite aid deliveries, keep the peace at all cost, and save lives? Will corrupt officials have a field day in the new environment? And will the means ultimately corrupt the end? Well-meaning emergency responses do not need to be less principled. It is essential that the same message prior to the emergency is conveyed early, in the response to the disaster, as it relates to the continued unacceptability of unethical and illegal behaviour as well as would be profiteers. There is a need for a well-publicized, standard code of conduct applicable to all intervening parties, which will leave no doubt on the policy in place during the period of emergency as well as the ensuing SDS. Reconstruction will be at stake. One could even be tempted to argue that, given the long, difficult and not necessarily successful struggle against corruption having taken place in normal circumstances before the onset of an SDS, the disaster may also provide unique opportunities for change and what is commonly referred as \u2018building back better\u2019. This is not a cynical or insensitive position but one that considers the inevitability of the new situation and tries to put a positive spin to an otherwise tragic event. There is all the more reason for upholding and promoting high moral and ethical standards right from the emergency response phase. When disaster of any kind strikes, local institutions and capacities may be unable to function normally, followed by a period of weakness and rehabilitation (SDS). CSO\u2019s may have better survived the disaster or had a quicker recovery, and may find themselves at the forefront of emergency response and reconstruction/peace building. This is another huge opportunity for strengthening their capacities and watchdog roles against corruption. Even during emergencies, 155 they can provide a channel for reporting and exposing corrupt practices and it is essential that donors be seen as openly supporting their role. As conditions return to normal, then CSO\u2019s may have gained more credibility and respect in their watchdog role and other independent forces such as the media, judiciary and law enforcement agencies can be brought to bear on the side of investigation, prosecution and reparation.

Perhaps the small number of postings has helped to spell out the difficulty of this topic for many agency people \u2013 difficult because situations like the Indian Ocean tsunami are acutely painful environments to work through; difficult because handling massive amounts of cash (including personal donations) transfers enormous responsibility, heightened when the work is in countries that have a reputation for corruption; difficult because there is acute time pressure on spending the money, requiring too-quick decisions about who to recruit and procure from, with limited data and local knowledge (under intense media spotlight); difficult because the transfer of goods is invariably in volatile security environments; and difficult because competition between different agencies are contesting shares in an intense donation market. What actions can be taken to develop policies and mobilise funds to promote agencies and staff who decide to tackle corruption? UNDP is launching websites that enable governments and communities to monitor spending on reconstruction projects. What are other steps are needed? What actions can be taken to ensure the groundwork and risk assessments are not too hasty but are effective? Transparency, consistent application of rules, publicity \u2013 all these help; but administrative processes alone will not win the fight. Local communities\u2019 involvement is essential for transparency, rules and publicity to work. Only when combined with systematic community engagement (particularly involving recipients) will administrative actions be able to tackle diversion.

There is a need to question the classical definition of corruption as an \u2018abuse of public office for private gain\u2019. A general image of the state as the main predator that controls access to resources or extracts resources for the benefit of a small class has to be balanced. Particularly for the natural resources sector, the boundaries between legal and illegal activities are not always clearly defined, which poses some conceptual challenges. The current concepts of corruption do not seem to be able to capture the complexities of the problems. The extractive industries show that corruption is not just a public sector problem that concerns the relationship between the state and its citizens. Much of the grand corruption in this sector is the result of legal and illegal deals between large private sector players and the state. Corruption may occur at various stages of natural resources management. When analysing the phenomena of state capture, there is difficulty in distinguishing between outright criminal activities and the more subtle ways in which companies may exert undue influence on policy making. These include political lobbying, companies offering donations to political parties and the conflict of interests that may exist between politicians and certain firms. We may also note the tendency of companies to \u2018bully\u2019 governments into changing policies by threatening to relocate to more favourable economic environments. Because these forms of undue influence need not always break the law, or they are allowed to occur due to legal loopholes, they are called \u2018legal corruption\u2019 or the \u2018use of public office/policy for private gain\u2019 \u2013 a term introduced by Kaufmann and Vicente (2005). There is a consensus that natural resources are essential for economic progress in both developed and developing countries. Natural resources also have a significant bearing on global efforts to reduce poverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Asia Pacific countries face the prospect of vastly increased income from minerals, oil and gas in coming years. Will the revenues advance human freedoms and capabilities or promote repression? In Mongolia right now, two of the world\u2019s biggest mining corporations are setting up a shop. It is a country that in 2006 ranked 99th out of 163 countries on the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), down 14 places from the 2005 CPI. Securing adequate pay for Mongolian decision-makers would help. But so too would requiring these companies to publicise how much they pay to the government in taxes, fees and royalties. Reforming the mining code could be a vehicle in helping Mongolians hold their government accountable. But what are the leverage points 6.

He elaborates, suggesting the hypothesis of the persistence of poverty in resource-rich countries can be explained by the fact their resources are sold/extracted far too cheaply, notwithstanding the bribes etc. paid. In regard to the question of what motivates corruption, the bulk of the literature has emphasized the well-known cases of \u2018resource curse\u2019, where abundance is considered as fuel for corruption. It would be useful to highlight cases where resource scarcity promotes corrupt behaviour (be it in the state, private sector or the population at large). Deprivation makes any society particularly vulnerable, but any form of scarcity induces public misconduct. Without unfulfilled demand, suppliers could not command any additional price and potential purchasers would not seek unfair access. Planning and regulation to ensure greater access and fairer distribution distort market conditions, setting in motion \u2018corrective\u2019 underground arrangements, and black markets aggravated by public monopolisation. This is the case regarding scarce water resources in Pakistan (see Matthew and Zaidi n.d.). There is a theoretical debate as to the relationship of natural resource abundance or scarcity to armed conflict (a close relative of corruption). You may refer to Le Billon 2001. I would suggest that in regard to corruption it is always an issue of scarcity, of what can be a locally, nationally, regionally or globally scarce (and needed) resource. Depending on the geographic scale of the scarce resources (in terms of supply and demand) the actors involved in the corruption are, in turn, local, national, regional or global. Hence governance solutions must be applied that match the geographic spread of those involved in corrupt management of natural resources (see Alley et al. 2007). Often, a country is referred to as resource-rich but it a more apt term would be resource-cheap. It is the ability to access and extract a resource cheaply (even when considering bribes, transport and protection fees) that should concern us. See Palmer\u2019s paper on illegal logging in Indonesia for a discussion on the confluence of market and government failures (Palmer n.d). In Asia, it is not only demand from G8 countries, but the region\u2019s fast developing economies that count on their least developed neighbours to extract raw materials. This \u2018drive to the bottom\u2019 also applies to the disposal of waste.

While this trade may not considered illegal (that is, unless the countries sign on to the Convention, which neither Japan nor Thailand has), the actual transport and disposal within Thailand remains undocumented and thus a recipe for corruption. It would also help to trace the dynamics of natural resources-corruption by identifying the timeline of opportunities: zoning, EIA, licensing, monitoring, enforcement, transport, etc. The issue of environmental protection is often raised as an instrument of awareness in the fight against corruption. In this regard, we must acknowledge that the experience to date is rather grim. The corruption (politicization and lack of transparency) in the application of EIA (environmental impact assessment) is rampant and involves many government parties, private sector (including EIA consultant firms) as well as development banks. There are lots of examples (see Briffett 1999). This situation will be exacerbated in the future, as more private companies rather than development banks will start funding large projects. Corruption, and the opportunity to make quick money, is also behind the improper selection of infrastructure requiring lots of concrete (more money to be made by a few and more environmental impact) rather than investing in ecosystems conservation (less profits to be privatized and obviously less negative impact). This is a very insidious link between corruption and chronic environmental degradation in the name of progress. In general, the investigative focus on corruption has been on the government agencies that are supposed to be custodians of a given resource, or their client arrangements with private sector, but we should broaden that view to encompass the role that judiciaries and the courts have played. See EIA International Study about Indonesia\u2019s forests (Environmental Investigation Agency and Telepak 2007) and mining pollution (Shawl 2007). To end on a more positive note, I recently came across this quote: \u201cUnless the region be preserved essentially in its present wilderness condition, the ruthless burning and destruction of the forest will slowly, year after year, creep onward ... and vast areas of naked rock, arid sand and gravel will alone remain to receive the bounty of the clouds, unable to retain it.\u201d Cambodia? Indonesia? No, it is a description of the Adirondack region before the 6-million acre Adirondack Park was created in 1882 by the New York State Legislature. 163 Phil Matsheza, UNDP Bureau for Development Policy, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Phil Matsheza adds to Sergio Feld\u2019s recognition that the \u2018resource curse\u2019 is a myth: the problem of natural resources is not abundance, rather, it is weak systemic management at the point of discovery, leading to overly-generous terms for the exploring companies. A remedy that Phil encourages in the way of participatory, transparent systems is to publish the outputs and financial gains. I would like to thank Sergio for an interesting article. Last week I attended a meeting to launch a Steering Committee for Natural Resource Revenue Management for pro-poor growth, local development and MDGs, a project being developed by the Africa Regional Bureau. We addressed the issue that natural resources if not properly managed can open opportunities for corruption and can lead to conflict over the resources. The only addition I would like to add to Sergio\u2019s paper is that abundance of natural resources per se is not the problem. The issue is the management of these resources for the public good. If the resources are available for, let us say diamonds or oil, the rules, regulations and laws for their management at the point of discovery tend to be very weak, while the terms for the exploring companies are generous. If the systems are not developed on licenses to exploit and distribute the resource as well as determining government royalties then it will be easy for corrupt officials to take advantage of the grey area to benefit themselves. The emphasis should be on participatory and transparent systems governing the exploitation of natural resources. Publishing the outputs and the financial resources realized from taxes is one area that is being encouraged. Botswana a country in Southern Africa was very poor twenty years ago. The discovery of diamonds and a proper management of the money from taxes companies paid have led to a prosperous country. Unless there is a proper management of natural resources, it is true that they can be a curse instead of a blessing.

Corruption made inroads in the rural social economy when the vacuum caused by the collapse of feudal authority was filled by various kinds of mafias. These mafias encroach on the commons, siphon off the subsidies provided to rural households by the government, and act as power brokers to obtain cuts from people for mediating their claims for their due share of natural resources. Corruption can be eliminated by mobilizing communities to create \u2018developed\u2019 villages. A \u2018developed\u2019 village will have two new features: 1) protection and improvement of its territory; and 2) cooperative services and supplies. Territory will include all the land in and around the village, with all its resources, water, soil, forest, pastures etc. A developed village will have a clear concept of responsible ownership of its territory, its protection and improvement, instead of the present suicidal concept of plunder. In addition a developed village will organize cooperative services, supplies for credit, marketing, plant protection and animal husbandry. Frank Vogl, Vogl Communications and Amnesty International, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Frank Vogl notes that when businesses in the extractive industry insist they operate within the local law they are talking about laws they possibly drafted themselves, with an eye to opening up ways to make \u2018legal payments\u2019 \u2013 through such clauses as \u2018geologist training\u2019 (tapped to pay the overseas school fees of the family of a local elite). Add to this maximum contract secrecy, and the monitoring challenges for civil society organisations take on extreme proportions. Whoever was responsible for the geographic placement of natural resources had a sense of humour, as these resources tend to be located in very remote places, usually in poor countries where the transportation and communications infrastructures are weak, where health/safety/ human rights labour laws are rarely enforced (if they exist at all) and where political governance at the local, municipal and national levels leaves an enormous amount to be desired. 165 Needless to say, the opportunities for bribe-paying and bribe-taking in such environments are enormous - from getting basic licenses and permits, to hiring labour, to shipping minerals. Even companies that may strive to place integrity at the centre of every single action can find that extortion - demands to pay bribes - can be very powerful in many countries. Companies can always say no and withdraw from further endeavours in such countries. This is an option that receives far too little public discussion. Companies can opt for total transparency in every aspect of their operations and accept that this may mean significant delays at times in securing permits and licenses. This course takes great single-minded determination by corporate leaders (I describe in detail a case example of Sutton Resources, which eventually was bought by American Barrick, and operated in minerals in Tanzania - see Vogl and Sinclair 1996).

EITI is a terrific initiative and it must succeed - but it needs some sort of external, credible, group to monitor its progress if it is to really make a difference - do you agree? Many companies claim they operate fully within the law. They do. But they are referring to local laws in countries where they may have had an influence (conspiring with autocratic local leaders) in writing the law. Such a law may in fact enable payments to officials that in turn enable such officials to boost their personal wealth. It is exceptionally difficult for civil society organizations to effectively monitor potential corruption in the extractive industries sector. Many contracts between companies and governments are secret. Several clauses in contracts provide opportunities for bribery but civil society never gets to see how and where payments are actually made. Mining companies often have clauses in exploration and development agreements with governments that include provision for personnel training, which is meant to be to train local geologists and so forth, but may well end up being used to pay for the school fees at a posh Australian or British board school of the sons of the mining minister! Few civil society organizations in countries that are oil and mineral wealthy are trained to really understand contracting in these sectors and thus lack the skill to monitor efficiently. Natural Resources 166 Asia Pacific Human Development Network The potential for corruption in extractive industries in much of the former Soviet Union is enormous and to a very great extent civil society organizations have no means at all to engage in this sector here. Additionally there appears to be a conspiracy of silence by the multilateral organizations, such as the UNDP and the World Bank about the real barriers in these countries to the free operations of NGOs. Meanwhile, there is water. The scale of corruption in water is a horror story - it will be the special subject of Transparency International\u2019s 2008 Global Corruption Report. Sergio Feld, UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Sergio Feld concurs with Frank Vogl\u2019s view that foreign operators are often called to participate in the development of extractive industrial standards, and this is of particular relevance to monopoly situations. When there is competition, a different scenario arises in which powerful companies command the bidding process, squeezing out minions by insisting on government adherence to unrealistic, too expensive engineering solutions. I agree with Frank\u2019s note to some extent. Please see a paper I co-authored (Armstrong et al. n.d.) regarding environmental licensing of oil and gas operations, comparing the situations of Indonesia, Angola and Brazil. In each national context, foreign operators face very different demands and sometimes they are called to take part in the development of standards themselves. This approach may could be likened to putting the fox in charge of the hens, but it only leads to corruption if the tendering results in a monopolistic arrangement. In instances where there are several operators, companies themselves will use environmental stewardship as \u2018peer pressure\u2019 and ability to apply strict environmental compliance to keep minor operators out. Governments with poor infrastructure or legislation that is unable to be implemented may be thus caught in a bind. For example, proper disposal of toxic waste originating from extractive industries can be very expensive, especially when there are no in-country facilities. Countries may have well formulated laws governing treatment and disposal, but the reality begs for cheaper and illegal solutions. Governments need to be strengthened to negotiate contracts that include realistic costs of compliance, including building of proper disposal facilities if they do not already exist. Often, governments are reluctant to do so if they fear companies will go elsewhere. Such companies are those that governments should keep out of business.

This exploits the absence of \u2018an integrated formal system of property rights\u2019 (that underpin capitalist economies). Additionally it puts local food security at great risk. Corruption and land Hernando de Soto\u2019s work on the importance of property rights for development and the legal empowerment of the poor, enlightened the world several years ago (De Soto 1989). He argued that many of the capitalist economies were built on an integrated formal system of property rights, while developing countries tend to lack such a system [1]. The consequences are clear: the poor are unable to access and, consequently, generate capital. Guaranteeing access to assets and productive tools for the poor, including land, is a key factor to lift the poor out of poverty and generate economic growth. Regrettably, land corruption is becoming a common trend in Asia \u2013 characterized by corruption in land administration (petty and grand) and land grabbing (grand). Land administration can be defined as \u2018the process of determining, recording, and disseminating information about ownership, value and use of land, when implementing land management policies\u2019 (UN/ECE 1996). As the administration of land lies within the domain of government authority, abuse of public power can become an issue. In addition, countries under customary law, which recognizes access to land as dependent on kinship, might be more vulnerable to practices of nepotism, favouritism, and clientelism. \u2018Land grabbing\u2019, according to UN-HABITAT, is used to describe the irregular allocation or sale of public land to individuals to reward political patronage \u2013 a practice common in rural and urban areas. A household study conducted by Transparency International (TI) in Bangladesh (2005a), India (2005b), Pakistan (2002), and Nepal (2003) reveals that land administration is in the top three sectors prone to corruption. Corruption is manifested through: 1) Bribery (payment by third parties) for the registration of property rights or change of title, acquiring land information, cadastral land survey and land use planning \u2013 as observed in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Vietnam and China. Natural Resources 168 Asia Pacific Human Development Network 2) Fraud (personal gain without third party involvement) in the sales of land and shares of plantations \u2013 observed in Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia and China. 3) Nepotism, favouritism and clientelism (abuse of discretion for the benefit of family and friends) in issuing property rights to land that belong to others \u2013 observed in Vietnam, Cambodia and China. In Bangladesh (TI 2005a), a survey of 2000 households reveals that 97 per cent of households paid bribes for land registration; 85 per cent paid bribes for land mutation; 85 per cent paid bribes to obtain land related documents; 83 per cent paid bribes for land survey; and 40 per cent paid bribes to receive land. In India (TI 2005b) the scenario is not different. Among those surveyed, 79 per cent of those interacting with the Land Administration Office perceived this agency as corrupt. Among those who paid bribes, 36 per cent paid to department officials; and 33 per cent paid money to middlemen (e.g. document writers, property dealers etc). Out of these, 39 per cent paid bribes for property registration; 25 per cent for land mutation; 12 per cent for land survey and 4 per cent to obtain documents. In Pakistan (TI 2002) 8 per cent of respondents indicated facing corruption when dealing with the Land Administration Department. Although the numbers seem lower than the other surveyed South Asian countries, there is no indication that corruption in this sector is actually lower. Surveyors and tehsildars (revenue officers) appeared to be the most involved in corruption. Most strikingly, in Nepal (TI 2003), respondents indicated land administration as the most corrupt sector, followed by the customs department, police and the judiciary. Similar to Pakistan, surveyors and tehsildars were considered the most prone to corruption. A survey on corruption in Vietnam indicates that land management tops the list of corruption acts. Land corruption crimes included: 1) using government projects to appropriate land, particularly in forestation and residential areas, and resettlement programmes; 2) abuse of power in leasing large areas of land at low prices for investment purposes, while bypassing routine administrative procedures; and 3) abuse of power in asking for gifts and money to perform administrative services related to land (e.g. land allocation, lease, land rights transfer, certificate granting, land compensation and site clearance) (Vietnam Net 2005).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "62afaada-5cd9-434a-82ee-0687fb2e48a6": {"__data__": {"id_": "62afaada-5cd9-434a-82ee-0687fb2e48a6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Transforming Corruption through Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a65235a6857521b371d711f6048463d35ec684d60f02f12881f08a1fd3117d75"}, "2": {"node_id": "98eaad73-573e-49ce-81db-21179bd93fd5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6ba742445f423ae63c2fe855297f8fc440d85939fd9234ccda694000b05dddee"}}, "hash": "15cb27a7a85a62c0ef53a4fddcefc4f53b588f31819f609151e7a1c414d9e9fc", "text": "169 Dependency on natural resources for sustaining livelihoods does not automatically translate into poverty.

In China, complaints about the illegal approval of farmland for construction (e.g. for road conversion, industrial and residential purposes) and the granting of rights to exploit mineral resources at low prices have increased over the years owing to growing urbanization, economic development and population pressure. This jeopardizes local food security, while driving a mass of small farmers and peasants into poverty (People\u2019s Daily 2005). Often, farmlands are seized without due compensation being paid. However since cultivated land is collectively owned, either by the state of village cooperatives, each individual farmer has limited legal right over the use of the land and limited recourse in the case of expropriation. In addition to land grabbing and corruption in administration, complaints have also increased due to issues of pollution \u2013 which can be associated with corruption acts or not. Overall, it is estimated that there are 40 million landless farmers in China and 2 million are added to this figure every year. In Cambodia, significant incidences of corruption and lack of transparency allied to rising economic and military appropriation of communal lands has exacerbated land disputes, skewed land ownership patterns to the disadvantage of both the rural and urban poor, with a negative impact on the living conditions of the indigenous population and women. This is a vicious cycle: insecurity of land tenure has also driven land grabbing \u2013 practiced mainly by the military and business with connections to local officials. Difficulties in redressing the problem arises due to: 1) absence of land records and cadastral index maps; 2) lack of transparency of land registration systems; 3) inadequate land laws; 4) unclear delineation of state land; and 5) the weakness and inability of the justice system to deal with land disputes (UN 2005). Overall, the problem of land corruption is not the lack of productive land, but rather the mismanagement of land, thereby opening venues for corruption. Sergio Feld and Phil Matsheza\u2019s argument that the resource curse is a myth \u2013 since the problem is dictated not by abundance but by scarcity - is a valid one. Fayyaz Baqir\u2019s argument on the \u2018developed\u2019 villages that mobilize for the protection and generation of public goods is already a best practice in many countries across Asia Pacific. For example, in Bangladesh, the Shidhurai Swanirvar Sangstha supports 2,000 landless poor who now own land and water bodies (khas). In Cambodia, the Mlup Baitong, a community based around the Kirirom National Park and heavily dependent on NTFP (non- timber forest products), focuses on the generation of alternative income for women and on the Natural Resources 170 Asia Pacific Human Development Network training of different social groups (Buddhist monks, military, school teachers, and villagers) to address the problem of overexploitation of natural resources affecting both the protected area as well as the livelihoods of the local people. Finding alternative ways to guaranteeing access to natural resources to local communities will certainly have a positive impact on human development. We would like to hear other best practices from network members. Notes [1] De Soto\u2019s ideas about the importance of titling for lifting people out of poverty have been criticized as being too simplistic. It was argued that, in certain countries, titles to small plots did not enable people to obtain credit more easily. To those, he responded that his ideas were not to be interpreted as a silver bullet for the problems of the poor, but that property rights should be accompanied by serious political social reforms. Gernot Brodnig, UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Gernot Brodnig responds to questions of motivation and best practices. Further, in categorizing key differences on how corruption manifests across sub-regions, Gernot suggests this is a question better posed within a matrix that considers the different stages that mark different countries and engagement, within the following areas: environmental/NRM governance, policy and regulatory development, utilization of environmental resources, permit and certification processes; and environmental enforcement (inspections and policing). What motivates corruption in the \u2018natural resources sector\u2019? The somewhat trite answer to this question is that natural resources do have high economic value, whether it is in the national or local context.

Sergio Feld, UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Sergio Feld introduces a critical point on how people perceive and act on the legitimacy of a government\u2019s authority in the field of how it deals with natural resource issues. His observations draw out a thread that has run through the entire discussion and differentiates it from the neoclassical economics approach to anticorruption. This concerns the notion that governance is both about being governed and how it feels to be governed. The basis of modern systems of representational government is invariably rooted in a social agreement about what rules to follow. Importantly, governance has its basis in trust, and not in power. The election process illustrates this. The exercise of authority is always a negotiation. The measure of whether authority is legitimately exercised is people\u2019s perception about a government operating under democratic principles and being subject to their will. However elections do not exhaust people\u2019s options if they detect illegitimacy. Civil society organizations have increasingly been contesting the authority of states, public decision\u2013making processes, and the whole broader issue of power relations between those who govern and those who are governed. One way they are doing this in the natural resources sector is by creating non\u2013state governance systems based on \u2018certification\u2019. The aim is to develop and implement environmentally and socially responsible management practices. Turning away from traditional state-based authority (rejecting its legitimacy), these civil society systems and their advocates gather the various actors in the supply chain (i.e. producers, who generate the flow of resources into and out of the combined operations constituting the respective livelihoods of the actors). The purpose is to create a different set of incentives and to promote the basis of a new legitimacy under which citizens are asking companies and governments to operate. In other words they are re-drawing the conditions under which people in democratic states grant authority. Their conceptual grounds cover very wide grounds of pragmatic, moral, and cognitive legitimacy. Natural Resources 172 Asia Pacific Human Development Network For purposes of implementation, they have put empirical emphasis on certification of sustainability, in a fairly narrow spectrum to date, which currently runs from forestry products to biodiversity and labour market aspects of trade in commodities like coffee. When addressing corruption and natural resources, we must agree that not only are markets imperfect, but that governments themselves are often less than perfect. In his book \u2018One World\u2019 on the ethics of globalization, Singer (2002) poses the thought-provoking question: \u201cwhat gives a government the moral right to sell the resources of the country over which it rules?\u201d International law acknowledges that once a government is recognised as legitimate, that legitimacy confers it the right to trade in the country\u2019s resources. Yet the sole test for such recognition is effective control of the territory, no matter how the government came to power or how it governs. The Jeffersonian principle that a government can be rightfully acknowledged as legitimate on the grounds that it has been formed by the declared will of the people is not used in practice even by the United Nations when granting membership. Singer asks us to contemplate the possibility of an international body, in front of which governments would need to satisfy the requirement that their legitimacy to have the right to sell their countries\u2019 resources stemmed from the support of its people. Like a private citizen who buys a watch knowingly or reasonably suspecting it to be stolen, anyone who receives goods stolen from a nation by those who have no claim other than the fact of exercising force would be committing a crime. Singer\u2019s suggestion is far-reaching but not far-fetched. He notes that in the 2001 Summit of the Americas in Quebec City the leaders of 34 nations agreed that", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5705913-16ad-4928-9e0a-e24850d52f20": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5705913-16ad-4928-9e0a-e24850d52f20", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Transforming Corruption through Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ae3804b8a577a0baa0149937afbf06e0c90dde1bc68ef55e110ec024994a6d47"}}, "hash": "ae3804b8a577a0baa0149937afbf06e0c90dde1bc68ef55e110ec024994a6d47", "text": "a country that ceases to be a democracy cannot participate in the continuing talks toward a free trade pact planned by the Summit and or access the support of institutions like the Inter-American Development Bank. Andre Standing, South African Institute for Security Studies, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Andre Standing proposes a new definition of corruption, which enables policies to be generated against the ways, that corporate corruption and \u2018state capture\u2019 undermine democracy. Countering the prevalent view of corruption as a barrier to a fully-fledged market society, Andre\u2019s definition explains that the problem of corruption is the problem of those with economic power dominating policy for their own self-interest. It is critical, Andre suggests, to move on from the image of a corrupt state as one whose officials intrude on the efficiency of entrepreneurs. The reality is that a corrupt state results from the nexus of wealth and power acting to deter democratic representation. This definition gives rise to distinct policy ideas, with clear aims, first, to restrict the power and purpose of multinational companies concerning the capture of policy making, and second, to empower citizens in the exercise of greater control over decision making. 173 It is tempting to comment on numerous issues relating to this debate on corruption, natural resources and human development [1]. However, in not wanting to burden you with a long essay, I just want to make a simple point about the concept of corruption and how this relates to rival policy views. As recognised in the opening comments of this debate, a distinction can be made between corruption that represents the \u2018grabbing hand of the state,\u2019 from corruption that represents \u2018illicit influence on the state by third parties\u2019 (so-called \u2018state capture\u2019). Although we can visualise situations where one form of corruption may dominate, these two forms of corruption are not mutually exclusive. Moreover, owing to conflicts of interest, such as government officials having a direct stake in private companies, there can be a blurring of the divide between the state and the private sector. We can therefore see that corruption is not a uniform malaise but a concept that covers a rather wide range of activities. This is one reason why single scores given to countries for their levels of corruption are highly misleading and lack validity. Yet we can also detect how corruption can be ideologically loaded. If corruption is narrowly understood as the abuse of public office for personal gain, then corruption may be associated with the negative impact of the state on private commerce. From this perspective, a corrupt state is one that intrudes on private business transactions, extracts burdensome rents, and causes uncertainties for companies and investors. By adopting this view of corruption, some analysts depict levels of corruption in a given country as being a risk for companies and a strong disincentive for foreign investment. However, if corruption is understood more broadly to include forms of corporate corruption and state capture, then we should also be concerned about how the power of third parties undermines democracy. In other words, in contrast to seeing corruption primarily as a hindrance to free market dynamics, it is also viewed as integral to the weakening of the nation state and the domination of policy by those with economic power. By adopting this view of corruption, a corrupt state is one where there is an excessive fusing of wealth and power, to the detriment of democratic representation. Such differing views on corruption become critical in relation to policy analysis and formulation. Our first view of corruption \u2013 that it is primarily a hindrance to the free market \u2013 is complementary to broader policies of economic liberalisation and privatisation. Indeed, many leading texts on corruption advocate privatisation as a potential remedy as it lessens the opportunities for rent-seeking officials. This appears as an orthodox understanding, advocated by many leading international organisations. Thus, as Michael Johnston writes, \u201c\u2026the consensus worldview Natural Resources 174 Asia Pacific Human Development Network [has] converged at a global level to influence both corruption and the ways we understand it. Corruption has come to be seen as both cause and effect of uneven or incomplete economic liberalisation, and of an intrusive, inefficient state. Rank-ordering countries from high to low corruption effectively defines the problem as the same everywhere, and its scope and effects are judged primarily in economic terms. Reform is seen as moving societies toward a neo-liberal ideal of market economics, and market-like political processes, facilitated by a lean, technically competent state that is little more than a kind of referee in the economic arena\u201d (Johnston 2001).

In combating corruption, the goal is not to create an efficient environment for capital accumulation and foreign investment, but rather to ensure that the wealthy do not capture policy making for their own self interests. It is worth noting that the well-supported EITI, although undermined by straightforward technical problems, is an initiative that addresses a very limited aspect of corruption in the extractive industries. While few would disagree, that greater access to information on revenue flows would be desirable, EITI does not offer any sort of remedy for conflicts of interest, or state capture. This is because corruption is more than the embezzlement of funds, which is the key problem EITI seeks to address. Thus, a risk is that those who champion EITI, tend to overstate its effectiveness. Even if it was successful on its own terms (which appears highly unlikely), it does not offer a panacea for corruption. To what extent EITI is supportive of corporate-led globalization, or representative of an attempt to increase social justice and human development, remains uncertain. Notes [1] Two other critical questions I would have liked to discuss include: 1) How significant is corruption in explaining the perverse outcomes of extractive industries? What political reasons are there for explaining why its significance has been exaggerated?; 2) the widespread assumption that the extractive industries, devoid of corruption, represent opportunities for human development correct? What vested interest are behind such arguments? Sumitra Sundram, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Sumitra Sundram observes that corruption in the Asia Pacific timber industry has generated opportunities for rent capture, at both local and state levels in a \u2018legalised\u2019 form of 175 corruption. This involves a major shift in the permit allocation process. Previously, management of timber permits was controlled by expert state institutions; now the allocation process is increasingly shaped by politicians, resulting in the erosion of customary land rights and contributing to climate change. Further details of this shift that Sumitra identifies have been brought to light by NGOs in Papua New Guinea (PNG). PNG is home to 5-10 per cent of the total species on the planet. About 80 percent of PNG is covered by rainforests that comprise one of the last major tropical wildernesses in the world and includes a high percentage of the world\u2019s total ecosystem types. More than half the rainforest areas are designated to be logged. In 2006, the NGO Forest Trends published a study of 14 logging projects in PNG: they found all are operating in a form of \u2018legalised corruption\u2019. This includes transfer pricing based on complicity between companies and the political elite. Transfer pricing is a hard-to-detect way that companies escape tax payments, e.g. by selling logs to its foreign subsidiary for processing. This gives them choices over how the transfer price affects the division of total profits between the company\u2019s different subsidiaries. Price transferring has two aspects: crude under-reporting of volumes logged on one side, and on the other, misquoted real prices by basing \u2018tax payable\u2019 on government sanctioned, totally out of date \u2018export price\u2019 schedules. Transfer pricing is currently \u2018remedied\u2019 by monitoring log export volumes; while at the other end where processed timber is received \u2013 in Europe and the US \u2013 there is no monitoring. But even at the point of logging, monitoring is ineffectual, as the following case shows. The chief logger in PNG and the sub-region is the Rimbunan Hijau group, owned by the Tiong family in Sarawak, East Malaysia. They provide the government monitor with a car and \u2018privileges\u2019. As an industry analyst has been reported as saying: \u201cThe forestry officer has to use a company vehicle to get out to the area, and his kids go to a school provided by Rimbunan Hijau.\u201d Far better remedies include support for local landowners to better understand and defend their rights to access the forests through which they live.

Native or customary land rights also get eroded by corruption in the timber industry. The second issue that I would like to highlight in the role of corruption in the timber industry is its negative impact on climate change. Though the world\u2019s largest forest region is in Latin America (which accounts for 34 per cent of the world\u2019s tropical rainforests), Asia Pacific has important reserves of forests that serve as carbon sinks. Seven per cent of the world\u2019s forest reserves are in Southeast Asia. Fifty seven per cent of the region\u2019s intact forests exist in two countries - Indonesia and its neighbour, Papua New Guinea. Six countries in the region have so far destroyed their intact forests \u2013 Bangladesh, Fiji, New Caledonia, Taiwan, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. Less than 10 per cent of the forests remain intact in 10 countries \u2013 Vanuatu, Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, China, India, Nepal, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia (Markets Initiative n.d). Malaysia and China are both strong investors in the timber industry in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, especially since strong national legislation in their own countries has restricted the quantum of the logging that can be done within their own borders. Malaysia is the single largest investor in Papua New Guinea. Unfortunately Malaysian companies operating there do not maintain the same levels of labour and environmental standards that they would have to in Malaysia \u2013 a form of South-South Cooperation that is less than ideal. Andre Standing, South African Institute for Security Studies, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: In this piece, Andre Standing emphasises the growing recognition that resource extraction needs to be better administered at local levels. The principal beneficiary would be indigenous groups, whose human rights are being abused as a result of the exploitation of natural resources on their lands. This is happening with \u2018disregard of free prior informed consent\u2019 and/or with \u2018broken promises and lack of accountability\u2019. Andre examines case studies of such tendencies found to highlight the key issues. Corruption, natural resources and the rights of local communities Natural resource exploitation, including mining and logging, often occurs in rural areas inhabited by people who have lived in the region for generations. Many of these people are recognised as indigenous and have a traditional way of life intimately connected to their environment. With the continuing expansion of the resource sectors caused by increasing demand and the search for new deposits of minerals, metals or tropical trees, an increasing number of such communities are coming into contact with companies. 177 In theory, both mining and logging represent opportunities for local economic development, as these industries create jobs and have enormous wealth potential. However, there is overwhelming evidence that throughout the Asia Pacific region, the governance of resource extraction offers inadequate protection to the indigenous people. Additionally where corruption and weak state capacity exists, we find examples of extreme suffering and human rights abuses. Often the resulting tensions lead to conflict and violence. Indeed, in the World Bank\u2019s Extractive Industries Review (EIR), the issue of how mining impacts on indigenous communities was given considerable attention. It was noted by the EIR, that the vast majority of human rights abuses reported to international human rights organisations by indigenous groups stems from the exploitation of natural resources on their lands. Due to increased awareness and campaigns, in many countries there is growing recognition that resource extraction needs to be better governed at a local level. Furthermore, it is clear that many leading mining companies seem to be taking a more proactive approach to mitigating the negative impacts of mining on communities through corporate social responsibility programmes. However, progress remains at best sketchy, and the claims made by governments and companies that improvements are being made are strongly challenged by a wide range of commentators, including numerous civil society groups and indigenous people\u2019s organisations. In some countries, such as Myanmar, the prospect of a truly just and transparent approach to the governance of resources seems particularly distant. Although there are a wide range of experiences in the Asia Pacific region, let us consider some of the tendencies found in case studies to illustrate the main problems and concerns.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c3490b0-e4b4-45a9-807f-dcffe527734f": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c3490b0-e4b4-45a9-807f-dcffe527734f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Transforming Corruption through Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a94b0e1fc2a312bbc268f7905d6a7345e1922f4722ced6f4c52d5cb31c248fc7"}}, "hash": "a94b0e1fc2a312bbc268f7905d6a7345e1922f4722ced6f4c52d5cb31c248fc7", "text": "The disregard of free prior informed consent Although contested, it is recognised in international law that indigenous groups have the power to withhold their consent to activities that adversely affect their human rights. Such groups are expected to have access to information, be fully integrated into relevant decision making processes, and are autonomous - an ideal referred to as \u2018free, prior, conformed, consent\u2019 (FPIC). Numerous countries in Asia Pacific region have protected the rights of indigenous communities in national legislation, although some have not. However, even where there is formal protection granted to indigenous groups, in several cases of resource exploitation, FPIC is not adhered to. In extreme cases indigenous groups are simply ignored. They only realise their lands have been handed to companies when work begins or Natural Resources 178 Asia Pacific Human Development Network eviction notices are given. Forced removals can follow and the resulting suffering caused is tremendous. This appears to be a major human rights concern in Myanmar, where both logging and mining activities seem to show almost no concern for local communities, some of whom are also subject to forced labour. Although it is the military regime that appears to be the main instigators of these abuses, foreign companies working in the country are also complicit. Where mining companies do seek formal consent from affected communities, this is often achieved through propaganda, impressive presentations and extremely attractive promises for the future, which critics cynically feel are misleading. People are assured employment opportunities, investment in local infrastructure, including roads, schools and healthcare. Individuals are promised generous sums of money for relocating. Local people who are either illiterate or unable to access more information seem easily swayed by such offers, yet communities are rarely offered unbiased assessments which also include the potential negative impacts of mining or logging. In cases where communities are reluctant to grant their permission to logging or mining companies, instances of intimidation and violence have been reported. In a report published by Greenpeace, it was claimed that some forest communities in Papua New Guinea have been forced at gunpoint to sign letters of consent by Malaysian logging companies, a claim contested by the companies involved. Likewise, in the Visakhapatnam district of India, communities claim that companies involved in mining aluminium and bauxite, bribe police and hire \u2018thugs\u2019 to intimidate those who object to proposed developments and relocation plans. However, ensuring consent from communities is not always achieved through such crude tactics. It is not uncommon for companies to offer direct payments or gifts to communities. Where one draws the line between philanthropic gestures and bribery is not always clear, and there are no guidelines regulating this practice. Moreover, critics see the process in allocating these awards as being selective and designed to cause divisions. In effect, there is a sense that companies can engage in \u2018divide and rule\u2019 tactics to gain access to land. In a damning report on mining in the Philippines, written in 2006 by a group of NGOs led by then British MP Clair Short, it was explained that: \u201cA pattern appears to exist of mining companies attempting to capitalise on, or generate, division within indigenous communities. In cases where the consent of the indigenous people has not been forthcoming, non-representative indigenous leaders have been created and recognised by the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples and the mining companies. The indigenous peoples view the selection of elders through procedures that do not respect customary laws as invalid. According to them consent obtained in this manner should not and cannot be the basis of FPIC\u201d (Doyle et al. 2006). 179 Even more worrying is the practice of companies making payments to community organisations to win their support. For example, Australian Climax Arimco Mining Company (CAMC) in Naeva Vizcaya, Philippines has been accused of making illegal payments to community organisations in order to stifle community protests. In a report submitted to the 2003 Extractive Industries Review by the Tebtebba foundation it was detailed that CAMC needed to win over the support of the Dipido Barangay Council. This was a strategic sector because they were the duly elected leaders in the community. The council was previously staunchly opposed to any mining activity in Dipido. Most of them acquiesced after the Company\u2019s aggressive cooptation campaign. Manila-based non-government organisation Legal Right Based Centre observed: \u201cBarangay officials were offered jobs in the CAMC bunkhouse until all of them, save for one, have acquiesced to the operation of CAMC.\u201d CAMC oppositionist added that the pro-mining officials received regular, and arguably illegal payments from the company, in exchange for their active support.

Guarantees made by companies to communities form part of their voluntary corporate social responsibility programmes. They are typically not legally binding and communities can be presented with ambiguous detail on time frames. The situation is ripe for broken promises and disappointing outcomes. Yet the power of companies can mean that communities have no way of holding them accountable. In this regard, we can also say that a general tendency is that companies have a poor track record of compensating communities for environmental degradation. As is well documented, mining operations can impact local communities severely, through water shortages, air pollution, contamination of natural water supplies by toxic waste and the resulting loss of local bio-diversity. Making matters worse, the local economic development achieved by mining tends to come at the detriment of indigenous people, with women being particularly hard hit. Where financial compensation for relocations is given, these are often presented in the form of one- off payments. In comparison to the enormous wealth that mining companies enjoy these payments are frequently seen as miserly and are quickly spent. Yet in this respect the lack of clear guidelines is partly at fault. Although compensation for communities relocated due to mining activities may often be scandalously low, there are no industry standards in this regard. Calculating compensation is therefore arbitrary and mining companies complain that any amount given will be seen as too little by their critics. Natural Resources 180 Asia Pacific Human Development Network Although communities are sometimes promised access to mining jobs, employment opportunities are in fact limited due to the shortage of skills. The majority of new jobs are acquired by an influx of specialized labour, and indigenous people tend to occupy a marginal and precarious position in the resulting new economy. Due to the loss of their traditional lands, they can be denied the ability to live in a self-sustainable way, and are expected to find new money-making ventures to survive. The impact of badly planned and poorly governed resource extraction is typically greater for women. Whereas women traditionally occupy an integral position in indigenous communities, resource extraction tends to promote men\u2019s dominance in the local political economy. Companies, almost exclusively run by men, tend to negotiate with local men, ignoring women completely. The few jobs available through mining are given to men only, and the influx of mining labour tends to comprise of men without families. Mining communities are therefore characterized as being excessively patriarchal. The negative impact on communities is exacerbated when mining operations close, and this can occur suddenly, without any consultation. Closures of mines create an upsurge in local unemployment, which results in myriad social problems. Infrastructure maintained for the sake of resource extraction may be neglected, and its upkeep becomes overly burdensome for local authorities. Local communities often complain that with the ending of mining, there is a significant deterioration in their quality of life, and they are faced with the long-term consequences of unemployment and an impoverished environment. In conclusion, where resource extraction at a local level has conformed to these tendencies, it is tempting to label the entire process as corrupt and lacking in transparency and accountability. Critics of this situation may feel that the immense economic power of companies and their undue influence on state authorities explains why the rights of local people are frequently ignored or compromised. Closing message Dear Network members, The time has come to close the discussion on the section of natural resources. There has been sustained interest throughout the discussion. which comes to an end because we have a time line. 181 The discussion has generated some important observations on Natural Resources. Members have added clarity to the reasons why land management has become the most corrupt single sector in many Asian economies, and advocated ideas to shift this. Contributors have put to bed the myth of the resource curse, seeing clearly that corruption is not an issue of abundance. Rather, it is about weak public management and the under-valorisation of natural resources. These causes manifest in poverty, underpinned by people\u2019s insecurity about access to their land. We have further read that insecurity produces a vicious circle in which administrative \u2018loopholes\u2019 allow \u2018crisis entrepreneurs\u2019 to grab farm land and issue illegitimate permits. Contributors have explained why monopolies in the private sector can point to the \u2018legitimacy\u2019 of their operations: they probably drafted the law, and are certainly complicit in maintaining the status quo of contract secrecy. We have learnt about the major shift in the permit allocation process, where, previously, the management", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9d706c09-65ea-4783-8d2a-50ecc05b7ce2": {"__data__": {"id_": "9d706c09-65ea-4783-8d2a-50ecc05b7ce2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Transforming Corruption through Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4fde3b7b07f9152c236b1bbcf6ab226c9279118f0f67db25b753221b9cad8f83"}, "3": {"node_id": "f674ea76-5164-4003-885f-3ec896212be5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ff4d11e918500446378f89be315e6f26823c788dd5fc7950d7ac21019882a65f"}}, "hash": "494129bafddad1c9e4f325fc64f9f4e2b0249e937974b0718ba807eef255de17", "text": "of timber permits was controlled by expert state institutions; now the allocation process is increasingly shaped by politicians, resulting in the erosion of customary land rights and contributing to climate change.

USA: IRWIN. 185 Police Contents 7.1 Discussion Questions 188 7.2 Contributors 188 7.3 Online Discussion 189 7.4 References 210 187 If we all found ourselves contemplating over ways to improve access to justice and protection of rights through better policing, many of us would focus on cases we know of poor and vulnerable people, especially women and children. This would necessarily raise questions about the origins of unequal access to justice and ways and means to eliminate these inequalities. The key task of the police sector is to protect the public from violence and theft. However, in many countries in the world, the real experiences of people are quite the opposite. According to Transparency International Global Corruption Barometer (2006), about one in every six contacts with the police \u2013 the guardians of the law \u2013 results in an illegal act, and the most frequent bribe paying worldwide (as opposed to the largest amounts) is paid to the police. The implications have a devastating impact. When those guilty of serious crimes can pay their way out, while innocent people may face jail sentences unless they pay a bribe, the foundations of security and trust needed in a society are being severely undermined. Instead of protecting the population, the police become a source of distrust and fear, and again those most vulnerable are women, minorities and the poor. Do we know how the poor, women and minorities actually experience access to justice? Yes, there are studies that clearly show the poor feel justice is linked to wealth; and that they overwhelmingly feel that legal system actors discriminate and are corrupt in ways that escalate inequality of access for vulnerable populations. In one such study from Latin America (Correa Sutil 1999), almost two-thirds of those surveyed thought police treated the well-dressed well and the poor badly; 63.5 per cent felt judges behaved differently with the rich and the poor; more than half thought that the intent when police detained people was to charge them money; almost 90 per cent felt there is one justice for the rich and another for the poor; almost 90 per cent thought lawyers were too expensive; and 90 per cent felt the quality of a lawyer\u2019s assistance is linked to how much money is paid. Such findings raise critical questions around whether governments have stepped away from responsibility to promote demand by poor people for reform. More than ever before in history, the material security, democratic evolvement, state control of justice and guarantee of rights depends on decision-making by the police and the broader judicial system. This means that access to justice is a critical issue. Its starting point is the escalation of demand for police services not controlled by corruption. Only then could the court system begin to constitute a more equal social order in which the poor participate in litigation and have their voices heard. But this could only happen in a legal system not controlled by corruption, which then becomes the only forum where powerful political interests cannot 7. Police Police 188 Asia Pacific Human Development Network hush voices, as they do in the market where poor people have insufficient power. This is why economic development approaches do not provide the answers to poverty alleviation. And this is why this discussion which is very interested in questions of human rights and equality of access, has taken a political economy approach to anticorruption. The following two weeks of our discussion will aim to address the inter linkages between police, corruption and justice \u2013 and the policy implications for human development. 7.1 Discussion Questions Questions to guide the discussion o How does corruption affect the relations between the police and disadvantaged groups? o In many Asian countries people avoid going to the police for help, particularly women. Why this is different in most developed countries, and what can be done in Asian countries facing this problem? o How does corruption in the police affect access to justice, and what are the long term consequences for the legal system in these countries? o What are the causes of police corruption? o How are the links described between corruption in the police and crime? o Do people in countries where the police are known to be corrupt, join the force to reap the advantages - or to stop crime and corruption? o Who polices the police? o How can corruption in the police successfully be addressed? o Are there mechanisms to monitor \u2013 watchdog entities \u2013 in the police?

Add to this the unparalleled facility of police units to encroach on investigations into their internal affairs, and we clearly see the need for a wholly independent lead authority. Basil goes on to specify the qualities of such an agency, sharing both a Hong Kong success story and a guide note of the Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC). The power of arrest and detention are vested with the police. These are very great powers. Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. By utilising the power of arrest and detention there are many ways in which the police can make extra earnings for themselves. Power of arrest and detention also means that the power of not arresting or detaining or prosecution in court is also with them. By giving assurances that a certain illegal activity can be carried out without the threat of being investigated or the wrongdoer being arrested, the police can make a profit. In the case of drug dealers for example, if they are assured that there will not be investigations and prosecutions into their activities, they would proceed to engage in their activities quite freely and would willingly give a share to their partners in crime. The possibility of the police becoming partners in graver crimes in society is very high. In fact it can be argued that no major crime can occur without the active cooperation of the police. Whether these are crimes of politicians who abuse their power or whether they be crimes of people who engage in drug dealing and other sorts of mega crimes, or the crimes of the underworld, in all these crimes the cooperation of the police is necessary. This then gives rise to the important question of what can be done to prevent corruption in the police force. What is clearly evident is that preventing the police from being corrupt cannot be left solely to the police. Only an authority that is outside the police, and one that has the necessary powers of investigation into corruption and which has the necessary resources to deal with corruption, including that of the police can succeed in creating a law abiding police force. In fact, probably the most difficult area of dealing with corruption is dealing with corruption of the police. This is primarily attributable to the fact that the police have the means to know when investigations against them are being carried out, and they can then use their various powers to intimidate witnesses, they can destroy documents and they also have the means to secure the patronage of powerful persons in the political field. What is required is an agency that is sufficiently empowered to deal with these problems and possesses the requisite capacity to conduct proper investigations (without being hampered) and which has the competence to deal with police crime, particularly police corruption. Police 190 Asia Pacific Human Development Network One successful example of such an agency can be found in Hong Kong which up to about the early seventies was one of the most corrupt places. The Hong Kong police were as corrupt as, or even more corrupt than the police of many countries. Both the people in Hong Kong as well as the administration had come to realise that something had to be done to arrest this malaise. Following several experiments, Hong Kong finally created the Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC). This is an agency which is entirely outside the police. It has its own investigation mechanism and its investigating officers are drawn completely outside the police force, which means that even when a policeman is inducted he will sever connections with the police from then on. The ICAC functions under the control of its own leadership and is therefore independent. It is this that led to a major success story, one that has taken Hong Kong to rank among the least corrupt places in the world.

Other crimes are dealt with by the police. However, since the police are a necessary component of crimes of corruption in society this was taken completely out of their mandate. Thus, by doing this the police are deprived of the use of their powers of arrest and detention and prosecution to gain personal financial advantage. They are made to do their jobs as expected of all civil servants purely on the basis of principle and their accountability is not held on moral terms but by a machinery that can control them. Police corruption can be stopped only by direct control not just by preaching. It is the top echelon of the police that needs to be brought under strict control. If the top layers of the police are not corrupt there is very little room for the lower ranks to be corrupt. The necessary component for a corruption agency was mentioned in the AHRC\u2019s recent statements. The successful establishment of an effective corruption control agency depends on adequate investment. The failure to provide adequate resources for the running of an institution which is expected to eliminate corruption amounts to deception. Thus, budgetary allocations to the agency should be under constant public scrutiny. It is futile to criticize an inadequately-resourced institution for its failure to carry out its functions. Equipped with laws, personnel and money, an effective corruption control agency should be organised incorporating the following components: o An operational component to deal with investigations. o A training component for staff. o A policy research component to study and make recommendations to eliminate corruption. o A legal component to advise the agency on all issues relating to law arising from its work and educate its staff. o An advocacy component to inform the public constantly on all matters relating to the elimination of corruption. 191 o A research and development component, which constantly updates the quality of work and materials. All these components should be independent but coordinated. There should be no overlap of functions within the institution itself. The success of an effective anti-corruption agency also depends very much on the integrity of the justice department or ministry and prosecution branch of government. It must be able to trust that in all circumstances the prosecution will act with professional integrity and competence. In many countries this trust is absent. Some defects also arise from the absence of sufficient staff in the prosecuting branch or the absence of competence of its officers, sometimes leading to leakages of information when preparing indictments and prosecuting. Thus defective prosecution agencies may defeat all the efforts made by an anti-corruption unit and even endanger the lives of its staff. Jens Chr. Andvig, Norwegian Institute of International Affairs (NUPI), wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Jens Chr. Andvig proposes the value of rational choice theory (the prevailing microeconomics theory) to understand behaviour related to corruption. This paradigm assumes individuals choose the best action according to what they prefer and what their options are and what the expected outcomes are. The advantage of assuming humans make choices in a rational way, rather than through other kinds of logic, is that our actions could be more predictive and modelled. What it also raises, as Nussbaum has done (and Kant before her), are questions about our uses of reason and power: what we ought to do with our practical reason, whom we ought to associate with, and how we should use our political power. In turn, this raises questions about how much education on alternate choices we need to have access to, before we can say we have \u2018rationally\u2019 chosen. And, can it be said that we have freely decided on a course of action if poverty or other vulnerability constrains our decisions? When discussing policy issues related to corruption it is my impression that many consider corruption as a kind of abnormal, almost evil behaviour, a kind of social illness that somehow will disappear through exorcizing and condemnation. This way of thinking may assist in writing political pamphlets, but is basically fruitless in terms of policy and in terms of understanding. Roughly most corrupt acts are driven either by a kind of profit motive or by a feeling of loyalty to another organization than the one which pays you. As I have argued before (Andvig and Moene 1990), even if everyone seeks to maximise their private income from a public position, it is possible that most people will choose not to use the corrupt option, or they may.

Hence it is theoretically possible to have widely varying levels in countries with the same institutional structure and the same individual preference. Note that even when the corruption level is high some stay incorrupt. That may be explained by their individual characteristics, but many of the incorrupt ones in the low corrupt situation have also chosen to stay honest because many of the others do so. A political or economic shock may make them switch. In theory this kind of explanation may work, but somehow it would be more plausible if most officials behave more corruptly than the norm. If everyone always looks for relatively risk free economic gain in all situations, corruption levels should be high everywhere and always. While it may be analytically plausible to explain high and low levels within the same model it may not be true. Perhaps different models for high and low level corruption should after all be made where officials\u2019 behaviour genuinely shift. If so, some countries in the Asia Pacific could be explained by versions of the high corruption model others by the low corruption one. The psychologist and game theorist Anatol Rapoport (1960) illustrates this beautifully through paraphrasing a Mark Twain story: Tom Sawyer, the new boy in town arrives, well dressed and with proper manners. He naturally annoys the dirty incumbent. They begin to consider a fight. Rational calculations about relative strength, useful aggression levels, likely fighting experience and training are made. If none do so and fighting starts, that model will often break down. The experience of being weaker drives weak people to be aggressive because the motivation now is not calculation, but rage. To explain how the interaction will eventually work out, a model of the strengths, the erratic sequence of punches and actual fighting capabilities is needed to predict the final equilibrium: the knock-out. What does this have to do with explanations of police behaviour - except for the knock-out? When a public organization works normally, it focuses on its tasks, and the motivation for most of its members\u2019 will be task-solving. However if the organisation lacks basic pre requisites; the necessary resources are absent, the tasks to be performed are difficult and there is lack of co ordination, then in such circumstances the official\u2019s motivation shifts, and is likely to lean towards individual profit maximization. In sum, the official thinks, \u2018what shall I do in order to get the maximum income from my position with the least effort?\u2019 Drawing from the list of possible corrupt actions by the police, it is clear that plenty of opportunities exist, in particular inefficiency. 193 I think, it is fairly well documented that the attitudes to the police are quite different in rich and non-rich countries, and that it is considered on average the most corrupt public bureaucracy is in most developing countries. However this might be only a perception. The question of behaviour shifts may be used to explain phenomena related to use by police of its legal instruments of violence. If someone is banging your neighbour on the head and afterwards someone asks you about whom you perceive as being the most corrupt \u2013 what are you going to answer? This does not really explain why the police are so popular in the rich and so unpopular in most non-rich countries, however. Maybe they bang heads more frequently there than here in Norway, but if so why? And does that have anything to do with corruption? It might simply be their job. While the evidence here is more sporadic, it appears that the police is also in fact the most corrupt public agency, at least in non-rich countries. That is, for a given number of interactions between households and a public agency, the ones with the police are the ones most frequently accompanied with an illegal payment. What is the explanation for this? It may have to do with the fact that the police after all have more interaction with criminals than other agencies. If in a normal situation a third of the public are willing to pay a bribe and a third of the officials are geared to demanding one, a little more than 10 per cent of the transactions will be accompanied with a bribe.

This behaviour may also be attributable to the fact that the police have legitimate instruments of violence. For instance if a third of the police want and are willing to accept a bribe and a third of the public is willing to pay, and the police accompany the bribe demand with their sticks, everyone they interact with will pay a bribe. Thus, more than 30 per cent of their household interactions will result in a bribe. More sinister are the possible feedback effects of the instrument of violence on the degree of behavioural homogeneity in the agency. In agencies where corrupt cops are influential, they force the others to participate through some feelings of solidarity based on being exposed to external threats generated by the violence games the police by necessity may be involved in. Even more sinister possibilities are possible. Data collected from police agencies in rich countries, clearly indicates that illegitimate use of force and corruption are strongly correlated. Police 194 Asia Pacific Human Development Network An obvious connection is the loosening of the monitoring process. Might it be that their special relationship to the public, on the one hand, makes the police demand bribes from the well-off but not too powerful, while, on the other hand they bang the heads of the poor for the joy of it. Nabeel Salie, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Nabeel Salie cautions against looking for singular root causes of police corruption in Sri Lanka \u2013 observations that serve as an important reminder that corruption involves multiple actors with motivations equally multi-faceted and ambiguous. These can be categorised as givers and takers, those who resist, endure or are incognizant (yet lose some entitled social good), as well as those who facilitate a corrupt practice. Nabeel\u2019s piece further points to the value of Mark Philp\u2019s insight that the relationship between these multiple actors plays into the broader coordinating system of decision-making. How this manifests, in part, is forcing a newcomer to adopt the prevailing norms and values that surround rights and responsibilities. In the final instance, corruption corrodes an intricate system of parts, which makes public decision-making increasingly dysfunctional. A recent corruption survey conducted in Sri Lanka revealed the first thing that came to most people\u2019s minds when speaking on the subject was the police. Alternately the survey indicated that while it may be factually correct to say that the police sector is the largest in which bribes are paid and in doing so disallows for the justice system to take its natural course, it would be unfair to stake a claim that the police were solely responsible for this scenario. This was because bribes were voluntarily offered as often as they were demanded. Therefore, to have a balanced perspective, it is important that the approach of civil society be spotlighted as it has been an integral component in shaping, encouraging and harvesting corruption in the police. Similarly, another vital factor for corruption in the police is that like most employees of the state, the remuneration received for their services does not sustain the rising cost of living. Therefore, at the lowest rungs of the force such as the traffic police where bribe taking is most frequent, corruption stems from want more than from greed and makes officers highly vulnerable when paltry amounts of rupees are offered for their pardon. So once again does the blame entirely rest on the police or should the state also take some responsibility? The points trying to be made in no way justify the actions of the police, but instead try to look at the underlying reasons for their behaviour. It is important to do so if proper and committed measures are to be taken to address the problems. 195 Thusitha Pilapitiya, Casals & Associates, Malawi, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Thusitha Pilapitiya reflects on stories of police corruption her family has encountered, concluding it is no longer appropriate for donors to focus solely on prevention (judicial training, legal training and access to justice projects).

My contribution today does not consist of heavy, theoretical stuff but an analysis of my latest experience with police and corruption in Malawi, where I live and work, heading a project on Strengthening Government Integrity and also acting as the project\u2019s Senior Anti-Corruption Specialist. Since Malawi is little known, it is worth mentioning that it is a small land-locked country in Southern Africa, ranked 166th out of the 177 countries surveyed in the UN human development index. Lilongwe is the capital. Exactly one year ago, I landed at the Lilongwe international airport. I cleared immigration and customs without any problem, but then was surprised to have a policeman ask me to open my bags. In surprise I told him \u2018but you saw customs open my bag moments ago\u2019. He replied that a customs check was separate to a police check. He checked my bags and asked me if I had a \u2018present\u2019 for him. I replied in the negative and he let me go. I then encountered five policemen sitting around a desk a few feet away and they asked for my passport. They then proceeded to laboriously write down my details, and then told me that they did not have \u2018telephone units\u2019. I pretended not to understand, and replied politely that I too did not have any telephone units as I had just arrived. One month later, my husband arrived to join me. They went through the same procedure with him. Again, we managed to get away without paying a bribe. Well, we were simply not going to. However, on this occasion they turned fairly abusive, and at one point I said \u2018look, we are not going to pay you anything\u2019, and the policeman turned on me saying \u2018did I ask you for money?\u2019. This is after arriving in the country with semi-diplomatic status, official first arrival privileges, duty free status etc. Police 196 Asia Pacific Human Development Network The worst was when my son came for his vacation. After peacefully clearing customs and immigration, the police desk that is set up near customs took his passport. He was kept standing there until everyone had left. I had gone in to find out what was keeping him. We saw bundles of Malawi Kwacha exchanging hands between police and those who wanted to get out of the airport soon, or bring contraband in to the country. My son had a Malawi visa in his passport issued by the Malawian embassy in Washington D.C. When they ran out of questions, they asked him for the receipt of the visa, which really confused him because my office got him the visa and thus he had no receipt. When I steadfastly refused to pay any money, they let him go. He was the last to leave the airport. His sponsor is USAID, yet they either did not care or understand. This is the introduction to police corruption in Malawi at the point of entry. It continues unabated inside the country with traffic, check points, and one completely avoids any interaction with the police. Corruption by the police is blatant, open, and entirely without fear of reprisal or repercussion. There are several training programmes for the police conducted by the US Department of Justice, and by my own project. Yet, the situation remains critically corrupt, which leads me to my next question which is \u2018are we making any difference with our development programmes to stop corruption?\u2019 Most of our programmes targeting corruption focus on training, which is a preventive measure. I have read many project documents, and have found that most of us focus on information sharing on corruption, in some instances even developing or strengthening anti-corruption laws, developing codes of conducts, and other technical assistance and training programmes. We do not focus on the \u2018cure\u2019 for corruption which we believe is the responsibility of the host country. We believe that our responsibility is to keep the duty bearers and right holders informed about how to prevent corruption, so that societies are corruption free. However, societies are already corrupt and while prevention is absolutely essential, and this is the work that I am personally focusing on at present, we have to recognize that \u2018cure\u2019 is as important as prevention. By cure, I mean, supporting the actual prosecution and punishment of corrupt officials. The key word is \u2018support\u2019 as we have no role to play in the judicial process of a host country.

I hope my brief thoughts will enrich this valuable discussion. 197 Jon Quah, The National University of Singapore, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Jon Quah describes the case of Singapore\u2019s successful transformation of police corruption. The shifting of the threshold of tolerating corruption in Singapore can be seen in widespread and constant awareness of its pathology. This was expressed by a Singapore taxi driver, who suggested that corruption is like a malaria virus: the body is not restored to health with just one shot in the vein. But administering that shot starts a collection of responses that the body makes to protect itself against infections and viruses. It begins a process of recognition in some cells of the immune system; and this enables them to identify parasitical cells as abnormal, and acts to alleviate them. Unfortunately, this is not enough to get rid of a parasitical cell completely, but, the taxi driver reflected, continued treatments aimed at using the immune system to fight parasitical cells clearly have remedial value in the long run. This contribution is based on an article by the contributor (Quah 2006). Police corruption is a serious problem in many Asian countries as the police are usually perceived as one of the most corrupt agencies in these countries. However, Singapore\u2019s case shows that it is possible to prevent and control police corruption if there is the political will to do so. After analyzing various forms of police corruption, it is possible to argue that police corruption was rampant in Singapore during the British colonial period. Since then, through the commitment of the People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) government to curbing corruption in the country, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) has succeeded in preventing and minimizing police corruption. It has done this by improving its salaries and working conditions, its recruitment and selection procedures, its training programmes, and the socialization of its members. The SPF has come a long way since its inception in 1820. Indeed, it has been transformed from an organisation afflicted with rampant corruption during the British colonial period to an organisation that is no longer infected by the scourge of corruption today. How did the SPF succeed in minimizing corruption within its ranks? The SPF\u2019s success in combating corruption is also a reflection of Singapore\u2019s success in fighting corruption. The first breakthrough in curbing corruption in Singapore occurred in October 1952 with the establishment of the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) as the first anticorruption agency in Asia that was independent of the SPF. The British colonial government realised the folly of entrusting the Anti-Corruption Branch of the Criminal Investigation Department of the SPF with the task of corruption control when police corruption was rampant. It corrected this mistake with the formation of the CPIB. However, as the CPIB had inadequate powers, the second breakthrough came in 1960 when the newly elected Police 198 Asia Pacific Human Development Network PAP government demonstrated its political will in fighting corruption with the enactment of the Prevention of Corruption Act (POCA), which strengthened the CPIB\u2019s capability to curb corruption considerably. In short, Singapore has succeeded in curbing corruption because the British colonial government transferred the task of corruption control from the SPF to the CPIB in 1952, and the PAP government followed through in 1960 with the enactment of the POCA. Throughout, the SPF has been a reflection of the society at large. Hence it is not surprising that it was corrupt during the colonial period, as corruption was a way of life then in Singapore. Similarly, with the PAP government\u2019s commitment to fighting corruption after it assumed office in June 1959, the SPF has also been transformed into an effective and clean organisation not only because of the improvement in its salaries and working conditions, but also in the improvements to its recruitment and selection procedures, its training programmes, and the socialisation of its members to the four core values of courage, loyalty, integrity and fairness. The SPF efforts in curbing corruption among its members have borne fruit, as manifested in the many cases of rejection of bribes by police officers in performing their duties. Traffic police officers are vulnerable to corruption as motorists might bribe their way out of traffic violations.

All the examples demonstrate clearly that the SPF has succeeded in persuading its members to abhor corruption and resist the many opportunities for corruption that are inherent in police work. Anuradha Rajivan, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Anuradha Rajivan writes with reasons to re-emphasise that \u2018police\u2019 are a heterogeneous collection of human beings with motivations both multi-faceted and ambiguous. This prompts Anuradha to wonder if it points to the starting point for strategy. Could incentives successfully be engineered around this human quality of ambiguity, specifically by targeting upright behaviour some police sometimes exhibit, and to do so by drawing on a blend of citizen voices and grassroots pressure? And could this pressure from below help to develop and sustain political will to transform police corruption? Dear Network colleagues, While the police in developing countries are considered highly corrupt, one question of 199 relevance is: how are the same police capable of the best and worst of human behaviour? When a young person joins the police force, does he or she join it primarily for the possibilities of extra- curricular income, for power (to do good/bad?), for respect or to serve the community? There could be many different motivations. Corruption may or may not be a part of the motivation, giving us a clue that all may not be lost: there is scope for curbing corruption. Here is a personal example. An out of town woman in a busy shopping area in a metro suddenly realised that she had lost her wallet which contained her passport, air ticket, money and credit cards. In obvious panic she looked about her, extremely anxious and at her wits end. A local constable was watching and asked her what the matter was. When she explained, he calmed her down and sharply whistled three times in a sort of code. Three pre-teen \u2018chhokra\u2019 boys sprang up from somewhere and reported to the constable. He gave the oldest a sharp clip on his head and demanded that the young fellow empty his pockets and hand over the missing wallet. The boy quietly did so. It was the missing wallet! The constable handed it over to the woman, who looked completely surprised - it was the quickest detection and recovery of stolen property she had seen! All her money was there and so were the ticket, passport and credit cards. No police complaint, no FIR, no investigation, no bribery, no court process! As she thanked him, and offered to pay him a tip, he just brushed it all aside. \u2018You are from out of town. We want you to have a good impression of this city, don\u2019t we?\u2019 he said, looking sharply at the young boys. The constable was in collusion with the local pickpocket gang, \u2018allowing\u2019 them to operate- but in some \u2018genuine\u2019 cases he voluntarily gave up his share without even asking. There are many reasons why the police are seen as corrupt - some of them pointed out in the net discussion. In most cases the police work under the political authority, and are expected to do what the boss expects. After hard detective work, they are sometimes told to let off the big-wigs, which is a major demotivating factor for professionals. They tend to be underpaid, have very harsh working conditions, very limited scope for creativity, initiative or training, poor infrastructure, and suffer from poor public image. Rewards and recognition often are unrelated to good work. Pressure to please the immediate boss or else (where does the money for \u2018looking after\u2019 the boss, for refreshments, providing women, etc., come from?) and fear of sudden career disruption when governments change make many officials take action for self- protection. These include pleasing both the party in power and the opposition, or keeping tabs on both political parties (funded by unaccounted money) inherently leading to convoluted behaviour and corruption. And in any case, one clean cop can be a thorn in the flesh of the political masters and colleagues. It is very hard to avoid being sucked into the mainstream - no one wants you in the system. Moreover, if the image is bad, good behaviour of a few is not going to make it better - the public will in any case be", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "de11fd8f-0345-4a2d-b4c3-c16f2bd934eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "de11fd8f-0345-4a2d-b4c3-c16f2bd934eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Transforming Corruption through Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b63e6e02e2daffc12e7377cce46fd10891ccad3f4508055724d725b8873211af"}, "3": {"node_id": "aceca573-830d-4a21-9472-e986575a1b11", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a4c0e0168f6d9a7d53bf4dd048985fc31c2f25805f8a3f84c5610eda4a4afe58"}}, "hash": "2d69e2336bb0495d9102fed302d36a5a04525de3b152471dc8083d9e75d8b15c", "text": "suspicious.

But as the example above shows, the police force is not a monolith. The same person can also be, both, corrupt and altruistic in different situations. In disaster situations, in accidents, there are numerous instances of police personnel going beyond the call of duty. Here is where we could find clues for policy. Can we incentivise upright behaviour through a combination of citizen voices / pressure from below? Can pressure from below help to build and retain political will? Sandy Gauntlett, Pacific Indigenous Peoples Environment Coalition, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Sandy Gauntlett observes that while Singapore is often studied as a case that has effectively \u2018eliminated\u2019 corruption, it simply is not \u2018best practice\u2019. To qualify for this the management of corruption requires a basis of tolerance; and in Singapore, control is being sustained by fear and oppression. Tolerance is a core ingredient of liberty and human capabilities. The network acknowledged this in the earlier debate which built awareness that the end goal of anticorruption is not eradication of corruption but far less tolerance of rights-impacting behaviour. The lesson of Singapore is that \u2018eradication\u2019 of corruption in that case has come at a too high price: the loss of diversity on which liberties and human capabilities thrive. Sandy\u2019s observations are suggestive that we need to refine this notion of \u2018lowered thresholds of tolerating corruption\u2019 and come up with a simple expression of \u2018tolerance\u2019 but one that encompasses its multiple dimensions, which can be seen as follows: 1) \u2018thresholds of what is normatively acceptable or censured; 2) \u2018level/degree of permission or veto\u2019, and 3) the \u2018impact on freedom of certain corrupt acts\u2019. The usefulness of this multifaceted understanding of \u2018tolerance\u2019 will become clearer when trying to operationalise the concept. This is because its various aspects are measured differently. For instance, \u2018thresholds\u2019 involves measuring the critical, flexible assessment of certain acts. \u2018Permission\u2019 entails testing what practices are banned or accepted. \u2018Impact on freedom\u2019 requires measuring impacts on rights and duties, as well as the \u2018demands of tolerance\u2019 as gauged by how individuals respond (e.g. escaping from information by using stereotypes, or by pledging support to an oppressive ideology, or a religion where many individuals derive their ethos). In the final instance, \u2018tolerance\u2019 can be seen a useful aim of anticorruption because it matches the need for a universalism that contains refusal of dogma. Plus it encompasses what Anuradha has emphasised as essential human ambiguities that surround individuals\u2019 searches for a meaningful social practice. Singapore has indeed managed to curb much of the obvious corruption that happened amongst the police and many other officials but this change has come at a price for Singapore. 201 While it is a city that I have been to many times on my way to Europe and a city that I love visiting because it is so safe, the ordinary citizen of Singapore has paid a hefty price for our sense of security. We have all seen this T-Shirt, \u2018Singapore is a fine city\u2019 followed by a list of the fines available for such crimes as chewing gum, dancing in the street, jay walking, spitting in public and the list goes on. What many of us do not read on far enough to realise is that fines are for first offences. It is possible to go to jail for littering, chewing gum, jay walking, etc, and that appears as a little draconian. The other reality is that everyone assumes it is Lee\u2019s regime alone that has helped in the transformation of Singapore into probably the safest city in Asia. Even this is debatable and like most of the things that happen in Asia is multi-layered. 1) First let us look at the notion of safety. Does everyone feel safe or is this sense of security designed for the tourist dollar (and even then the straight white tourist dollar).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aceca573-830d-4a21-9472-e986575a1b11": {"__data__": {"id_": "aceca573-830d-4a21-9472-e986575a1b11", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Transforming Corruption through Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b63e6e02e2daffc12e7377cce46fd10891ccad3f4508055724d725b8873211af"}, "2": {"node_id": "de11fd8f-0345-4a2d-b4c3-c16f2bd934eb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2d69e2336bb0495d9102fed302d36a5a04525de3b152471dc8083d9e75d8b15c"}}, "hash": "a4c0e0168f6d9a7d53bf4dd048985fc31c2f25805f8a3f84c5610eda4a4afe58", "text": "Homosexuality is technically illegal in Singapore with sodomy being able to receive 10 years to life imprisonment and public indecency (which could be as simple as a kiss) capable of receiving two years.

Yes, corruption has lessened but having travelled to Singapore many times, I get the sense that social control in Singapore is still maintained by fear and when this fear is ingrained into the psyche as the right thing, peer pressure adds to the pressure to conform.

My concern is with the secondary message in these billboards (the word good). The implication here is that if you do not learn English, you are a bad Singaporean. I might not be so concerned Police 202 Asia Pacific Human Development Network if I saw as many signs encouraging people to retain their Malay, Chinese, Indian, or Arabic languages and cultures because that would provide a sort of balance. So the next time you are travelling in Singapore and notice the lack of corruption (relatively) and walk around anywhere secure in the knowledge that you are safe, think about the price of that safety and ask if you would be prepared to pay it in your own countries. There are no simple answers to these questions and we do have to try and eliminate corruption and injustice and crime but we have to do so while allowing diversity to flourish and by building respect for other cultures, languages and lifestyles.

Recently retired from the Armed Forces Medical Services of India, I entered practice in Bangalore for 6 months before moving on. One day in the third month of practice I received a call from an old colleague. He was working in a private medical college where a few other faculty members were retired military doctors too. In fact, the senior administrator (a retired Major General) had been one of my respected instructors in graduate school 26 years ago! The call conveyed urgency. I was urged to help out old colleagues and friends in their hour of need. They were looking for a professor in Internal Medicine immediately. I had been an MCI (Medical Council of India) certified post graduate teacher and examiner and would fit the bill perfectly. Already toying with the idea of resuming teaching in my second career, I must have sounded quite enthusiastic, yet the level of urgency could not be understood. I would be required to submit necessary documents and sign for an appointment letter within the next 2 days. An odd certificate that had not been updated or transferred to a state licensing body would be \u2018taken care of\u2019. My name would go up as \u2018Head of Department\u2019. I was required to be present 2 days later for a whole day. For this one day appearance I would be paid Rs 25,000 (roughly $650). A limousine would be sent for my transportation. My queries about class size, academic session, part-time versus full- time employment, teaching- aids, curriculum, attached hospital facilities, etc, were answered only perfunctorily. There was enthusiasm only for that one day\u2019s appearance! He said that everything else could be discussed later, and that almost any term of mine would be met. 203 Naturally I probed further. Then the story came together. The MCI inspecting team was to inspect for the annual revalidation of the institution\u2019s teaching capability. There were many such faculty members on paper, who made annual appearances. Names of several respected teachers were mentioned.

Ramesh Gampat, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Ramesh Gampat raises questions around various elements of effective cases of police anticorruption, including the limits of the belief that targeting police as the most corrupt sector will alleviate corruption generally. He goes on to ask whether it was effectual police reform that transformed Singapore\u2019s corruption through renewal of independence, performance and salary levels. Or did much broader strategic incentives succeed in tapping into a distinctive social historical flow of ethical values? And, does this effectiveness, measured by citizens\u2019 perceptions of low corruption, equate to a reality of higher moral and ethical standards than in countries where corruption is perceived to be widespread? Dear Colleagues, Removing corruption from the police force seems to be a key ingredient in reducing overall corruption. Independent and properly functioning legal institutions seem to be key here. Does this mean that focusing on the most corrupt institution/entity pays higher (and faster) dividends than adopting a more comprehensive strategy? Could one really assert, for example, that controlling corruption in the police force will bring down the pathology significantly? Are there any features intrinsic to Singapore (and Hong Kong?) that make the police force so important in the fight against corruption? Police 204 Asia Pacific Human Development Network I should observe, however, as Jon Quah suggested, that better salaries and working conditions also played a role, at least in Singapore. Yet all of these solutions seem like mechanical fixes of an issue that, by definition, arises in a social context. My readings and observations have led me to believe that, in countries riddled with corruption, there is a breakdown of moral and ethical values. This leads me to the question: what is the role of moral and ethical value in controlling corruption? More to the point: is there a role for moral and ethical values? If there is, should it be part of a long-term, broader, more comprehensive strategy while legal deterrents should comprise the immediate elements of such a strategy? Research outside of economics suggests, \u201cHumans are endowed with a sense of fairness that permeates social perceptions and interactions\u201d (Moll et al. 2002). This same body of research also suggests that humans are endowed with innate capacities for self-seeking, self-interested behaviour. Nevertheless, these innate capacities are not absolutes and are in fact moulded by environment including culture). Thus, it would seem that, despite genetics and evolution, moral and ethical values play a role in controlling deviant behaviour, including corruption. Yet this raises a troubling issue: if we gauge corruption by popular measures of perception, can one say that countries with lower corruption have higher moral and ethical standards than countries where corruption is widespread? Basant Kumar Rath, Police officer Jammu and Kashmir, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Basant Kumar Rath, a police officer in Jammu and Kashmir, elaborates on a critical point that the demand-side of corruption is simply explained by a public official\u2019s aspirations for power in an underpaid situation.

In this posting I have tried to explain that police corruption is a co-production of various actors in the context of the local community of which the police is a part. Co-production, as understood in development economics, refers to a process through which inputs from individuals or groups who are not \u2018in\u2019 the same organization are transformed into goods and services. The concept of co-production does not inherently imply positive utility of the goods and services produced as a result of this process. The product need not always be valued by the public. In the context of a public bureaucracy (of which the police is a part) co-production may not intrinsically lead to good governance. Seen this way, the concept of co-production, being value-neutral in a Weberian sense, is capable of explaining police corruption as an organic feature of the present politico-economic environment of India\u2019s public bureaucracy. The police being a public service system, means that how various actors (individuals and groups) co-opt and get co-opted by police personnel, impinges upon the quality of the delivery mechanism. The import of the argument made here is that the supply- demand equations involving police corruption are affected by co-production amongst various actors operating within the local community. Let me illustrate this with some examples: 1) Large scale organised encroachment of public land. Because of terrorism-induced migration from interior areas to urban locations making the real estate business extremely lucrative, public land has become the main target of the land mafias. The official figure - one thousand hectares in Jammu alone \u2013 does not tell the whole story of what the land mafia has done to vast stretches of forest land and river-beds. Other towns like Srinagar, Rajouri, Kathua and Udhampur are equally affected. Corrupt police officers have been too willing to partner with greedy revenue officials and vested interest groups. Thanks to the political patronage that the land mafia enjoys, the bureaucratic set-up has been successful in sabotaging the very interests of the state that it is supposed to serve. How this illegal enterprise has evolved is a classic case of co-production of police corruption by various groups. The demand for land, both for residential and commercial purposes, has always been there due to economic growth and massive migration to cities. The supply side has been taken care of by the co-producers such as revenue and police officials, politicians, criminals and businessmen. 2) Organised vehicle-theft. A substantial portion of the vehicles stolen in New Delhi, Punjab and Haryana finds its way into Jammu and Kashmir, especially the Kashmir valley. Right from Police 206 Asia Pacific Human Development Network Lakhanpur to Banihal the National Highway 1-A, the life-line linking the valley with the rest of the country, is littered with traffic police check-posts that live off this illegal business. The criminal gangs have well-oiled networks comprising hired drivers, professional vehicle lifters, police officers, transport officers, receivers of stolen vehicles, illegal automobile shops and political patrons. There are instances where a legal owner of a vehicle in Delhi sells the vehicle to a gang member and then lodges a complaint of theft with the police after a couple of weeks. The existence of a huge demand-driven market for stolen vehicles is facilitated by the lack of computerized data bank on vehicle registrations and the involvement of insurance agents and employees of Road Transport Offices, which makes the enterprise extremely complicated to unearth. Jens Chr. Andvig, Norwegian Institute of International Affairs (NUPI), wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Jens Chr.

The implication is that corruption thrives in such scenarios due to the role regression that happens, and police turn to serving and protecting unofficial elites. A more explicit implication is that when analysis is focused on the combined features of the police role this uncovers an active ingredient in the glue that makes a country\u2019s economic and political forces stick. In a number of articles and several books Mustaq Khan has tried to tease the anti-corruption community. I am not sure how successful he has been in this venture since he is frequently invited to community meetings. He makes a point, or rather draws attention to a set of social and political forces that are exceptionally important when gauging the roles and consequences of police corruption. Mr. Khan criticizes most of the discussions of corruption in the public sector that consider the state as mainly a service provider, and that conclude that corruption reduces the quality of those services leading to undesirable transfers of income and together act as a negative impulse to growth. Untrue, claims Khan. Ex-ante most strong growth countries have not displayed particularly impressive numbers on their set of governance indicators. Corruption may even 207 contribute positively to growth by transferring resources into more dynamic economic forces, and by its violating old property rights that may block economic development. Its effects turn around the way that economic and political forces in fact are shafted together. And here the police are more clearly involved than most other public agencies. To think about concrete examples today we may just refer to the large number of stories in China where the police are involved in throwing out poor, peasant legitimate \u2018owners\u2019 of land and houses in favour of well-off entrepreneurs investing, for example, in manufacturing plants. Sometimes they have the support of the legal authorities, but sometimes the transfer of the possession of land is simply achieved by paying the police. The outcome is unfair and may in the end stifle growth through increasing conflict levels or create a drag on growth through the inequality created, even though in the short term it could be a growth stimulus. All over the world\u2019s large cities dominated by the poor, the police are involved in establishing new property rights where they have been unclear and then mostly in favour of the well-off in exchange for a pay off. They rent out their legitimate monopoly of violence and geographical knowledge acquired through their position as police to private entrepreneurs. More generally, the police is not only a service provider protecting the citizens against each other, its second major task is to provide protection of the political elite whether that is considered legitimate or collectively rejected by the majority. In stable democratic regimes that task is mainly latent, but in most developing countries it is rather manifest, particularly in countries where the regime is violently challenged in parts or the whole country. This means that the police\u2019s behaviour will be strongly influenced by the configuration of political forces in a country, that is, it will be brought into the force field outlined by Khan as crucial for determining the economic effects of extensive corruption. On average I would expect for a number of reasons that a regime will give the police greater freedom to exploit its instruments of violence for private profit, the more threatened the regime is, expressed by the level of violence. Power will be shifted and increased levels of illegal violence will give more opportunities for private income, but also more dangerous work for the police. But as the scale of violence increases, and power shifts to the military, and police\u2019s role is relegated to that of an information provider the opportunities for private income will become more pronounced. Maybe we can frame this in the fashionable inverted U-hypothesis: as the level of violence increases, the police\u2019s power and possibilities for rent extraction first increases and then becomes constrained mainly by the military, but also by a situation where none are willing to pay for valuable information. Police 208 Asia Pacific Human Development Network In relation to armed conflict, the police\u2019s main historical role will be in the developments triggering conflicts and in their aftermath, not during the peak of armed struggle.

Note that in addition to its access to violent instruments, a key characteristic of the police\u2019s part in the battery of public controls is its role in monitoring geographical areas and collecting information about it. This knowledge is extremely valuable for gaining political control and is often used by politicians also in peaceful democratic contexts when it is allowed. This is, I believe, a major reason why the police (often together with organized crime) are allowed to challenge public opinion by an open often even arrogant economic exploitation of Indian citizens. Well-known historical examples may we find also from US history. Summing up, I believe it is difficult to understand police corruption and its effects by only looking at its service- providing work and without looking at its regime- defending tasks, which draws it into the centre of the political economic battleground that has occupied Mustaq Khan\u2019s analyses of corruption. Alas, here we meet a number of signals that may be difficult to document, but that still are essential in determining the extent of police corruption and its effects. We may believe it is important but it can only be rationalized through detailed historical analysis of the single country. And even then we will miss the data on business enterprise \u2013 police and household-police interactions that we have for some countries. To collect those in conflict areas are normally too dangerous, but does someone better informed than me know about any serious study of rent seeking behaviour of the police in the conflict areas of the Asia Pacific region? Closing Message Dear Colleagues, This is a message to say that the discussion on police is now closed and to thank you. The focus on police has spawned some of the most notable ideas to date. We opened with a view that the tradition of granting a group such imposing power to choose whether to arrest and detain is certain to generate \u2018unreliable\u2019 choices; and an independent agency is needed to watch over the police. A separate outlook was expressed in the idea that anticorruption strategy must go beyond prevention; donors need to investigate, prosecute and adjudicate. This evoked 209 a perhaps balancing view that sought an entry point for strategy in the observation that some police sometimes choose to act with integrity. Accordingly, is it possible to design incentives that could stimulate \u2018choices to act in upright ways\u2019 \u2013 combining citizen voices and grassroots pressure to shift political will? Then, what about variables that help explain choice-making? What kind of literacy is needed for people to recognise they have chosen \u2018rationally\u2019, and to realise that how one uses practical reason matters, and how one uses political power is critically important? Further, what constraints do poverty and other vulnerabilities have on access to this kind of education? Such questions prompted memory of an earlier talking point that no singular root cause exists for corruption. Corruption can be traced to an array of explanatory variables and actors with motivations equally multi-faceted and ambiguous. The viewpoint on this we heard this time around is that the demand-side of corruption is not simply explained by a public official\u2019s aspirations for power in an underpaid situation: this situation involves multiple actors who \u2018co- drive demand\u2019. We heard in particular that the role of police is much more than simple service delivery; and their role of providing protection to political elites was put under the spotlight. What emerged was a notable proposition, as follows: a regime who experiences a growing level of violent threat is increasingly likely to transfer power to the military; in this scenario, the role of police reverts to a simple provider of information; but it\u2019s a situation involving little demand for information; hence, this causes police to serve the corrupt domain of \u2018unofficial elites\u2019. That thesis adds further value to an earlier insight from the network that the relationship between the various actors involved in a corrupt act impacts on the whole system of choice- making. Ultimately corruption corrodes an intricate system of parts and this makes choice- making increasingly dysfunctional. We heard different views on how choice-making has been impacted by the \u2018reversal\u2019 of corruption in Singapore. We read the conviction that this case does not represent \u2018best practice\u2019, given how \u2018integrity\u2019 is being sustained by fear and oppression; whereas, tolerance", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ace8251-9491-4efe-b24e-8b1eea1b9a82": {"__data__": {"id_": "2ace8251-9491-4efe-b24e-8b1eea1b9a82", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Transforming Corruption through Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9d9b4195b0210facf9faad91ca668c3ac243619ea659756771ffe80d176af6dd"}, "3": {"node_id": "daf8a5b7-c4dc-41ca-8624-ac86b4b4c3ca", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "920c2556e0959616d0e62771584f6f399514be4e165dab7841efa5225fcbd30f"}}, "hash": "0c962d4ebe6a99f9a430e70e67d05f570bcd12d85daedfcd0951750373e7782c", "text": "is required as a core ingredient of liberty and human capabilities. Additional questions were raised about whether it was police reform that transformed Singapore\u2019s corruption, or did much broader strategic incentives manage to tap into the social historical flow of ethical values?

This write-up aims to provide network facilitators with a short guide to iron out issues that usually surface in managing net discussions. In 2007, the Human Development Report Unit integrated and revitalized the Asia Pacific Human Development Network as a part of a larger consultation process in preparing for the Asia Pacific Human Development Report Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives. To ensure that useful material was provided for the Report, the discussion of each sub-theme was short and focused, although preparing for the discussion consumed a fair amount of time. Below is a short summary of our experiences and lessons learnt. Increasing membership When the process was initiated, our network consisted of 216 members who had joined to vote on upcoming themes for Asia-Pacific Human Development Reports. At the close of the discussion, the total number had encouragingly more than doubled to 450. o Do: Identify key persons/organizations with the necessary competence in the issues being discussed. Send them personal messages and invite them to join the network. The messages should be concise, and in essence capture the purpose of the discussion as well as clearly indicate to the prospective members the value they can add to the topic under discussion. o Don\u2019t: Forget to regularly and continuously update the membership list. Members who want to exit from the discussion should not be sent new messages; those who want to join in the middle of a discussion should receive a copy of or, preferably, a link to see previous messages posted on the network. o Don\u2019t: Do not delete completely the information on members who have left the discussion/ network.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "daf8a5b7-c4dc-41ca-8624-ac86b4b4c3ca": {"__data__": {"id_": "daf8a5b7-c4dc-41ca-8624-ac86b4b4c3ca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Transforming Corruption through Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9d9b4195b0210facf9faad91ca668c3ac243619ea659756771ffe80d176af6dd"}, "2": {"node_id": "2ace8251-9491-4efe-b24e-8b1eea1b9a82", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0c962d4ebe6a99f9a430e70e67d05f570bcd12d85daedfcd0951750373e7782c"}}, "hash": "920c2556e0959616d0e62771584f6f399514be4e165dab7841efa5225fcbd30f", "text": "Instead enter their details in a \u2018hold\u2019 folder.

Employing an expert to moderate the discussion Owing to the complexity of the theme and the need to ensure a focused and constructive discussion, we hired an external expert to moderate the discussion. III. Annex Annex 214 Asia Pacific Human Development Network o Do: Ensure that there is a clear division of labor between the external moderator and the internal facilitation team. There must be a system in place to ensure that contributions do not fall between the cracks as all participants would like to see their contributions posted! Keep the discussion lively It is important to devote adequate human resources to the discussion network. In order for such discussions to yield beneficial outcomes, participants need to be constantly nurtured, prompted, coaxed and provoked. Bottlenecks, including technical glitches, must be dealt with rapidly to ensure the speedy and seamless flow of information. It is equally important to develop processes that ensure that the collaborative knowledge-producing potential of the network is fulfilled by constantly challenging and provoking responses from members. There is otherwise the danger that the network can wither in the absence of sustained supervision from the team. o Do: Set aside adequate time. A fair amount of time and effort needs to be devoted towards inviting specialists and stakeholders to contribute during the discussion. An important lesson learnt from our experience was that it was useful to have a couple of substantive contributions ready as well as some firm commitments from members to contribute, before the launch of a discussion on various sub-themes. This procedure worked successfully as we had a good contribution to spark off the discussion and were also able to insert a contribution if or when the pace of the discussion slowed. o Do: Try to keep a balance between very theoretical contributions and more hands-on comments. This is vital in ensuring that all your members remained engaged. Also make a concerted effort to keep the discussion lively and interesting! o Don\u2019t: Underestimate technical aspects. Unfortunately, we spent much more time than originally anticipated, on the technical aspects of the LYRIS software. Our experience was that it was more efficient to prepare the messages in Outlook, but it was equally necessary to be familiar with LYRIS in order to post messages when away from the office or when some specific features had to be used- for e.g., the hello message, adding members, survey, etc. Synthesizing the discussion Prepare a consolidated reply. This is a valuable exercise that enables the members to see all contributions in one place. It may also be useful to develop a synthesis/summary of the discussion, and/or each sub-theme. o Do: Reflect the diversity of your discussion in the synthesis. Nobody wants their contribution to be included as supporting an argument they contradicted or did not express their views on. o Don\u2019t: Leave the synthesis until the end of the discussion. Summarize each sub-theme, or keep a short summary that will enable you see the direction of the discussion and adjust sub-themes and questions posted on the network accordingly.

Expert systems represent an opportunity to assist users lacking expertise in a specific area to carry out complex tasks, promote efficient governance and enable sustainable decision-making in developing regions. The ability of expert systems to guide and educate means they can also be used for knowledge building and tackling the low level of information technology literacy that have a direct negative impact on socio-economic advancement in developing regions. This APDIP e-Note provides a summary of what expert systems are and how they operate; the opportunities they can provide as a driver for socio-economic development; and how they can benefit developing countries through capacity building and local empowerment.

Expert systems, also known as knowledge-based applications, are part of the general category of computer applications known as artificial intelligence. They are usually single-purpose programs filled with detailed information that enables them to guide users through a series of simple yes/no or textual questions, and provide answers about specialized fields. Expert systems consist of a knowledge base that contains facts about a specific task and rules for applying the facts; and an inference engine that processes knowledge encoded in the knowledge base to respond to a user's request for advice. The system reaches conclusions by using inference, a reasoning process, to make decisions similar to a human expert by relying on logic, belief, rules of thumb and experience within a given domain contained in the knowledge base.1 The knowledge used in an expert system is acquired from various sources such as expert opinions, legislation, reports, databases, policy papers, case studies, empirical data, textbooks and manuals. Although lacking the \u2018common sense\u2019 and human characteristics of intuition and empathy, they can contain great detail and sophistication to cover most circumstances and allow for manual intervention in instances when they are not appropriate.

Mycin was one of the first expert systems ever built and is an example of medical diagnostic decision aid used to help doctors diagnose infectious diseases (bacterium and meningitis) prevalent in developing regions.4 It provides advice for the type of antibiotics and the recommended dosage, based on the analysis of the primary and secondary symptoms of the disease. Isabel is another expert system in use which provides diagnostic advice on areas such as toxicology, oncology, bio-terrorism, and causative drugs.5 Environmental Management Sustainable development frequently relies upon human expertise (resources managers and environmental planners) which can be captured in expert systems. Expert systems are a core component in the implementation of decision support systems that assist with the transition to a sustainable society through well- informed decisions. The United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) recognizes in the Millennium Development Goals the important role that expert systems can provide in response to environmental issues, and the need to develop and disseminate expert systems to assist enterprises in developing countries with environmental assessments.6 Expert systems can assist with sustainable decision- making in land development and in the promotion of cleaner production methods. In the Land Development Village (Thailand) project an expert system was integrated with a geographical information system to assist with decision-making. It was involved in cost estimation and land evaluation concerning issues such as soil erosion and water conservation.7 It is an example of how expert systems can be used in parallel with other technologies to help integrate the principles of environmental management into country policies and programmes. The Landfill Restoration Plan Advisor (Malaysia) was designed for use in the planning of sanitary landfill restoration. Expertise was acquired from a combination of sources, including textbooks, manuals and interviews with selected domain experts.8 Such a system 4http://www.computing.surrey.ac.uk/research/ai/PROFILE/myci n.htm 5 http://www.isabelhealthcare.com 6 UNIDO, Service Module 8 Environmental Management, see http://www.unido.org/doc/5073 7 Kanjana, Sutisak, Ard, GIS and Expert Systems Integration for Land Development Village, Thailand, Paper: 755. http://gis.esri.com 8 Basri, \u201cAn Expert System for Planning Landfill Restoration\u201d, Water Science and Technology, Vol 37 No 8 pp 211\u2013217 IWA Publishing 1998. http://www.apdip.net/apdipenote/10.pdf 3 encourages local empowerment in developing countries as it assists them to responsibly manage their own social and economic development.

For a cost-effective IT solution, the design process and system requirements must be well thought out and 9http://www.computing.surrey.ac.uk/AI/PROFILE/prospector.ht ml 10 Manage Cyberary - Expert Systems in Agriculture, J. Panduranga Rao. http://www.manage.gov.in/managelib/faculty/PanduRanga.htm have regard to wider development and policy issues. Consideration must be given to the relatively high cost of deployment compared to alternative solutions, and how the system will work with existing and planned infrastructure. Poorly programmed software and systems that are not adequately maintained can make dangerous and costly mistakes. Therefore, infrastructure and ongoing maintenance are essential, including reprogramming to acquire and adapt to new knowledge. The technical expertise needed to develop an expert system places an emphasis upon access to technology and highly-skilled IT workers which may have to be outsourced from high cost regions. Although today's expert systems deal with narrow domains of knowledge, for them to perform competently over a broad range of tasks they will require larger knowledge bases, requiring additional programming and more sophisticated technology. With technological advancement there is the potential loss of employment opportunities caused by redundancy to automation of tasks. This is of particular concern to developing economies that have large poorly educated populations and depend upon high domestic employment rates. Due to the range of models of decision-making and their appropriateness in sustainable development it is necessary to tailor specialized solutions to developing regions. Access to and training to use expert systems is essential, particularly in remote locations where they can be of most assistance. Expert systems must also be developed in local languages to assist the development of local expertise which in turn will enhance productivity and promote self-empowerment. Another concern in using expert systems is the moral and legal dimensions - if it gives the wrong diagnosis, who do you sue? Although Mycin outperformed members of the Stanford medical school in tests, its use was hampered because of ethical and legal issues related to the use of computers in medicine.11 CCoonncclluussiioonn Expert systems provide a support mechanism for socio- economic development and facilitate participation in society by enabling access to information in government, in the economy, and in the development process. The requirements involved in developing expert systems remain prohibitive to many developing nations, with few possessing the finances or technological expertise required. Therefore, financial and political commitment from governments, the private sector and NGOs is needed to increase the presence of affordable expert system solutions designed specifically for use by developing countries and which promote sustainable decision-making. ~ Glen Harris, Legal Analyst 11 It was never used in practice due to the ethical and legal issues with using computers in the filed of medicine.

It is not just hardware and software. It encompasses the policies, processes, procurement, data, laws, applications, partnerships, standards and stakeholders that together make up a technology environment for a country, a government or an organization. People - those who create, buy, sell, regulate, manage and use technology - are the most important part of any ICT ecosystem. An open ICT ecosystem brings increased choices, collaboration, innovation and economic opportunities. It impacts access to public information, government procurement, industrial development (especially for small- and medium-sized enterprises), privacy, security, investment policy, intellectual property and economic growth. Five principles define open ICT ecosystems and guide their evolution. Open ICT ecosystems are: interoperable, user-centric, collaborative, sustainable and flexible. To activate these principles, there are three building blocks of an open ICT ecosystem: open standards, open source and service-orientation. This APDIP e-Note explains the value of open ICT ecosystems and elaborates on their principles and building blocks in simple terms. TThhee bbiigg ppiiccttuurree When people hear the word \u201ctechnology\u201d they may think: Everyone talks about it, but does technology really have anything to do with social development and economic growth? Answer: it has everything to do with development and our daily lives. One year ago, the world saw just how true that was. 26 December 2004. 7:56 AM. A wall of water \u2013 a tsunami \u2013 slams into the famed resort islands off Thailand\u2019s coast. In one tragic moment, thousands of lives are lost, and thousands more are missing. Homes are destroyed; businesses ruined. As agencies and non-governmental organizations desperately mobilize in a race against time, emergency relief slows. Aid groups are unable to share information vital to the rescue effort \u2013 who was found, who was hospitalized, what supplies were delivered. Each uses different data and document formats to record this critical information. The need for common, open standards for disaster management was never more compelling or painful. The Royal Thai Government responded by creating a common website for registering missing persons and making open file formats, in particular, an immediate national priority. It is time for people - especially policy makers and civil society leaders - to stop seeing technology as something only for techies. Technology is not about bits and bytes, or computers and code. It is about innovation, knowledge, economic opportunities and public services. It is about transforming our governments, our economy and our communities. In rare moments, it is about saving lives. This needs to be understood, especially now, as globalization, cheap technology and the Internet spread.

Everything moves faster. It is hard to manage the amount of information before us. People everywhere expect and need real-time information and faster, cheaper, better services. Governments and companies (indeed, all of us!) must adapt, and quickly. There is some good news. The fusion of globalization and technology offers new ways to meet the demands of our high-speed, 24/7 world. A potent combination of connectivity, access, collaboration and transparency - or openness - is emerging as a catalyst for transformation. And we can all use it. This is the big picture. To understand the big picture, we need to discuss \u201copen technologies\u201d and why they matter.

People - those who create, buy, sell, regulate, manage and use technology - are the most important part of any ICT ecosystem. A word about open. The word causes much confusion and outright conflict, in part because everyone wants to be open. \u201cClosed\u201d sounds bad. The problem is that the meaning of \u201copen\u201d depends on the specific context. Open for standards differs from open for software. Open standards and open source are different - standards are like technical design blueprints, while open source is a development approach (and licensing model) for software. So, what are open ICT ecosystems? First of all, the types of systems or software installed do not define them. As described in the Roadmap, five principles define open ICT ecosystems and guide their evolution. Open ICT ecosystems are: interoperable, user-centric, collaborative, sustainable and flexible. An open ICT ecosystem is more capable of incorporating and sustaining interoperability, collaborative development and transparency (on policy, process and technology levels). Increasing these capacities - call it \u201copenizing\u201d an ICT ecosystem - is the key. An open ICT ecosystem does not mean, \u201call open, all the time.\u201d In terms of technology, open ICT ecosystems are heterogeneous \u2013 combining open and closed, proprietary and non-proprietary technologies. This will not be a transitional phase, but a permanent situation. To activate these principles, the Roadmap focuses on three building blocks of an open ICT ecosystem: open standards, open source and service-orientation. If hardware and software are ICT ecosystem\u2019s bricks, open standards are its mortar, holding together diverse systems and services. They enable interoperability, assure future access to information and lower costs. Open standards ensure that the next purchase is not dictated by the last purchase. They help break lock-in. The Roadmap recommends that all governments treat open standards as the norm, and make them policy priorities. Opening an ICT ecosystem is impossible without addressing software, the second pillar of an open ICT ecosystem. Open source does not define an open ICT ecosystem, but it can have a transformative impact. In recent years, open source has been the most powerful change agent of ICT ecosystems, forcing the re- examination of policies, purchasing practices and business models. While software developers stress the access to code that open source offers, the most vital aspect of the open source model is its collaborative nature. Demonstrating the power (and networking effect) of collaboration may be open source\u2019s most enduring contribution to society. It has the potential to change not only how technology is created and used, but also more broadly how a knowledge society connects and competes. The third foundation of an open ICT ecosystem - and the most technical - is its service orientation. In simple terms, this is about focusing less on the technology and more on the business processes that drive delivery of services. A service orientation focuses on people\u2019s needs and how to meet them. Open standards are the backbone of a service-based approach, adding the flexibility needed by managers, suppliers and users to respond to new business requirements without always having to replace systems and applications.

Open ICT ecosystems bring increased choices, collaboration, innovation and economic opportunities. These issues cannot simply be left to the Chief Information Officer or the IT Department. Decision makers in governments, industry and civil society need to pay attention. Opening an ICT ecosystem raises serious issues that touch not only technology.

Buyers decide what functionality they want and when upgrades are needed. No longer is future access to data controlled by a company. Users (all of us) no longer need to rely on technology owned by a company in order to access, use and share the data and documents that we create. Another word for all this is empowerment. Open technologies empower people by giving them greater access to technology, information, decision-making and the collaborative efforts that drive innovation. These are not merely theoretical benefits. They can propel more effective delivery of public services, expand public access to policy-making and create opportunities for entrepreneurs to build new businesses. CCoonncclluussiioonn:: W Whhaatt ccaann II ddoo?? The short answer is: push for change - change in how government buys and uses technology and change in how ICT policies are made. We do not have to wait for another disaster to see the importance of open technologies. Opening an ICT ecosystem means changing people's behaviour and procurement drives behaviour. A few procurement rules will help drive real change: \u2022 Mandate interoperability in procurement decisions, with a preference for open standards where they are applicable, mature and widely used. \u2022 Require technology and brand neutrality in procurement specifications to prevent lock-in to a single vendor, data format or technology. \u2022 Link final payments to an auditor's confirmation that a system or solution comply with policies on open standards and related procurement terms. This will ensure that suppliers deliver the openness promised. Secondly, see technology in a different way. See the big picture. Make sure government leaders understand the stakes involved and the benefits of more open ICT ecosystems. The Roadmap focuses on introducing openness system-wide to ICT ecosystems. The potential impact of its principles and policies, however, extends across a government, an organization or an economy, touching countless sectors from transportation and energy to healthcare and disaster management. In every country, agencies must become more efficient; economies and industry must be more innovative and competitive. Evolving more open ICT ecosystems is a decisive, even necessary, step. It is vital to building and sustaining an innovative, knowledge society. ~ Jeffrey A.

A well-planned e-government strategy can make leaps into building a more efficient, accountable and transparent government. If planned with representation from key stakeholders, e-government applications can rebuild citizen trust in government, promote economic growth by improving interface with business, and empower citizens to participate in advancing good governance. While e-government is not a panacea for the complex and deep-rooted problems of corruption, it cannot be ignored that ICTs possess the ability to contribute effectively towards any anti-corruption efforts. This APDIP e-Note looks at how e-government can help fight corruption; gives two well-known examples from the Republic of Korea and India where e-government has successfully helped to fight corruption; and discusses the challenges in designing and implementing similar programmes. When e-government applications are used to fight corruption, it is critical that four key anti-corruption strategies \u2013 prevention; enforcement; access to information and empowerment; and capacity building are integrated in the design and implementation process. A few case studies of e-government applications from the Asia-Pacific region report some impact on reducing corruption in several ways: Prevention: Introducing e-government applications provide an opportunity to simplify rules and procedures, and re-engineer processes and systems. The use of computers and online transactions eliminate gate keepers, depersonalize and standardize the delivery of services and thus, reduce abuse of discretion and other opportunities for corruption. Enforcement: Computerized procedures make it possible to track decisions and actions and thus, serve as an additional deterrent to corruption. Where data are centralized, unbiased sampling procedures can be applied for audit purposes. Access to Information and Empowerment: Publishing of government information online builds accountability by providing documentation to citizens to substantiate their complaints against corrupt practices. Capacity Building: Introducing e-government applications requires that telecommunication infrastructure is strengthened, human resources are developed in ICT literacy, and the culture of good governance promoted.

The use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) has dramatically changed government services, business models, and people\u2019s expectations of the quality and efficiency of information sharing and service delivery. e-Government refers to government\u2019s use of ICTs to work more effectively, share information and deliver better services to the public. e-Government is more about government \u2013 the process of reform and resulting benefits - than about the technology. The resulting benefits can include: increased efficiency in governments\u2019 functions; greater trust between government and citizens from increased transparency; empowerment of citizens through access to information; and contributions to overall economic growth. Governments in the Asia-Pacific region are serving a variety of objectives by adopting e-government. China is using websites to inform citizens and visitors.

Efforts to prevent corruption can be complemented with e-government strategies that review and clarify procedures and practices, and design systems that simplify, standardize and de-personalize the delivery of services. Of course this needs to be complemented with civil service reform, as well as, societal education efforts in reducing tolerance to corruption and reinforcing fundamental values such as honesty. e-Government can also help monitor corruption and hence better enforce laws and policies that ensure accountability and transparency by standardizing data collection methods, tracking actions and decisions, and developing a feedback/complaint mechanism. This needs to be complemented with the development of institutions, laws and practices that protect \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d impose powerful disincentives for corruption and punishes those involved in corruption. There is an implicit hierarchy of objectives that e- government applications must meet to reduce corruption. Increasing access to information; presenting the information in a manner that leads to transparency of rules and their applications in specific decisions; and increasing accountability by building the ability to trace decisions/actions to individual government officials, represent the successive stages in the hierarchy. All these objectives in tandem can curb corruption. Media, as an alert watchdog, plays a significant role in providing information and generating widespread debate around significant issues of public concern. Organizational and individual capacities need to be built with adequate telecommunications infrastructure, hardware and software to support e-government initiatives. Commitment and resources are required to train stakeholders from senior officials to clerical staff, as well as citizens, on specific applications, and increase computer literacy in general. There is no specific sequence in which different kinds of reforms are introduced. Often they run a parallel course, depending on the state of the starting condition.

First, e-government can become one of the key components of a broader anti-corruption strategy as is demonstrated by the OPEN system established in the Seoul Municipality in the Republic of Korea. Second, service delivery improvement initiatives can be implemented in corrupt departments, specifically targeting transparency and reduced corruption as objectives. An example is the Bhoomi project in India. OPEN Initiative, Republic of Korea In 1998, Seoul\u2019s Mayor initiated an anti-corruption programme, the Online Procedures Enhancement for Civil Applications (OPEN) Initiative, which opened up governmental procedures to the public. This project is widely recognized as an effective example of political and managerial commitment to transparency and for its impact on corruption. A review team analyzed the entire civil applications for permits and approvals, and identified 26 categories of civil applications that most frequently caused irregularities and inconvenience to citizens. A development team prioritized the details to be made public on a web portal. For each of the 26 categories, the OPEN web portal contains information on e-Government 2 application procedures and contact information of departmental persons-in-charge so that citizens can monitor applications and raise questions in the event any irregularities are detected. Examples of civil applications include: building permits and inspection; approval and sanction of entertainment establishments and song bars; and decision and change of urban development plans. A total of 5,000 employees in 485 city departments dealing with applications were trained to operate the system, and add and change the data. Following training, usernames and passwords were assigned to allow each individual trainee to make entries at his or her department. Results from a survey conducted by the Audit and Inspection Division of the city government one year after the launch of OPEN showed very positive results. The number of visitors to OPEN reached 648,000 (and this number increased to 1,257,000 on 1 January 2001). The number of civil application categories included in the OPEN web portal increased from 26 to 54. A total of 83 corrupt practices by civil servants were reported by the investigation organizations in 1998 (but not a single case has been filed since February 2000). A major part of the OPEN Initiative was focused on the simplification of regulations and procedures, reengineering of work practices, transparency in procedures, effective communication with the citizens, and training, rather than the technology.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "07446cc7-e136-4858-9daa-bb5fc1b86517": {"__data__": {"id_": "07446cc7-e136-4858-9daa-bb5fc1b86517", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-note-8-fighting-corruption-e-government-applications", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e-Note 8 - Fighting Corruption with e-Government Applications", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-note-8-fighting-corruption-e-government-applications", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "de948c22ac31713236b5daa9d403c78d43d99341988cfa71d15cc869cf5c2fc5"}, "2": {"node_id": "518cd83e-5755-4921-8a5a-34da499feab4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-note-8-fighting-corruption-e-government-applications", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7761232dbbe952c81085524312177d3f60401499c2b6b81df88bcf9ab8f86912"}}, "hash": "2b75e9af6266a73debc3265733887df31c91fd903f074a041889c1ddc78d7261", "text": "The technology was used as a tool to achieve its goal.

When a change of ownership takes place through sale or inheritance, farmers can file an application at the kiosk. The requests can only be processed on a first- come-first-serve basis. Each request is assigned a number that can be used by the client to track the status of the application on a touch-screen in some kiosks or by asking the kiosk operators. The Revenue Inspector will approve the request within the prescribed period (30 days from the notice date), if the request is valid. Following verification, a notice is automatically generated by the computer system to the affected parties and the system updates the particular land record. Operators of the computerized system are made accountable for their decisions and actions through a login system. The project involved organization of a series of workshop to plan the project, production of guidelines in using the online system and conduct of an extensive training programme that trained 9,000 village officials and 1,000 Revenue Inspectors. The participatory nature of the project has contributed to the success of the project. Independent evaluation of the project has indicated that bribes have decreased significantly.

Integrating e-government in anti-corruption programmes: Using e-government to fight corruption is often incidental and not part of the design objectives. Building political commitment: Even if anti-corruption and e-government strategies are in place this does not guarantee that corruption will be curbed. Commitment of decision makers (and adequate financial resources allocation) is key to the success of all government anti- corruption programmes, including those with an ICT component. Backed by political leadership and commitment, ICTs could lessen the traditional resistance for change. The cross-cutting and multi- stakeholder nature of e-government initiatives makes it more important that there is strong leadership and political commitment among different government ministries and agencies. Providing legal support: e-Government can lead to transparency provided that the legal framework supports free access to information. Until a few years ago most countries still had strict national secrecy laws. These have been repealed in favour of Freedom of Information Laws in the U.S. and much of Europe, but only after decades of lawsuits. Secrecy laws are still in effect in many of the developing countries. While increasing citizen\u2019s access to information, governments must also address risks to privacy and security. Selecting appropriate technologies: The cost of introducing ICT in government organizations is high. Selecting appropriate hardware and software is also a challenge due to the rapid advancement of new technologies. ICT specialists need to work closely with public officials to ensure that the design of the ICT system is coordinated with other reform processes. Capacity and resources need to be in place for systems maintenance, upgrades and troubleshooting. Securing the ICT system is important to prevent corruption by those who know how to manipulate the ICT system. http://www.apdip.net/apdipenote/8.pdf 3 Ensuring interoperability: Overlapping roles and responsibilities among government departments and lack of cross-departmental cooperation in developing common hardware, software, data collection methods, and rules and procedures proves a challenge when designing a national e-government system.

Systematic surveys of citizens and other stakeholders can help establish the linkage more clearly and will also provide invaluable feedback on the parts of the system that need improvements. CCoonncclluussiioonn The debate on e-government is no longer about whether it should be implemented. e-Government has been used as a strategic tool to modernize structures, processes and the overall culture of public administration. Many governments around the world are putting critical information online, automating once cumbersome processes and interacting electronically with their citizens. Indeed, reform-minded officials everywhere are using technology to improve their governments. However, with the exception of the above and a few other examples, the potential of ICTs is not considered in many anti-corruption programmes. Similarly, reducing corruption is not part of many e-government initiatives. Although, e-Government should not be seen as a panacea for the complex and well-entrenched problems of corruption, e-government is one of the many tools whose potential in tackling these problems needs to be recognized by decision makers. ~ Subhash Bhatnagar and Christine Apikul This APDIP e-Note is based on a paper written by Subhash Bhatnagar entitled, \u201ce-Government in the Asia-Pacific Region: An Assessment of Issues and Strategies.\u201d Read the full paper at http://www.apdip.net/resources/e-governance/paper.pdf AAddddiittiioonnaall RReeaaddiinngg Pascual, P.J., 2003, e-Government, e-Primer for the Information Economy, Society and Polity Series, UNDP-APDIP, e-ASEAN Task Force. http://www.apdip.net/publications/iespprimers/eprimer- egov.pdf UNDP Anti-Corruption Practice Note, March 2004 http://www.undp.org/policy/docs/practicenotes/Anti%20 Corruption%20Note%20Draft%20FINAL%20copy%20e dited%20100404.pdf Wescott, C.G., 2003, e-Government to Combat Corruption in the Asia Pacific Region, 11th International Anti-Corruption Conference, Seoul, Republic of Korea, 25-28 May 2003. http://www.adb.org/Governance/egovernment_corruptio n.pdf Bhoomi Project Website http://www.revdept-01.kar.nic.in/ OPEN Initiative Website http://english.seoul.go.kr/gover/initiatives/inti_12cor_02. htm e-Government 4", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e60e05f-62c5-4816-9434-441adbf0456e": {"__data__": {"id_": "2e60e05f-62c5-4816-9434-441adbf0456e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-note-9-internationalized-domain-names", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e-Note 9 - Internationalized Domain Names", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-note-9-internationalized-domain-names", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8b7927d2800d6838475daeacaac004456dd78996b67f6b30765e9b9bf7ba16e5"}, "3": {"node_id": "6572939d-04cf-4da3-b563-888fa3db39f9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-note-9-internationalized-domain-names", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c643bce72797950c157f88fa81195775d2366d9926052d9b0ed7d0876e19594f"}}, "hash": "25f02611e8c2fea66a1b8b30e231f9725440fe935589166ba30d457c35a0c51d", "text": "SSuum mm maarryy Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) have become a hot topic in the field of Internet governance. As the number of non-English speakers on the Internet grows exponentially, the limitations on the Domain Name System (DNS) overseen by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) have become evident to a wider range of people. ICANN has acknowledged this with the ICANN President appointing an Advisory Committee on the issue. The history of IDNs in the Asia-Pacific, however, goes back to testbeds established by the Asia Pacific Network Group in 1998. There are also a number of IDNs already established within particular Internet Service Providers (ISPs), with organizations such as the Multilingual Internet Names Consortium (MINC) attempting to develop a coordination framework to ensure that fragmentation of the Internet does not occur through \u201cleakage\u201d of these IDNs into different zones. From the perspective of the North American/European Internet governance bodies, a single system for IDNs should be established which can serve the interests of all stakeholders, and multiple systems should be avoided. This \u201cuniversal\u201d approach to IDNs raises much more complex technical, political and economic issues than developing a viable system for a particular language group. This complexity partially accounts for the slow progress on IDN development within the ICANN system. These are the two philosophies on IDNs: those supporting universality, standardization, stability and control on the one hand; versus multiplicity, diversity, coordination and responsiveness to local language groups on the other. The major challenge will be to create viable mechanisms for mediating between these philosophies. The goal will be to ensure that the Internet remains a single, interoperable public facility, while ensuring that the right of all people to communicate in their own language is maintained and expanded within this new medium. W Whhyy aarree IIDDNNss iim mppoorrttaanntt ffoorr tthhee AAssiiaa--PPaacciiffiicc?? Language is the basis of communication, and use of one's own language is a basic human right. UNESCO states that language is \u201cnot only a tool for communication and knowledge but also a fundamental attribute of cultural identity and empowerment, both for the individual and the group.\u201d1 This cultural identity and empowerment comes from seeing communication and identification occurring in a way that seems natural in one's native language. While the bulk of the content on the Internet has been in English, this is increasingly changing. In China for example, over 60 million of the nation's 100 million-plus users browse the web only in Chinese. While it is true that these users are currently able to have access while using Roman script in domain names, a truly globalized Internet would enable all users to use their own language for navigational purposes. This is especially important in areas such as education, e-government and e- commerce. Success of e-government in countries not using Roman script depends on ensuring that the ordinary citizen can remember the web address of the election website, or the e-forms and e-services which the government is offering as a public service in all the languages which are used in that country. 1 Education in a multilingual world, UNESCO Education Position Paper No. (ED-2003/WS/2) - UNESCO, 2003, p9.

Realizing the value of the Internet as a truly global medium for social and economic development will require integration of communication languages that are used for offline communication and commerce. The Asia-Pacific region contains the majority of the world's languages and so multilingual domain names are particularly important for this region. The Working Group on Internet Governance Background Report clearly identifies many of the implications of the IDN issue and areas where progress is needed, noting that: \u201cThe current market led approach to IDN only tends to maximize the number of domain names that are sold. However, there might be cases in which global public service issues should be considered \u2013 for example, whether gTLDs2 should be required to support all scripts, including minority scripts that might not be commercially viable. Without these considerations, IDN might become available only for scripts used by big countries and communities, thus contributing to the loss of linguistic diversity.\u201d3 A single DNS dominates global Internet use by agreement of major ISPs, rather than by mandate from a central body or government. If effective IDNs are not implemented within the ICANN system, it is likely that alternative navigation systems for specific language groups will continue to be developed outside of US- based coordination mechanisms such as ICANN. The differing views on how this would affect the Internet are at the core of the IDN debate.

As with many new systems, script encoding for computers was invented for a relatively narrow set of situations with little thought for what might happen if those applications expanded rapidly. In the early days of computing within the US and Europe, there was little need to consider the use of other scripts, as computers 2 gTLDs stands for generic top-level domains, such as .com, .edu, .gov, .int, .net, .org 3 Background Report \u2013 The Working Group on Internet Governance, June 2005, p.23. http://www.wgig.org performed highly specialized calculation tasks, rather than the very broad range of tasks they perform today. In particular, computer systems would rarely have to interact with others, and so a diversity of standards could emerge for the encoding of characters. Initially, the range of encoding schemes was not a significant issue, as users would generally communicate within language groups before the widespread popularity of the Internet. However, as the need for interoperability between different systems increased, Unicode emerged as an architecture that could represent any script in machine-readable code. Unicode would conceivably allow any computer to represent any character, as opposed to the script developments where language communities would simply repurpose the code points provided within operating systems designed for Roman script. Controversies during the development of Unicode 4 highlight the issues that continue to cause problems for IDN deployment. A single script-based encoding - rather than a language-based encoding - requires entirely new political relationships between different language groups who share that same script. In many cases, the governments have previously controlled language representation in their own territories, but in unified systems like Unicode, negotiations must take place on areas where there is overlap. Similarly, for IDNs to become universally resolvable will require political choices and compromises. While on the surface it would appear that a simple solution to DNS issues would be to allow any Unicode script encoding to be used for domain names, this is more complex than it first appears.

A number of issues make it difficult to upgrade the DNS to accept other scripts and languages. To take an example, the DNS automatically maps lower to upper case - APDIP.NET is effectively the same as apdip.net. But in Canada and France there are different rules about how accents are handled when being converted between cases - which rules should the DNS use? Another example is the \u201ca\u201d with a dieresis (\u201c\u00e4\u201d) which in German should be sorted and looked at exactly as an \u201ca\u201d with diacritical character, but in Swedish has nothing to do with the character \u201ca\u201d except the look.5 While Sweden could implement one set of rules under .se and Germany another under .de, what rules should be used for generic TLDs such as .com? These questions could require serious negotiations between nation-states and their language experts to find compromises. Domain names are intended to unambiguously associate a name to an IP address. This does not work effectively in the case of \u201chomoglyphs\u201d where domain names contain characters which are visually indistinguishable at quick inspection. Homoglyphs are present in domain names using LDH ASCII script - e.g. a lower case \u201cL\u201d and an upper case \u201ci\u201d look the same in some typefaces, so that a website URL like http://paypai.com could be written to be indistinguishable from http://paypal.com if cases are mixed in a browser address bar.6 However, the number of visually similar characters is greatly expanded when a large variety of scripts can be used. To some extent, security issues will be mitigated by the fact that individual users will be able to distinguish areas of risk within their own scripts. However, the DNS is globally accessible and contains no reference to a user's context, so IDNs offer many more opportunities to be exploited in fraudulent ways. For example, characters from different scripts which are visually equivalent can be used to launch \u201cphishing\u201d attacks and mislead users into thinking an Internet site is genuine. Michael Everson notes that, \u201cin Burmese the digit zero and letter wah are 100 percent identical in every font and there is no getting away from that.\u201d7 As the various cases were explored it became clear that rewriting the underpinnings of the DNS to account for every script and language would be impossible, and development of IDNs requires a number of compromises and balancing of priorities in the technical, cultural, and organizational arenas. The complexity of these issues has led the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) to determine that it would be extremely disruptive to transition the entire DNS to a 5 Signposts in Cyberspace: The Domain Name System and Internet Navigation \u2013 Committee on Internet Navigation and the Domain Name System: Technical Alternatives and Policy Implications, National Research Council, 2005. http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11258.html 6 Another example is a digital numeral \u201c0\u201d and upper case \u201co\u201d. 7 http://www.icann.org/meetings/vancouver/captioning-idn- workshop-30nov05.htm fully IDN-compliant system, despite numerous limited implementations in non-ICANN namespaces.

The benefit of the client-side approach of the IDNA standard is that it is compatible with the existing DNS. However, in order for IDNA to function universally, all software applications that interact with a domain name must be upgraded to implement the IDNA standard, including browsers, email applications, word processors, operating system tools, etc. Another downside to IDNA comes from requiring conformance at the application layer rather than within the DNS infrastructure, which results in a lack of control over implementation. Therefore, even though the guidelines are specific about how applications should implement IDNs, applications can still be produced which implement IDNs in unusual ways or not at all. The required extensions to browser operations and syntax are not standardized and not consistent across all applications, meaning different users may receive different results depending on which tools they are using, and the rollout of a universally available set of tools will take years, if it happens at all. A more significant problem is that IDNA is not yet capable of being used by most email clients, and email is one of the most important functions of the DNS. This Internet Governance 4 is especially important because email very often includes users' personal names, whose accurate representation will be very important to the average user. It also functions as an important aspect of corporate identity - the domain section of a user's work email address will usually be read as the marker for the employer of that user. Even with acceptance of IDNA proposals, the question remains open as to how multilingual domains would be mapped into the DNS. For example, is a Japanese language version of .com (say, .\u4f1a\u793e, company) an entirely new domain space requiring its own registration procedures; or does it map onto the existing .com domain space? In the latter case, should a user typing in http://\u52d5\u7269.\u4f1a\u793e go directly to the http://animals.com website? This last example relates to the most controversial IDN implementation being tested by ICANN: DNAME.8 DNAME is a type of DNS record used to map or rename an entire sub-tree of the DNS name space to another domain. Under the DNAME scenario, alternative representations in different scripts would be mapped to existing ASCII TLDs. From the point of view of existing registries controlling one or more TLDs, it is an attractive proposal because it means that, for example, Verisign would be able to offer .com in a number of different languages (with significant revenue implications) rather than .\u4f1a\u793e being offered by an entirely new and different registrar perhaps based in Japan. Another proposal being tested (NS-record) is equivalent to how current DNS entries are currently made for any new TLD. For these, an internationalized label in punycode format (for .\u4f1a\u793e, xn--6oq404h) would be inserted in the root zone. This means that .\u4f1a\u793e would effectively be equivalent to a new TLD which could be managed in a completely distinctive manner (and by a different company) than .com. This would have a much greater economic and political impact on the domain name industry and its management.

An axiom of the Internet is that because there is no control enforced by legislation (only agreement and recommendation), people will use a new system if it works for them. This is the case whether or not a solution is the most technically efficient for the network as a whole. So a number of organizations have deployed solutions for multilingual navigation services which serve DNS-like functions. It should be noted that not all of these systems are in direct competition with the ICANN DNS. Many have simply emerged to fill a market need and have expressed interest in migrating to global standards if/when they are developed. However, for some successful companies there is little incentive for them to migrate to standards such as IDNA which are less effective for their users. 8 This function was defined in RFC 2672 in 1999.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6f49229b-5568-4f81-bd0a-078cd117361a": {"__data__": {"id_": "6f49229b-5568-4f81-bd0a-078cd117361a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-note-9-internationalized-domain-names", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e-Note 9 - Internationalized Domain Names", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-note-9-internationalized-domain-names", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "15a2cea8877951aaa593182d75c20bc68798d1596c4d11f94861df9c80076287"}, "2": {"node_id": "e9bf4ee7-e278-481f-ae84-53c4c6d84558", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-note-9-internationalized-domain-names", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "81143a482e192e9b6a7ca7aa63fcde21f971af0036dc86f2977ad0e74e6c4fc5"}}, "hash": "a6dd09470f96e4a43e61b05d0c4f3778363cc2fe71b7fa94dd986739247a729c", "text": "8 This function was defined in RFC 2672 in 1999.

A number of technical experts, including the IAB have reiterated the importance of a single and authoritative root. From the IAB's perspective, \u201cthere is no getting away from the unique root of the public DNS.\u201d That sentiment was reiterated by a recent report from ICANN's Security and Stability Advisory Committee on alternate root systems.9 However, former ICANN board member Karl Auerbach claims that the ICANN report \u201cdoes not raise any technical reason why as a technical matter there can not safely coexist on the net several different DNS naming spaces - which may or may not be consistent with one another - each dangling from a different DNS root.\u201d10 Ironically, the telephone system numbering plan works in such a distributed fashion with no single technical root. There is only logical coordination by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) - with, depending on the context, national regulation or market forces taking care of the rest. This distributed policy model has made innovation possible in national and regional contexts (e.g. national freephone numbers) while still supporting more general global resolution. Different DNS name spaces can co-exist, provided there is coordination and cooperation amongst all namespace owners to avoid collision and to mutually cross-resolve each other\u2019s namespace to their respective end users to preserve universality. This is what a number of Arabic, Chinese, Farsi, Hebrew, Korean, Russian IDN TLD operators are currently trying to do under the coordination of the MINC, to set up a universal resolution system that will take their fragmented namespaces and enable cross-resolution.

The biggest issues with IDN are not technical, but political - they relate to the relative priority given to different users and their needs. This is for two reasons: Firstly, the DNS is not designed for computers but for people. The Internet would be simpler from a technical perspective if the DNS did not exist and everyone used IP addresses to identify the computers they wished to reach, much as we use telephone numbers today. Therefore, the discussion about how the DNS should 9 http://icann.org/committees/security/alt-tlds-roots-report- 31mar06.pdf 10 http://www.cavebear.com/cbblog-archives/000245.html http://www.apdip.net/apdipenote/9.pdf 5 function is primarily about humans and how we interface with the technology. In particular, there are competing ideas of \u201cthe user\u201d and what is logical and effective for the user which are at stake in the discussion. The average user themselves has little understanding of the DNS (especially compared to the \u201caverage user\u201d in 1985, who was often a member of the technical community) so it is left to others to advocate on their behalf in technical and policy frameworks. Secondly, the DNS as currently controlled by ICANN and the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is not the only mechanism by which users navigate the Internet, though it is by far the most prominent. As well as the various alternate-script systems mentioned above, many important software applications such as Skype and AOL Instant Messenger have navigation and identification systems that do not require the DNS, but instead offer users their own private directories to facilitate communication and file transfer. Similarly, search engines have to some degree reduced dependence on the DNS to identify organizations and individuals on the Internet. Therefore, the single most important question is not whether alternate systems are possible, but whether the overall benefits of a single namespace and unique root outweigh the benefits of allowing users to use the language of their choice in the DNS. In general, there are two identifiable groups of opinion in this discussion. They are not completely polarized, and individuals and organizations may tend more toward one or the other position. The unique root The first and most powerful bloc consists of ICANN and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and its most influential stakeholders: registry owners, the US/European private sector, engineers in this private sector and civil society, and the US Government - those for whom the current system works well, or at least better than practical alternatives.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "51c018c9-6fda-46e3-99eb-0819232bb471": {"__data__": {"id_": "51c018c9-6fda-46e3-99eb-0819232bb471", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-note-9-internationalized-domain-names", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e-Note 9 - Internationalized Domain Names", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-note-9-internationalized-domain-names", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a0caf1f1f4fc3cdca126c229d8280fe180a2e29e86dcc4689d2ce170d2255b20"}, "2": {"node_id": "cf85bd89-1ee4-4b99-81e9-0568336b191e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-note-9-internationalized-domain-names", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aff7c8619dbc5bc70bbe1a285140666de1101e2c37d84f196af1189d9f3f7e76"}}, "hash": "9abfd5623efcb9b4b7d9445f95180ae2952805de4c945b28096b34cbbdb6528a", "text": "For slightly different but compatible reasons, they prioritize the stability of the existing system and the need for a unique root.

Transnational companies resist new TLDs as they fear they have to register their names in the new TLDs whenever they emerge in order to prevent passing off by others. When they neglect to register, others will capitalize on their omission and cybersquat or pass off, or generate fake sites for phishing and other nefarious activities, thereby confusing end users. However, it has been noted that in the case of IDN TLDs, this will generally be taken care of by their own branches in the countries which they operate. Other than additional expense, it is within the standard operating procedure of such companies to detect for passing offs, and well within existing intellectual property laws to handle such cases expeditiously. \u2022 For engineers involved in the DNS, it is self-evident that the DNS only works where there is a single and unique root, because that is how the system was designed. The implications of deploying multiple public DNS roots would, in the words of RFC 2826, \u201craise a very strong possibility that users of different ISPs who click on the same link on a web page could end up at different destinations, against the will of the web page designers.\u201d11 This would increase the chances of fraud and could reduce the overall usability and coherence of the system. \u2022 The US Government's National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) noted in 2005 that \"the United States is committed to taking no action that would have the potential to adversely impact the effective and efficient operation of the DNS and will therefore maintain its historic role in authorizing changes or modifications to the authoritative root zone file.\"12 Although many members of the technical community would prefer to see this oversight fully delegated to ICANN, it nevertheless means that there is a shared interest with the US Government in maintaining a single, authoritative root. Prioritizing multilingualism The second body of opinion sees the lack of progress on IDNs as a critical issue that prevents the non- English speaking majority of the world from making effective use of the Internet. In this group are the IDN providers, technical bodies working on script encoding (especially from Asia), governments whose official languages do not use Roman script, cultural rights advocates, and many members of civil society in North America and Europe. For these communities, the priority is to implement systems that allow users to navigate using a range of scripts, and that the decisions about what is possible should be made by the language communities themselves. They point out that international business still takes place without a single shared language, and that different language communities can negotiate interfaces between their relatively discreet cultural and economic systems. \u2022 IDN providers want to gain access to a valuable market for domain registry services that has so far been located in the US and Europe. \u2022 Various technical bodies in Asia who have navigation systems in particular scripts would like 11 http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2826.html 12http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/USDNSprinci ples_06302005.htm Internet Governance 6 to see this work taken up on the Internet as a whole. They are impatient with delays and a perceived lack of commitment from ICANN/IETF to this issue. \u2022 Governments whose official languages do not use Roman script are uncomfortable with decisions on domain name deployment sitting with a private US- dominated body. They are used to having control over things like language rules and mandating how languages and scripts should be used. \u2022 Cultural rights supporters (primarily in civil society) see the use of one's own language as a basic human right, which is not outweighed by ease-of- use or security considerations proposed by predominantly English-speaking groups for whom the current system is viable.

If IDNs are this hard and do not solve the problem... maybe it is time to go back to the problem and do some serious thinking about models which would be \u201cnon-DNS\u201d or \u201cabove-DNS\u201d.13 The maintenance of a single unique namespace for a truly multilingual global medium brings unprecedented challenges. The attempt to fully internationalize the DNS would be more complex than the massive project undertaken by Unicode, finding a common technical encoding for scripts (itself far from uncontroversial). A single, multilingual namespace would also be the first attempt to mediate between competing uses of the same words on a global scale, some of which had previously been allowed to exist in different languages. A single system which serves a range of language groups would require mechanisms to effectively negotiate between different priorities of language scholars, trademark owners, standards bodies, and technical engineers, to name a few. In particular, the role of nation-states in formalizing language has never 13 http://ws.edu.isoc.org/workshops/2004/ICANN-KL/ICANN- ISOC-KL-IDN-part2.ppt been as complex as a single unique namespace would require. To effectively support this negotiation would require more resources than existing bodies such as ICANN currently have available for the task. It is only in 2005 that ICANN committed significant resources to the problem with a President's Advisory Committee working on the subject and the proposal for IDN testbeds to be put in place. For those who have been working on alternative systems, there is little confidence in the ability of the established regime to achieve their interests. If the bodies in control of the existing DNS wish it to remain the default Internet navigation standard, they must not only work to implement IDNs in areas where it is economically lucrative, but provide an effective participation mechanism for all the stakeholders in this complex domain.

21\u201322 April 2008 1 1. The East and South-East Asia HLF Consultation had a two-fold objective: \u2022 to support partner countries in preparing for the Third High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness (HLF-3); and \u2022 to ensure that the East & South-East Asian voices genuinely contribute to the design and outcome of the Accra High Level Forum. 2. The Consultation sought to achieve these objec- tives by bringing together nine countries from the region \u2013 Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Timor-Leste and Viet Nam \u2013 including senior offi cials came from across the breadth of government, span- ning central policy ministries (such as Finance, Planning and Foreign Affairs) as well as line ministries charged with deliv- ering results at sector level (Education, Agriculture and Forestry); donor focal points (acting as representatives for the in-country donor community) and representa- tives from civil society organisations from Indonesia, Philippines and Viet Nam. 3. Participants were made aware of the range of meetings and preparations in the lead up to HLF-3 and asked that organisers make every effort to ensure continuity of representation of govern- ment offi cials in these meetings to demonstrate systematic inclusion of the sub-region in HLF-3 preparations as well as to facilitate greater own- ership of HLF-3. Governments in the region were urged to be vocal and forthright in conveying their messages for Accra and the Accra Agenda for Action (AAA) at these events, or opportunities to infl uence would be lost. 4. In-country consultations and preparations were seen a prerequisite for the AAA to be successfully agreed in Accra. Indonesia, Laos, and Viet Nam, among others, have already consulted in their capitals. Future country consultations ideally would involve Ministers, so that countries in East & South-East Asia can provide formal feedback to the AAA Consensus Group on the draft AAA (visit www.accrahlf.net ). 5. The Contact Group, led by KY Amoako in his advi- sory capacity to the Government of Ghana, was recognised as an initiative available to the region to leverage their voices at the international level. Viet Nam and Cambodia, through discussion with the Government of Ghana, informed participants that they meet with Sri Lanka (the Asia countries on the Contact Group) and draw from the four Asia-Pacifi c Consultation outputs to contribute to the drafting of the AAA. These gov- ernments will work with UNDP Regional Centre for Asia and the Pacifi c to ensure govern- ments in the region are kept involved in the key next steps in preparing for Accra and drafting the AAA. 6. Representatives of those leading work on the \u201ccross-cutting\u201d issues emphasised the importance of including in consultations those actors with a mandate for promoting aid effectiveness in the areas of gender equality, human rights, HIV and AIDS, and environment and ensure that key com- mitments on strengthening these dimensions of development are included in the AAA. 7. Partner countries repeatedly stressed that Accra must not become another \u2018talking shop\u2019. Accra must not be allowed to become another donor-centred and donor-driven process, but must listen to and act upon partner country needs and priorities.

Countries in the region have a number of experiences that they are willing to share 3 14. The East and South-East Asia HLF Consultation had a two-fold objective: \u2022 to support partner countries in preparing for the Third High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness (HLF-3); and \u2022 to ensure that the East & South-East Asian voices genuinely contribute to the design and outcome of the Accra High Level Forum. 15. The Consultation sought to achieve these objec- tives by bringing together the critical actors with knowledge and infl uence on aid effectiveness from within the region and internationally. The nine countries from the region \u2013 Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Timor-Leste and Viet Nam \u2013 were represented by a diverse array of colleagues: \u2022 Senior offi cials came from across the breadth of government, spanning cen- tral policy ministries (such as Finance, Planning and Foreign Affairs) as well as line ministries charged with delivering results at sector level (Education, Agriculture and Forestry). \u2022 Donor focal points from each country briefed to share the perspectives of a broader range of donors and share back with them on their return the consul- tation\u2019s outcomes. \u2022 Representatives from civil society organisations from Indonesia, Philippines and Viet Nam. 16. The hosts of the Accra High Level Forum, Ghana, were represented by the Minister of State of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning Dr. Anthony Akoto Osei, and Ms. Mary-Anne Addo, Director, External Resource Mobilisation. Dr Osei and Ms Mary-Anne Addo extended a personal invi- tation and looked forward to welcome each of the country\u2019s delegations to Accra in September.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e9aa5345-197b-450d-a21d-b212bde87092": {"__data__": {"id_": "e9aa5345-197b-450d-a21d-b212bde87092", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/east-south-east-asia-outcomes-consultations-high-level-forum-aid-effectiveness", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "East & South-East Asia Outcomes: Consultations on the High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/east-south-east-asia-outcomes-consultations-high-level-forum-aid-effectiveness", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0932e1a3a0768b0ad7edb08f60ae06610936537a04e8f2a1fa6fb0bc72b053ef"}, "2": {"node_id": "46a1bab7-9b4a-4183-ab84-bbfa0652ee27", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/east-south-east-asia-outcomes-consultations-high-level-forum-aid-effectiveness", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "208ac82ca4219e79d2250849571987759386c62966b1ca7736692721073ac414"}}, "hash": "3096d61705a087158fc43f5b1e3a9f66e7b8fb9f7ec408571754cfbf3e8406ab", "text": "Six of the Nine HLF Round Table Co-Chairs also attended and were able to both brief and listen to the priori- ties and recommendations from the region. 17.

This year, from 2\u20134 September, ministers, heads of development agencies, representatives from global funds, emerging economies and civil society organizations from around the world will gather in Accra for the Third High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness. Their common objective is to identify concrete actions that will accelerate and deepen implementation of the Paris Declaration, endorsed in March 2005, which laid down a practi- cal and action-oriented roadmap to improve the quality of aid and its impact on development. HLF-3: An Opportunity to Engage 22. HLF-3 provides a unique opportunity for part- ner countries and other stakeholders to infl uence the highest levels of governments and organisa- tions, and reinforce networks for mutual learning and sharing of experiences. Over 800 delegates will take part in the Accra HLF, including ministers and senior offi cials from over 150 countries, heads of multilateral institutions and representatives from civil society organizations (CSOs). The HLF is organised in three tiers: HLF Tier 1: Nine Round Tables 23. The Round Tables provide for in-depth discus- sion on nine topics. What are the bottlenecks? What actions can we (partner and donor governments) take to remove them and boost aid\u2019s contribution to the Millennium Development Goals? Preparations around each Round Table can infl uence the AAA drafting process, and also have value in their own right \u2013 shaping the aid effectiveness agenda over the longer run, beyond Accra and towards HLF4 in 2011.The nine Round Table are shown in Box 1. 2 | Third High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness: process & event Country ownership 1.

On the fi nal day in Accra, heads of agencies, senior officials and Ministers will negotiate and endorse the Accra Agenda for Action (AAA) which will highlight a small set of politically appealing, high impact actions for both donors and partner gov- ernments to take in advancing progress towards the Paris Declaration commitments and targets. 25. During the East & South-East Asia consultations, Minister Osei of the Government of Ghana, host of HLF-3, reiterated his government\u2019s commitment to supporting HLF-3 to deliver substantive out- comes on aid effectiveness through the AAA. He emphasized that the event in Ghana was not only for Africa, but for all regions of the world.

Participants can submit their materials by writing to: secretariat@ accrahlf.net. The Accra Agenda for Action will highlight a small set of politi- cally appealing, high impact actions 6 (i) Effective Consultation and Preparation for the HLF are Critical to its Success 28. During the East & South-East Asia Consultation, participants learned more about the many events and meetings preparing for Accra \u2013 such as the Capacity Development Meeting in Bonn (May) and the Ownership workshop in Colombia (June). Governments stated that some continuity in rep- resentation from the sub-region was essential to maximise their effectiveness. Bruce Purdue, Head of the Results Management Unit of the ADB, urged governments in the region to be vocal and forth- right in conveying their messages for Accra and the AAA, or opportunities to infl uence would be lost. 29. In-country consultations and preparations were seen a prerequisite for the AAA to be successfully agreed in Accra. Indonesia, Laos, and Viet Nam, among others, have already consulted in their capitals. Future country consultations ideally would involve Ministers, so that countries in East & South-East Asia can pro- vide formal feedback to the AAA Consensus Group on the draft AAA \u2013 as Sri Lanka has already done (visit www.accrahlf.net).. 30. Delegates noted the need to convey what occurred at the Consultation to their colleagues and networks at country level who had not been able to attend. This was seen as one key way to reach out across the region and help countries prepare for HLF-3. 31. While international meetings such as the HLF are essential in crafting a global consensus on aid effectiveness, and can improve the parameters at country level relating to predictability, tying and incentives, for example, it is at the partner coun- try level that we will \u2013 or will not \u2013 change how we do business, and where actions have the greatest potential to lock in better development results. And here, at the local level, it is often about person- alities \u2013 and success or failure can be attributed to the enthusiasm or apathy of individuals in key positions \u2013 a country representative, a Minister, a departmental head, a program manager\u2026 So, this is a political challenge for all of us at the local level. 32. The Contact Group, led by KY Amoako in his advisory capacity to the Government of Ghana, was recognised as an initiative available to the region to leverage their voices at the international level. Viet Nam and Cambodia, through discussion with the Government of Ghana, informed participants that they would work with Sri Lanka as part of the Contact group. They will meet in Bangkok, and draw upon the many inputs from this South-East Asian Consultation to contribute to the drafting of the AAA, including through the global meeting of the Contact Group later in May. With support from UNDP\u2019s Regional Centre for Asia and the Pacifi c and other members of the organising committee, these gov- ernments will seek to ensure governments in the region are kept involved in the key next steps in preparing for Accra and updated on the contribu- tion of the Contact Group to the AAA. 33. Representatives of those leading work on the \u201ccross-cutting\u201d issues emphasised the importance of including in consultations those actors with a mandate for promoting aid effectiveness in the areas of gender equality, human rights, HIV and AIDS, and environment. They asked that the con- sultation meetings at national, regional and global levels include discussion to ensure that the HLF-3 3 | Messages and Feedback from East & South-East Asia It is at the partner country level that we will \u2013 or will not \u2013 change how we do business 7 East & South-East Asia: Outcomes genuinely mainstreams the cross-cutting issues into its programme of action. 34.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8f2c0c63-2a41-41c0-9e8a-a912c6c9052e": {"__data__": {"id_": "8f2c0c63-2a41-41c0-9e8a-a912c6c9052e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/east-south-east-asia-outcomes-consultations-high-level-forum-aid-effectiveness", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "East & South-East Asia Outcomes: Consultations on the High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/east-south-east-asia-outcomes-consultations-high-level-forum-aid-effectiveness", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bddd3086b9ba71cc86c92cb267b67bf3f3ad7593bf8bd987c0ba3c6ddad966a0"}, "2": {"node_id": "029f409e-6884-4911-98cf-0adf5f49a42c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/east-south-east-asia-outcomes-consultations-high-level-forum-aid-effectiveness", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "174f1ede86cfa9a99734270a8e75753bbe84f92e739d5d14c5e87b33f1e4c666"}}, "hash": "6e20f6afbcd73727012c65eddd3d529b9f541b2efad19fa4aa936678a865889b", "text": "34.

Please visit http://cop-mfdr. adb.org (ii) Strengthening the Accra Agenda for Action (AAA) 35. Partner countries repeatedly stressed that Accra must not become another \u2018talking shop\u2019. Accra must not be allowed to become another donor-centred and donor-driven process, but must listen to and act upon partner country needs and priorities. Participants supported the Government of Ghana\u2019s intent to make this meeting count in terms of real acceleration of progress in achieving development results. The fi nal agreement at Accra is not an end in itself, but a stepping stone to forg- ing a true partnership to remedy weaknesses in the current systems, and make development aid effective. 36. Participants found it diffi cult to relate the Draft AAA to their country experience and were cautious in giving their inputs, noting the need for their Ministers to be involved before defi nitive comments can be made. Some requested that the AAA focus more explicitly on the six partner country priorities identifi ed during previous consultations. 37. The fi nal AAA should use clear and simple lan- guage, contain specifi c actions and responsibilities for donors and partner countries, and should refl ect the six priorities identifi ed by partner coun- tries (untying, conditionality, predictability, division of labour, incentives, and capacity development). Participants argued that the current AAA text was insuffi ciently clear and direct: why, for example, write \u2018supply-driven\u2019 when what is really meant is \u2018donor-driven\u2019? 38. Participants felt the balance between recipient and donor government commitments was not yet right \u2013 particularly in rela- tion to the topics of mutual accountability and owner- ship. Participants felt they need to discuss the AAA in much greater depth in their own countries in order to build up genuine ownership of the HLF-3 \u2013 this was a vital part of the process given the objective of deeper and more genuine ownership at the country level of the Paris Declaration. 39. Countries recognised the important contribu- tion being made by Non-DAC donors and the need to work together on a common platform led by partner countries. 40. Below are some headline messages regarding the fi ve Paris Declaration Principles, which currently frame the AAA document (see Annex 1 for more detail). Ownership 41. Leadership, good governance, transparency and accountability are crucial factors for strengthening ownership. 42. Donors have not committed much in terms of reducing conditionality and the emphasis seems to be shifting from a reduction in conditionality to redesigning conditionality. Donors distort democra- cy building through over-imposing conditionality. 43. The continued practice of tied aid undermines ownership. The issue of tied aid can generally not be tackled at country level. Governments and donors have to deliver aid on mutual understand- ing. Donors must have the political will to address it themselves at their HQ levels. 44. Donors distort capacity building through over- use of international technical assistance. Leadership, good gover- nance, transparency and accountability are crucial factors for strengthening ownership. 8 Consultations on the High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness | Bangkok, 21\u201322 April 2008 45. Technical cooperation is essential for capacity development but needs to be well-coordinated and aligned to partner country\u2019s strategy. 46. Partner countries need to develop coherent capacity development plans across sectors and levels of government and to make this the basis for demand-driven technical assistance. 47. The localization of the Paris Declaration through national declarations and/or action plans address- ing key Paris Declaration targets has strengthened ownership of the aid effectiveness agenda in the region (Cambodia, Lao PDR, Viet Nam), and more countries, such as Indonesia, are planning to loca- lise . These are excellent examples for the HLF-3 of aid effectiveness in action. Alignment 48.

Partner countries and donors should commit to develop and make use of national ODA Aid Management Systems to record and manage all funds. This is a prerequisite for aligning ODA with national priori- ties and getting more aid on budget. 53. Increasing use of direct budget support helps align with partner country systems. 54. Country analytical work should be available to all through a common information sharing plat- form: donors and governments need to commit to developing these platforms. Harmonisation 55. Donors are interested in harmonising \u2013 but \u2018on their own terms\u2019. They should commit to har- monising on partner governments\u2019 terms. Partner governments also need to ensure that priorities set out in national plans are translated into frame- works for complementarity and division of labour amongst donors. More work is needed to understand how 56. division of labour can be opera- tionalised effectively \u2013 uniform approaches will not work. Harmonisation should 57. not undermine the diversity of aid available for partner countries. 58. Inequalities in government- donor relations can make it diffi cult for Governments to determine the com- parative advantage of donors. 59. Increased use of Programme Based Approach (PBA) modalities can foster harmonization. 60. The approaches to harmonisation need to pay attention to diverse actors in the changing aid architecture. Managing for Results 61. Results-based decision making processes apply as much to external aid as they do to the manage- ment of domestic resources. Financial planning systems can best be strengthened by channelling donor funds through them 9 East & South-East Asia: Outcomes 62. Political leadership, good governance, and capacity for managing results are essential, partic- ularly for effective delivery of services to people. 63. The whole aid effectiveness agenda had become too technocratic, and donors (and part- ner governments) should not lose sight of the purpose \u2013 promoting better actual development outcomes. Capacity development 64. and sustainability issues are key in results management. A good practice example of peer to peer learning (for example between Afghanistan and Malaysia) is through the Community of Practice ini- tiative supported by Asian Development Bank. 65. Donors and partners need to identify incentives that are required to improve the results culture. 66. The Accra Agenda for Action must address poverty, gender, and delivery of services \u2013 if it is to generate tangible results and improvements in people\u2019s lives. 67. Predictability of aid is closely related to the achievement of results and the MfDR agenda. 68. Networking and knowledge management on how to monitor and evaluate well are important, and south-south collaboration can make a signifi - cant contribution to this. Mutual Accountability 69. There is no agreed defi nition of mutual account- ability, and partner countries asked for greater clarity to ensure better understanding on this issue, but in simple (and not complex) language, which makes sense at the country level. 70. Participants expressed concern that the mutual accountability pillar of the Paris Declaration was unique in placing obligations on one party only \u2013 Indicator 12 should be refi ned to recognise the obligations on both governments and donors if mutual accountability is to be meaningful. 71. East & South-East Asia offers good examples of mechanisms for monitoring reciprocal performance of governments and donors against aid effective- ness commitments (eg independent monitoring mechanism in Viet Nam, Country Action Plans in Cambodia and Laos). Viet Nam discussed with Laos and Cambodia plans to develop a joint government position paper on mutual accountability as a con- tribution from the sub-region to Accra. 72. Participants underscored that exercising mutual account- ability itself demands that key capacities are in place. These range from leadership skills to budget and planning capacity at sector level. \u201cSofter\u201d aspects, such as human resource capac- ities, must be addressed \u2013 not only systems. 73. Country participants asked that donors report all ODA provided (using national systems), including ODA delivered to non-governmental agencies. 74. Clarifi cation is needed in how principles, such as mutual accountability, might be applied to non- DAC donors, which are of growing importance in the region. 75.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8fe145e3-5f88-4d4b-8909-f64fa02905bb": {"__data__": {"id_": "8fe145e3-5f88-4d4b-8909-f64fa02905bb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/east-south-east-asia-outcomes-consultations-high-level-forum-aid-effectiveness", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "East & South-East Asia Outcomes: Consultations on the High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/east-south-east-asia-outcomes-consultations-high-level-forum-aid-effectiveness", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "335289f4feed0285c4727f5773c47c4b3510338a59d815fe8be1db0ffe5ff09e"}, "2": {"node_id": "660fdb4c-5a01-46b3-88fa-747e7f1bfaf3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/east-south-east-asia-outcomes-consultations-high-level-forum-aid-effectiveness", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "809c482b8f82b414e97ba178f1a07293b5bc8a699c30fbe19a15c4cb8d762369"}}, "hash": "15050996c7e5e9ff5a8c2677dd26ccb8454d017b6081155ed5b68b3b4b366265", "text": "75.

The nine Round Table (RT) working group dis- cussions underscored that countries in the region have a number of experiences that they are willing to share and which could help advance the agenda of aid effectiveness at the HLF-3. These are cap- tured in Annex 2. 78. Participating governments from the region were keen to know more about how they could offer to serve as panellists or key note speakers at the HLF. Country delegations interacted directly with six of the nine RT Co-Chairs which were present, giving, and the organising committee said it would be willing to work with RT Co-Chairs to iden- tify further panellists from Asia-Pacifi c. The organising committee is also willing to support governments in the region develop case studies for the HLF-3. 79. Alongside the many specifi c country con- tributions made during the RT working group discussions, Viet Nam initiated discussion with governments over the development of a joint posi- tion paper on Mutual Accountability \u2013 which would extract lessons from across Lao PDR, Cambodia and Viet Nam. Participants agreed that this was a genuinely country-led initiative which would be a unique contribution to the HLF-3 given the empha- sis on donor-led studies to-date. UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok is willing to help facilitate this or other country-driven analytical contributions to the HLF. 80. The preparatory process (of meetings, ana- lytical work, country studies) differs for each of the Round Tables. More information will become available at www.AccraHLF.net. Policy and research documents on each of the nine Round Tables can be found at www.AidEffectiveness.org. (iv) Using Evidence for Action: the 2008 Survey on Aid Effectiveness and the Paris Declaration Evaluation 81. A review of the 2008 Survey on Monitoring the Paris Declaration revealed a number of com- mon themes for the South-East Asian countries of Cambodia, Laos, Indonesia, the Philippines and Viet Nam. \u2022 Cambodia provides an excellent example of a country that has devel- oped a national system for managing ODA fl ows and integrated within it the Paris Declaration indicators. As a result, Cambodia\u2019s develop- ment partners did not need to complete the DAC survey forms, and the survey results were seen as more reliable. Aid Information Management Systems were seen as valuable instruments for promoting aid effectiveness as long as they were integrated into national busi- ness processes (of governments and donors), including planning and budgeting. \u2022 The Paris Declaration indicators do not always mesh with country priorities; their localisation and adaptation at country level is important for ensuring policy relevance. \u2022 Comparison of data across countries and within countries across years can be problematic, and the real value of the survey data is as evidence to help clarify priority areas for action on aid effectiveness at country level. \u2022 The short time frame given to complete the survey was particularly challenging for coun- tries undertaking the survey for the fi rst time and made it more diffi cult to reap longer term benefi ts in institutionalising of dialogue on aid effectiveness.

LO O K I N G F O R W A R D 25 Taking forward Accra 26 4th High-Level Forum Annex 2 15 Round Table 1: Country Ownership Democratic Ownership (i) While there is no major disagreement on the issues involving country ownership, there is some question over how democratic ownership can be measured. The instrument (World Bank Aid Effectiveness Review) for measuring owner- ship as part of the Paris Declaration needs to be improved. (ii) Ownership is impacted by aid modalities and the priority issues identifi ed by partner countries. Donor-driven aid, conditionality, non-predictability, and tied aid and project-based aid, make it diffi cult for governments to plan and therefore lead to poor ownership. Good governance, transparency and accountability are also factors that are important for ownership and leadership. (iii) Time bound commitments on localising Paris Declaration country action plans could lead to greater country ownership. (iv) The \u2018How\u2019 of promoting ownership needs to look at the tension between conditionality and democratic ownership. (v) Donor commitments to reducing conditional- ity have been disappointing in their scope. The emphasis seems to be shifting from reduction in conditionality to redesigning conditionality. This is rejected by countries in the sub-region, some of whom seek the elimination of policy conditionality by 2010. (vi) Some countries requested that the commit- ment to reduce conditionalities should not be limited to reducing \u2018over lapping\u2019 but should apply to all conditionalities. Leadership and Capacity (i) Leadership is a prerequisite for partner countries to ensure ownership. It is diffi cult for countries to reconcile heavy aid dependence and ownership. (ii) There is the gap in capacity at national, sectoral, and provincial levels, and TC should be designed according to each context. Partner Countries need to develop capacity development plans across sec- tors and levels of government and to make this the basis for demand-driven technical assistance.

(v) Some participants called for a reinforced com- mitment to link national priority programmes, MTEF (Medium Term Expenditure Framework) and budgets.

Annex 2 | The Accra Round Tables: Messages from East & South-East Asia HLF Consultation 16 Consultations on the High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness | Bangkok, 21\u201322 April 2008 Country experiences (i) Compared to other regions many countries have already (Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam) or are in the pro- cess of (Indonesia) localising the Paris Declaration through operational plans and declarations. (ii) Cambodia and its Donor Performance Report in Education, which assesses donor performance in delivering on programme-based approaches. (iii) Lao PDR, improvements in procurement sys- tems to facilitate greater use of national systems by donors. Round Table 2: Alignment: Use of Country Systems, Untying Aid, Aid Predictability Use of Strengthened Country Systems in Public Financial Management and Procurement (PFM&P) (i) Where partner country capacity in PFM is weak, the best way to develop capacity is for donors to channel funds through country systems. Where donors create parallel system, country capacity has no opportunity to develop. (ii) A coordinated plan for capacity development of country PFM systems is needed, and donors should align their capacity development efforts to it. (iii) All donors must synchronise with partner country budget cycles and use a common system. Start with \u2018like minded donors\u2019, and progressively bring all donors into line. (iv) Some participants suggested that increasing the use of direct budget support helps promote alignment with partner country systems. (v) Partner countries and donors should use one common nationally-owned ODA database to record and manage all funds. (vi) Some international standards are emerg- ing such as PEFA ( www.pefa.org ) and OECD Joint Venture on PFM. (vii) The \u2018One UN\u2019 pilot in Viet Nam making progress on harmonising basic foundations of programming \u2013 planning, budgeting and systems procurement, etc. Aid Predictability (i) Donors should speed up approval process for releasing committed funds so more funding deliv- ered on time. (ii) Donors should move beyond annual funding commitments (e.g. to three-year rolling horizon). This is an issue for donor head offi ces and requires political commitment of donors. Untying of aid (i) Progress by donors is varied: overall there is a need to reduce the proportion of tied aid. (ii) Need commitment to use local suppliers and consultancy fi rms wherever possible. Increased decentralisation of donor operations is seen as desirable \u2013 undecentralised donors tend to favour using their own country\u2019s services and systems. Round Table 3: Harmonisation: rationalising aid delivery, complementarity, division of labour (i) Harmonisation means implementing common procedures in various aspects of development activity like planning, funding, disbursing, moni- toring, evaluating & reporting. It also means overcoming excessive fragmentation of aid at various levels to increase complementarity and to decrease the transaction costs of delivering aid through more effective division of labour. (ii) Harmonisation can be in the context of policy, systems, or process. It could also be between donor and government or among donors. (iii) Donors are interested to harmonize but are not keen to be led by others \u2013 suggestion is to start with like-minded donors. 17 East & South-East Asia: Outcomes (iv) Increased use of Program Based Approaches (PBA) modalities can foster harmonization. (v) Harmonisation needs to be balanced between donors and partner countries. (vi) Harmonisation should not undermine the diversity of aid available for partner countries. (vii) UN initiatives towards harmonisation in Viet Nam include the use of same policies and procedures for all its organisations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b8e64816-52a6-4fe9-a3a3-ea83635bb82c": {"__data__": {"id_": "b8e64816-52a6-4fe9-a3a3-ea83635bb82c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/east-south-east-asia-outcomes-consultations-high-level-forum-aid-effectiveness", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "East & South-East Asia Outcomes: Consultations on the High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/east-south-east-asia-outcomes-consultations-high-level-forum-aid-effectiveness", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "79cf2f4c00734d18b932bc673e4f9b0f558e8bd5146929430d88afd112e89c43"}, "2": {"node_id": "26553ef2-4594-4ce6-b4bf-c316ce290e71", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/east-south-east-asia-outcomes-consultations-high-level-forum-aid-effectiveness", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "20b4c4d685e930cc1b604b34c9c3320e5a19cd81511e726d89f2b020819f5607"}}, "hash": "3670fa211485a8d855ff2926be1c6abf68a0951470fec13365e876a82fcf816b", "text": "Division of labour and complementarity (i) Division of labour can help tackle fragmenta- tion and misallocation of resources.

In this way comple- mentarity can promote the harmonisation of the overall development effort (domestic and donor- aided). (iv) The approach to harmonisation needs to pay attention to diverse actors in changing aid environment. (v) Inequality in government-donor relations can make it diffi cult for Government to determine comparative advantage of donors, which is a pre- requisite in bringing about an effi cient division of labour. (vi) Country experiences, such as that from Cambodia, show that even today some sectors are over-funded, while others remain under-funded \u2013 and that faster progress on complementarity and division of labour is urgently needed. (vii) In-country division of labour is the fi rst prior- ity, rather than division of labour among donors across countries, i.e. bring about harmonisation among donors as they operate within a particular country. (viii) National development strategies and sector matrices would be useful in pushing forward the division of labour agenda. (ix) Donor harmonisation requires government involvement \u2013 harmonization is a function of ownership and leadership by government (bal- ance between host country and donors) and this hinges on adequate country capacity. (x) Lao PDR\u2019s experience is relevant, where the government has designed development agenda with support from donors. While the strategy refl ects country priorities, it also has donor fl avour and hence has wider acceptability. A key to this process is to work with like minded donors whose perceptions are more closely aligned to that of the partner country. (xi) Cross-country division of labour will need to begin with the development partners. Round Table 4: Managing for Results and Development Impact Managing for Development Results as a country system (i) It was agreed that the results-based decision making process is as applicable to external aid as it is to the management of domestic resources. (ii) The sub-region is home to a large number of MfDR good practices. These include the introduc- tion of change management processes from 1998 to 2004 by the Philippines, which has resulted in the use of log frames in all agency budgets through the \u2018organizational performance integrated frame- work\u2019 (OPIF); secondly, Viet Nam\u2019s introduction of a monitoring and evaluation system in the Ministry of Finance; and Cambodia\u2019s example of setting up of common data systems used both by donors and the national monitoring systems. 18 Consultations on the High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness | Bangkok, 21\u201322 April 2008 (iii) However, the demand for results has to be articulated at the highest political level, and there is need to make the national budget process results oriented. (iv) Strong leadership and ownership at the highest political levels is also required to ensure sustainability of the system. (v) Country capacities to assess development outcomes need to be built in if the partner gov- ernments are to be more results-oriented. (vi) In results management, capacity develop- ment and sustainability are key. A good practice example of peer-to-peer learning (for example between Afghanistan and Malaysia) is through the Community of Practice initiative supported by the Asian Development Bank. Incentives for increased aid effectiveness in donor agencies (i) Partner countries questioned whether the whole aid effectiveness agenda had become too technocratic, and if the donors were losing sight of the actual development outcomes; according to them: \u201cPoverty is the real issue!\u201d. And attribu- tion to achievement of development results is a complex issue. (ii) The Paris Declaration has paid little attention to the institutionalisation and sustainability of public service provision. Are the political leaders conscious that the provision of basic services such as health and education are so dependent on the donors? (iii) Decentralisation may require a careful re- examination of how ownership is fostered and the concepts of development results applied. (iv) Donors and partners need to identify incen- tives that can strengthen a results culture. (v) Participants fl agged the importance of devel- oping capacity to deliver services to people and not simply improving resource and planning capacities; and secondly to prmote joint capacity assessments for MfDRs.

More effort was focused on creating capacities in the \u201chard\u201d areas (eg, establishing a sector working group architec- ture or ODA database), without creating suffi cient corresponding \u201csoft\u201d and human resource capaci- ties without which systems deliver few tangible benefi ts. Willingness was sought to fund capacity assessments and implement country led capac- ity development strategies (not ad hoc technical assistance). (v) An imbalance of commitments between donors and partner countries was fl agged, and 19 East & South-East Asia: Outcomes it was considered ironic that only indicator in the Paris Declaration on mutual accountability (Indicator 12) refers to an obligation upon partner countries only. (vi) There seemed to a consensus among part- ner countries that all the identifi ed cross-cutting issues were important. (vii) The issue of inclusion of Non-DAC donors in the debate was considered important. (viii) Countries in the sub-region shared a range of good practice examples: Philippines has a long tradition of joint portfolio reviews with the donors, long predating the Paris Declaration. Viet Nam\u2019s example of Independent Monitoring reports, and Afghanistan\u2019s example of requiring all UN agencies to prepare business plans (in 2004), and assess synergies with the national development plans, were seen as strengthening country ownership and mutual accountability. Partner countries noted diffi culties in obtaining reliable and comprehen- sive data from donors on their full ODA portfolio (including aid to NGOs). Countries recommended that some donors invest in improving their own tracking systems to facilitate their reporting to country aid information management systems and comply with the aid effectiveness survey requirements. (ix) Paragraph 48 of the Paris Declaration says partner countries should strengthen the role of parliaments, but greater clarity is required on the role of the parliaments. (x) It is important to recognize the diversity within the Asia-Pacifi c region, and there is need to explore the possibility of sharing good practices within the region. (xi) Partner countries need to take a much more active role on the issues of mutual accountability. Some donors suggested that partner Governments should not be \u201ctimid\u201d about leading the process and recommended that Governments need to tell the donors to live up to their commitments. Round Table 6: The Role of Civil Society in Advancing Aid Effectiveness RT 6 at Accra will focus on: \u2022 Why does it matter to bring CSOs to Accra? \u2022 What recommendations are needed to promote CSO effectiveness as actors in development? Do the principles of the Paris Declaration deal with this? How to take the agenda forward after Accra? \u2022 (i) Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) have a unique and important role to play in aid effectiveness. (ii) The civil society dimension touches many of the Round Table topics, in particular Round Table 5 (Mutual Accountability) and Round Table 8 (Aid Effectiveness in Fragile States and Confl ict Situations). (iii) There is great diversity among CSOs so the defi nition of CSOs is not clear. CSOs can be as development actors, donors, recipients and/or partners. (iv) The principles of the Paris Declaration need to be translated or adapted to CSO context. (v) Despite this diversity, there is broad agree- ment on cross-cutting\u2019 issues (human rights, gender and climate change) for civil society as they are at the core of CSOs mandates. (vi) CSOs can bring new perspectives to the fi ve principles of the Paris Declaration and provide additional solutions, both as direct development actors and as agents of accountability to other development actors.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8e4ec4b-d41f-4399-9cc0-268dada4896a": {"__data__": {"id_": "f8e4ec4b-d41f-4399-9cc0-268dada4896a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/east-south-east-asia-outcomes-consultations-high-level-forum-aid-effectiveness", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "East & South-East Asia Outcomes: Consultations on the High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/east-south-east-asia-outcomes-consultations-high-level-forum-aid-effectiveness", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8b5e1f2e317cf328a442a8f3bfe9840509ef475dd6b01116866cc59f700a7217"}, "2": {"node_id": "22cffbfb-43f0-44a8-819a-f5baef1a2aec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/east-south-east-asia-outcomes-consultations-high-level-forum-aid-effectiveness", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "44b6039f8ca5256b011066f688afe9a8d7aa1e86f2221e8c36225b2277305f8b"}}, "hash": "98506246ce98dc70e277b304259efb2358762744a65801eb77ce56e2b4d28ab3", "text": "(vii) CSOs have a role to play in aid coordina- tion mechanisms and in accountability and can supplement existing auditing mechanisms and thus reinforce country systems.

(ix) For CSOs to play such roles well, investments in their capacities may be needed, particularly for local NGOs. International NGOs may sometimes marginalise or \u2018drown-out\u2019 local NGOs in ways which can parallel donor domination of partner country dialogue. It is important to leave space for local NGOs to participate in the development process, and in preparation up to Ghana. (x) There are issues with the mandate, demo- cratic ownership and accountability of CSOs as well as their relationship with governments allowing space to operate within an enabling environment. This links with Round Table 1 on democratic owner- ship and national leadership. Round Table 7: Aid Effectiveness in Fragile States and Confl ict Situations Strengthen state legitimacy (i) Early recovery and development interven- tions should focus on meeting basic needs, and in delivery key services well reinforce the legitimacy of the state. Efforts should be made to channel aid through governments and to allow govern- ments take credit for services delivered, thereby bolstering legitimacy. Setting out clear national programmes which donors can buy into can reduce aid fragmentation, accelerate implementation and enhance state legitimacy. (ii) Important to establish during the design phase who are the correct authorities to deal with if this is unclear. (e.g. Aceh in Indonesia after the tsunami/ earthquake.) (iii) Development partners have already devel- oped sets of principles (e.g. OECD DAC Principles for Good International Engagement in Fragile States and Situations). Donors must apply them, and be accountable against them. Act Quickly (i) Focus on a few critical issues necessary for sta- bility and state building in the short term (basic services \u2013 \u201cplanning light\u201d). In this regard, a con- sensus is necessary as to what these issues are between donors, and the authorities and citizens of the country in question. Timor-Leste\u2019s recent actions provided a good practice in this regard. (ii) Donors should respond quickly to prevent emergencies getting out of hand. (iii) Where there is a weak government that can not coordinate ODA, it is necessary to rely on UN or donor coordination. (iv) There are risks in creating \u201cfast track\u201d stand alone institutions/ministries \u2013 may be bet- ter to reinforce existing plan/budget departments (which may have fast track powers) including to manage fast-track grant/loan facilities. (v) Donor responses have often been too short term and linear. Donors should plan for short-, medium- and long-term needs from the outset \u2013 perhaps through a Capacity Development Fund? (vi) Traditional/customary practices and struc- tures often persist despite confl ict and these could be useful structures for delivery of aid and should be preserved. Other issues for Round Table (i) The Paris Declaration commitments and prin- ciples are even more relevant for fragile states or countries in confl ict situations, but donors must be pragmatic and fl exible in their responses. (ii) Staff must be appropriate to post confl ict (i.e. not the same as development environment) and not only \u2018high quality\u2019(paragraph 14). (iii) It was strongly suggested that this Round Table should cover countries experiencing ongoing confl icts (eg parts of Philippines) and prolonged situations of fragility. (iv) Several very diverse countries within the region provide case study materials for Round Table 7, 21 East & South-East Asia: Outcomes including Timor-Leste, Indonesia (Aceh), and the Philippines. Round Table 8: Sector Application of the Paris Declaration: Health, Education, and Infrastructure (i) There is a need for real commitment from donors to harmonise and to align, not just pay lip service. (ii) Programme Based Approaches (PBAs) at sector level imply increasing the level of trust between partners, and can make it easier for governments to take a comprehensive approach to development and to provide a framework against which donors can align. (iii) Ownership, alignment and mutual accountabil- ity are all crucial for PBAs to work properly. (iv) The diversity of country context needs to be taken into account.

(viii) A good practice for furthering a PBA is to start with a group of like-minded donors and move for- ward with them fi rst, and then hope that the others will join with time. (ix) In the absence of reliable country system, use adequate donor systems as transitional solutions, while simultaneously developing capacity of coun- try systems. (x) Create a focal point for reform/technical assistance which can support sector ministries in framing their demand for technical assistance, and based on this develop a national technical assistance plan, that is then used as a basis for negotiating support from donors in a demand- driven fashion. (xi) Joint reform efforts need to focus on build- ing the capacity of other actors, not only build administrative capacity among government offi - cials It requires looking holistically at constraints to development in the sector, and a combination of training, research, experts and institutional building. (xii) To be successful developing a sector pro- gramme the strategy must be discussed with involvement of local communities, which requires a considerable time commitment. (xiii) Donors are expected to adapt to, and to be led by, the partner country. It is a question of pride to donors that they want to be the innovators and leaders themselves, but this undermines the capacity and ownership of the partner country. (xiv) Ownership requires knowledge and human capacity. The role of external consultants is to transfer knowledge and skills, but to do so with- out \u2018taking over\u2019. (xv) The Programme Based Approach is still seen too much as a fi nancing modality, and in some cases a donor-led exercise. For instance some participants talked to donor/fi nancier-led area based programmes or trust funds, rather than Government-led programmes.

Increasing corporate social responsibility is also channelling funds, though that is mainly within the private sector. (ii) These present new challenges of managing aid and further heighten the issues of harmonisation, complementarity and division of labour. (iii) There is a need to make all forms of aid effec- tive, be this traditional or new aid. (iv) One factor that became clear, which will be incorporated in further RT discussions is that, partner countries must have clear strategies within which all donors must operate, with ade- quate capacity. The onus is on the partner country to provide leadership. Governments are fi rst and foremost accountable to their own people and may therefore have to be blunt with donors. (v) It is important to use donor coordinating mechanisms (led by government) to ensure com- plementarity of aid. Must identify comparative advantage based on understanding of issues on the ground. The World Bank and ADB could work more together. (vi) Non-DAC donors: recognition of the value of south-south cooperation and \u201ctriangular\u201d coop- eration, which is regarded as less donor-driven than other forms of aid, more in tune with cultural sensitivities. (vii) Vertical funds/programs: Global Funds and all donors need to fi t in with and respect local priorities and processes. Many are trying to imple- ment the Paris Declaration. They work when local strategies are clear. However, (i) they are still not adequately refl ected in national budgets; (ii) sal- ary supplements can create distortions; (iii) Use of parallel systems can undermine sustainability of results.

UN MDGs represent a global common minimum programme for sustainable human security and well-being. It is now clear that ICTs can help to empower rural women and men in areas of importance in their day-to-day life such as health, education, agriculture, weather and, above all, markets. The work done by a wide range of institutions during the last 10 years in different parts of India has shown that ICTs can help us to leapfrog in the areas of knowledge and skill empowerment of the rural poor. The poor are poor only because they have no assets like land, livestock or productive employment. They are often illiterate. There is need for a paradigm shift from unskilled to skilled work if the poor are to come out of the poverty trap. This is where ICTs can help to impart speedy functional and adult literacy and market driven skills. It can also help the rural poor with knowledge about their entitlements. Yet, as promising as these examples are, they risk being overwhelmed by the massive scale of India\u2019s poverty, so that, on the other hand, no matter how well our individual efforts perform, either in the cyber cities or the rural telecentres, their results are almost undetectable from a wider perspective that encompasses all of our more than one billion citizens. This is the challenge we face in Mission 2007. The Mission for achieving a knowledge revolution in India derives strength and confidence from the numerous outstanding initiatives underway in the country under the sponsorship of central and state governments, civil society organizations, academia and the corporate sector. The visionary Bharat Nirman or New for Rural India programme includes knowledge connectivity. In Mission 2007, we have stated that what is now needed is the launching of a self-propelling, self-replicating and self-sustaining model of ICT for rural regeneration and prosperity. This can be achieved in a short time and at a low transaction cost by the functional fusion of the large number of programmes in progress at the micro-level. Such a fusion of objectives, strategies and programmes can be achieved only by creating a platform for partnership. This is what the National Alliance for Mission 2007 provides. Against this background, this study of the ICT4D efforts in India makes a valuable contribution. To be successful in our goal, we must all understand the sometimes problematic issue of how ICTs can be used to change the lives of the poorest of the poor. What must be done to ensure that ICTs fulfil their promise to change the lives of the large number of Indians caught in the poverty trap? How can ICTs be used to increase literacy rates, education, employment and healthcare on a nationwide scale, thereby empowering the poor with the basic necessities of life for achieving the fullness of their human capacity in the new millennium? These are some of the questions this study tries to answer by analysing 18 ICT4D case studies from India and considering the circumstances necessary for them to scale-up to even wider audiences. The study it is not limited to an illustration of the projects. As a research enquiry, it sought direct evidence through surveys of the poor users of the projects as well as from the project staff. It goes Foreword xii Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction beyond descriptives to examine the success factors and contextual circumstances of each project. In our field, there is a paucity of such robust research from which the necessary new knowledge can be generated and the results of this study provide the beginnings of an evidence-based approach to poverty reduction with ICTs. To some extent, the results confirm what many of us working in this area intuitively believed \u2013 that real change is a product of changes in human behaviour. But as we proceed with Mission 2007, there is a pressing need to make this clear to the non-experts; the government, civil society and corporate sector organizations participating in Mission 2007; and the one-million members of the Jamsetji Tata National Virtual Academy", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "797e522e-b318-4c86-a431-43b3e3946087": {"__data__": {"id_": "797e522e-b318-4c86-a431-43b3e3946087", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Empowering the Poor", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "77b2ffcf0294242d9e4547042a29c4ecffc4fc4c43a88b1076366f640f9f03f3"}}, "hash": "77b2ffcf0294242d9e4547042a29c4ecffc4fc4c43a88b1076366f640f9f03f3", "text": "for Rural Prosperity who will serve as the torchbearers of the knowledge revolution in rural India.

PROF M S SWAMINATHAN Chairman, National Commission on Farmers, Government of India President, Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs Chairman, M S Swaminathan Research Foundation Empowering The Poor xiii A Study of Rural Development Projects in India Preface This report sets out to examine the application of large-scale approaches to the use of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) for electronic governance and poverty reduction. The study that is reported began with the premise that ICTs are effective tools in the fight against poverty, when used appropriately, so we do not further argue that proposition. We pose the question, if ICTs can be used to reduce poverty, why in India are they not being used more extensively to do so? The study examined 18 development projects in India that make use of ICTs in the form of community telecentres for the benefit of the poor. The objective was to evaluate them along key constructs relating to their potential for scaling up; these were Project Design, Community Participation, Project Outcomes, and their contextual Political Economy. Questionnaires were completed by 2,156 users of the telecentres and interviews were conducted with project stakeholders and personnel. A typical survey respondent was a 30-something, male farm worker, with some schooling, representing a socially-marginalized community and earning close to US$ 2 per day. The study sought to understand the factors that influence how and why the projects might or might not scale up into widespread implementations once they had established themselves as being capable of delivering beneficial outcomes in a sustainable manner. It was recognized that even when individual implementations generate useful and unambiguous benefits, external factors such as political will, social awareness, business imperatives and the availability of resources will affect the rate at which ICTs are made available to wider audiences of poor rural populations, Nevertheless, it has emerged from the study that projects with promise have the ability to influence these external factors but at the same time they are not dependent on these factors being in their favour. However, the pre-condition for scaling up is to have a successful project, and the key component of that success in terms of scaling it up appears, from the study, to be the extent to which the recipient community accepts the project within its day- to-day life. Furthermore, it has emerged that the most effective way of achieving community acceptance lies in the quality of the staff at the centres with whom the community interacts. Several projects have failed to understand the importance of cultivating close relationships with their beneficiary community, either by employing inappropriate staff within telecentres or by failing to supply incentives for those staff to ensure that they are sensitive to the needs of the community. As a result, the quality of the services of these projects has suffered. Moreover, although the political and social environments within which the projects operated were mostly less than ideal, projects depicted higher levels of community acceptance where they were better. Other project characteristics generated more desirable outcomes: G projects that were formed within public-private partnerships, where the telecentre operator had a financial incentive to succeed, possibly under a franchise arrangement; G centres that delivered a wider range of integrated useful services, including e-government, agricultural support, education, trade facilitation, health and entertainment; G projects that participated closely with their beneficiary communities, in a bottom-up mode of design; xiv Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction G projects that targeted low cost technology; and G projects that engaged in capacity building at all levels of stakeholder engagement, from institutional to local. The implications for practice are that whilst useful information services are a prerequisite for successfully operating ICT implementations in the form of community telecentres, in themselves they are insufficient.

In many projects it is left to chance; a low priority task sometimes assumed to be within the capabilities of local volunteers, even schoolchildren. Yet our evidence suggests a far higher priority for the selection, training, support and development of such personnel if it is intended that the project would eventually be scaled into a wider implementation. Technologies and the information they deliver are key ingredients, but telecentres act as conduits for community development and their social role in terms of fostering productive relationships with poor people appears to be at least as important as their substantive role of delivering information services. Scaling rural ICT projects for poverty reduction, then, depends on the project providing useful services, but it also depends on doing it with effective staff that can achieve high levels of community acceptance. Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 1 Empowering The Poor OVERVIEW AND INTRODUCTION Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 2 A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 3 Empowering the Poor Overview: People before Technology It is evident that, in rural India, Information and Communications Technology for Development (ICT4D) projects are well received by their users, who value the benefits the projects bring. They accept these projects as part of their lives. Yet not all the supposed benefits of ICT4D, or the conditions that foster them, matched with either expectations or with what is often claimed to be the purpose for making ICTs available to poor people. According to the study, the users of the centres seem to express that while they are satisfied with the benefits the projects bring, they do not feel fully empowered by receiving them. At the same time, they do not seem to feel that they have much influence on the operations of the centres. The findings from the data correspond with the observations of many of the individual projects by emphasizing the importance of understanding the needs of recipient communities. A further consideration is the extent to which the benefits of the projects are evenly distributed among the members of communities. Three-fourths of our survey respondents were male. As a group, the respondents seemed not to believe that benefits were evenly spread. Generally, there was low impact on the factors that are supposed to lead to some form of social appropriation of the technology; a highly desirable condition whereby users of technology take over its control from the original implementers and design new and unforeseen uses for it. While conducting the study, we did not see this taking place. The expectations of the project users were not well managed. They did not feel that their use of the centres encouraged them to adopt any form of leadership in using the technology. Their technology awareness remained rather low and they did not feel as though the projects were empowering them beyond the immediate benefits. Paradoxically, the overall rating by the users of the quality of service from the centres was also rather low, even though they appreciated the benefits of using them. We speculate that the rural poor appreciate all attempts to improve their lives whilst simultaneously recognizing that more could be done. The capability of project staff varies considerably across the projects. Yet this seems to be an important determinant of the degree to which users accept the project as part of their community. Designing projects around communities is clearly a winning strategy, and deploying staff which is capable of fostering productive relationships with clients also strengthens project operations. Whilst not in themselves leading to high probabilities that projects will scale up, it seems that these factors have a strong chance of positively influencing the factors that do lead to scaling projects up. The social and political environments within which the projects operated were not always seen to be conducive to their operation. Many verbal accounts recount the frustrations over red tape and entrenched interests, and it is a tribute to the tenacity of many of the project protagonists that useful results actually emerged. Some projects exhibit positive indicators for their financial sustainability, especially those that involve the private sector. Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) show the most promise for delivering reliable and desirable public services in a financially sustainable manner. Whilst the design of the projects has enabled them in some cases to achieve high levels of staff capability and associated Information and Communications", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2019fb1d-d473-40bd-90fc-309767d311a2": {"__data__": {"id_": "2019fb1d-d473-40bd-90fc-309767d311a2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Empowering the Poor", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8e77d91bd3d60dc7f8b0f66bbaecd2b2b4acb791779f4e75a971ebdc187594d3"}, "3": {"node_id": "6cbcb402-9ce1-4978-a5eb-5a933e142dbd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "de5d298c53c769c1e30e9535783643968d6c6e7644508aba4c27f58682e84ba9"}}, "hash": "1e9680a17905c96c4f791a73fab336a1286bba48d94cd4bbaebd268828501e53", "text": "Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 4 community acceptance, the quality of service delivery still shows room for improvement. Generally, community participation seems rather low yet community acceptance is high where benefits are evident. The projects do not appear to have engaged with their user communities as closely as they could have, suggesting the possibility of improvements even where results are already desirable. The projects included in the study are as follows: Projects and Brief Descriptions 1. Akshaya \u2013 Mallappuram, Kerala In 2001, a joint project between local bodies (gram panchayats) in rural areas, municipalities in urban areas and private entrepreneurs in Mallappuram district of Kerala was started to bridge the digital divide by providing community access to computers and the Internet. Five hundred and sixty-five Community Technology Centres (CTCs) have been implemented in the district. Akshaya operates PPPs in establishing the CTC in remote villages. 2. Anand Milk Collection Centres \u2013 Anand, Gujarat The Anand Milk Union Limited (AMUL) with more than 578,000 members was the first cooperative dairy to be established in Gujarat. It was established in 1956, and now AMUL collects 0.8 million litres of milk from 1,003 milk societies every day. AMUL introduced an electronic automatic milk collection system in 691 milk collection centres, which reduced the time required for collecting the milk. The system weighs the milk and measures its fat content at the time of delivery to the centre, and this has enabled immediate payments to the farmer, thereby eliminating the previously opaque procedures that often left the farmer short-changed and with little recourse for query. The project has been selected for the study because the technology tool has affected a huge population of women dairy farmers socially as well as economically. 3. Bhoomi \u2013 Bangalore, Karnataka The Department of Revenue, Government of Karnataka, has computerized 20 million land ownership records of 6.7 million farmers in the state. Each record is available online from 177 taluka kiosks at a cost of Rs 15 per record. The project has been widely acclaimed as possibly the most successful ICT project for land records in the country. 4. Computer-Aided Administration of Registration Department (CARD) \u2013 Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh In this project, 214 registration offices have been computerized since 1998. This project provides services such as encumbrance certificates, valuation certificates, market value search, etc., on user- charge bases. The time taken for registration of documents has been reduced from one day to 15 minutes. More than 4 million documents have been registered, and 2.16 million encumbrance certificates and 3.73 million registration check slips have been issued since 1999. A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 5 Empowering the Poor 5. Community Information Centres \u2013 Gantok, Sikkim This project was started by the Department of Information Technology, Government of India with the technical support of the National Informatics Centre (NIC). This pilot started in 30 blocks of seven North Eastern states in 2001. Presently, all 487 blocks in 79 districts of the states, including Sikkim, are provided with one telecentre each. The kiosks provide e-governance, e-health, e-education and e-business opportunities. 6. e-Choupal \u2013 Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh This web-based initiative of Indian Tobacco Company\u2019s international Business Division in Central India caters to soya growers for information, products and services required in soya farming. The kiosks facilitate the supply of high quality farm inputs and purchases of soya at the doorsteps of the villagers. This project was started in 42 villages of Ujjain district and around 1,800 kiosks in Madhya Pradesh and has around 3,300 kiosks in Central India. The kiosks also handle dealerships of various commodities like Hero cycles and Eicher tractors. This feature has provided extra benefits to the villagers in terms of minimizing their cost on travel expense. 7. e-Seva \u2013 Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh The project was started as a pilot in the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad, and was thus called TWINS (Twin Cities Integrated Network Systems). It was started at the cost of Rs 10 million, fully funded by the Government of Andhra Pradesh. The project provides registration of birth and death certificates, and vehicles and learners\u2019 driving licenses. 8.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6cbcb402-9ce1-4978-a5eb-5a933e142dbd": {"__data__": {"id_": "6cbcb402-9ce1-4978-a5eb-5a933e142dbd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Empowering the Poor", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8e77d91bd3d60dc7f8b0f66bbaecd2b2b4acb791779f4e75a971ebdc187594d3"}, "2": {"node_id": "2019fb1d-d473-40bd-90fc-309767d311a2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1e9680a17905c96c4f791a73fab336a1286bba48d94cd4bbaebd268828501e53"}}, "hash": "de5d298c53c769c1e30e9535783643968d6c6e7644508aba4c27f58682e84ba9", "text": "8.

BENCHMARKING: POLITICAL ECONOMY Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 10 The graphs are self explanatory. Figure 5 shows that the overall results of the projects vary only within a limited range. Of a total of 80 standardized marks, all projects have been able to score nearly 50 percent or more. This means that users have evaluated all projects to be moderately successful though their rates vary slightly. Even regional projects, confined to certain areas, are rated comparably to national level projects. In Figure 6 the projects are depicted with their scores in the survey for each variable. In Table 1 they are shown with their rankings for each variable. Those ranking the highest for each variable are highlighted. Janmitra and VISP emerge as projects that rank the highest most often in the scoring for our variables, but 10 of the 18 projects rank the highest on at least one score. Of the eight that do not rank highest on any score, six rank second on at least one score and the other two rank third on at least one score. Some projects do not attain the highest ranking for any variable. It is necessary to look at these rankings and scores in various ways in order to understand the overall picture. It appears that the projects we have studied display a wide range of characteristics that are required for desirable outcomes, yet none display them all and most display only one or two. The importance of the role of the project staff, those who interface with users, has been highlighted and our observations are that staff-user relationships are better in projects whose centres are operated by profit\u2013motivated individuals. In most cases in the study, this has been achieved through some sort of franchise arrangement between government and local entrepreneurs, possibly with the support of a microcredit scheme, or some other from of early assistance, perhaps subsidized equipment. Accordingly, the PPP mode of institutional arrangements is indicated as desirable. FIGURE 5. BENCHMARKING: TOTAL A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 11 Empowering the Poor FIGURE 6.

Projects ranked by variable Staff capability Leadership development A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 13 Empowering the Poor In all cases, project outcomes appear to be preferable when they are based on a close understanding of the communities\u2019 needs, probably based on some sort of participatory appraisal of what the community would welcome from the project. The range of information services that all our projects deliver is also revealing, in that it provides a number of alternatives and opportunities on which to base rural ICT programmes. The projects in our study that did best provided an integrated but varied range of information services, including e-government, education, agricultural information, trade, health, and entertainment. In conjunction with general communications, these seem to have emerged as the primary areas of interest for rural populations where ICTs have something to offer. Projects that begin life by focusing on a sub-set of these services have the potential, therefore, for building their sustainability by expanding into other areas. From a practical standpoint, it is probably more feasible to establish services slowly, especially as projects begin, than to attempt to do everything at once, which risks spreading resources too thinly and delivering sub-optimal outcomes as a result. Nevertheless, a wide range of useful services should remain the long-term objective for rural ICT projects that aspire to longevity. Another desirable characteristic that does not appear in many projects is the determination to restrict technology to low-cost devices that are the minimum requirement to do a good job. With the right information services, and the correct approach to delivering them to communities, a single simple device with basic connectivity can achieve a great deal, and it is not helpful to over- specify technology, even though resources may be available at the time of inception. Finally, all projects benefit from capacity building, at local operator and community levels as well as at the institutional level, where services are designed and programmed. There is much evidence of background champions backing many projects, and whilst their drive and enthusiasm is a key ingredient to getting started, scaling up to wider implementations cannot depend on it. Awareness raising and capacity building are essential to harness human resources towards replications and the achievement of suitable standards of service delivery, community interaction, equipment maintenance and outcome evaluation. Table 2 summarizes individual conclusions for each project. General comments are as follows: G Most projects have achieved moderate to high levels of usage, community acceptance and user satisfaction through targeting specific application and information provision areas, such as milk trading, e-government, agricultural market prices, etc. G Users of the centre value the e-government applications most, followed closely by information on: G prices G farming practices G business contacts G The level of usefulness of the centres and the extent to which they have been able to achieve community acceptance both affect their sustainability. G User satisfaction with the centres\u2019 services is closely associated with the capability of the staff at the centres and this in turn affects the degree of community acceptance that the centres enjoy.

A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 17 Empowering the Poor Poverty in India By many measures, the problem of poverty is no more severe anywhere else than it is in India, which still has the world\u2019s largest number of poor people in a single country. Thirty five percent of its billion plus population lives on less than US$ 1 per day and around 86 percent of Indians, more than 900 million people, manage to survive on incomes of less than US$ 2 a day.1 Although the much-heralded economic reforms of recent years have led to impressive levels of economic prosperity and the creation of a middle class, the distribution of wealth in India continues to be highly uneven. Furthermore, despite reductions in India\u2019s poverty level during the 1970s and 1980s, when farmers prospered, poverty reduction efforts stagnated during the 1990s, along with declines in agricultural growth, a slowing of growth in agricultural incomes and price rises of basic food staples. The causes of these setbacks, according to the World Bank, lie in the nation\u2019s fiscal crisis, which reduced the ability of the government to underwrite technological change for agriculture and development of the non-farm economy, and in over-regulation of agriculture, forestry products, agro-industry, and the non-farm economy, which benefits neither farmers nor the poor.2 Others point to high rates of illiteracy, enduring social exclusion, population growth rates that exceed economic growth, and protectionist policies that inhibited foreign investment. Poverty reduction in India will clearly remain a very long-term goal. Yet India\u2019s poverty statistics reveal a paradox: its huge population, estimated at 1.05 billion in 2003, along with that of China, at 1.29 billion, means that when these two countries achieve reductions in poverty, which they have done since 1990, it seems that the global goal of halving poverty by 2015 from its 1990 levels, expressed in the internationally agreed and ambitious Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), may soon be reached.3 A relatively modest reduction in the proportion of poor people in these countries registers as a huge reduction globally. Consequently, the scale of poverty in India (and in China) makes it possible to use the numbers simultaneously to commend as well as criticize the progress that has been made.4 This also means that, although poverty levels have fallen, with growing income disparities that exist, many rural Indians feel they have become worse off. In fact, India\u2019s urban residents were twice as rich as their rural counterparts in the 1970s, but they are now eight times as rich, prompting one observer to note that poverty is now a case of relative deprivation.5 Additionally, pervasive as poverty is in India, it is becoming more concentrated in the country\u2019s lagging states, its rural areas and among its disadvantaged people. As of the time of the study, more than half of India\u2019s poor lived in four states of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Uttar Pradesh, with more than two-thirds in rural areas, where the poverty incidence is highest amongst agricultural workers, many of them small-scale farmers or casual labourers. People of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, who together make up around 24 percent of the total population of India, or 252 million people, are far more likely to be poor than those of other social groups, because low status and gender barriers still operate as social obstacles that exclude them from opportunity.6 Introduction Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 18 Poverty is a multi-dimensional phenomenon. Income poverty is central but it is just one aspect. There are also other aspects such as powerlessness, lack of voice, vulnerability and fear (especially for women) as well as the deprivation of basic capabilities and the lack of access to education, health, natural resources, employment, land and credit, political participation, services and infrastructure.7 Solutions to these conditions imply a level of social restructuring that goes far beyond economic opportunities and increases in incomes. Governments and international agencies seem to agree that poverty reduction and sustainable development require a wide range of mechanisms including: sound macroeconomic policies; open trade relations; increases in human and physical capital; good governance; sound legal, incentives and regulatory frameworks; an adequately regulated and supervised financial sector; health, education and social services that reach the poor, women and girls effectively; quality infrastructure and public services to promote rural development and liveable cities; and policies to promote environmental and human sustainability.

The ICT Political Landscape A spate of reforms since 1991 has given impetus to the Indian economy, particularly to the ICT sector. As part of the reform agenda, the Indian Government has taken significant steps to promote ICTs, including the creation in 1988 of a World Market Policy, with a focus on software development for export; telecommunications policy reform; privatization of the national long-distance and mobile phone markets; and development of a more comprehensive approach to ICTs. Although India's success is commanding increasing attention and investment, it has yet to result in the distribution of social and economic benefits across a broader base of the population. Challenges remain, including the perception of an unfavourable regulatory climate, an overloaded judicial system, poor infrastructure, costly access, and resulting limited use of ICTs. However, the emerging shift in government strategy, toward knowledge-intensive services, has created a climate more conducive to addressing enterprise, domestic infrastructure, education and the use of ICTs to meet development needs. According to a Gartner estimate, India spent US$ 1.008 billion on Information Technology (IT) in 2002, making it the fourth largest vertical spender on IT after telecom, manufacturing and banking, and finance industriesi. This compares favourably with other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, where the total spending on IT was around US$ 15.2 billion. The government accounted for 9 percent of the total IT expenditure in India for 2002. This figure is expected to increase to 15 percent by 2007. That establishes India as a serious force within the Asia-Pacific region. According to Gartner, it is the only recession-proof vertical sector that could keep up the momentum in IT spending despite a downturn in the country\u2019s economy. i \u201cGartner estimate rates India as the fourth largest IT spender\u201d .

See http://www.infochangeindia.org/archives1.jsp?secno=9&monthname=September&year=2003&detail=T A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 19 Empowering the Poor Although e-governance is only five years old in India, a dozen states already have an IT policy in place. The 10th Five-Year Plan, which highlights the role of IT as an interface between the government and the public, has given IT a fillip, say experts. Areas in which it is increasingly being used include the maintenance of land and treasury records, various departments of the police, the irrigation department and the courts. The states that are taking ICTs seriously include Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, West Bengal, Haryana and Goa. Where less expensive solutions, based on the Linux operating system, are available these have been adopted in states such as Maharashtra, Goa and Madhya Pradesh. Additionally, Indian Railways, at the central level, is taking greater interest. India\u2019s ICT Industry Against the background of appalling poverty in India, we can juxtapose the country\u2019s more recent phenomenal success in the global ICT industry, with its software exports contributing upwards of 7 percent of GNP growth in 2000. Between 1991 and 2003, India\u2019s ICT industry grew at an annual rate of nearly 37 percent, doubling every 2.2 years.9 The country's National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM) estimated the value of India\u2019s 2003-04 software and services market at a staggering US$ 20.3 billion, with exports making up close to 60 percent.10 Figure 7 demonstrates how India\u2019s software exports have grown during the 1990s and early 2000s.11 FIGURE 7. INDIA\u2019S SOFTWARE EXPORTS The Prime Minister\u2019s National Task Force on Information Technology and Software Development advocated in 1999 that the software and hardware industries were two sides of the gold coin representing India\u2019s emergence as a global IT super power.12 Indeed, the impact of India\u2019s prowess with ICTs on Indian society has been considerable.

Although the National Task Force envisaged a variety of services to be delivered to citizens in rural areas through a network of privately operated service delivery points, its priorities were clearly focused on the further development of India\u2019s ICT industry as an export earner. But the improvements that emerged as a result have been accompanied by a marked growth in income disparity.13 This has not passed unnoticed by the country\u2019s electorate. The World Bank has claimed that \u201cIndia is a leader in the Information Technology revolution, and states such as Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka are making impressive gains in applying Information Technology solutions to a variety of public sector problems.\u201d14 These two states are ranked as leaders on the Government of India\u2019s e-readiness scale along with Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra.15 The spate of suicides by destitute and debt-ridden farmers in Andhra Pradesh, numbering around 3,000 in some reports, is a stark testimony to the desperation of the poor India\u2019s New Challenge on Technology Policy It is significant that two south Indian states threw out ruling parties of differing political complexions in the 2004 elections. Andhra Pradesh, with its capital Hyderabad, and Karnataka, with Bangalore, are vying to become global IT powers. In doing so, however, both have become excessively focused on IT development, ignoring the conventional rural development that should have gone along in parallel. The outcome has important lessons for other developing countries. For it is a reminder that although technological innovation is a necessary condition for social and economic progress, it is not a sufficient condition. Equally important are accompanying policies to ensure that the benefits of successful innovation are widely shared and experienced. There is growing resentment among those being asked to help share the costs of participation in such an economy, yet at the same time are excluded from its benefits. In issues that range from the application of intellectual property rights to the integration of biodiversity concerns with development strategies, there is growing evidence that solutions designed by the North are not always applicable in the South \u2013 and that alternative approaches are needed. If India can now explore and develop some of these alternatives, ensuring firstly that they are based on a thorough comprehension of the underlying science, and secondly that they are capable of meeting the basic needs of the country\u2019s rural poor, it will have made a substantial contribution to the whole development community. Conversely, there is a strong case for reviewing the future direction of IT policies in India, ensuring that these effectively complement and support rural development and poverty-reduction strategies, and not substitute for them. SciDevNet, 18 May 2004 http://www.scidev.net/Editorials/index.cfm?fuseaction=readEditorials&itemid=115&language=1 A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 21 Empowering the Poor and the urgency of effective measures to relieve their suffering.16 Clearly, in India as well as elsewhere, governments neglect the rural poor at their peril, representing as they do, in most cases, the majority of the population. Rural neglect and its consequences in terms of enduring and debilitating levels of poverty can be identified everywhere as the root cause of social disaffection, electoral upsets and ultimately of armed conflict and rebellion. ICTs and Poverty While India\u2019s poverty is deepening and its ICT industry booming, there are many experiments underway with the direct application of ICTs for poverty reduction. IT For Change, a non-profit network located in India, lists more than 50 such projects, some with hundreds of rural technology centres providing services to the public, including poor rural communities.17 Some of these projects involve significant resources and have demonstrated their ability to deliver desirable social, economic and government services to rural populations. At a workshop held at the Indian Institute of Management-Ahmedabad (IIM-A), on 26-27 February 2004, representatives of the more significant of these projects agreed that there were major challenges in scaling up the use of ICTs in rural areas. They concluded that since most of the projects had not been subject to any serious evaluation, it was difficult to assess why they could not be scaled up. There was no clear mechanism for scaling them up and there needs to be a formalized method for learning from them.18 Other Asian governments, encouraged by international aid agencies and mindful of what is becoming possible through their understanding of the activities of the pioneering projects in India, are implementing their own pilots in order to learn how they might emulate the Indian experiences and apply ICTs to their own poverty alleviation efforts. Yet the projects for poverty reduction with ICTs in India are not without their problems.

Modern technology often carries a halo effect in the settings in which these projects are conducted. In other cases, observers have drawn conclusions prematurely, either positively or negatively, usually by applying their own criteria rather than those of the project and its beneficiaries. In cases where failure has been declared, it is sometimes more the result of rigid forms of project conduct and management, or of unreasonable and externally imposed expectations, rather than through any inherent faults in the initiative itself. According to one observer, an analysis of the Indian experiments with ICTs for poverty reduction is a prerequisite for any effort aimed at replicating and scaling up these pioneer, pilot projects, with a view to ensuring the technology makes a difference from a human development point of view.19 Given the current political climate in India, it is timely to now examine more closely how ICTs can be applied to the massive, widespread and seemingly intractable problems of poverty, especially that they now seem to be demanding urgent attention. Whilst many of the pilot programmes have demonstrated value, they are set in contrast to the paucity of government efforts at central or state levels to replicate such endeavours on a wider scale that might be capable of making measurable inroads into the poverty problem. Even though the Government constituted a Working Group on Information Technology for Masses in May 2000, and despite the vast experience with ICTs for poverty reduction in India, the nation\u2019s 10th Five-Year Plan (2002-2007) makes scant reference to the topic. In the chapter on ICTs, there is no mention of poverty reduction, Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 22 and in the chapter on poverty reduction there is barely any mention of ICTs.20 Although, as the World Bank points out, several states are already implementing innovative reforms in the delivery of public services, often with the aid of IT, the challenge, it says, is to broaden these initiatives and to apply them across the country, including the poorer states, where the governance environment is weak.21 The Government\u2019s Working Group on Information Technology for Masses identified four categories of IT relevant applications that could be expected to have the effect of reducing poverty: electronic governance; enabling literacy and education for masses; fulfilling local information needs of the people; and enabling a better economic condition of people.22 Its report notes \u201cwhile there has been considerable progress in the use of IT in government services, most of the applications have been confined to back-office computerization. As a result, the improvement in quality of service to the public has not made sufficient impact.\u201d23 By mid-2003, the Government had announced its National IT Mission, or \u201cIT Application in Rural Development, Agriculture, Water and Panchayats (e-Rural Group)\u201d, with the slogan \u201cTaking IT benefits to ALL People\u201d and with the stated aim to \u201censure that the benefits of an IT based economy reach the masses.\u201d24 In November 2003, the e-Governance National Action Plan was approved. It was the culmination of a series of high-level announcements by the Government starting with the Prime Minister\u2019s announcement, on 15 August, 2002, that the Government was determined to use ICT to provide better services to citizens. According to Mr R. Chandrashekhar, Joint Secretary e-Governance, in the Department of Information Technology, the goal of the National e-Governance Plan is to focus on speed and accessibility, accountability, reliability and transparency in the provision of services to citizens. The National Plan actually looks at a centralized initiative; however, considering the kind of innovations, local variations and customizations that are required, implementation is totally decentralized. Twenty-two mission mode projects have been identified to be undertaken as national missions: eight areas in the central sector, nine areas in the state sector, and five projects in integrated services.25 Scaling up ICTs for Widespread Poverty Reduction This report sets out to examine the application of large-scale approaches to the use of ICTs for electronic governance and poverty reduction. This study began with the premise that ICTs are effective tools in the fight against poverty, when used appropriately, so we do not further argue that proposition. We pose the question, if ICTs can be used to reduce poverty, why in India are they not being used more extensively to do so, especially given the existence of several seemingly powerful forces that might lead anyone to suppose that they would be.

What holds back the wider rollout of ICTs for poverty reduction at the state and national levels? If India, with all its technical and human resources and with all its problems of poverty, struggles to make ICT an effective ally in the war on poverty, what chances do other developing countries, with fewer resources, have? How can the extensive learning that is available from the Indian experiences guide the nation\u2019s own future directions, as A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 23 Empowering the Poor well as those of the other countries that look to it for guidance? We will attempt to furnish answers to these questions, based on the evidence gathered during the study. Whilst the answers are unlikely to be conclusive, it is our expectation that they will contribute in some small way to the immense challenge of eliminating, once and for all, the horrendous state of India\u2019s and the world\u2019s poverty and its consequences that have blighted so many for so long. It would be untrue to claim that scaling up of existing promising initiatives that utilize ICTs for rural poverty reduction is not yet happening. e-Choupal, one of our case studies, is operated by ITC and provides farmers with ICT-based services relating to the production and selling of their produce; e.g., soya, coffee and prawns. Farmers using the services receive better prices than they did previously through traditional markets. ITC has set up 3,500 e-Choupals serving 20,000 villages ICT for Poverty Alleviation in India: Scaling up Opportunities The performance of India\u2019s ICT sector is widely held up as an example of the significant and positive effects that the ICT revolution can have for development. India\u2019s software sector is second only to the US, and global corporate organizations continue to increase the outsourcing of their software requirements to Indian companies, despite a slowdown in overall IT spending. The impressive growth of the ICT sector is considered an indicator of the possibility of a much more widespread and deeper diffusion of ICT, particularly to improve India\u2019s progress in achieving the goals set by the Millennium Declaration in areas such as literacy, education, gender equity and employment by allowing larger sections of the population to exploit or benefit from new technology. India has undertaken a large number of pilot projects \u2013144 projects according to IT for Change, Bangalore, and many more await launching. These projects, among the others, provide the blueprints for possible replication and/or scaling up, allowing for the potential that ICT holds for human development to be realized. The Government\u2019s IT Task Force has recommended that the best of these should be replicated across India, but financing issues remain to be addressed. While there are a few over-arching lessons that are being derived from these experiments, the focus of this workshop will be how to scale and replicate such projects through public-private partnerships and through the international donor community.

The projects that have already demonstrated their capability for reducing poverty as well as the ability to expand their services to wider audiences have done so for varying reasons that may be more or less applicable from place to place. The ITC e-Choupals, for instance, focus on areas where they have an interest in agricultural production. The land registration facilities of Bhoomi would not apply to urban communities. For the extent of scaling that will be required for ICTs to have a measurable impact on poverty, some form of generic or meta-service needs to be provided, one that will be widely applicable for communities with highly varying socio-economic characteristics. Whilst a transaction- based view of poverty reduction makes for a more focused set of information services within any particular community, and it is now well-understood that in this regard local relevance is key to success, a more generalized approach to defining information and service delivery is more likely to foster widespread diffusion. Accordingly, scaling up successes from the local to the general will require more than the mere replication of services, although that would be useful in many cases, but it would also need the institutionalization of the process that is used to define the services that any particular community finds useful. Relating as it does to the nature of the relationship between the project and the communities within which it operates, this aspect of ICTs for poverty reduction is less well understood and it probably represents a considerable obstacle to scaling up. The Study In this nationwide study, data were collected from 18 different projects with one common factor, that they use ICTs to reduce poverty, often through the application of e-governance, but sometimes through the delivery of services that increase incomes. The intention of the study was to understand what influences will determine the extent to which projects like these can be scaled up from what often appears to be a perpetual pilot syndrome; either to greater use within existing recipient beneficiaries (infusion) or among wider beneficiary populations (diffusion), or both. The enquiry was driven by informed opinion derived from direct experience with the use of ICTs for reducing poverty, as well as from observations and studies of such initiatives. Such assumptions suggested that projects should be well designed and managed; that community participation is important; that benefits have to be tangible to those for whom they are intended; that the political and social climate should be conducive to the initiative; and that financial sustainability, or at least its prospect, has to be demonstrable. A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 25 Empowering the Poor The Projects Surveyed Initially, researchers identified 50 ICT initiatives in India in the field of poverty alleviation and governance as candidate projects for inclusion in the study. These were assessed against a set of criteria before the final list of projects was arrived at. The criteria for projects to be included in the study were as follows. Selection Criteria Projects should have had an ICT component for poverty alleviation and/or governance. The identified projects focused mainly on education, training, capacity building, health, microfinance, microenterprises, etc. Whilst contributing to poverty reduction in a broader sense, such initiatives were not limited to serve only rural poor. Overall, the projects selected were to be spread over different parts of India, so as to take account of regional diversity. India has considerable geographical, linguistic and cultural diversity and projects in one part of the country may not be relevant or replicable in another part. The aim was to include projects that would give the study adequate diversity of literacy levels, language, availability of resources and economic conditions. Projects should be making use of a gamut of ICTs, such as the Internet, community radio, satellite phones, wireless technology and so on. We took the view that ICTs are not limited to the use of computers and the Internet. Projects should have different models of financing: private, public and public-private. Many ICT-related projects have been initiated by governments of different states, but using different models of funding. Some projects have also been initiated by private companies as well as Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). Some projects are community driven and some are funded by international organizations. The study tried to reflect these varieties in its selection of projects to be examined. Based on these criteria, 18 ICT-related projects were eventually selected for the study.

Therefore, during field visits, these two projects were substituted by Akshaya (Kerala), and Vidyal Information Service Provider (VISP), Tamil Nadu. Furthermore, the team faced difficulties carrying out the study at Infovillage/MS Swaminathan Research Foundation project in Pondicherry. The projects were surveyed between June and October 2003, whereby a two-man team of enumerators applied a questionnaire to around 100 randomly selected project users at each of the project locations. This was followed up by detailed interviews with the project staff: promoters, management and operators. The study was supported by the Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme (APDIP) of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), UNDP India and the Department of Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 26 Personnel and Trainin, Government of India. It was guided by an advisory group of eminent researchers and practitioners.29 The Variables of Interest The variables that were examined in the study are as follows. Each variable is described in the subsequent sections. Project design The initial design of the project will have an impact on its outcomes, its viability and hence the likelihood that it will have the potential for scaling up. A well-conceived project will be more likely to deliver useful benefits to its target audience in a sustainable manner. Several aspects of project design are considered relevant in this regard. Staff capability Information services that are provided via ICTs to poor rural populations require more than merely setting up and maintaining the technology. In most of the settings of our study, the clients of the services had hardly had any previous exposure to computers and the Internet. Although computer training is commonly conducted, most users are only able to avail of the services that are on offer through the staff of the centres, who act as intermediaries. The role played by such people intercedes between the clients and the information services and will affect their effectiveness. Sometimes known as information intermediaries, or infomediaries, they fulfil a vital role and they require certain characteristics to be effective. Their actions and behaviour should lead to the information service achieving its full potential, through active promotion, sensitive and respectful dealings with the clients, and by building empathy with the host community. Volunteers drawn from the community and trained in ICT skills have been shown to be effective in playing this role, and in India it is essential to use women in this role in order to provide services to female clients. The project has to be able to attract, train and retain such people. Staff capability, as we see it, is indicated by its numbers and levels of education and by the opinions of clients with regard to the quality of the service they provide. Community acceptance For a development project to have a positive impact, especially where it implies changes in the way that people live their lives, it must be accepted by the community as something that they can trust and respond to. Community acceptance is a key ingredient of desirable outcomes, and projects have to work at achieving it. There has to be a demonstrable concern with the problems of the community and a willingness to provide services that are of value. Outreach activities that manifest a willingness to share control and to respond to community concerns are important components of a programme aimed at winning community trust and embedding the services of the centre into its daily life. Effective providers of information services grow their services with the changing demands of the client community, and to do this they need to win the confidence of the community and to form close relationships with community A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 27 Empowering the Poor representatives that are based on trust and mutual goals. Indicators of community acceptance would be the benefit that is derived by the community from the services of the project as well as its willingness to continue using the services of the project. Service delivery This factor relates to the ability of the project to maintain the delivery of the services that it is meant to provide over a long-term period, for as long as the host community might wish to receive those services. In many cases, a project will depend on delivering information that is sourced from partner organizations, over which the project has little or no control. These may be government institutions or private businesses.

Accordingly, how well the project is able to retain the cooperation of the partner institution will impact the effectiveness of the service. Community development projects that use ICTs will grow in effectiveness as the number and quality of information services that they provide grow. Single service centres, such as those dedicated to land registration transactions or to agricultural support services, may provide value to poor people, but the delivery infrastructure could well be capable of delivering a wider variety of services as well, say for health care or education, and that may be a necessary requirement for approaching financial self- sustainability of the centres or a wider diffusion of the service. In such circumstances, there will be an added demand on the project managers for coordinating services from a variety of sources and of making the most out each of them for the host communities. Key indicators here would be the nature of the relationship between the project and the content providers, the form of partnership, and the level of their joint commitment to the maintenance of the service. Technology Project design incorporates the selection of the most appropriate technology. Technology is most effectively deployed in pursuit of some predefined developmental outcome, rather than as an outcome itself. Accordingly, development problems and the strategies to overcome them should be clearly articulated before technological solutions are determined. In many cases, the reverse actually happens; technology is decided upon and then a development opportunity is sought to which it can be applied. Often this leads to the deployment of inappropriate technologies, say computers and the Internet, when simpler alternatives such as radio and television would have been more appropriate. In addition, computers and the Internet tend to deliver maximum output when they are appropriated by the organization and the community to provide assistance with problems that they themselves have identified and sought solutions for, and project promoters should adopt measures, including education and awareness raising, to encourage this form of technology adoption to take place. It indicates the achievement of higher order benefits through community empowerment and requires suitable awareness of the technology within the using community. In the study, we looked for awareness of technology among the users of the centres as an indicator of this variable. Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 28 Community participation Available knowledge makes a strong case that information-based development services are effective when the communities in which they are provided have a share in their design and operation. For one observer, \u201cparticipation should not be considered simply the contribution of content, but also the determination of direction, and the ability to determine and even develop future applications and intended uses\u201d. Community participation in project design should, of course, be based on equality of gender, caste, age and so on, so that equal participation in project design fosters equal participation in the enjoyment of the benefits of the project. ICTs have an important characteristic that distinguishes them from other development tools in that they are multi-purpose, and can be shaped to address problems that were not necessarily those for which they were originally intended. Once communities have become accustomed to the use of ICTs for one purpose they will begin to consider other uses, for the technology, but only if they have been able to participate in the decision- making processes that determine how the technology is used. Creative solutions can emerge from the cross learning that occurs between communities and promoters of technology. The dictum about listening to the poor, and acting on what they say, has particular applicability with ICTs because there are almost always significant information components within the solutions that they themselves foresee for their problems, and which provide openings for the introduction of ICTs. Based on what we already know, ICT has proven that it can help reduce poverty when used appropriately and with the full participation of stakeholders, particularly the poor themselves.30 In the study we evaluated participation in project design with four indicators: equality in decision-making; equality in benefits; influence on project management; and leadership development. Equality in decision-making Here we look to see if the community has been able to play a truly equal role in the processes of decision-making in the conduct of the project. Is the role of the community characterized by one of equal and active collaboration or more by one of passive cooperation?

As indicators of equality in decision-making we look for participation in meetings and committees, not just attendance and also acceptance of roles of responsibility. There need to be representatives of all sections of the community within decision-making processes, especially women and disadvantaged groups. Equality in benefits The benefits of the project must be distributed widely throughout all sections of the host community. Even communities in the poorest districts will be stratified into groups that are better-off and those that are less well-off. We have seen that facilities that are provided for the poor can also be used by the rich, but that the reverse is not always the case. Everyone in the community should be able to make use of the services of the project in an equal and unimpeded manner. The available experience indicates that rural women, whether literate or semi-literate, are able to take to new technologies like fish to water, provided they are genuinely involved in the implementation process. It is therefore important that women A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 29 Empowering the Poor managers and operators are trained in large numbers. There is also a gender dimension to the information needed. For example, women require specific health information. Therefore, the participation of women both as managers and users of ICTs should receive specific attention. Also, a gender audit procedure should be built into the final ICT programmes.31 In the study we have examined the gender, caste, age, education and income levels of the users of all projects. Influence on project management Whilst equality in decision-making may only materialize on occasion, when decisions have to be made, we were also interested to know if the community has been able to influence the way in which the project has been managed on a day-to-day basis. This would reflect both real influence as well as project managers responsive to their client\u2019s needs. Such influence would require effective mechanisms that allow the community to make their opinions felt with regard to project management and are then able to see that they are acted upon. Such mechanisms might include steering committees that meet regularly, and explicit lines of responsibility and representation in management processes. Leadership development If the technology is to be appropriated by the community, so that it can decide for itself the type of service that is provided, equality and participation have to lead to the independent decision- The Meaning of Participation Participation has been used to mean different things in different contexts. One important distinction is whether it is interpreted to involve \u2018empowerment\u2019, implying significant control over decision-making, or whether it simply means rudimentary levels of consultation, where little delegation of decision-making powers occurs. Another distinction is between whether it is viewed as a means or an end. An instrumental approach views participation as a means to improving implementation, efficiency and equity, while an empowerment approach values the process of increasing participation as an important end in itself. At a minimum, participation clearly requires that individuals and groups are, in some way, involved in the decision-making process. This engagement can assume any of a number of points along a spectrum, which has been defined as ranging from: (1) information-sharing (2) consultation (3) joint decision-making to (4) initiation and control by stakeholders. At one end \u2018information sharing\u2019 involves very limited decision-making powers but potentially important knowledge transfer. At the other end lies \u2018initiation and control\u2019, which implies a high degree of citizen control over decision-making. In between, \u2018consultation\u2019 exists when participants are able to express opinions but their perspectives are not necessarily incorporated into the final product; \u2018joint decision-making\u2019, on the other hand, gives participants the shared right to negotiate the content of strategy. The boundaries of this classification are of course not clear-cut. Frances Stewart and Michael Wang, Do PRSPs empower poor countries and disempower the World Bank, or is it the other way round?

Useful indicators include the extent to which the community has been mobilized towards using information within its own development plans and planning for its use of information as a means towards achieving a better life. Project outcomes In examining project outcomes, the study sought to depict factors that are broad enough to capture the intent of a varied range of project objectives, give the diversity of those that were studied but at the same time to focus on concrete measures that would be capable of indicating genuine benefits to those for whom they were intended. The factors chosen were intended to clarify the subtleties implied by the unfortunate labels of project \u2018success\u2019 and \u2018failure\u2019, and whatever lies in between these simplistically bilateral characterizations of project outcomes, as well as drawing on the substantial body of knowledge in the information systems field relating to system success. Sustainability ICT projects for poverty reduction and e-governance require a regular flow of adequate resources in order to remain viable including, but not limited to, financial resources. However, in the sustainability discourse that surrounds the use of ICTs for poverty reduction, most of the attention is directed towards financial sustainability, and even then it is narrowly interpreted as self-financing. Curiously, this serves to set apart ICT projects from other infrastructure developments, e.g., roads (unless tolls are charged) and telephones, where rural subsidies are widely applied and self-financing sustainability is hardly mentioned. Even libraries, which serve a sub-set of the purpose of most rural ICT projects; that of disseminating information and knowledge as a public good, mostly escape the demands of requiring to be self-financing, not to mention public schools and universities. Nevertheless, it seems clear at this stage of the diffusion of rural ICTs, i.e., before they are accepted as being at least as important and useful as public libraries, that governments and private organizations will not take on substantial commitments to scale up ICT projects without assurances that they are not exposing themselves to unendurable and indefinite financial demands in order to keep the initiative alive. Accordingly, we expect that financial sustainability is a key criterion for scaling up, and that the closer that it comes to self-financing sustainability, the better. Usage The degree of actual and intended usage by its beneficiaries indicates the extent that the project can be deemed successful. In most situations in the study, usage is optional, and future intensions of usage would be indicative of project outcomes. A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 31 Empowering the Poor Usefulness A long history of research in the field of information systems, mostly applied to the organizational use of ICTs, confirms that the usefulness of an information system is a reliable indicator of its value.32 Intuitively, it would be expected that beneficiaries, or users, of the ICT project would place some value on an information system that they found useful, would use it again and that this would indicate some measure of success of the project. Satisfaction User satisfaction is another accepted indicator of information system success, known as the recipient response to the use of the output of an information system. The use of user satisfaction in measuring information system success is frequent among researchers and practitioners.33 Users that are satisfied with their use of an information system within the projects of the study imply desirable and successful outcomes for the project. Empowerment A number of ICT projects for poverty reduction touch upon the need to empower the poor, particularly women. Empowerment in this sense seems to involve the taking up of new skills but it also points towards an increase in the freedom of individuals to make certain key decisions regarding their own future, as opposed to having no such opportunities or having such decisions made for them by others. Enhanced status and the ability to freely advocate for one\u2019s rights and interests are also implied by increased empowerment.34 There seems to be a close association between empowerment and the availability of information, and ICTs therefore are closely implicated in empowering processes. Political economy All the projects in the study are being conducted, of course, within their own specific contexts, which can be expected to have a bearing on the conduct of the project and on its potential for scaling up. All information systems exist within such contexts, and their influence needs to be accounted for when assessing the impact of the system.

The study sought information relating to two aspects of the political economy surrounding each project, using observation and interviews with project staff as well as secondary sources. Policy environment With many Indian states having populations that are larger than most Asian countries, state policies with regard to ICTs are as relevant as national policies. The telecommunications infrastructure is sensitive to national policy, regulating the activities of private operators whose presence is said to accelerate the diffusion of telephones. National telephone density reached five per 100 inhabitants by 31 March 2003, compared with only 1.39 at the end of March 1994, when the shift to a new, more liberal telecom policy began. However, differences between urban and rural areas and between individual states distort the overall picture. Rural teledensity Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 32 stood at a mere 1.49 in 2003, when urban teledensity was placed at 15.49. In March 2003, while teledensity in the state of Delhi was 26.85, that in Bihar was still as low as 1.32.35 Other differences exist between states, as revealed by a study of national e-readiness, in which a composite index encompassing network policy and e-governance was used to rank states. Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh were ranked as \u2018Leaders\u2019; Haryana, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh and Orissa, among others, were ranked as \u2018Below Average Achievers\u2019; and Assam, Bihar, Jammu and Kashmir, and Arunachal Pradesh, among others, were ranked as \u2018Least Achievers\u2019.36 This study was interested to discover what policies, if any, drove the implementation of the project and to what extent it seemed possible that the outcomes of the project might feed back into policy formulation processes. Social environment The social environment of each of the projects in the study is made up of the local factors that comprise the intended beneficiaries, their social make up and condition, both before and after the project was implemented, as well as any influence there has been on the relationships within the community. For example, one often-quoted impact of rural ICTs is on the relationship between farmers and traders, whereby the negotiating power of middlemen, which is based on their monopoly over trade information, becomes balanced more in favour of the farmers who can use ICTs to obtain the same information that the traders previously withheld.37 ICTs impacts in rural projects are often sought in gender relations, advancing women\u2019s equality, and in increased incomes, directly reducing income poverty. Scaling The dependent variable in the study is the potential for project scaling; the extent to which the benefits that are experienced from experimentation can be enjoyed more widely. Given the scale of India\u2019s poverty, and the ambition of the MDGs, scaling up of ICT projects for poverty reduction will be essential if the technology is to have significant impact and is to achieve its full potential.38 Scaling up rural ICTs can be related to the diffusion of other types of innovation, which is what rural ICTs are. Whilst acknowledging that project success (in some form) is a prerequisite to scaling it up to wider audiences, it is also clear that in practice, scaling goes beyond mere replication; it involves processes of bureaucracy and institutionalization that would be markedly different from the typically intensive, adaptable and flexible operations of small-scale experiments run by visionaries. Scaling up from experimental modes of technology operation to mainstream practice does require certain enabling conditions. For example, the diffusion of technology beyond experimental usage seems to demand the removal of uncertainty and a high degree of predictability with regard to the outcomes of its use. Technology adoption takes off among majority groups (the equivalent of scaling) when it is easy to understand the innovation and when it can be acquired and put to good use as a single complete \u2018package\u2019 without any additional mechanisms or uncertainties.39 Currently, many institutions (governments, corporations and NGOs) are uncertain of the conditions that are necessary to ensure that rural ICTs will deliver real benefits to poor people in a predictable, reliable and affordable way. They are uncertain of the technology in a fast changing environment and they are wary of the adaptations that experience tells us are necessary in order to ensure the services that are provided are relevant within highly localised contexts. They are also wary of the costs involved, especially when competing demands that carry less uncertainty with regard to their benefits are crying out to A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 33 Empowering the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0e84bd10-2531-4b61-ba57-2159cf4db801": {"__data__": {"id_": "0e84bd10-2531-4b61-ba57-2159cf4db801", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Empowering the Poor", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8658fb66bc77c361b3226bd0caccf116309b2c533d9afcce5a139b03dee144ed"}}, "hash": "8658fb66bc77c361b3226bd0caccf116309b2c533d9afcce5a139b03dee144ed", "text": "Poor be served. Being effective with ICTs requires agility and adaptability; characteristics that are uncommon among the large government institutions and other organizations whose resources and managerial and technical skills are required for scaling up. In such cases, it is necessary to implement institutional reforms that are rooted in a high level commitment to deliver radical improvements in services and a widespread willingness to adopt innovative methods, and from this, the adoption of ICTs will emerge naturally. In the corporate world, this process is sometimes known as Business Process Re-engineering in which extensive improvements in service quality are achieved by stripping away traditional methods and organizational norms and by aggressively innovating with technology.40 Whilst the study does not address aspects of institutional reform in the scaling of the rural ICT projects that are examined, it is expected to remove some of the uncertainties surrounding the diffusion process by coming closer to an understanding of what a complete and scaleable \u2018package\u2019 of a rural ICT innovation might look like. Essentially, while the success of a pilot project is a precondition to scaling it up to wider audiences, this is treated separately from the issue of institutional reform that would often be required to make scaling up possible. Finally, we treat scaling as being represented by two dimensions, diffusion and infusion. Diffusion Diffusing a project relates to replicating its methods and its benefits among a wider population; i.e., beyond the beneficiaries of the pilot. This would be carried out either by the original implementing institution or by other institutions with similar roles and responsibilities, such as government or private organizations. In some cases, pilots evolve, moving into new areas of experimentation, and scaling institutions spin off the successful initiatives successively as they emerge. Such projects are sometimes criticized for appearing to be in a perpetual pilot mode, but this often ignores the way that experiments evolve, through adaptive planning into new areas of enquiry, learning as they proceed and exposing novel challenges that may not have been evident at the outset, or which only arose in response to the new conditions created by the project\u2019s earlier work. Accordingly, scaling up from a successful pilot can occur more than once over time and in more than one direction. Infusion Intensification of the project within the existing populations that it serves, either by the same implementing agency or by others, for example by providing new services across the same network, represents another dimension of scaling. Such amalgamations of different services that provide benefit to the same population might generate synergies from their complementary strengths, thereby increasing usage and economic viability and approaching the network effects that are so important in achieving the full potential of ICTs. One such suggestion that has been put forward is to combine the e-Choupal and Bhoomi models.41 It seems that the use of ICTs for e-government and poverty reduction will be easier to justify financially when multiple applications are delivered in this way, making maximum use of the costly physical infrastructure. Scaling in both directions, diffusion and infusion, can therefore occur simultaneously. Measuring the Variables Measurement was by questionnaire and interview. Interviewing included the gathering of stories related to any of the variables. A standardized questionnaire was applied to the projects, involving around 100 respondents in each. Respondents were asked to give answers on a scale of 1-5 against Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 34 questions that represented one of the indicators of the variables of interest. In some cases, indicators were represented by more than one question. The questionnaire is shown in Annex 3. The following case studies provide a description of each of the projects. In each study, the results of the survey are depicted in a \u2018radar\u2019 graph. A score was computed for each variable on a standardized scale, which is depicted on the graph. By shading the area under each score, it can be seen that the closer the shaded area approaches the outside edge of the graph, the more favourable the results of the study for that project.

It was started as a joint venture between local bodies (gram panchayats in rural areas and municipalities in urban areas) and private entrepreneurs to bridge the digital divide by providing community access to computers and the Internet. In November 2002, Dr A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, the President of India, launched the project in Thiruvananthpuram whereas the Chief Minister of Kerala started Akshaya centres in Thiruvananthpuram and Malappuram in May 2003. Goals and Objectives G To provide basic functional skills (e-literacy) to every family in the state. G To ensure universal access to various information and communication tools as well as technologies. G To provide relevant content to the local population in the native language. G To provide community access centres, which can eventually be developed as centres to provide integrated e-governance services. Planning The district panchayat, Malappuram, presented a proposal in February 2002 to train interested rural youths in ICTs, at a budgeted cost ofRs 6 million. A survey conducted in the district resulted in a list of 26,000 trained IT personnel and 451 private IT training institutes (mostly concentrated in urban areas). The project was launched as a pilot in Malappuram district. The district has an area of 3,372 sq km and a population of 3.7 million (of which more than 70 percent are Muslims), 600,000 families in the district live in 102 panchayats and five municipalities. The district is administratively divided into 137 villages, 14 blocks and six talukas. It has a satisfactory penetration of landline and mobile phones (250,000 phones). It also has 3,500 voluntary organizations. The Town and Country Planning Department was entrusted with the task of identifying geographical locations. It identified 801 locations for Community Technology Centres (CTCs), which were located on main/link roads, with telephone connections and available electricity power. The district panchayat finally selected 634 sites after the approval of gram panchayats. Of these, 565 CTCs have already been set up. The project proposes to establish 9,000 CTCs throughout the state, so that there is one CTC within a distance of 2 km of every household. Three critical factors in the project are: the number of centres, the number of users and the mass of content. The three major Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 38 components are: access, skill sets and content. The project had initially planned for one CTC among every 1,000 families. However, currently the plan is to have one CTC among every 1,500 families. Services Provided Various services are provided from networked and stand-alone computers. An e-literacy campaign that imparts IT-related training at the CTCs has been started. These centres also provide services such as DTP (digital albums, identity cards, report cards, etc.) and conduct advanced courses on ICT-related subjects. Of the 565, only 83 CTCs have Internet connectivity. They provide services such as web browsing, e-mail, Internet telephony, web-based consultancy, etc. Each CTC has 10 computers (smaller and remote centres have six or eight computers), two printers, one web camera, one scanner and one CD writer. These centres are planning to provide e-government, e-education and e-health services in the future. Target Group and Intended Beneficiaries The target group is the 600,000 families residing in the Mallapuram district. One member from each family (selected by the family), preferably in the age group 15-65 years, is the intended beneficiary of the project. In the extended phase, it is envisaged that 6.4 million houses will be covered in the state.

The state-level executive committee is headed by the Chief Minister and is represented by ministers and secretaries of relevant departments. The District Coordinator of Akshaya has a District Programme Officer (for the campaign) and an Assistant Mission Coordinator (for implementation). About 4,500 women from Kudumbashree, a movement of 60,200 women in the state, have been engaged in mobilizing for the e-literacy campaign, particularly in Mallapuram district. There are 13 block-level coordinators who are appointed on contract and 100 panchayat-level coordinators, who execute and monitor the project. Technologies Each CTC is equipped with personal computers, each having a LAN card, application software, a modem, a web camera, a printer, a scanner, a CD writer, a UPS, a cable networking component and a telephone connection. Connectivity will be provided through leased lines or through cables in the near future. Around 15 percent of the CTCs have some form of Internet connectivity. Five companies were short-listed (Escotel, Satyam, Asianet, Tulip and Aksh) for providing uninterrupted connectivity at 64 Kbps/2 Mbps to all CTCs in the district on a monthly user-charge agreement. This work was awarded to Tulip, and the entire network has now become wireless. Primary Access Points CTCs provide primary access points. One CTC has been started for about 1,000 families and situated, in most cases, within 2 km from every household. On average, each centre provides e-literacy training to 1,000 members in the community in the span of 100 days. For each person trained in the basic course, the owner of the CTC gets Rs 80 from the gram panchayat, Rs 20 from the janpad panchayat, Rs 20 from the district panchayat and Rs 20 from the member itself. The state government also pays Rs 10 per person as incentive for those trainees who complete their e-literacy targets in the specified timeframe. Capacity Building The project has taken up an unparalleled challenge for providing e-literacy at an unprecendented scale. Each entrepreneur/ owner of the 565 CTCs established so far has undergone two-day training at Thiruvananthpuram. Each member of the family is given 15 hours of computer training at the closest CTC from the household, which consists of 10 lessons prepared in the local language. Constraints and Implementation Challenges The project has faced numerous constraints and implementation challenges. One of the first questions asked was why not invest more in health and education instead of investing in ICTs.

He was earning Rs 60,000 per month. However, homesickness and the desire to do something for his village brought him back to Olvattur in the year 2000, along with his wife and his one-year-old daughter. He rented a dilapidated building in the village at Rs 450 per month and started an Akshaya centre in May 2003. He bought eight computers, two printers, one scanner, one UPS, one web camera and the minimum required furniture, investing Rs 300,000 from his own savings. He says, \u201cI had to make 2,000 families e-literate in the first three months. From this, I earned Rs 270,000. Then onwards, all the machines became mine after recovering my investment in three months\u2019 time.\u201d He also helps in the nearby orphanage (housing 200 orphans) and organizes health and sanitation campaigns in the village. He provides free computer courses to needy children of the village. He is earning less than he did in the UAE, but he realizes that his work is more fulfilling and satisfying. His ultimate dream is that some day the President of India, his idol, would come to his village to visit his Akshaya centre. \u201cLearning to drive an auto is more difficult than learning to use a computer\u201d Phiroz Babu, the youngest in his family, dropped out of school in the ninth class.

A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 41 Empowering the Poor watching pornography on the Internet. These doubts were addressed by the project administration by reasoning with and educating the users. There was a strong resistance from commercial, cooperative and rural banks to provide term-loans of Rs 200,000 without collateral. Local bodies like gram/ block/district panchayats and municipalities initially did not want to provide Rs 120 per person per family as a contribution towards e-literacy efforts from their own resources. Eventually, the state government had to provide budgetary allocations for these bodies. The district has poor Internet connectivity though the telephone density is higher than the national average. This too was a constraint to the successful implementation of the project. Another major constraint was the unavailability of Malayalam content. The absence of Malayalam sites on the web prevents the local population from deriving maximum benefits from the Internet. Project Outcomes The project has shown that the PPP model can be effectively mobilized to launch this type of project, helping to bridge the digital divide. Of the total cost of Rs 260 million, Rs 180 million has been invested by private entrepreneurs in establishing the CTCs. Local bodies contributed Rs 60 million towards the e-literacy programme. The state government has to spend only Rs 20 million for promotion and content development. Around 40 percent of the 0.6 million families were made e-literate in the Malappuram district. The community has largely accepted CTCs as centres for communication and e-literacy. Key Lessons Learnt Apart from the fact that Akshaya has introduced a successful and effective PPP model for establishing CTCs, it was found that there is adequate skilled manpower available for operating computers in rural areas. The project also emphasized the fact that e-literacy is a precursor in a developing e-community. The project also shows that the People\u2019s Action Plan is more important than the Technology Action Plan. Sustainability It is too early to comment on the sustainability of the project, as it is in the nascent stage of implementation. The promise of one CTC per 1,000 families (5,000 people) may not be realistic. The long-term sustainability of the project would only be ensured once the CTCs are effectively networked with the provision of sufficient bandwidth. Replication and Scaling Up This project has been replicated in seven other districts in India. The PPP model is worth emulating and replicating to bridge the digital divide. In a resource-poor country, this model provides ample opportunities for community access to computers and ICT. The state of Kerala had set a target to scale up the project in all its 14 districts to provide e-literacy to 6.4 million families by 2004. Recommendations It is recommended the initial strategy of having one CTC for every 1,000 families be changed. In the long run, many ventures might not be financially viable. Instead of adopting such a rule of thumb, it would be better to decide the number and location of CTCs based on a needs assessment and potential analysis. The project should focus more on implementation on the basis of field realities rather then rhetoric.

Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 42 Connectivity and networking of all the existing CTCs is a critical issue to be addressed before increasing their numbers. Numerous technology options like cable, VSAT, fibre, line- of-sight wireless as well as non-line-of-sight wireless exist for providing connectivity to the CTCs. It is also recommended that a technology be chosen only after a detailed analysis of cost/capital requirement, recurring costs, usefulness in the geography, potential use of the bandwidth by the community and long-term sturdiness of the technology. Connectivity should support Internet browsing, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), multimedia, video-conferencing and e-learning/e-health services. The government should also encourage all organizations, institutions, universities and business establishments in the state to host informative websites in the local language on the Internet. A significant effort is still required to enable these CTCs to provide e-governance, e-health, e-education and e-business. Similarly, a vision of using these Akshaya centres as outlets of the FRIENDS project (see page 72) is yet to be implemented. For the sustainability of these centres, the integration of Akshaya CTCs and FRIENDS need to be achieved at the earliest.

The first cooperative dairy in the state of Gujarat was established in Anand district and the offices of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) are also located here. The Anand District Milk Cooperative Society has a staff strength of 1,200 and collects 700,000- 800,000 litres of milk every day from 1,003 milk societies (with more than 578,000 members, of whom 405,000 belong to the poor category) in Anand and Kheda districts. The Anand District Milk Cooperative Society (DMCS) produces milk, flavoured milk, cheese, chocolates, butter, ghee, etc. It provides backup integration to these societies through selling 600 tonnes/day cattle feed and has one breeding centre, 36 veterinary centres (with 76 qualified doctors) and four chilling plants. The old system of milk collection at the primary societies; with manual testing, manual account keeping on paper and manual receipt of the payments from the district dairy, resulted in a five to10 days\u2019 delay in payment to the milk collectors. An Automatic Milk Collection System (AMCS) was introduced in 1996. At the time of the study, 691 primary milk collection societies used AMCS. Goals and Objectives G To automate milk collection procedures at the collection centres to reduce the time required in collecting milk from members. G To use electronic technology to weigh the milk and to measure its fat content. G To automatically calculate the amount payable to each and every milk collector. G To maintain regular records at the Dairy Cooperative Societies (DCS). G To integrate data at each primary milk society with the District Milk Cooperative through the use of ICT. Planning Each AMCS consists of a computer for billing, a milk-testing machine and an automatic milk tester. There are seven to eight manufacturing companies (such as Akashganga, Surabhi, RAL, Kaamdhenu, Prompt, etc.), which manufacture these instruments. Each AMCS costs Rs 70,000 to 90,000. At the time of the study, 691 out of 1,003 primary milk societies used AMCS, while the remaining societies used automatic weighing machines.

Institutional Arrangements The DMCS has 13 elected members. There is a Managing Director, along with two general managers (plant technology and dairy development), two assistant general managers (cattle feed and other products), 10 managers (milk procurement, cooperative How effective are the Anand Milk Collection Centres in establishing transparency and financial integrity in milk collection at dairy cooperatives A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 45 Empowering the Poor development, finance, accounts, production, engineering, chocolate complex, cattle feed, cheese centre and animal husbandry). There is a fully-equipped research facility as well. Each 1,003 primary milk cooperative society has 11 elected members, of which there is one chairman. Each primary society has a secretary, a milk collector, a cashier, a tester, an artificial insemination worker, a cattle- feed salesman and a clerk. At the primary milk cooperative society, AMCS is either manned by a milk collector or by a tester. Technologies A basic milk collection transaction done by Akashganga comprises: G Measuring weight of milk with electronic weighing scale. G Fat testing using \u2018milk-o-tester\u2019. G Capture of unique member ID by the PC software. G Printing of pay slip, with all this data and the amount to be paid. The MS DOS-based system offers scalability for an information-kiosk like service. Thus, DISK has been added as an enhancement, which offers a multitude of animal husbandry-related services, besides maintaining databases and offering Internet connectivity at the DCS. Primary Access Points The Milk Collection Centres of the primary DCS are the primary access points. The number of farmers selling to their local cooperative milk collection centre varies from 100 to 1,000 and the daily milk collection varies from 1,000 to 10,000 litres. Capacity Building AMUL uses the facilities of the Institute of Rural Management at Anand (IRMA) for the purpose of capacity building. At least two members from each DCS have been given three-day training on the use of AMCS and computers. All the secretaries of DCSs have been given one-day training in AMCS. Managerial training courses like Member Business Development Programme, Society Staff Orientation Programme, etc, also include an orientation on the use of AMCS. Constraints and Implementation Challenges The major barrier is the attitude of the people. It seems like a surmountable challenge but building the initial momentum takes time due to this attitude. Although AMCS is priced competitively, the cost is a major impediment for the DCS, for whom every rupee has to be accounted for. They are answerable to every member of the society. In addition, villages in India are dusty and have poor infrastructure. For ICT-based systems to operate, the machines have to be rugged and be able to withstand the climatic conditions. The power situation in the villages is poor. When the power goes down at the time of milk collection, all activities come to a halt. At times, manual entry has to be done, leading to a disruption of the normal routine. Project Outcomes AMUL has been one of India\u2019s great success stories. It has been instrumental in bringing the \u201cWhite Revolution\u201d into India. The use of AMCS in the DCSs has brought about phenomenal results. AMCS has brought down the waiting time for the members of the Milk Collection Centres from 20 minutes to 50 seconds. AMCS has a comprehensive database of 290,000 members in Anand-Kheda districts in 691 DCSs. Also, it has reduced payment delays from 13- 14 days to sameday payments. AMCS has served tens of thousands of members in Anand- Kheda districts and in other districts of Gujarat.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5fa0997b-53e1-4c03-ac27-1d2e06dfde74": {"__data__": {"id_": "5fa0997b-53e1-4c03-ac27-1d2e06dfde74", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Empowering the Poor", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "77c25d7bd48cfb91055203e323cac1c9e8bbd9e582148310c71c450f44ea6878"}, "2": {"node_id": "beb90221-a17b-46c2-9943-56f3bbc7fdf0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bc23fe1b50572e5ffb567fb4d316788d705e329c8565be8f575760f71299feec"}}, "hash": "c0ee328985d908272967f0a60a48a4a25a2a5fffe446ff659b5c5ace8744e45d", "text": "Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 46 Key Lessons Learnt A large part of the success of this venture can be attributed to the use of appropriate technology.

Simple and rugged plastic cards with holes are used as personal identifiers, rather than smart cards. The idea was to keep the cost to affordable levels, without sacrificing any essential requirements. Building useful content in local languages is absolutely necessary. In the dairy sector, the district unions are willing to spend because they stand to gain as the system increases the efficiency and effectiveness of the services delivered by them to rural farmers. For rural kiosks to become a reality, it is necessary to build partnerships among development organizations, telecom companies, small IT service companies and government agencies. The role of the Human Interest Stories The Dairy Cooperative Society of the new age The DCS at Utarsanda in Anand district provides quality services to 2,300 members. The population of Utarsanda village is 15,000 and it has 4,500 milch cattle. The DCS has a staff of 10 and is looked after by the secretary, Deepakbhai Patel. AMCS was introduced in the Milk Collection Centre in 1997. Everyone in the DCS knows the operation of AMCS. Every morning and evening, they generate data on milk collection which they post on the office notice board. The centre opens between 6 am to 8.30 am and between 5.30 pm to 8 pm. Earlier there used to be long queue of around 700 members every day and the centre used to close one hour later in the morning and the evening. The centre has a telephone and a television for the use of members. The AMCS is always functional because of the UPS and generator backup. Four hundred and sixty-five milk buyers have also joined a special deposit scheme in which on a deposit of Rs 500 or Rs 1,000, they receive milk and the amount is debited from their accounts. The services available at DCS are very popular with the villagers. In 2002-2003, the DCS has made a net profit of Rs 2 million. And in 2001 it received the ISO-9002 certification. Empowerment of a woman member Forty-year-old Santokhben is a migrant from drought-prone Saurashtra region. She has been looking after her five sons and one daughter since the death of her husband. She has no agriculture land and milch cattle are her sole source of income. She owns 25 cows and the income thus earned is the family\u2019s livelihood. Her sons take the cattle for grazing and she takes the milk to the DCS in Bhumel, which is 1.5 km away from her house. She deposits 20-30 litres of milk every day at the Milk Collection Centre. She is very satisfied with the AMCS as now her work gets done in less than 60 seconds, while earlier it used to take up 20-30 minutes. She is fully satisfied with the fat content measurement of her milk now. Before the AMCS was introduced in October 1998, she used to argue with the milk collector/tester or the secretary every day over the quality of her milk. She is now happy as she gets her payment on the spot. She plans to change over from local breed cows (Gir) to newer breeds. A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 47 Empowering the Poor committed volunteer who acts as the intermediary between the computer screen and the rural farmer is also important. Sustainability The AMCS is sustainable. The cost of the whole system is Rs 70, 000-90,000. The time reduction in catering to customers, providing an instant milk quality measurement facility and the automatic generation of database recovers the cost within a period of two years. In most DCSs, one or two staff has been removed after the introduction of AMCS, further reducing operational costs. The District Milk Union has entered into an annual maintenance contract for the hardware. The operation of AMCS is so simple that in less than one day anyone can master its operation. The widespread replication of AMCS in numerous DCSs in various Indian states has been primarily due to its sustainable business model. Replication and Scaling Up Of 10,000 DCSs in Gujarat around 4,000 are in the AMCS network. The concept of AMCS required considerable effort from the manufacturing companies. Their aggressive marketing and rural coverage assisted them in winning the confidence of the DCSs. The replication of the use of AMCS has spread beyond the state of Gujarat. Of 96,000 DCSs all over India, around 6,500 are already using AMCS. The replication has been fastest in Gujarat and Maharashtra. But other states like Andhra Pradesh, Punjab and Karnataka are also quick in adapting AMCS at Milk Collection Centres of DCSs.

Recommendations It is recommended that the pilot DISK should be replicated in all the DCSs where AMCS are being used. There is a felt need for a database of milch cattle (consisting of past history of diseases, inoculations, artificial inseminations, etc.), decision support systems (like milk collection forecasts), information on veterinary- related issues and innovations. DISK would eventually fill the gap for the benefit of poorer members. There is a need to scale up the pilot of connecting five AMCS in DCSs through a network. All 50,000 AMUL product distributors are already connected to 50 marketing offices of AMUL across the country through dial-up connectivity. Since 1997, 50 marketing offices are linked to the Gujarat State Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation through dial-up connectivity and, in turn, this is connected through VSAT with 12 District Milk Unions in the state of Gujarat. The organizational structure is already in place; the networking of DCSs with the DMU should follow. In most DCSs which are using AMCS, other databases of members are kept manually. The PC attached with the AMCS is only used for four hours in a day. It will be useful for the DCSs if all their remaining work is computerized too. The cost of AMCS is still out of reach of small DCSs. If it could be reduced by 20-30 percent, it would become affordable to even small DCSs. Website http://www.amul.com Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 48 Background Sixty-six percent of the population of Karnataka resides in rural areas where the main occupation is agriculture. About 6.7 million farmers own 20 million land holdings. The crucial document which records various parameters and information pertaining to land holding is the Record of Right Tenancy and Cultivation (RTC). Earlier, in the manual system, these records were maintained by 9,000 Village Accountants (VAs or village revenue officials) who served farmers in about 27,000 villages. The RTC is required for land transactions, to obtain crop loans, other loans and concessions linked to the size of the land holding. The manual system of maintaining RTCs was exploitative as the VAs were not easily available and bribes were often extracted. Since the records were not open for public scrutiny, there was considerable scope for manipulation. The land records are the most important testimony of rights for land owners in the huge agro- economy of India. VAs held a monopoly on all revenue records and were frequently involved in harassing citizens, tampering with the records and other corrupt practices. The Ministry of Rural Development has been providing funds to state governments for computerization of land records since 1988-89. In Karnataka, data entry work started in 1995, but up to 1999 there were few concrete benefits. In 1999-2000, modifications were made in the software and all the databases were updated when the Bhoomi project was launched. Goals and Objectives G To facilitate easy maintenance and prompt updatation of land records. G To make land records tamper proof. G To provide farmers easy access to their land records. G To create and to construct databases of land revenue, cropping pattern, land use, etc. G To utilize the data for planning and formulating development programmes. G To enable usage of this database by courts, banks, private organizations and Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Planning A pilot project for the computerization of land records in Karnataka started in 1989, initiated by the Government of India. By 1996, the project for computerization of land records for all districts in the state was sanctioned. The aim was to create computer records from the manual data. However, since no provision was made to install computers at the sub-district level, online updating of these records was not possible. Thus these projects failed to achieve all of the above objectives. The Bhoomi project was launched in Karnataka in 2000 with the aim of computerizing the system for maintaining land records, thereby permiting online updating. In the first phase, the project was implemented as a pilot in five talukas in the district; and later rolled out to all 177 talukas. The required software was designed and developed in-house by the National Information Centre (NIC, a Government of India organization). Services Provided At each kiosk, there are two computer screens, one of which performs the operation and the other which shows the transaction being performed to the clients.

These are important transactions for initiating the mandatory process known as mutation for effecting necessary changes in the RTC. Each request is assigned a number, and notices are then generated from Bhoomi, which are served by the VA, on interested parties. After waiting for a statutory period of 30 days from the day of serving the notice, the Revenue Inspector (RI) passes the mutation order in a register maintained for this purpose. The mutation order passed by the RI is processed in Bhoomi and a new RTC is generated, duly incorporating the details of the new owner. As a part of this process, the mutation order is scanned to take care of non-repudiation. While the mutation records are pending for orders of the RI, a farmer can trace the status of the application, using the number provided to him. Target Group and Intended Beneficiaries All citizens of the state (residing in rural and urban areas) are the target groups and intended beneficiaries. Institutional Arrangements An additional secretary in the Revenue Department (Land Reforms) acts as the project manager, assisted by the Senior Technical Director, NIC (Technical Manager). At the district level, the leadership role is given to the Deputy Commissioner. The administrative responsibilities were given to the Assistant Commissioners, technical responsibilities to District Information Officers of the NIC, and implementation and monitoring tasks assigned to the consultants appointed by the Bhoomi How effective is Bhoomi in facilitating easy maintenance and prompt updating of land records Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 50 project. Revenue Shrestedars (Deputy Tahsildars) were made project leaders at the taluka level, working under the direction of the Tahsildar. At the grass-roots level, there are revenue inspectors, village accountants and data entry operators. Except for the 28 consultants (one for each district and one for the state headquarters) appointed on an annual contract by the Bhoomi project, all tasks have clearly defined roles and responsibilities assigned to existing government staff. At the taluka level, one of the three existing Deputy Tahsildars are made responsible for Bhoomi. Five VAs were trained and assigned to man the Bhoomi counter and update records. Technologies Each of the177 talukas is provided with one computer with 64 MB RAM (with two monitors), one printer, one scanner, one UPS, one battery for back-up and a generator. The computer at the counter is connected to a a LAN and the server room has biometric equipment for fingerprints, two client machines for data updation and one printer. The front-end is written in Visual Basic v6 and the database in SQL server v7.0. The Operating System is Windows NT. Primary Access Points Bhoomi centres are operational in all 177 taluka headquarters of the state, providing a primary access point for all citizens. Each Bhoomi counter has two computer screens, one for the counter operator and another for the user. Some centres have touch screen kiosks as well. Capacity Building Rs 12.8 million were spent on capacity development of government officials. Intensive training was conducted for bringing about changes in attitude amongst departmental staff. This included seven-day training of 1,200 VAs , consisting of 10 hours a day on the basics of computers and the Bhoomi software; and two-month intensive training of 108 VAs on hardware and networking. In addition, 500 Tahsildars and 900 Shirastedars were given seven-day training on computer operations and the Bhoomi system and 600 VAs were given two-day training on data entry operations. Twelve state-level seminars were organized for 1,200 senior and middle-level officers; and four divisional-level workshops were organized to train 800 officials. To clarify technical and administrative issues, over150 circulars were issued and compiled into seven compendia. Also a Bhoomi Help Manual was distributed at the sub-district level. A computer-training lab was also set up. Constraints and Implementation Challenges Many constraints and challenges were faced at the time of implementation. There were 20 million land records of a dynamic nature, which had to be updated at least once a year. The manual copies of land records had a number of inaccuracies and inconsistencies. The question of data integrity became a major issue, as the inconsistencies became more visible once they came into the public domain rather than under the monopoly of VAs. The data structures in the state were not uniform. Data were kept in multiple languages across the state. Data entry operations by multiple agencies had to be closely monitored, as there was an urgent need to create a robust process to facilitate", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "34868ddb-4a3a-46e6-a022-b59db20e91fe": {"__data__": {"id_": "34868ddb-4a3a-46e6-a022-b59db20e91fe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Empowering the Poor", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a1ebb3b1dd1e0bf754a592de23ff53343421f97fe6710403e157ba33fdafdc90"}}, "hash": "a1ebb3b1dd1e0bf754a592de23ff53343421f97fe6710403e157ba33fdafdc90", "text": "data validation by the owners. There was huge resistance to change from an exploitative system of land records which had operated for more than 300 years.

The revenue officials involved in the project had no exposure to technology.

Online updating of the system had to be built in to obliterate manual updating of records. The issue of manual records had to be discarded, which was a major procedural shift. The mutation system had to be robust and quick once it was decided that it would go online. The geographic expanse of the project \u2013 27 districts, 177 talukas and 27,000 villagers \u2013 provided a challenge in the form of coordination of implementation and monitoring. Major power cuts (six to10 hours a day) also hindered the project. This compelled project managers to buy UPSs, batteries and generator sets in each taluka. Project Outcomes The generation time of the RTC has been reduced from 1 to 30 days to 5 to15 minutes. Similarly, the mutation process cycle time has decreased from 90-180 days to 30-45 days. Crop record updating has increased to 80-100 percent from 50-70 percent. Around 12 million users have used Bhoomi since its inception, resulting in the collection of Rs 180 million as user charges. Presently, 0.7 million people are using Bhoomi centres every month and monthly user charges collected amount to around Rs 10 million. Key Lessons Learnt Land registration is a major requirement of Indian villagers. The successful implementation of the project has proved that citizens are ready to pay increased user charges to get certified copies of their records. It has also emphasized the point that even huge and confusing databases can be integrated in a simple and user-friendly program. Another key lesson is that the payment of user charges is necessary for the financial viability of the project. Actually, land records can become a core e-government service for any CIC or a telecentre, supporting other developmental activities. Sustainability The project operates a financially sustainable model. It has recovered Rs 180 million in three years against the investment of Rs 244 million. In-house capacity building has provided skilled manpower from within the organization. The constant modification of software ensured long-term functionality of the system. Replication and Scaling Up Computerization of land records is an ongoing Government of India programme, which has been continuing over the last decade. Besides Karnataka, other Indian states like Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra have also shown similar success in land record computerization projects. It is planned to scale this project up to at least three villages in every taluka (around 500 kiosks). On a pilot basis, seven talukas have been linked to the St
