Leonard Compagno kindly provided the distribution maps, mainly taken from Compagno et al. 2005. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra UK) funded the preparation of the database, the preparation of a separate resource document for the CMS shark meeting in the Seychelles (December 2007) report, and Sarah Fowler\u2019s travel to the Seychelles and the CMS Scientific Council Meeting in Bonn (March 2007). The CMS Secretariat funded this review of the cartilaginous fishes, which was based on the information collated in the database. Sarah Fowler\u2019s attendance at the Seychelles and Bonn meetings was made possible by the Pew Marine Fellows Program. The Lenfest Ocean Program funded the SSG\u2019s Red List workshop for pelagic oceanic species, the results of which have contributed to this report. Finally, we would particularly like to thank John A. Musick, James Sulikowski and Zeb Hogan for their technical reviews of this report. 1 Introduction 1.1 Background The Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) currently includes three species of chondrichthyan fishes on its Appendices, in recognition of their unfavourable conservation status and need for concerted international conservation measures. Whale shark Rhincodon typus was listed on Appendix II in 1999, white shark Carcharodon carcharias on Appendices I and II in 2002, and basking shark Cetorhinus maximus on Appendices I and II in 2005. Also in 2005, the Eighth meeting of the Conference of Parties adopted Recommendation 8.16 \u201cMigratory sharks\u201d (see Annex 1). This recognises the importance of sharks in the marine ecosystem and the many threats to their populations and, inter alia, calls upon Parties to strengthen measures to protect migratory sharks and to develop a global migratory shark conservation instrument. The IUCN Species Survival Commission Shark Specialist Group (IUCN SSG) was commissioned by the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the CMS Secretariat to prepare a database of all migratory chondrichthyan fishes (the sharks, skates, rays and chimaeras) and to identify potential species that would benefit from a CMS listing due to their current status and conservation needs. This paper summarises the results of this review. A CMS meeting is being held in the Seychelles in December 2007 in order to identify options for international cooperation on migratory sharks under CMS. A separate background paper on the conservation status of migratory sharks and possible options for international cooperation under CMS (IUCN SSC Shark Specialist Group 2007) has been prepared for this meeting and is available as an information document. It includes information on the global conservation status of sharks that is reproduced here, but excludes data on the rays and chimaeras. The background paper also describes the global, regional and national legal and management status of sharks and options for international cooperation under CMS, which, while relevant to other chondrichthyan taxa, are not presented in this document. 1.2 Objectives The primary purpose of this study was to prepare a database of migratory chondrichthyan fishes (the sharks, skates, rays and chimaeras) and to use the database in order to identify potential species that would benefit from a CMS listing due to their current status and conservation needs. The authors were asked to specify the appropriate CMS Appendix for each species, to summarise the main reasons why such a listing would be valuable, and to identify range States that might potentially make specific listing proposals.

Fortunately, Red List assessments have been completed for some 90% of migratory or possibly-migratory species, providing a very good picture of the relative extinction risk for these species. The structure of the database is described in Annex 3. For each species, where known, fields provide taxonomic information, migratory status, distribution (including range States and ocean basins), habitat, depth, IUCN Red List Status (published and in preparation), and management status. Hyperlinks are included to sources such as Fishbase (www.fishbase.org), the IUCN Red List (www.iucnredlist.org), and FAO Factsheets. The database has collated details of approximately 140 migratory and possibly migratory species of chondrichthyan fishes and their conservation status (where known). It was used to extract brief tabulated reports on the distribution, migration and conservation status of these species, which are presented in the following pages. The authors selected 42 species for a more detailed discussion. These were chosen because they appear to warrant further consideration by CMS due to their unfavourable conservation status and the apparent potential for CMS intervention to address this. These species are highlighted in the final section of this report, and their range States are listed in Annex 5. 2.2 Definition of migratory species Species included in this analysis appear, on the basis of current information, to fall under the definition given in Article I of CMS i.e. \u201cthe entire population or any geographically separate part of the population of any species or lower taxon of wild animals, a significant proportion of whose members cyclically and predictably cross one or more national jurisdictional boundaries\u201d. For the purposes of migratory marine species, national jurisdictional boundaries are taken to include not just national boundaries between States, but also the boundaries between the high seas (those that do not fall under the jurisdiction of any State) and States\u2019 Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) or territorial waters (where no EEZ has been declared). Under this definition: i) The word \u201ccyclically\u201d in the phrase \u201ccyclically and predictably\u201d relates to a cycle of any nature, such as astronomical (circadian, annual etc.), life or climatic, and of any frequency. ii) The word \u201cpredictably\u201d in the phrase \u201ccyclically and predictably\u201d implies that a phenomenon can be anticipated to recur in a given set of circumstances, though not necessarily regularly in time. iii) National jurisdictional boundaries include national land and territorial sea borders, and the outer 200 mile EEZ boundary of each nation where this has been declared. While it is easy to identify many chondrichthyan species that are clearly migratory as defined above, published and unpublished data are currently inadequate to identify conclusively all migratory chondrichthyans. Several species are considered to be \u2018possibly migratory\u2019 and described as such in the database where there is evidence suggesting that migrations occur, but their precise nature remains uncertain, or when inferences have been drawn from knowledge of the migratory movements of better known closely related taxa. The GROMS database was consulted and found to include a subset of the species identified by this study, but also some sharks that are apparently not migratory but likely restricted to very small home ranges. 2 Methods, definitions and datasets 3 IUCN SSG/CMS \u2022 Review of Migratory Chondrichthyan Fishes It should be noted that while a species that occurs in more than one ocean basin may undertake seasonal migrations of similar length in different regions, it is possible in one region for the entire migration to be undertaken without crossing a national boundary, whereas in another the migrating stock may cross several because its range States have shorter coastal fringes. The document prepared for the December 2007 CMS shark meeting refers to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the FAO definitions of its Annex 1 \u2018Highly Migratory Species\u2019, \u2018high seas\u2019, transboundary and \u2018straddling fish stocks\u2019.

The list reviewed for this study is still, however, incomplete. Twenty new species have been identified in Indonesia alone during a recently concluded five year study there (White et al. 2007). Six of these are now described and 14 await description; none of these or many other recent discoveries are included in the summary in Annex 4. The Chondrichthyans are the most diverse group of vertebrates after the teleost fishes. They are comprised of the sharks (34 families and about 500 species), batoids (23 families and about 650 species, including skates, stingrays, guitarfishes and sawfishes) and chimaeroid fishes (three families and some 40\u201350 species). The chimaeras fall in Subclass Holocephalii and the sharks and rays in Subclass Elasmobranchii (the latter are also commonly referred to as elasmobranchs). Early classifications divided the elasmobranchs into sharks (Squalii, Pleurotremata) and rays (Batoidea, Hypotremata). Taxonomic research in the 1990\u2019s (e.g. Shirai 1996, de Carvalho 1996, Compagno 2000) subsequently suggested that the elasmobranchs should be subdivided into two Superorders, Squalomorphii (squalomorph sharks, containing the batoids in Order Rajiformes) and Galeomorphii (galeomorph sharks). However, the most recent taxonomy, based on molecular and paleontological analyses of the neoselachians show that the Batoids (skates and rays) are indeed the sister group of the Selachii (sharks), which is divided into Squalomorpha, and Galeomorpha. Thus the batoids are no longer considered to be part of the squalomorphs (Maisey et al. 2004, Musick et al. 2004, Musick and Ellis 2005, Naylor et al. 2005).To further confuse the issue, it is fairly common to refer to all of the chondrichthyan fishes as \u2018sharks\u2019 \u2013 for example this is routine practice in FAO and CITES documents. For the purpose of this study, and recognising that a separate initiative is underway through CMS to consider migratory sharks, the review has been divided into the sharks and the batoid fishes. (No chimaeras have been identified that fulfil the CMS definition of migratory, although some do undertake seasonal breeding migrations from deep to shallow water). 2.4 Ecology and life history The living chondrichthyans are the end products of over 400 million years of evolution. While a few species are similar to their primitive ancestors, modern sharks and rays exhibit advanced characteristics such as placental reproduction and live birth, homothermy, very large brains and extremely sophisticated sensory capacity. They are all predatory, feeding on a wide range of species from zooplankton and tiny benthic invertebrates to large bony fishes including other sharks and, in a few cases, turtles, seabirds and marine mammals. The cartilaginous fishes occupy niches in every marine environment except the deepest oceans below 4,000 m. About 50% of described species occur on continental and insular shelves and slopes to 200 m, 35% in waters deeper than 200 m, much smaller numbers (about 5%) in the open ocean, another 5% in freshwater, and the remainder in several of these habitats. Most species favour temperate to tropical conditions, from coral reefs to cold coastal waters, but some live under the Arctic ice and range into the Antarctic Ocean. The greatest diversity occurs in the tropical Indo-west Pacific Ocean, where a widespread lack of survey and monitoring combined with high pressures on the coastal zone, have the potential to result in extinctions before species can be Review of Migratory Chondrichthyan Fishes \u2022 IUCN SSG/CMS 4 described. There is also significant diversity in continental slope habitats, where chondrichthyan species may be restricted to relatively narrow depth bands. These habitats are also coming under pressure from fisheries expanding into deeper water as shallow stocks become over-exploited.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "88960d00-0c6a-4337-a61b-dc7a497fd1d9": {"__data__": {"id_": "88960d00-0c6a-4337-a61b-dc7a497fd1d9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-migratory-chondrichthyan-fishes", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Review of migratory Chondrichthyan fishes", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-migratory-chondrichthyan-fishes", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a70804cba24d74ad8fc407ea4abc46532b41e46add7abdb1c7c4bb4f026bc575"}, "2": {"node_id": "90b91335-f9ec-4a97-bdfa-e948eeb48c48", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-migratory-chondrichthyan-fishes", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "44c22506024dd869a2d9d0b0df10db921f7b92ee3e33afc58ff5651d17a49fc1"}}, "hash": "32344dd78eacfabbf175add34531a64b079a25f7d0acb6a5ffa4fa5588c88638", "text": "Adult size ranges from less than 10 cm to 20 m.

The majority of threats to these species arise from mortality in fisheries that take unsustainable numbers as part of the target catch, or as a utilised or discarded bycatch. The above summary draws upon Fowler et al. 2004a and Camhi et al. 1998. 2.5 Data sources Much of the analysis presented in this document draws upon published IUCN Red List data, the Red List data sheets submitted in 2006 but not yet published and, to a lesser extent, draft Red List assessments still in preparation by the IUCN Species Survival Commission Shark Specialist Group (SSG). These data sheets include all key literature identified for each species, and have been compiled during the Shark Specialist Group\u2019s Global Assessment of Chondrichthyan Fishes, which is scheduled for completion at the end of 2007. The FAO Catalogue of Sharks of the World (Compagno 1984, 2001 and in preparation) has been a particularly important source of information, both for published Red List assessments and for those species not yet reviewed for the Red List. Finally, SSG members were also consulted and asked for their feedback on the provisional list of migratory species prepared during this study. 2.6 Database structure No database specification was provided for this project. Excel was therefore used for the construction of the prototype migratory shark species database since this can easily be exported into more complex database formats. Annex 3 describes the structure of the database prepared for this study and the fields included. The database includes information, where available, on CMS migratory status, global and regional Red List (threatened) status, legal and management status, range States, and a bibliography. This information is not comprehensive. In particular, information on the national legal and management status of sharks is not readily available and likely incomplete (much of this was obtained in the form of \u2018personal communications\u2019 from the members of the IUCN SSC Shark Specialist Group network who kindly assisted with research for this study). Summing the columns for each State in the \u2018Range\u2019 section of the database provides an index of the number of CMS migratory shark species occurring in each State. This can be sorted to show the range States by the number of shark species occurring in their waters. When these data are amalgamated, the range States can be identified in whose waters the largest number of species of migratory chondrichthyans occur. This analysis is presented in the resources paper prepared for the December 2007 CMS Migratory Shark Meeting (IUCN SSG 2007). 5 IUCN SSG/CMS \u2022 Review of Migratory Chondrichthyan Fishes sharks and slightly over half of all living chondrichthyans, they do include 90% of migratory and potentially migratory species (roughly 70 sharks and 70 batoids). The results of these appraisals, summarised in Table 1, reveal that a much higher percentage of migratory chondrichthyans are of unfavourable conservation status (47.5% are assessed as Threatened: Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable, and 27.5% as Near Threatened), than are non-migratory species (18.9% and 13.4% respectively). The degree of threat to the small number of possibly migratory species (that may meet CMS criteria) is also high. Correspondingly, therefore, a much smaller proportion of migratory species than non-migratory species are Data Deficient or Least Concern.

The most common threat to these species is population depletion caused by fisheries that either target them directly (primary target) or take them as a utilised bycatch (secondary target). In some cases breeding or migrating aggregations are specifically targeted, but this is likely to occur to many more species than noted in the Table (data are very incomplete). A smaller number of species are primarily threatened because of bycatch discard mortality, not because they are utilised in fisheries.

It can be seen from this summary that data are lacking on the migrations of many of the species that taxonomic and regional experts consider are likely or very likely migratory. This is due to the lack of life history information that characterises even relatively common and abundant chondrichthyans. Most have not been the subject of tagging studies. Even when conventional tagging studies have included very large numbers of animals, they do not necessarily provide detailed information on their migratory movements. For example, if research is focused on single study sites it may not yield information on where the animals go between capture events. For example, re-captures of mature females may occur annually, or on alternate years, when they visit pupping grounds to give birth, but if there are no tag returns during the other 11 to 23 months of the breeding cycle, the majority of their range remains unknown. Electronic tracking studies are beginning to provide such data, but have not been widely used.

(2007) The range States for each migratory species listed in the Tables are provided in the database, but it is important to note that many migratory species with an unfavourable status are fished on the high seas or in other States EEZ through fisheries access agreements by vessels flagged in States that are not range States for these species. For example, large numbers of European vessels operate in the Indo-Pacific, where they capture and utilise species that do not occur in European waters. This is where the global and regional membership of regional fisheries bodies (see below) and international biodiversity conventions is particularly important; in many cases the fishing States that are not range States for the species, but are still having a potentially detrimental effect upon stocks of migratory chondrichthyan, may be Party to the international or regional bodies with the capacity to develop management measures for these species. 3.3 Legal and management status A detailed account of the main global and regional measures adopted to date that have the potential to contribute towards the conservation and management of migratory chondrichthyan populations is provided in the resources paper for the December 2007 CMS migratory sharks meeting (IUCN SSG 2007). This document also summarises the lack of implementation and/or generally very poor performance of the global instruments that are in force. In a number of cases (the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the 1995 Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of UNCLOS relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks (the Fish Stocks Agreement, or UNFSA), and the listing of shark species on appendices of CMS and CITES), the measures are too recent realistically to have had much impact upon the status of listed species.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7dce77b8-5cad-44b4-a078-a05d30e8d6b5": {"__data__": {"id_": "7dce77b8-5cad-44b4-a078-a05d30e8d6b5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-migratory-chondrichthyan-fishes", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Review of migratory Chondrichthyan fishes", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-migratory-chondrichthyan-fishes", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0e2326aa44cf8f4164eda7bb3f08231d08754cd33e8d8377ebdefbe6c113f462"}, "2": {"node_id": "5774f606-c53c-4235-bbc7-4772fef122fc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-migratory-chondrichthyan-fishes", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "940d09c641b79e1050aff86ae9dd192aeb61c39724b73936b7ea206214a07360"}}, "hash": "ccdf91d02f4bc19bbee90b10156c8fa4d6449d487d7f173bd726c312b3b922f9", "text": "Progress under the FAO\u2019s voluntary International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA-Sharks), which is intended to operate at national and regional level, has been particularly disappointing during the eight years in which it has been in effect.

The IPOA\u2013Sharks also envisages fisheries management action being taken at regional level. This would be most effective through Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs). They serve as fora through which States meet and cooperate to manage fisheries for the conservation and sustainable use of marine living resources and have a mandate to establish binding management measures for fisheries resources, including on the high seas. To date, RFMO activity with respect to the management of chondrichthyans has largely been confined to the adoption of shark finning bans by the tuna management bodies, some basic catch reporting, and in the case of the International Council for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) an unsatisfactory attempt to develop initial stock assessments for two migratory shark species (lack of catch and to a lesser extent biological data imposed serious limitations on the outputs).

In the case of the batoid fishes, lack of information is an even greater problem than for sharks. Fewer species have been the subject of tagging studies and their migrations are therefore largely unknown. There are also fewer data available on their status and distribution. For this group, therefore, only a few taxa have been selected for initial consideration by CMS because their need appears to be particularly urgent. Apart from these, it is not recommended that other batoid fishes be proposed for listing at present, unless more information becomes available to justify this.

The following species and taxa are considered in taxonomic order, except that all sharks are listed first, followed by batoid species (see Table 2). 4.1 Hexanchus griseus bluntnose sixgill shark This primarily deepwater species is included in this section primarily because it is listed on Appendix I (Highly Migratory Species) of UNCLOS. It is unclear why this species should have been selected for that list, since it is not obviously a strongly migratory species nor, so far as can be ascertained, is it taken in high seas fisheries outside State EEZs. Its IUCN Red List assessment is Near Threatened, recognising that this is a target species that is vulnerable to overexploitation, and that there have been some stock depletions caused by fisheries, albeit not known to be sufficiently serious to warrant a Vulnerable listing (Shark Specialist Group 2000). A CMS Appendix II listing would potentially be appropriate for this species, but it is not considered to be a particularly high priority for CMS action at this time. This initial taxonomic review has identified about 140 migratory or potentially migratory species of chondrichthyan fishes, roughly 50% sharks and 50% batoids. Information on the migrations of many of these species is, however, seriously lacking (particularly for the rays), making it difficult to determine whether it would be appropriate to consider them for listing on CMS, or indeed to judge whether a CMS listing could be applied effectively so as to yield benefits for the species. Many of the species identified in the previous pages are not, therefore, considered further here, although it is likely that some may warrant consideration in the future as knowledge improves. Others may prove in due course not to be migratory under the CMS definition and therefore outside its remit. A number of species and taxonomic groups are, however, identified as worthy of further consideration under CMS at this stage. These are described below. They have been selected on the basis of their conservation status, management needs, and the potential for CMS intervention to add value to current regional management regimes, if these exist, or to stimulate such management if it appears unlikely to take place under current circumstances. The threats to many large wide-ranging pelagic-oceanic chondrichthyan species are very similar: their greatest need is collaborative management measures to regulate the fleets and fisheries that capture them. Unfortunately such regulation appears to be a low priority for national and regional fisheries management bodies at the present time, despite repeated acknowledgement in international fora over the past decade of the urgency of introducing such management. (See resources paper prepared for the December 2007 Shark meeting for a more detailed discussion.) CMS intervention will yield the greatest benefits if it helps to stimulate these measures but, in order to do so, it does not necessarily have to list a large number of qualifying species; many unlisted species will also benefit from any improvements to overall fisheries and bycatch management that CMS may stimulate. Rather than propose very large numbers of migratory requiem sharks with similar conservation problems for listing on CMS, therefore, a relatively small number of the strongest cases have been identified below from family Carcharhinidae. All three large hammerhead sharks 4 Species that may potentially benefit from a CMS listing 33 IUCN SSG/CMS \u2022 Review of Migratory Chondrichthyan Fishes 4.2 Squalus acanthias spiny dogfish or spurdog This highly migratory coastal and shelf shark is globally Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. Regional population status (Table 4) ranges from Least Concern where there is little or no fishing pressure or fisheries are well-regulated, to Endangered and Critically Endangered where stocks have been seriously depleted by unmanaged or poorly managed fisheries (Fordham et al. 2006). Fisheries pose a particular threat to this species because of its highly vulnerable life history (it has a very low intrinsic rate of population increase), high demand for its products in international trade (it is currently proposed for a CITES Appendix II listing), and its vulnerability to the target fisheries that preferentially target aggregations of pregnant females. In the Northern Hemisphere and South America, Squalus acanthias stocks are shared and exploited by more than one coastal State, requiring collaborative management action if they are to be fished sustainably. Such collaborative management either does not exist, or has yet to be demonstrated successfully. This species should certainly be a much higher priority for collaborative management by range States than it appears to be at the present time. It is therefore potentially a high priority for a", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "94d78b85-ecdf-4ac6-a019-9c8087760d42": {"__data__": {"id_": "94d78b85-ecdf-4ac6-a019-9c8087760d42", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-migratory-chondrichthyan-fishes", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Review of migratory Chondrichthyan fishes", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-migratory-chondrichthyan-fishes", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b91471763fe57a9b46e9b3efa7a5537dc147e7333ca098e6265566a6411c9abf"}, "3": {"node_id": "777f5961-5868-49b8-a151-9e6eeae707d4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-migratory-chondrichthyan-fishes", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca5ba1342ca9319e263941d965afa7e21196493cb83e42c05c3577c285a13270"}}, "hash": "a8a9369309bc70699c9e508044fa209831abb4e625c0f5616f49274c5a59c6b6", "text": "CMS Appendix II listing. The purpose of such a listing would be to help drive the improvements in regional management that are so urgently needed; this might be achieved by prompting improved synergies between environment and fisheries management authorities, since only a small number of fisheries management bodies appear so far to consider this species a high priority for action despite many years\u2019 discussion of this species as a possible candidate for CITES Appendix II. Range States that might consider proposing Squalus acanthias for a CMS Appendix II listing include Germany, which has taken a strong leadership role over the proposal to list this species on CITES, with particular support from Georgia, which offered to co-sponsor the proposal. Other range States that strongly supported the proposal to list this species on CITES during consultations and in internal EU discussions (where the CITES listing proposal was approved without opposition) included Albania, Latvia, Lithuania, Monaco, Netherlands, Poland and the UK. 4.3 Squatina squatina angel shark This formerly common coastal shark is a Northeast Atlantic endemic that undertakes seasonal migrations, at least in the northern part of its range. It has been assessed as Critically Endangered because it has become extremely rare in, if not extirpated from, large areas of its former range (which extended from Norway and North Sea to the Mediterranean and Western Sahara) (Morey et al. 2006). It is listed on Annex III of the Bern Convention and was proposed in 2002 by the UK and Belgium for listing on the OSPAR Priority List of Threatened and Endangered Species. Although this proposal was deemed appropriate by the ICES Study Group on Elasmobranch Fishes (ICES 2002), the scientific advisory body for fisheries in the region, the nomination was not adopted by OSPAR. A new proposal from Germany will be considered by OSPAR in 2007. This species is also a high priority for a CMS Appendix I listing, which has the potential to yield important benefits for this species since it would stimulate strict legal protection from the CMS Parties whose waters cover a large part of its range. It should be noted, however, that the species is now so seriously depleted in (if not extirpated from) the northern part of its range, where seasonal migrations were presumably formerly most common, that it may be difficult to determine how much migratory activity still takes place. Figure 1. Global distribution of Squalus acanthias Figure 2. Global distribution of Squatina squatina Review of Migratory Chondrichthyan Fishes \u2022 IUCN SSG/CMS 34 Range States that might consider proposing Squatina squatina for a CMS listing include Germany, Belgium and the UK, all of which have proposed this species for listing on OSPAR during the past five years. 4.4 Carcharias taurus sandtiger, grey nurse, ragged tooth shark This large slow-moving coastal shark occurs in disjunct populations in most sub-tropical, warm-temperate oceans, with the exception of the Eastern Pacific. Seasonal migrations, probably governed by water temperature, have been observed in the western North Atlantic. Similar migrations are also thought to occur in subtropical areas of the southwest Atlantic and off southern Africa, where they are likely to include movements between range States. Migrating sharks exhibit philopatry: they regularly return to very small home areas after undertaking long migrations. The species is currently on the IUCN Red List as Vulnerable globally, as a result of depletion in target and utilised bycatch fisheries. It is taken in small numbers for display in large public aquaria and is economically- important for dive ecotourism in some regions (Pollard and Smith 2000). Some seriously depleted regional populations are assessed as Endangered or Critically Endangered; others are \u2018only\u2019 Near Threatened. The species is currently under consideration for uplist to Endangered globally and would certainly benefit from higher global awareness of its threatened status and the importance of collaborative management (if not strict protection) for migrating stocks. A CMS Appendix II listing would potentially stimulate improved management of these migratory stocks by helping to drive the improvements in regional management that are so urgently needed. This could be achieved by prompting improved synergies between environment and fisheries management authorities; this species is managed under environmental legislation in some States, fisheries legislation in others, but remains unmanaged in much of its range.

Australia is an important range State and places a very high priority on the conservation of this species, which is strictly protected, but does not share its stocks with any other range State. 4.5 Alopias pelagicus, A. supercilious, A. vulpinus thresher sharks Family Alopiidae \u2013 the thresher sharks, is comprised of three species of large-eyed sharks with hugely elongated, curved whip-like caudal fins as long as their bodies. A. pelagicus occurs in the Indo-Pacific Ocean, A. superciliosus is almost circumglobal except in the North Pacific and Southern Ocean, and A. vulpinus is globally distributed. Their migrations are not well studied, but all are likely migratory within at least parts of their range. Thresher sharks have valuable meat and fins. All three species were assessed in 2007 as Vulnerable because of the serious declines in their populations that have been caused by target and utilised bycatch fisheries in coastal waters and on the high seas (these assessments have not yet been published). The whole family is listed on Annex I, Figure 3. Global distribution of Carcharias taurus Figure 4. Global distribution of Alopias pelagicus 35 IUCN SSG/CMS \u2022 Review of Migratory Chondrichthyan Fishes Highly Migratory Species, of UNCLOS, in recognition of the importance of collaborative management for thresher shark stocks. As can be seen in Table 5, however, very few range States and no regional fisheries management bodies appear to have introduced management measures for these species. They certainly warrant a much higher priority for collaborative management by range States than is currently the case. A CMS Appendix II listing could help drive the improvements in national and regional management that are so urgently needed; for example by prompting improved synergies between environment and fisheries management authorities, since so few of the latter appear to consider the thresher sharks a priority for action. Because these species are very similar in appearance and have a partly overlapping distribution, it would seem most practical to seek to list all three on CMS. Range States that might consider proposing family Alopiidae for a CMS listing because they are range States for more than one species and/or have demonstrated an interest in shark conservation and management issues include South Africa, India, Ecuador, Kenya, Portugal, UK, and several other EU States. 4.6 Isurus oxyrinchus shortfin mako and I. paucus longfin mako The mako sharks are among the five members of family Lamnidae (which includes the white shark, already listed on CMS Appendix I and II). Makos are large, fast swimming oceanic sharks with large fins and a crescent-shaped tail with pronounced keels. They are extremely valuable in target and utilised bycatch fisheries for their meat and fins and populations have declined significantly. Shortfin mako was recently uplisted from Near Threatened to Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened species. Longfin mako is listed as Vulnerable (Reardon et al. 2005). Results from a large tagging study in the North Atlantic have demonstrated shortfin mako movements of well over 3,000 km; similar migrations are likely to take place in other parts of its global range in temperate and tropical oceans (this is probably the fastest-swimming shark in the world). The longfin mako is not so well known and may not be as fast and active as the shortfin, but is also likely to be migratory in its tropical oceanic range. The latter species is most common in the Western Atlantic and Central Pacific, possibly rare elsewhere. The lamnids are listed on Annex I, Highly Migratory Species, of UNCLOS, in recognition of the importance of collaborative management for Figure 5.

There is a very large number of Range States listed in Annex 5 that might consider proposing either or both of the mako sharks for a CMS listing. They include most EU Parties to CMS, Ecuador, India, Kenya and Uruguay. Fewer range States are confirmed for longfin mako, but these include Portugal, Madagascar, South Africa and several west African States with a strong interest in shark conservation and management (Cape Verde, Guinea- Bissau and Mauritania). 4.7 Lamna nasus porbeagle shark The porbeagle shark is another member of family Lamnidae. It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because of the past and ongoing declines in its populations caused by target fisheries and utilised bycatch of this highly valuable species. It has been target fished for its meat for many decades in the North Atlantic, where stocks are assessed as Critically Endangered and Endangered, and it is currently under consideration for an Appendix II listing on CITES. The Critically Endangered northeast Atlantic stock continues to be targeted because of the vulnerability of aggregations of this species. (In contrast, the lightly fished northern Pacific sister species, Lamna ditropis, has recently been assessed as Least Concern.) (Stevens et al. 2005). Migrations have been described in the North Atlantic, including some exchange across the ocean basin although this is primarily a coastal and continental shelf species. The structure and migrations of the southern hemisphere population(s) are very poorly known, but porbeagle is assessed as Near Threatened in most of these regions because of increasing fishing pressure in many areas combined with their high commercial value. As already noted, all lamnids are listed on Annex I, Highly Migratory Species, of UNCLOS, in recognition of the importance of collaborative management for these sharks. As can be seen from Table 5 however, only a few range States and no regional fisheries bodies have introduced sustainable management for the porbeagle shark, despite many years\u2019 discussion of this species as a possible candidate for a CITES Appendix II listing. The porbeagle shark certainly warrants a much higher priority for collaborative management by range States than is currently the case. A CMS Appendix II listing could help to drive the improvements in regional management that are required; for example by prompting improved synergies between environment and fisheries management authorities. Range States that might consider proposing the porbeagle shark for a CMS listing include Germany, which initiated the proposal to list this species on CITES, with support during consultations from many other EU States, Albania, Madagascar and Monaco. 4.8 Galeorhinus galeus tope or soupfin shark Galeorhinus galeus is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because of the past and ongoing declines in many populations that have been caused by target fisheries harvesting the meat, fins and liver oil of this valuable species, although the conservation status of many stocks is unknown (Walker et al. 2005). Galeorhinus fisheries sometimes target aggregations. It is a highly migratory species, travelling up to 16,000 km. Australia is the only range State that is paying close attention to managing this species, as a result of former serious depletion of the stock in the target southern shark fishery. Requests Figure 9. Global distribution of Lamna nasus 37 IUCN SSG/CMS \u2022 Review of Migratory Chondrichthyan Fishes from CITES in recent years for an improved focus on the assessment and management of Galeorhinus stocks, including through FAO, have so far been ignored by regional fisheries bodies and range States. This species certainly warrants a much higher priority for collaborative management by range States and through regional fisheries bodies than it is receiving. A CMS Appendix II listing could help to drive the improvements in national and regional management that are required if this species is to be managed sustainably. Range States that might consider proposing Galeorhinus galeus for a CMS listing include Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Ecuador, Germany, Israel, Malta, Mauritania, Monaco, Netherlands, Portugal, Senegal, South Africa, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

These include the potential difficulty of making a strong case for listing because of a lack of data, identification difficulties, because it is not clear how a CMS listing could lead to management improvements, or because they might benefit indirectly anyway from the management measures that might be pursued under CMS or alternative regional management arrangements for the other migratory carcharhinid sharks for which a stronger case for listing is possible. The six species that are considered to be of highest priority for consideration by CMS are described below. Several other carcharhinid species are considered to be of slightly lower priority on the basis of their conservation status, migratory data and geographical distribution. They include Carcharhinus brachyurus bronze whaler shark, C. brevipinna spinner shark, C. galapagensis Galapagos shark, C. limbatus blacktip shark and C. perezi Caribbean reef shark. The two lemon sharks Negaprion species appear, on the basis of current knowledge, not to undertake sufficient migratory activity definitely to qualify under CMS. These and the other carcharhinids listed in Table 2 are not, therefore, considered below in detail, but could prove to warrant further consideration on another occasion when more data are available. Successful listings of some or all of the species listed below would probably also yield significant management improvements for the lower priority species of carcharhinid sharks, since fairly broad improvements to the management of fisheries would be required for any wide-ranging species of shark that was listed from this taxonomic group. 4.10 Carcharhinus falciformis silky shark The silky shark is one of the largest carcharhinids. It occurs in semi-pelagic coastal and oceanic shelf and slope waters of all tropical ocean basins, less commonly in the open ocean, and is likely to migrate across the boundaries of State EEZs. It is naturally one of the most abundant oceanic sharks and has been taken in very large numbers as a bycatch in pelagic fisheries, since it is often associated with tuna and may aggregate with target species. This bycatch is utilised for its fins. Although originally listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, silky shark is being uplisted to Near Threatened because the intense fishing pressure experienced throughout its Figure 10. Global distribution of Galeorhinus galeus Figure 11. Global distribution of Carcharhinus falciformis Review of Migratory Chondrichthyan Fishes \u2022 IUCN SSG/CMS 38 range is known or inferred to have caused extremely steep population declines in some regions (these populations are Vulnerable). It is completely unmanaged in most of its range. This species certainly warrants a much higher priority for collaborative management by range States and through regional fisheries bodies than it is receiving. A CMS Appendix II listing could help to drive the improvements in national and regional management that are required if this species is to be managed sustainably. Over 40 range States are also Party to CMS and might consider proposing silky shark for a CMS Appendix II listing (Annex 5), including Angola, Australia, Chile, Congo, Ecuador, Egypt, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea- Bissau, India, Israel, Jordan, Madagascar, Mauritius, Nigeria, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Samoa, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Togo, Yemen. 4.11 Carcharhinus leucas bull shark Bull shark is assessed as Near Threatened globally on the IUCN Red List, with some populations Vulnerable because of the susceptibility of this large shark to depletion in target and bycatch fisheries and the impact of other human impacts upon its largely coastal tropical and subtropical habitat (Simpfendorfer and Burgess 2000, Wintner et al. in prep.). It undertakes long distance seasonal and breeding migrations along coasts, into estuaries and long distances up rivers, and it is occasionally recorded from oceanic islands. Very few range States have established any management for this species, despite its importance for commercial and recreational fisheries and occasionally dive tourism. The bull shark would benefit from collaborative management by range States (coastal and riverine) and through regional initiatives.

It is thought likely to be highly migratory in the surface waters it inhabits, although it is uncertain how frequently it enters State EEZs during these migrations because it is most abundant well away from land. Management measures are largely confined to finning bans on the high seas that should reduce bycatch mortality. The high value of this species\u2019 fins and steep population declines recently observed indicate that it should be a much higher priority for collaborative management by range States and particularly on the high seas. A CMS Appendix II listing could help to drive the improvements in national and regional management that are required if this species is to be managed sustainably. Figure 13. Global distribution of Carcharhinus longimanus Figure 12.

Range States that might consider proposing this species for a CMS listing because there have been particularly serious declines in their waters include Panama and EU States with Territories in the Caribbean (France, Netherlands, and the United Kingdom). Others are listed in Annex 5. 4.13 Carcharhinus obscurus dusky shark The dusky shark is a large wide-ranging coastal and pelagic warm water species with a patchy distribution, which is among the slowest-growing, latest-maturing of known sharks. It undertakes long distance coastal seasonal and breeding migrations. The dusky shark\u2019s very low intrinsic rate of increase means that it is very vulnerable to exploitation and as slow to recover from depletion as the great whales. It is difficult to manage or protect because, in addition to being the subject of target fisheries for meat and fins, it is caught in many non-target fisheries and suffers from high bycatch mortality even if legally protected. It has recently been uplisted from Near Threatened to Vulnerable globally, with the Northwest Atlantic population assessed as Endangered because of serious depletion despite many years of management effort and, more recently, strict legal protection in the USA. It is generally unmanaged elsewhere in its global warm water range. Dusky shark requires a very much higher priority for management by range States and through regional initiatives than it is currently receiving outside the USA. A CMS Appendix II listing could help to drive the improvements in national and regional management that are required if this species is to recover from depletion and become managed sustainably. Indeed, the species is so very vulnerable to over-exploitation that it may qualify for an Appendix I listing, at least in parts of its range. Because of its patchy distribution, there are relatively few confirmed range States that are also Party to CMS and might, therefore, consider proposing dusky shark for a CMS listing: Australia, Cape Verde, Egypt, Eritrea Saudi Arabia, Senegal, South Africa, Spain, Yemen. 4.14 Carcharhinus plumbeus sandbar shark This is another large coastal shark with a global distribution in warm temperate and tropical waters that is taken in target and bycatch fisheries for its meat and large fins. It has also recently been uplisted from Near Threatened to Vulnerable globally on the IUCN Red List, with some stocks Endangered because of depletion in fisheries. It is biologically less vulnerable than the dusky shark and its stocks are therefore better able to recover under management from a depleted state. Sandbar sharks migrate seasonally along the coast, sometimes in large schools. As for the dusky shark, this species is largely unmanaged outside the US Atlantic coast. This species certainly warrants a much higher priority for collaborative management by range States and through regional fisheries bodies than it is receiving. A CMS Appendix II listing could help to drive the improvements in national and regional management that are required if this species is to be managed sustainably.

It is an active schooling shark that migrates vertically into shallower water at night and is thought to make seasonal geographic migrations. Tagging data show that this species moves across the US EEZ (Kohler et al. 1998). It is the most important elasmobranch species in commercial seamount fisheries off northern Brazil and significant declines have been documented in catches throughout its range in the tropical western Atlantic (Castro et al. 1999). The night shark is assessed as Vulnerable globally on the IUCN Red List, based on significant population declines throughout its Western Atlantic range due to target and bycatch exploitation by fisheries for its meat and fins, which although now managed in US waters, is not the case elsewhere in the region (Santana et al. 2006). A CMS Appendix II listing could help to drive the improvements in national and regional management that are required if this species is to be managed sustainably. Fifteen range States are Party to CMS and might consider proposing night shark for a CMS Appendix II listing (Annex 5): Angola, Cameroon, Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, Togo, Uruguay. 4.16 Prionace glauca blue shark The blue shark is one of the most abundant, well- studied and possibly the widest-ranging of all pelagic sharks. It undertakes very long distance possibly almost continuous migrations across and around ocean basins, entering range State EEZs and covering long distances on the high seas. Its migrations are very complex, relating to prey availability and breeding cycles, with segregation by sex and reproductive stage. Fortunately this is a fairly fecund species, maturing at 5\u20137 years old, giving birth to an average of 35 pups per litter each year, which has enabled it to support extremely high fishery capture rates. Maximum sustainable yield is estimated as 7\u201312 million sharks per annum. Catches are hugely under recorded, but an estimated 11 million (range 5\u201316 million) blue sharks are estimated to enter the global fin trade annually, indicating that the total taken by target and bycatch fisheries is even higher than this. Catch declines of 40%, 60% and 80% have been reported in some studies, while others show no trend. Despite major concerns over the sustainability of these catch rates, continued high fishing pressure and the lack of management or restrictions on fishing effort in most of its range, the blue shark is still only listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List (Stevens 2000). This is mainly due to its abundance and hence the inability of the Shark Specialist Group to reach consensus over the degree of risk of extinction for such a wide-spread species. Regional assessments are also still under debate. There is no disagreement, however, over the urgency of introducing management for this species; unfortunately no large-scale collaborative/regional management actions currently seem likely, other than those delivered through shark finning bans. The blue shark is certainly in urgent need of collaborative management by range States and through regional fisheries bodies, but appears not to be a high priority for action at the present time. A CMS Appendix II listing could help to drive the improvements in national and regional management that are required if this species is to be managed sustainably. A very large number of blue shark range States that are also Party to CMS are listed in Annex 5. In view of the particularly poor status of Mediterranean and North Atlantic blue sharks, it might be appropriate to consider range States from these areas: Albania, Algeria, Cyprus, Figure 17.

These species occur worldwide in tropical and warm temperate seas, in coastal waters, on or near continental shelves and seamounts, sometimes in large schools. Some are widely distributed and fairly well- studied; others have a fairly limited distribution and are poorly known with little or no information on possible migrations. Eusphyra blochii, Sphyrna corona, S. media and S. tudes are not sufficiently well-understood to warrant consideration under CMS at the present time. S. tiburo is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, thus in favourable conservation status and does not qualify for consideration. The three largest and globally distributed species, Sphyrna lewini scalloped hammerhead, S. mokarran great hammerhead, and S. zygaena smooth hammerhead, do qualify for consideration by CMS because they are known to be migratory and are certainly of unfavourable conservation status. S. lewini and S. mokarran have both been reassessed recently as Endangered because of the steep population declines driven by target fisheries and high bycatch mortality (hammerheads die quickly when taken in nets or by hook and line and are also utilised for their valuable fins). S. lewini is an aggregating seasonally-migratory species at least in part of its continental and insular shelf distribution. Its aggregations are targeted by fisheries. S. mokarran is not usually found in aggregations but is Figure 18. Global distribution of Sphyrna lewini Figure 19. Global distribution of Sphyrna mokarran Figure 20. Global distribution of Sphyrna zygaena Review of Migratory Chondrichthyan Fishes \u2022 IUCN SSG/CMS 42 nomadic and migratory in its worldwide coastal-pelagic tropical range. S. zygaena is assessed as Near Threatened as a result of less serious declines in fisheries (although this may require reassessment and some stocks may be more seriously threatened) (Simpfendorfer 2000). The young of S. zygaena occur in huge migrating schools. All three of these rather similar species would benefit from collaborative management initiated under a CMS Appendix II listing, since they are fished by many range States that currently have little or no management for hammerheads. A large number of CMS Parties are range States for all three large hammerhead sharks (see Annex 5), aware of the problems that illegal and unregulated fisheries pose to these species, and might potentially consider proposing one or more for a CMS Appendix II or I listing. These include several West African and Mediterranean States, India, Ecuador (where there has been much illegal fishing for hammerheads in the Galapagos Marine Park), and many others. 4.19 Family Pristidae, sawfishes Five of the seven species in family Pristidae, sawfishes, are migratory or potentially migratory: Anoxypristis cuspidata, Pristis microdon, Pristis pectinata, Pristis perotteti, and Pristis pristis. All are very seriously depleted, extirpated from large parts of their range, and listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (Compagno et al. 2006a, Compagno et al. 2006b, Adams et al. 2006, Charvet-Almeida et al. 2007, Cook and Compagno 2000).

A CMS Appendix I listing would yield significant benefit for one of the most endangered groups of chondrichthyan fishes if it resulted in strict protection being extended to larger numbers of sawfishes in larger numbers of range States. In view of their wide range and acutely threatened status, combined with a high cultural importance in some parts of the world, there is a large number of range States that might be willing to consider proposing the sawfishes, Family Pristidae, for a CMS Appendix I listing. These include Australia (on the assumption that sawfishes migrate between Northern Australia and Indonesia), Ecuador, India, Kenya, South Africa, some of the Arabian States, and several West African States (e.g. Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Mauritania, Senegal). 4.20 Myliobatoids, eagle rays Three of the 21 species of eagle rays have been selected for consideration by CMS. These are the longheaded eagle ray Aetobatus flagellum, spotted eagle ray or bonnet ray Aetobatus narinari, and the banded or Nieuhof\u2019s eagle ray Aetomylaeus nichofii. Aetobatus narinari spotted eagle ray is the most common and best studied of these species. It is a very active swimmer in tropical and warm temperate seas almost worldwide, occurring from the seabed to the surface, sometimes leaping out of the sea, and its ability to cover long distances is evidenced by its occurrence in many oceanic islands and atolls. It is usually seen in what may be small social groups as well as in schools of 100 or more. This is a spectacular animal that is a major attraction for dive tourism. Females produce one to four live pups per litter. It is assessed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List because it is a common utilised bycatch in various fisheries across large parts of its range that are likely to have caused population depletion because of its low reproductive potential. A Vulnerable listing is warranted in Southeast Asia where fishing pressure is particularly intense and the species is a common component of landings. With further data this species will likely fall into a threatened category in other 43 IUCN SSG/CMS \u2022 Review of Migratory Chondrichthyan Fishes regions also (Kyne et al. 2005). For example, although specific details are not available, pressure on the inshore environment through artisanal fishing activities off West Africa, eastern Africa, throughout the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal and in large portions of the species\u2019 American range has likely affected this species. There is nothing to suggest that pressure will decrease in these regions in the future. In a few parts of its range (e.g. South Africa, the Maldives, the USA and Australia) the species faces lower levels of threat, but overall, pressure on the species is high and likely to cause population depletions. The only known protection for this animal throughout its global distribution is on the US Atlantic coast. Aetobatus flagellum longheaded eagle ray is an uncommon Indo-West Pacific eagle ray, with a fairly limited distribution from the Red Sea to Japan and China. It is highly susceptible to a variety of fishing methods in regions where the level of exploitation of marine resources is extremely high and increasing. All caught are retained in most areas. This species is assessed as Endangered on the basis of inferred past and projected future declines due to the very high (and increasing) level of fishing pressure throughout its range, which is of great concern given that it is a naturally very uncommon species with limiting life history characteristics (White 2005). There are no known protection measures for this species at present. Aetomylaeus nichofii banded eagle ray is a wide- ranging but rare, little known eagle ray, occurring from the Indian subcontinent through Southeast Asia to Australia and Japan. It is a major commercial eagle ray that is marketed throughout its range, except in northern Australia. This species is naturally rare and has declined due to heavy trawling in Southeast Asia since the 1960s. It is assessed as Vulnerable, given actual (and increasing) levels of exploitation, observed and inferred declines, rarity and low fecundity (Kyne et al. 2003).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6860bc27-fa64-42bf-bb43-e1af753302a7": {"__data__": {"id_": "6860bc27-fa64-42bf-bb43-e1af753302a7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-migratory-chondrichthyan-fishes", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Review of migratory Chondrichthyan fishes", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-migratory-chondrichthyan-fishes", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f7e669bc4495e229acd27fe42f33db7b7c9df689649bba3e323daf19f267cd3"}, "2": {"node_id": "0bf7d8d0-5242-4bef-8687-1fdd8ec5f71e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-migratory-chondrichthyan-fishes", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "688d09f143fafeb7650524fc1e612a3820204bb647e99a616c79727fff547eca"}}, "hash": "2cef4806df7163e4a1027aa453f8f0ede4a886a26c47afbfab11150960bcac87", "text": "2003).

They could benefit from the introduction of collaborative management introduced under an Appendix II listing and from protection as the result of an Appendix I listing. 4.21 Genus Rhinoptera, cownose rays The cownose rays tend to swim almost continuously in groups or very large schools. Many species are considered to be seasonally migratory and several of these migratory or possibly migratory species have been assessed as Threatened or Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List. These are the Brazilian cownose ray Rhinoptera brasiliensis (EN), Javanese cownose ray R. javanica (VU), cownosed ray R. bonasus (NT), Lusitanian cownose ray R. marginata (NT) and hawkray R. steindachneri (NT). Aggregations of R. marginata are targeted as they migrate along the West African coast. Rhinopterids are regularly landed around the world and heavy pressure on the inshore ecosystem is having negative impacts on many of these species. For example, R. javanica occurs in coastal inshore waters in depths less than 30 m, including estuarine and brackish waters, where fishing pressure is typically very heavy and unregulated, especially in Southeast Asia. Although catch data are lacking, this species\u2019 small litter size, its tendency to form large schools, its inshore and estuarine habitat and hence availability to a wide variety of inshore fishing gear, its marketability and the generally intense and unregulated nature of inshore fisheries all raise concerns for its conservation status. Despite a lack of species-specific catch data, declines are inferred across its range, warranting a global Vulnerable assessment (Dudley et al. 2005). There is no existing legislation for this species. R. steindachneri is one of the most common batoid species landed in both the northern Gulf of California (GOC) and Pacific Mexico, where it is taken almost exclusively with bottom set gillnets, but may be landed in nearshore surface gillnets and longlines as well. Furthermore, many embayments and estuaries (used by this species for feeding and reproduction) in this area are being modified to accommodate shrimp farming, which could have a detrimental impact on its abundance in affected areas (Smith and Bizzaro 2005). Despite a lack of catch data and specific information on the movements of most of these species, their schooling nature, inshore habitat, together with their relatively late maturity and low productivity (generally one young per litter) increases their susceptibility to overexploitation and will limit their ability to recover from population decline. Review of Migratory Chondrichthyan Fishes \u2022 IUCN SSG/CMS 44 Rhinopterids are also known to inhabit estuarine areas where fishing pressure is also extremely high and where (in Southeast Asia at least) pollution is also a major factor for all marine life. Collaborative management for these species is unknown \u2013 indeed there seem to be very few national management measures in place. CMS could help to instigate management cooperation for these threatened migratory rays. Many CMS Parties are range States for one or more species (see Annex 5) and might be prepared to consider developing listing proposals for individual species or perhaps the entire genus. 4.22 Manta birostris manta ray The manta is a member of family Mobulidae (devil rays). It is the world\u2019s largest living ray and like some other very large chondrichthyans, a harmless plankton feeder. It occurs throughout the world\u2019s tropical seas, from coasts to open oceans, but it is uncertain how much exchange takes place between different stocks or whether the populations in different oceans may actually be separate species. The manta ray is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List, with some regional stocks Vulnerable as a result of declines driven by target and bycatch fisheries for their meat and gill rakers (apparently increasingly utilised in traditional Chinese medicine). Target fisheries for this species currently exist in several countries, including the Philippines, Mexico, Mozambique, Madagascar, India, Sri Lanka, Brazil, Tanzania and Indonesia; regional population declines have been recorded.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d9f09148-01af-41c4-b2c9-8735fd2c208d": {"__data__": {"id_": "d9f09148-01af-41c4-b2c9-8735fd2c208d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-migratory-chondrichthyan-fishes", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Review of migratory Chondrichthyan fishes", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-migratory-chondrichthyan-fishes", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "69c00272ff7013f241c489e32d96413ef1297a9921140526d52952499e805700"}, "2": {"node_id": "f51f510c-a9aa-47bf-92b0-1287e8f4e661", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-migratory-chondrichthyan-fishes", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ad36392a5a4c9c195b0a5ada5083dd481795c090d2227a194a80ce30ea56422e"}}, "hash": "a88d63e62131c45405a8bde547f333327f5dae7daf24407290bc0e7c3d50e905", "text": "Unfished populations are not thought to be seriously threatened, however it is not well understood how their use of inshore areas around inhabited coastlines might be affected by anthropogenic influences such as pollution, coastal development, and eco-tourism pressures (Marshall et al. 2006).

Other studies on populations with year-round sightings and high re-sighting rates reveal that a portion of the population is resident while a subset of the population appears to engage in larger migrations. In a few sites, mantas have been well documented to be seasonal and management plans for areas with open populations will have to include all other parts of their home range to be effective. Range States for mantas that have protected or are considering protecting this species and are also CMS Parties include the Philippines, South Africa and New Zealand. Other range States are listed in Annex 5. 4.23 Genus Mobula, devil rays Genus Mobula contains nine of the ten members of family Mobulidae. These are large, warm water filter- feeding epipelagic rays that give birth to single large pups after a long gestation. The devil rays generally have a relatively small range and few range States, particularly when compared with the manta ray. Most are considered migratory or, for the lesser-known species, likely migratory. Distribution maps are not available for these species, with the exception of Mobula munkiana (Figure 21). This is included to illustrate the poor availability of data for some of these species; it is possible that M. munkiana is far more widely distributed between the two locations shown, but is commonly misidentified as another species of Mobula. Those species for which sufficient information is available to develop IUCN Red List assessments range from Figure 21. Global distribution of Mobula munkiana FAO ECP 1995 45 IUCN SSG/CMS \u2022 Review of Migratory Chondrichthyan Fishes Endangered to Near Threatened. They are, like manta rays, taken in target and bycatch fisheries for their meat and gill rakers. Concern over the sustainability of these fisheries has resulted in their legal protection or consideration for legal protection in some range States (Philippines, Mexico, New Zealand) and the listing on the Barcelona Convention of the likely Mediterranean endemic, the Endangered giant devil ray Mobula mobular. The devil rays have also been noted by CITES as species of concern in need of greater management attention. Other species with unfavourable status include spinetail devil ray Mobula japanica (NT) (which has a fairly large range), Monk\u2019s devil ray Mobula munkiana (NT), box ray Mobula tarapacana (NT) and bentfin devil ray Mobula thurstoni (NT). M. japonica, M. tarapanca and M. thurstoni are all considered Vulnerable in Southeast Asia where catches and demand are increasing (White et al. 2005, Clark et al. 2005ab). The high value of gill rakers in some areas is driving a dramatic increase in the catch of mobulids in Indonesia where devil rays are now targeted. They appear to be particularly susceptible to overfishing as their fecundity is among the lowest of all elasmobranchs. Options for listing on CMS range from selecting one or two of the more widely distributed species (M. japonica or M. mobular) for listing on Appendix I and II, or also to include the threatened species with a smaller range for listing on Appendix I. There are many CMS Parties that are range States for one or more of these species \u2013 see Annex 5.

Regional Fisheries Bodies by CMS Region This sheet presents the acronyms for all relevant Regional Fisheries Bodies within each CMS Region. The Ocean that each RFB applies to (Atlantic, Pacific or Indian) and the type of body (Management, Scientific, Advisory) are given next to each, under the \u2018Type\u2019 field. Each RFB name is also hyperlinked directly to the webpage for each body, and the full name of each body has been added to the screen tip, so just hover over the link to see the name of the body in full. Ultimately, the intention is to link this by the range States and management for each species, but this may not be workable until the database is migrated to table format in another programme. Sheet 3. Range In the same way as for Ocean Region, the list of range States for each species is marked by a \u20181\u2019, so that species may be filtered by country, to allow the total number of species occurring in each country to be calculated using the Sum feature in Excel, and to facilitate the format for transfer to an Access-based database. A \u2018?\u2019 denotes where a species is may occur within a range State, but its presence is not confirmed. The Range States are organised according to CMS Biogeographical Region, to allow comparisons between regions. I would like to add the CMS Status (i.e. Party, Non-party, MoU, etc) of each of these countries to this sheet, and am considering the best place and way in which to record this. Sheets 4 and 5. RL Sum ONLY Migratory sp and RL Sum Migratory & Potential These sheets present some summaries from the Red List status data within the database. Each sheet provides a breakdown of the number and % of species in each category on the 2006 RL (Globally, regionally and by individual region, where possible). Sheet 4 (RL Sum ONLY Migratory sp), gives this ONLY for the species strongly suspected as being migratory (i.e. those listed as Migratory under \u2018CMS Migratory\u2019 in Sheet 1, Column G). Sheet 5 RL Sum Migratory and Potential, gives this for all species, including those listed as \u2018Potential\u2019 migrators. Under both, summaries of the Global Status, and Regional status of all evaluated species are listed. Sheet 6. Bibliography The bibliography can be filtered by Region(s), Specie(s), Citation and Reference. This is being built on, and can be hyperlinked to the main database itself where each citation is referred to at a later stage. There is also the potential to link directly to the documents themselves from here, if these could be collected and if the database will not be published. (The Red List Assessments, for which links are provided, also give references relevant to each species).

Existing regulations do not adequately protect the environment of Antarctica from tourism impacts, which include damage at visitor sites and along travel routes, and the disturbance of wildlife. The negative impacts of tourism compound other threats to Antarctica\u2019s biodiversity, which risk the survival of many species and the continent\u2019s ability to help regulate the global climate. Tourism in Antarctica must be effectively and proactively managed, with new safeguards based on science and informed by best practice. Download June 2023 What is the issue? Since the early 1990s tourism in Antarctica has grown continually. Between 1992 and 2020, the number of tourists arriving increased ten-fold, rising to 75,000 in the 2019-20 season and again to 104,897 in the 2022-23 season. Antarctic tourism has both positive and negative impacts. The Antarctic tourist experience can be both inspirational and educational, fostering public support and investment for the continent\u2019s protection. On the other hand, Antarctic travel has a high carbon footprint. Tourist activities can also cause damage at visitor sites and along travel routes, and disturb wildlife. For example, research has shown that tourist activities are causing penguin species to change their reproductive and social behaviours. Tourists interacting with a Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) colony at a popular visitor site Photo: \u00a9 Daniela Cajiao Measures are therefore needed to better protect the environment of Antarctica from tourism, but there are gaps in existing governance frameworks. All activities in Antarctica are regulated through the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS), which includes The Madrid Protocol. The Protocol provides broad rules for tourism, however day-to-day management is mostly self-regulated by the industry through guidance issued by the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO). Many researchers and conservation organisations are concerned that self-regulation is no longer sufficient to protect Antarctica\u2019s wildlife and ecosystems from the impacts of tourism. Why is this important? The protection of the Antarctic environment is vital to achieve global goals for nature, climate and sustainable development. However, as the Antarctic tourism industry grows and diversifies, the severity of its negative environmental impacts is likely to increase. If left unchecked, these impacts will be exacerbated by the effects of climate change. For example, reduced sea ice and increased ice-free land areas mean that tourists can visit previously inaccessible places, and a warmer climate will allow the industry to extend the tourist season. The negative impacts of tourism compound other threats to Antarctica\u2019s wildlife and ecosystems, such as climate change and invasive alien species. Combined, these threaten the continent\u2019s unique biodiversity, including species such as krill, fish, seals, whales, penguins and other seabirds, as well as putting at risk Antarctica\u2019s ability to help regulate the global climate. Visitor trends, fastest-growing source markets, distribution of visitor sites and growth in tourism activities data source: IAATO What can be done? Tourism in Antarctica must be effectively and proactively managed, with decisions based on science and informed by best practice. Such an approach should consider projections of tourism and climate trends, and will require the cooperation of stakeholders including the tourist industry (IAATO and its members), researchers, conservation organisations and governments (via national Antarctic programmes). More research is needed to inform the policies and implementation of this management approach. All proposed visitor sites and tourist activities should be evaluated using the precautionary principle. Researchers should explore the ecological impacts of tourist activities at local and regional levels, assess existing guidelines and whether tourism operators comply with them, and identify the gaps in current protections. It is likely new safeguards will be needed, which could include stronger protections within the Antarctic Treaty System or specifying the appropriate type, amount, location and route of tourism activities in the management plans for all Antarctic protected areas. Continual monitoring of tourism impacts is essential to assess and refine the effectiveness of new protections. Governments, research funders and the tourism industry should support monitoring programmes and help coordinate research activities. Researchers should develop indicators that go beyond counting visitor numbers, and reflect wider impacts on Antarctica\u2019s biodiversity, wilderness and ecosystem services. Efforts should be made to enhance the positive impacts of tourism as a conservation tool. Measures could include incorporating more conservation education into visitors\u2019 schedules, and involving tourists in Antarctic citizen science programmes in which members of the public help gather data for research projects. Researchers should also evaluate how visiting Antarctica changes tourists\u2019 long-term behaviour.

Lack of data and international cooperation means action is often too late to prevent serious harm to communities\u2019 health and livelihoods, coastal economies, wildlife populations and ecosystems. Governments must work together to prevent pollution leaking from vessels, and develop a new International Standard to guide action and prioritise resources. Governments should also make national plans, which include financial support for communities and the restoration of damaged ecosystems. Download April 2023 What is the issue ? There are an estimated 3 million sunken and abandoned vessels in the ocean, over 8,500 of which are classified as \u2018potentially polluting wrecks\u2019. The majority of these wrecks date back to World War I and II (WWI and WWII) and contain harmful chemical pollutants, unexploded munitions and an estimated 6 billion gallons of heavy fuel oil. This is 545 times more oil than the Exxon Valdez leak in 1989 and 30 times that of the Deepwater Horizon spill in 2010, both of which had severe and long-lasting environmental consequences. Severe weather events resulting from climate change are likely to speed up the process of wrecks breaking apart. After more than 75 years of corrosion, leaks from sunken vessels are expected to reach their highest levels within ten years but scientists do not yet have enough data to forecast when or where individual leaks will occur. Photo: \u00a9 NewScientist The financial cost of responding to pollution from wrecks is prohibitively expensive for developing nations. It is also unclear who is responsible for this cost. Many of the countries most affected were not participants in WWI and WWII, and ships sunk in war remain owned by the country they sailed for under the principle of sovereign immunity. The lack of data and international cooperation on how to manage pollution from wrecks means many governments do not act proactively to prevent leaks. Therefore, responses are often too late to prevent serious harm to marine ecosystems and the health and livelihoods of coastal communities. Why is it important ? Marine pollution from sunken vessels is a global, cross-border issue that affects people, the environment and economies around the world. Action on this issue is required to achieve UN Sustainable Development Goal 14 with its target to \u201cprevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds by 2025\u201d, and to achieve the desired outcome of the UN Decade of Ocean Science 2021 to 2030: \u201ca clean ocean where sources of pollution are identified and reduced or removed\u201d. The regional impacts of pollution from wrecks can be devastating. Impacts include the loss of wildlife populations (including commercially important fish species) and damage to coastal and marine ecosystems like mangroves and coral reefs. This in turn threatens communities\u2019 food security, livelihoods and the other benefits these ecosystems provide such as shelter and climate change mitigation. Pollution may also pose a direct threat to human health. Munitions can explode, and research suggests that eating fish exposed to chemicals found in some wrecks may be toxic and carcinogenic. What can be done? Action to prevent pollution leaking is critical to protect human and environmental health, and is cheaper in the long-term too. For example, the USS Mississinewa sank in 1944 in the waters of the Federated States of Micronesia. Following a storm in 2001, the US Navy removed 1.8 million gallons of oil from the vessel. This cost around USD 6 million, which is a fraction of what it would have cost to address had this oil leaked. Given the large number of wrecks worldwide, action to prevent pollution must be effective and prioritised by risk. A new International Standard is needed to determine best practice and classify sunken vessels according to potential environmental, social and economic impacts. Applying the Standard will help governments know how, where and when to act, and allocate global resources most effectively. More research is needed to inform the structure of the Standard, specifically on individual wrecks, possible local impacts, and the risk factors that cause wrecks to break apart. Existing research programmes should be extended to combine historical data, local biodiversity and economic assessments, and analysis of weather patterns, currents, water salinity and temperature, seismic activity and detailed mapping of the seafloor. Research teams should prioritise gathering this information and governments, foundations, maritime stakeholders and other funders should support this work. \u00a9 US Navy 2004 Developing and implementing the Standard also requires states to work together.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO), as the UN body that regulates global shipping, can help facilitate collaboration through existing frameworks, and provisions for managing pollution from wrecks in international waters could be introduced through the UN High Seas Treaty (BBNJ). In the meantime, national governments should incorporate wrecks into their marine spatial and contingency planning urgently. National plans should prepare to: stop pollution spreading by removing it from wrecks and responding to leaks; provide financial support for communities whose livelihoods are affected by pollution; restore damaged ecosystems once pollution has been contained. Alongside their role in research, civil society organisations can help raise awareness of this issue and ensure it is high on national and international political agendas.

Los conflictos humano-vida silvestre tienen graves consecuencias para los medios de subsistencia, la seguridad y el bienestar de las comunidades, y corren el riesgo de socavar los esfuerzos de conservaci\u00f3n al erosionar el apoyo a las \u00e1reas protegidas, la fauna silvestre y la biodiversidad. Las represalias contra la vida silvestre pueden suponer una grave amenaza para la supervivencia de una especie y revertir los avances anteriores en materia de conservaci\u00f3n. Por ejemplo, los lobos, los osos y otros grandes carn\u00edvoros se est\u00e1n recuperando en toda Europa, lo que provoca tensiones sobre c\u00f3mo gestionar su presencia, que es bienvenida por algunos y percibida como un riesgo para la seguridad y los medios de vida por otros. \u00bfQu\u00e9 se puede hacer? El conflicto humano-vida silvestre se reconoce como una preocupaci\u00f3n mundial en el marco de la biodiversidad mundial posterior a 2020 del Convenio sobre la Diversidad Biol\u00f3gica de las Naciones Unidas (que ser\u00e1 adoptado por las Partes en la segunda parte de la COP15 del CDB). En relaci\u00f3n con esto, muchos gobiernos est\u00e1n empezando a incluir la gesti\u00f3n de los conflictos entre los seres humanos y la vida silvestre en las pol\u00edticas y estrategias nacionales para garantizar que se disponga de recursos para gestionarlos.

Esto puede convertirse en divisiones m\u00e1s profundas en las que las partes interesadas perciben que el conflicto sobre la vida silvestre amenaza sus valores o su identidad. Estas situaciones son muy dif\u00edciles de resolver. En las tensiones por los lobos en algunas partes de Norteam\u00e9rica, por ejemplo, la relaci\u00f3n entre las partes interesadas se ha deteriorado hasta convertirse en un conflicto profundamente polarizado.

Les conflits entre l'homme et la faune sauvage deviennent de plus en plus fr\u00e9quents, graves et \u00e9tendus \u00e0 mesure que les populations humaines augmentent et que les habitats disparaissent. Une gestion efficace des conflits entre l'homme et la faune prot\u00e8ge les communaut\u00e9s, emp\u00eache l'escalade des conflits, renforce la confiance dans la conservation et \u00e9vite les repr\u00e9sailles contre la faune.

Par exemple, lorsque les \u00e9l\u00e9phants se nourrissent des cultures, que les phoques endommagent les filets de p\u00eache ou que les jaguars tuent le b\u00e9tail, les gens peuvent perdre leurs moyens de subsistance. Il s'ensuit souvent des repr\u00e9sailles contre l'esp\u00e8ce incrimin\u00e9e. Le terme de conflit homme-faune a traditionnellement \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9 uniquement \u00e0 ces interactions n\u00e9gatives entre l'homme et la faune sauvage, mais cela implique une action d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e de la part des esp\u00e8ces sauvages et ignore les conflits entre groupes de personnes sur ce qui devrait \u00eatre fait pour r\u00e9soudre la situation. Le groupe de sp\u00e9cialistes des conflits entre l'homme et la faune sauvage et de la coexistence de la Commission de la sauvegarde des esp\u00e8ces (CSE) de l'UICN d\u00e9finit les conflits entre l'homme et la faune sauvage comme suit : les luttes qui \u00e9mergent lorsque la pr\u00e9sence ou le comportement de la faune sauvage constitue une menace r\u00e9elle ou per\u00e7ue, directe et r\u00e9currente, pour les int\u00e9r\u00eats ou les besoins de l'homme, entra\u00eenant des d\u00e9saccords entre les groupes de personnes et des impacts n\u00e9gatifs sur les personnes et/ou la faune sauvage. Les conflits entre l'homme et la faune sauvage sont de plus en plus fr\u00e9quents, graves et \u00e9tendus en raison de la croissance de la population humaine, de l'expansion agricole, du d\u00e9veloppement des infrastructures, du changement climatique et d'autres facteurs de perte d'habitat.

Ocean oxygen levels are expected to fall on average by 3\u20134% by 2100 overall due to climate change and increased nutrient discharges, though the scale of effect seen will vary regionally. Consequences of ocean oxygen decline include decreased biodiversity, shifts in species distributions, displacement or reduction in fishery resources and expanding algal blooms. Ocean deoxygenation threatens to disrupt the ocean\u2019s food provisioning ecosystem services. To slow and reverse the loss of oxygen, humans must urgently mitigate climate change globally and nutrient pollution locally. Download December 2019 What is the issue ? Globally, oceans have lost around 2% of dissolved oxygen since the 1950s and are expected to lose about 3\u20134% by the year 2100 under a business-as-usual scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5), though the scale of effect is predicted to vary regionally. Much of the oxygen loss is concentrated in the upper 1000m where species richness and abundance is highest. Even slight overall reductions in the levels of oxygen dissolved in the oceans can induce oxygen stress in marine organisms by depriving them of an adequate oxygen supply at the tissue level (termed hypoxia). The loss of oxygen in the ocean has two major causes: Ocean warming-driven deoxygenation: Warmer ocean water holds less oxygen and is more buoyant than cooler water. This leads to reduced mixing of oxygenated water near the surface with deeper waters, which naturally contain less oxygen. Warmer water also raises oxygen demand from living organisms. As a result, less oxygen is available for marine life. Excessive growth of algae: Fertilizer run-off, sewage, animal waste, aquaculture and deposition of nitrogen from the burning of fossil fuels are promoting excessive growth of plant life \u2013 a process known as eutrophication, which mostly affects coastal areas. Warming of ocean waters is expected to cause further oxygen loss in nutrient-rich coastal areas, exacerbating the situation. As a result of these processes, ocean regions with historically very low oxygen concentrations are expanding and new regions are exhibiting low oxygen conditions. In 2011 there were around 700 reported sites worldwide affected by low oxygen conditions \u2013 up from only 45 before the 1960s. The volume of anoxic ocean waters \u2013 areas completely depleted of oxygen \u2013 has quadrupled since the 1960s. Evidence suggests that temperature increases explain about 50% of oxygen loss in the upper 1000 m of the ocean. The major causes of ocean deoxygenation driven by nutrient inputs from the land and warming of the open ocean, and how they interact. modified after Stramma et al. 2010 The largest oxygen loss is observed at a depth of between 100\u2013300 m in the Tropical and North Pacific Ocean, the Southern and Artic Ocean and the South Atlantic Ocean. Ocean oxygen loss driven by excessive organic matter and growth of algae and the threats it poses to ecosystem services are documented in many regions but likely under-reported in others. Oxygen loss driven by ocean warming, on the other hand, was only recognised more recently and is not as fully understood. The two causes can also interact \u2013 warming-induced oxygen loss is tipping coastal areas into hypoxia and may contribute to the dramatic increase in reports of coastal hypoxia. Deoxygenation is one of multiple human-induced stress factors affecting marine ecosystems. Because respiration consumes oxygen and releases carbon dioxide, ocean deoxygenation is often accompanied by ocean acidification, making it necessary to mitigate these stressors together. Similarly, a warming ocean decreases oxygen supply but increases oxygen requirements of marine organisms, making it critical to understand the combined effects of these stressors. Global distribution of deoxygenation in the coastal and global ocean. In the coastal area, more than 500 sites have been inventoried with low oxygen conditions, while in the open ocean the extent of low oxygen waters amounts to several millions km\u00b3. Breitburg et al. 2018 Why is it important ? The ocean represents 97% of the physical habitable space on the planet and is central to sustaining life on Earth. Loss of oxygen from the ocean will have severe impacts on marine biodiversity and the functioning of ocean ecosystems. Much remains unknown as to the long-term human health, social and economic consequences of ocean oxygen loss. Virtually all the ocean\u2019s food provisioning ecosystem services for humans require oxygen to support organism growth and production. Oxygen is necessary to sustain the life of all the fishes and invertebrates, and deoxygenation is already causing measurable declines", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c870c151-2d84-4967-a60f-c4f8fb2d73e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "c870c151-2d84-4967-a60f-c4f8fb2d73e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-brief/ocean-deoxygenation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Issue Brief"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ocean deoxygenation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-brief/ocean-deoxygenation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Issue Brief"}, "hash": "44a85e5b314a6c8ece40efa1165f9f317481b7b84300ceefc1419c9f8c987ec9"}}, "hash": "44a85e5b314a6c8ece40efa1165f9f317481b7b84300ceefc1419c9f8c987ec9", "text": "of fish species. Some of the ocean\u2019s most productive biomes, supporting one fifth of the world\u2019s wild marine fish harvest, are formed by ocean currents that bring nutrient-rich but oxygen-poor water to coasts that line the eastern edges of the world\u2019s ocean basins. As naturally oxygen-poor systems, these areas are particularly vulnerable to ocean deoxygenation, and such effects may ripple out and affect hundreds of millions of people. Degraded habitats caused by climate change-driven hypoxia and increased algal blooms may lead to reduced catches for fisheries and possible collapse of regional stocks. Ocean deoxygenation has started to alter the balance of marine life, favouring hypoxia-tolerant species (e.g. microbes, jellyfish and some squid) at the expense of hypoxia-sensitive ones (many marine species including most fish). Large species such as tuna, marlin, swordfish and sharks are especially sensitive to low ambient oxygen conditions because of their large size and are being forced into increasingly narrow surface layers of oxygen-rich waters. Changes in the distributions of fish species could have significant negative socio-economic impacts \u2013 where fish populations decrease in abundance or move away from traditional fishing grounds, fishers may struggle to adapt. Ocean deoxygenation may also influence the movement of gases between the ocean and the atmosphere. Deoxygenated deeper ocean waters produce greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide and methane that may reach the ocean surface and be released into the atmosphere, contributing to further warming. What can be done ? To reverse the loss of oxygen, people, industry and governments must urgently cut carbon dioxide emissions and reduce ocean nutrient pollution. Warming-driven deoxygenation cannot easily be reversed but it can be slowed considerably by mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. Without a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, the ocean oxygen inventory is likely to take centuries to recover from warming projected under business-as-usual emissions scenarios. Reducing human-driven warming by cutting climate-changing emissions from fossil fuel combustion can prevent widespread ocean oxygen loss and enable oxygen levels to recover to some degree. Nutrient run-off from agriculture and from both treated and untreated sewage effluent are major contributors to oxygen depletion in coastal waters, driving the over-enrichment of waters with nutrients. Solutions to reduce nutrient runoff can be tailored to local needs and economies. Effective nutrient reduction strategies include introducing legislation to limit runoff, setting specific targets and employing monitoring to detect problems. We also need to better protect marine ecosystems to conserve marine genetic biodiversity and to allow ocean life to recover, provided carbon dioxide emissions are cut.

The amount of soil biodiversity determines the productivity of land, and thus the provision of food, water, and the regulation of climate. Current land degradation, chiefly due to chemical-fuelled, intensive agricultural production, is causing the loss of soil biodiversity, undermining the services provided by healthy soils. Governments should put in place policies and legislation, and promote land management practices which restore or preserve soil biodiversity. Download May 2019 What is the issue? The health of soils is dependent on the mix of living organisms they contain, including bacteria, fungi, protozoa, insects, worms, other invertebrates and vertebrates. This variety of organisms present in soils is known as soil biodiversity. Components of soil biodiversity IUCN Soil biodiversity drives the carbon, nitrogen and water cycles upon which life on earth depends. The productivity of land is therefore determined, to a large extent, by its soil biodiversity. When land is degraded, it loses its soil biodiversity. Soil, which takes hundreds of years to form, can be eroded easily by wind and water when soil biodiversity is lost, causing land to produce less food, store less water and release carbon into the atmosphere. About a third of the world's land has already been degraded, with two thirds of this degradation attributed to the agricultural sector, particularly chemical-fuelled, intensive agricultural production. According to the Assessment Report on Land Degradation and Restoration, produced by Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), land degradation is currently undermining the wellbeing of at least 3.2 billion people, and represents an economic loss of 10% of annual global gross product. By the year 2050, the global population is projected to surpass nine billion people. These people will be wealthier than ever and will demand more agricultural products, placing even greater demands on soils and undermining the long-term productivity of land. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) has estimated that, based on current trajectories, the world only has 60 harvests left. Why is it important? Globally, soil biodiversity has been estimated to contribute between USD 1.5 and 13 trillion annually to the value of ecosystems services \u2013 the goods and services provided by healthy ecosystems, including the provision of food, hydrological services and regulation of climate. Food and water security Soil organisms regulate nutrient availability and uptake of nutrients by plants, maintain soil structure, and regulate hydrological processes. The loss of healthy soils reduces agricultural yields and could result in a food production shortfall of 25% by 2050. It is estimated that increasing soil biodiversity could contribute up to 2.3 billion tonnes of additional crop production per year, valued at USD 1.4 trillion. Research in Argentina, India, and the West African Sahel has also found that crop yields can be increased by 20\u201370 kg/ha for wheat, 10\u201350 kg/ha for rice, and 30\u2013300 kg/ha for maize with every 1000 kg /ha increase in soil organic carbon around plant roots. Soil stores two thirds of the fresh water on the planet, and this function is determined by the level of organic matter in the soil. This water from soils supports 90% of the world\u2019s agricultural production. The loss of soil biodiversity reduces the infiltration capacity of the soil as well as its capacity to store water, lowering food production and worsening the impact of drought. By 2025 an estimated 1.8 billion people will be living under water stressed conditions. One estimate suggests that the loss of 1 g of soil organic matter decreases soil available moisture by 1 to 10 g. Climate change mitigation Soil biodiversity represents one of the largest carbon stocks on Earth and plays a major role in mitigating climate change. It is estimated that there is more carbon stored in soils than the total carbon in both the atmosphere and above-ground vegetation. When soil is eroded, the carbon in soils is lost in the form of greenhouse gasses (GHGs), contributing to climate change. Increasing soil biodiversity could provide at least half of emissions reductions needed to limit the global average temperature increase to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels as set by the Paris Agreement. Soils and their ecosystem services and benefits IUCN Target 15.3 of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development aims to halt the world\u2019s net land degradation. Healthy soils are both a natural resource and a public good underpinning sustainable development. The targets of the 2030 Agenda for food, water and energy security, biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation all hinge on healthy soils.

What can be done? It is preferable to avoid degradation in the first place, by adopting sustainable land management practices and sustainably managing agricultural landscapes. Farming practices that increase soil biodiversity include sustainably managing soil water and nutrients, controlling erosion, and maintaining groundcover. One such method is agroforestry, which involves planting trees alongside crops. An agroforestry plot in Sudan IUCN / Akshay Vishwanath Governments should support land users in adopting sustainable land management practices, for instance through subsidies and other means. Land users should be paid for conserving this public good, rather than purely for the individual foods and other commodities they produce. Governments should also promote private investment in sustainable land management, for instance by facilitating finance opportunities for small and medium agribusinesses that engage in sustainable land management. The services healthy soils provide should be incorporated into land-use planning. This planning requires input from a number of sectors to ensure the delivery of collective goals, for example food production, water supply and biodiversity conservation. Governments should also strengthen land tenure and resource rights to enable local communities manage land more sustainably. More information Peter Laban, Graciela Metternicht, and Jonathan Davies.

Synthetic biology applications have important positive and negative implications for biodiversity conservation depending on how they are designed and targeted. Potential benefits range from protecting threatened species to providing synthetic alternatives to wildlife products. Potential detrimental effects include changes to ecological roles played by target organisms, and negative impacts on the livelihoods of indigenous and local communities who largely depend on biodiversity. The use of synthetic biology needs to be informed by case-by-case assessments, guided by empirical evidence, and incorporating traditional knowledge, religious and ethical values in decision-making. Download May 2019 What is the issue? Though there is an active international discussion on how best to define synthetic biology, it generally refers to technologies that allow humans to make precise alterations to the genes of organisms to make them do things that humans want and that those organisms would not normally do. Recent advances at the intersection of biotechnology, engineering, computation and chemistry have enabled scientists to design and synthesise new sequences of the genetic code (DNA), which can support the design of cells and organisms that do new things. Precise manipulation of DNA to obtain specific functions is the essence of synthetic biology. The practice of synthetic biology is increasing rapidly, with major developments being promised and some delivered across multiple sectors. Over the last 15 years there has been a five-fold growth in companies working on aspects of synthetic biology, with public and private investment approaching US$10 billion over this period. Investments and research in synthetic biology mainly focus on products and processes that may improve agriculture, e.g. more disease-resistant crops, or human health, e.g. new medicines. There has been little investment directed at specific conservation benefits. No technology developed for conservation purposes is yet ready to be tested in the field, let alone applied for management, with the possible exception of disease-resistant American chestnut trees. One area of synthetic biology that has attracted significant attention is the development of engineered gene drive systems. A gene drive, which can occur naturally, is a phenomenon in which a particular gene gets passed down with a higher probability than the usual 50%. Scientists are exploring the possibility of harnessing gene drives to spread engineered genetic changes through wild populations over many generations. Engineered gene drive systems are still years away from any deployment, despite the fast pace at which this technology is being developed. Growth in funding for synthetic biology companies IUCN Why is it important? Certain synthetic biology applications, depending on how they are designed and targeted, have the potential to enhance or disrupt biodiversity conservation, acting through both direct and indirect pathways. Potential positive impacts on conservation Engineered gene drives and other synthetic biology applications could complement current efforts to halt biodiversity loss and enhance biodiversity conservation, for instance by eradicating invasive species through engineered gene drive systems or by modifying genes to increase the ability of organisms to resist climate impacts. The engineering of microbes to biosynthesise products sourced from threatened species, such as a medically-valuable molecule found in the blood of horseshoe crabs, are already underway. Potential adverse impacts on conservation There are concerns that synthetic biology is fraught with uncertainty, and could have detrimental effects. These may stem from the movement of organisms carrying engineered gene drives impacting non-target populations or species, or from changes to ecological roles played by target organisms and broader ecosystem effects. The introduction of biosynthesised wildlife products may have negative socio-economic effects on livelihoods and on production and consumption patterns. For instance, a legal market for synthetically manufactured products could render attempts to curb illegal trade in wild-sourced products difficult or impossible, especially when the illegal trade is currently run by corrupt syndicates. Synthetic biology applications may affect the cultures, rights and livelihoods of local and indigenous communities, which manage, govern, reside in or depend on a large part of the world\u2019s biodiversity. New technologies may divert funding from other conservation approaches, whereby the urgency and importance of biodiversity conservation rooted in addressing fundamental socio-political problems is ignored in favour of synthetic biology applications. Unintended impacts from other sectors Applications that are not designed with a specific conservation goal could have an indirect impact on biodiversity. For example, agriculture is one of the major sectors for investment, research and development of synthetic biology. Potential impacts from agriculture include the creation of new invasive species and crops that are better adapted to marginal land, or to previously unusable land.

IUCN What can be done? Unfortunately, there is no universal path for minimising the potential detrimental effects and maximising the potential benefits of synthetic biology for biodiversity conservation. The use of synthetic biology needs to be informed by case-by-case assessments incorporating empirical studies examining its efficacy, potential benefits and risks. Traditional knowledge, religious and ethical values also need to be considered in decision-making. Deeper collaboration between conservationists and synthetic biologists will be necessary to both develop evidence and to create the frameworks for understanding and using that evidence. There is an opportunity for conservationists to shape how these fields interact and to set the research agenda. This will require the engagement not just of scientists, but also of the government at all levels, civil society, and indigenous peoples\u2019 organisations. Multiple existing governance structures are relevant to synthetic biology. However, synthetic biology and engineered gene drives raise questions and challenges for these existing frameworks. For instance, there are challenges related to mechanisms that address environmental harm, particularly transboundary impacts, or benefit-sharing questions where inventions involve genetic elements from multiple organisms both within and beyond national jurisdiction. In assessing risk, national decision-makers may be required to consider different factors, including socio-economic concerns as well as impacts on indigenous and local communities. Informed consent or approval and involvement of potentially affected indigenous peoples and local communities should be a prerequisite to introducing engineered gene drives into the environment. Legislation may provide for monitoring of regulated activities, with regulation revised frequently to keep up to date with technological changes.

These sites provide life-supporting benefits to millions of people \u2013 90% of sites provide jobs, two-thirds are crucial sources of water and about half help prevent natural disasters such as floods or landslides. Natural World Heritage sites are under increasing pressure from climate change, infrastructure development, mining, poaching and other threats. To protect sites from threats, investment in their protection and management is urgently needed. Closely monitoring the status of sites, World Heritage-specific biodiversity targets, and adopting IUCN Green List standards for site management can also help. These sites are a litmus test for our ability as a conservation community to protect biodiversity and pass on nature\u2019s treasures to the next generation. Download November 2018 What is the issue? One in five (23%) sites on the UNESCO World Heritage List are natural sites, most often protected areas such as national parks or nature reserves. Natural World Heritage sites are globally recognised as the planet\u2019s most significant protected areas. There are 252 natural World Heritage sites around the globe, including iconic places such as Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef, Yellowstone National Park in the United States, Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or the Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra in Indonesia. Natural World Heritage sites account for 8% of the total surface covered by all 230,000+ protected areas worldwide. Almost every country has signed the World Heritage Convention, committing to the best level of protection for these sites. Yet natural World Heritage sites are under increasing pressure. Invasive species, climate change and the negative impacts of tourism are currently the three most significant threats to natural World Heritage, according to the IUCN World Heritage Outlook, the first ever assessment of all listed natural sites. Climate change is the fastest growing threat to natural World Heritage, with the number of sites highly threatened by climate change almost doubling in the three years between 2014 and 2017. Coral reefs and glaciers are among the most affected ecosystems. In 2016, up to 85% of all reefs surveyed had been impacted by climate change. The Great Barrier Reef, the largest reef on Earth, has suffered widespread bleaching due to the increase in global sea surface temperature. Retreating glaciers threaten the very reason why Tanzania\u2019s Kilimanjaro National Park, home to Africa\u2019s highest peak, is on the World Heritage List. Climate change is also by far the largest potential threat to natural World Heritage, meaning more sites will likely suffer impacts in the near future. Main threats to natural World Heritage sites, with number of sites affected by each type of threat. The number of sites affected by climate change has dramatically increased from 2014 to 2017. IUCN World Heritage Outlook 2 (2017) Pressure on natural World Heritage from planned infrastructure is also increasing. Major development such as the construction of roads, dams, tourism facilities, mining and oil and gas projects is among the top potential threats. For instance, Bangladesh's Sundarbans, a vast mangrove forest home to the royal Bengal tiger, could be severely altered by impacts of the Rampal coal-fired power plant proposed near the site. The proposed Stiegler\u2019s Gorge dam could cause irreversible damage to important habitats in Tanzania's Selous Game Reserve, home to the Critically Endangered black rhinoceros. The protection and management of natural World Heritage are becoming less effective. In 2017, fewer than half (48%) of the sites were assessed as having effective protection and management, down from 54% in 2014. Lack of guarantee for long-term finance is the most challenging aspect of protection and management \u2013 an issue assessed as being of concern for 118 natural World Heritage sites. Growing threats and declining protection and management present a worrying combination for natural World Heritage sites. If natural World Heritage sites are not adequately conserved, their unique values could be irreversibly damaged or lost. Fewer than half of all natural World Heritage sites were assessed as effectively protected in 2017. IUCN World Heritage Outlook 2 (2017) Why is it important? Natural World Heritage sites provide crucial habitats to many iconic species, as well as protect rare ecological processes and stunning landscapes. They also contribute to economies, climate stability and human well-being. Two-thirds of natural sites on the World Heritage List are crucial sources of water, and about half help prevent natural disasters such as floods or landslides. Over 90% of listed natural sites create jobs and provide income from tourism and recreation.

Natural World Heritage sites have high international visibility and provide insight into conservation successes and challenges. Through the World Heritage Convention, they have the power to mobilise action where it is most needed, and often pioneer management solutions which contribute to sustainable development. The success of the conservation of World Heritage can act as a litmus test of the effectiveness of protected areas globally, and of our ability to protect nature overall. Many natural World Heritage sites demonstrate that conservation works when efforts are sustained. For instance, Como\u00e9 National Park in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire came off the List of World Heritage in Danger in 2017 thanks to international support and joint action on the ground, which resulted in species populations rising, including chimpanzees and elephants that were thought to have disappeared from the park. What can be done? To protect the world\u2019s natural World Heritage sites from growing threats, investing in their protection and management is key. This is a collective responsibility shared by governments, civil society, local communities and indigenous peoples. The state of conservation of natural World Heritage sites needs to be closely monitored to identify the most threatened sites, and this is where national and international conservation efforts should focus first. World Heritage sites, as the planet\u2019s most significant protected areas, deserve the best quality management if they are to have a positive outlook. IUCN recommends the adoption of World Heritage-specific targets in the post-2020 agenda of the Convention on Biological Diversity as an effective means to drive biodiversity conservation action. The IUCN World Heritage Outlook also offers a tool for measuring progress over time, as it tracks changes in the sites\u2019 protection and management, threats and natural values. The IUCN Green List of Protected and Conserved Areas \u2013 the first global standard of practice in area-based conservation \u2013 can ensure natural World Heritage sites enjoy internationally benchmarked protection and management. The IUCN Green List can celebrate and share high-quality management and help those World Heritage sites most in need to lift standards. Quantifying the benefits provided by natural World Heritage sites helps justify investing in and conserving them. Many tools for assessing ecosystem services \u2013 the benefits provided by nature \u2013 now exist. New IUCN guidance helps to select the most appropriate tool according to objectives and resources.

IAS have major impacts on human health, livelihoods and food security, and undermine progress towards achieving many of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The rate of new introductions is increasing, and the impacts from IAS can be compounded by climate change. IAS are not only an environmental problem, and a cross-sectoral approach must be taken to address them. Preventative measures, such as biosecurity, are the most cost-effective ways to tackle IAS. Download July 2018 What is the issue? Alien or non-native species are animals, plants or other organisms introduced by humans, either intentionally or accidentally, into areas outside their natural range. Some of these species become established and negatively impact native biodiversity. These species are classified as invasive alien species (IAS). Due to the increase in the movement of people and goods around the world, and with new trade routes opening and enhanced transportation, the number of species being introduced into new areas is rising. A 2017 study in the journal Nature Communications found that over one third of all introductions in the past 200 years occurred after 1970. According to The IUCN Red List of Threatened SpeciesTM, IAS are one of the top causes of biodiversity loss and the second most common cause of species extinctions. The brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis), for example, is responsible for the extinction of 10 bird species on the island of Guam where it was introduced in the 1940s. IAS also constitute the most significant threat to natural World Heritage sites, affecting 68 out of 241 sites, according to the IUCN World Heritage Outlook. IAS impacts go beyond biodiversity and also seriously affect economic activities, livelihoods, food security, and human health and well-being. Overall, IAS risk undermining progress towards achieving 10 of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Why is it important ? Though the scale of the socio-economic costs associated with IAS is poorly understood, it is estimated that the direct impacts of IAS and their management cost the global economy billions of US$ annually. It is estimated that IAS cost the EU at least \u20ac12.5 billion/year, and Australia at least AUS$13.6 billion/year. Invasive alien insects alone, due to their impacts on agriculture and forestry, cost at least US$70 billion/year globally. The global cost of controlling invasive freshwater biofouling animals, such as the zebra and quagga mussels which accumulate on wetted surfaces in electric power generation and water treatment facilities, is estimated at more than US$277 million/year. IUCN The water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), for example, which is native to South America, has been intentionally introduced around the world for ornamental purposes and as animal food, and has rapidly invaded water ways, irrigation channels, lakes and rice paddies. Under the right conditions it can double in biomass within two weeks forming dense mats, with potentially disastrous consequences. In Africa\u2019s Lake Victoria, water hyacinth infestations covering 12,000 hectares have blocked shipping trade and access to ports, and halted fishing activities, impacting 40 million people. Agriculture and fisheries are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of IAS, placing food security at risk and jeopardising livelihoods. For example, the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) was introduced to sub-Saharan Africa most likely from the USA in 2016, and is spreading rapidly across the continent causing yield losses of over 40% for smallholder maize farms in some countries. Mesquite (Prosopis), a thorny drought-tolerant shrub native to the Americas, was widely introduced to tackle the impacts of desertification but became invasive, forming impenetrable thickets in many countries. In Ethiopia it has seriously affected the ability of pastoralist communities to rear their livestock. IAS also pose a threat to human health, directly by exposing people to injuries and wounds e.g. through bites and stings, or indirectly by transmitting diseases through infectious pathogens, or providing suitable habitat for disease spreading organisms. The Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus), native to South-East Asia, is a vector of a number of human diseases such as Dengue fever and West Nile virus. It has spread to many countries around the world via shipping, surviving in standing water (e.g. used tires).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1df43a61-f0f8-4830-b06f-b37e1e1382f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "1df43a61-f0f8-4830-b06f-b37e1e1382f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-brief/invasive-alien-species-and-sustainable-development", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Issue Brief"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Invasive alien species and sustainable development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-brief/invasive-alien-species-and-sustainable-development", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Issue Brief"}, "hash": "93aadb5f86ace420b593a6b2bb31962494c297da0dc393a5fecc7c275e27eb7f"}, "2": {"node_id": "d7235536-7b06-4b07-a9e1-6a865b9dfc47", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-brief/invasive-alien-species-and-sustainable-development", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Issue Brief"}, "hash": "d92285bc566353e57b870dc0b1743198490da8956cc8f341900894d937f5be20"}}, "hash": "9577a7870a38fe209b045936643d3f99325cba02ec07b3c76c07688554e36914", "text": "used tires).

Examples of invasive alien species that can undermine progress towards achieving sustainable development IUCN What can be done? The most cost-effective measure to address the impacts from IAS is to prevent their introduction. This can be achieved by establishing effective and well-resourced biosecurity measures to manage priority pathways of introduction, supported by early warning systems and rapid eradication capacity. Control, containment and \u2013 where feasible \u2013 eradication, also need to be undertaken to mitigate the impacts from established IAS, including those whose impacts are likely to increase due to climate change. It is essential that a cross-sectoral approach is taken in IAS prevention and management measures. This needs to include the environment, human health, agriculture, fisheries, customs and transport government departments, along with key private sector bodies and civil society. Governments, donors and agencies that fund and implement projects, including projects supporting the SDGs, must ensure that current and potential impacts of IAS are understood so that relevant prevention and management measures can be incorporated into projects.

Palm oil is important for global food security and economic development. Palm oil production increased 15-fold between 1980 and 2014 and will likely increase further. Oil palm expansion could affect 54% of threatened mammals and 64% of threatened birds globally. Because other oil crops have lower yields than oil palm, replacing it is not a solution. To reduce its impacts on biodiversity, palm oil needs to be produced more sustainably by avoiding deforestation and cutting non-food palm oil use. Download June 2018 What is the issue? Palm oil is derived from the oil palm tree (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.), which is native to West Africa and grows best in tropical climates with abundant water. Three-quarters of total palm oil produced is used for food, particularly cooking oil and processed oils and fats. It is also used in cosmetics, cleaning products and biofuel. Between 1980 and 2014, global palm oil production increased by a factor of 15, from 4.5 million tonnes to 70 million tonnes. This was driven by the high yield and relatively low production costs of palm oil. Industrial-scale oil palm plantations now occupy an area of 18.7 million hectares worldwide (as of October 2017), with smallholder oil palm plantations also occupying a significant area. Palm oil demand is expected to grow at 1.7% per year until 2050. Most (85%) of global palm oil supply comes from Indonesia and Malaysia, followed by Thailand, Colombia and Nigeria. The bulk of palm oil produced in these countries is exported to the EU, China, India, the US, Japan and Pakistan. Oil palm produces about 35% of all vegetable oil on less than 10% of the land allocated to oil crops. Oil palm expansion is a major driver of deforestation and degradation of natural habitats in parts of tropical Asia and Central and South America, behind cattle ranching and local and subsistence agriculture. On the island of Borneo, at least 50% of all deforestation between 2005 and 2015 was related to oil palm development. The tropical areas suitable for oil palm plantations are particularly rich in biodiversity. Oil palm development, therefore, has significant negative impacts on global biodiversity, as it often replaces tropical forests and other species-rich habitats. Globally palm oil production is affecting at least 193 threatened species, according to The IUCN Red List of Threatened SpeciesTM. It has been estimated that oil palm expansion could affect 54% of all threatened mammals and 64% of all threatened birds globally. It also reduces the diversity and abundance of most native species. For example, it has played a major role in the decline in species such as orangutans and tigers. Some 10,000 of the estimated 75,000\u2013100,000 Critically Endangered Bornean orangutans are currently found in areas allocated to oil palm. Every year around 750 to 1,250 of the species are killed during human-orangutan conflicts, which are often linked to expanding agriculture. A small number of species can benefit from the presence of oil palm plantations, including species of wild pig, rodents and some snakes. Why is it important? Currently about half the people in the world rely on palm oil as part of their diets and it is the dominant oil used in food in Africa and Asia. As the global population grows, palm oil\u2019s role in meeting global food demand will increase. Oil palm plantations provide jobs and drive national economic development. The industry is an important source of employment in Indonesia and Malaysia. It also contributes to the development of remote areas via provision of infrastructure including roads, hospitals and schools. However, the way plantations are currently established and managed is damaging to the environment. The expansion of oil palm plantations into natural areas is responsible for greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and peat drainage, and contributes to regional smoke haze and water pollution. Further expansion of the area occupied by oil palms would most likely occur in Africa and South America, where potential plantation sites are particularly rich in biodiversity. The oil palm industry also often has negative impacts on local communities. Some communities suffer economically from oil palm development because their loss of access to forests is not sufficiently compensated by economic gains from oil palm cultivation. Human-wildlife conflict often increases with the displacement of species such as orangutans and tigers when forests are cleared for oil palm, resulting in human and animal casualties. Because of high labour requirements, palm oil expansion can also lead to labour shortages for local food production, and labour in-migration from", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "89421a09-cb6e-4d96-97c3-79ff50e9c42b": {"__data__": {"id_": "89421a09-cb6e-4d96-97c3-79ff50e9c42b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-brief/palm-oil-and-biodiversity", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Issue Brief"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Palm oil and biodiversity", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-brief/palm-oil-and-biodiversity", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Issue Brief"}, "hash": "831a2cde315adc976f78d96b06a5d026e927efd98bed79153bd34e53bcaf7c06"}}, "hash": "831a2cde315adc976f78d96b06a5d026e927efd98bed79153bd34e53bcaf7c06", "text": "lower income countries or regions. What can be done? Palm oil needs to be produced more sustainably. A simple shift from palm oil to other oil crops is not a solution as it may lead to further biodiversity loss. Oil palm produces up to nine times more oil per unit area than other major oil crops, and can help meet global demand for vegetable oils that is estimated to grow from an annual 165 million tonnes now to 310 million tonnes in 2050. Banning palm oil could result in diminished efforts to produce palm oil sustainably, and an increase in land used for producing other oils (mostly soy, sunflower and rapeseed) which is likely to shift biodiversity impacts to regions where those oils are produced. To mitigate biodiversity loss, effective policies and programs are needed to stop the clearing of native tropical forests for new oil palm plantations. This includes policies which limit demand for palm oil for non-food uses (such as the new European Union policies limiting the use of palm oil for biofuel) or which protect forests and other ecosystems in producer countries. Importing country policies need to apply to all vegetable oils, not just palm oil, and must minimise the environmental cost of producing these vegetable oils. Policies in producing countries need to ensure that the production of palm oil abides by national laws and international conventions aimed at avoiding negative environmental impacts, such as the UN Convention on Biological Diversity. In existing oil palm plantations, producers should also manage their land more responsibly to reduce impacts on biodiversity. Currently, producers mainly do this by setting aside forest and other areas identified as important for biodiversity and carbon, using two main frameworks: the High Carbon Stock and High Conservation Value approaches. However, there is little evidence that these approaches are effective at reducing impacts on biodiversity. Better management of these set-asides is needed to ensure sustainability, and to reduce impacts on biodiversity. More information Meijaard, E. et al. (eds.) (2018). Oil palm and biodiversity.

Coastal ecosystems such as mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrass meadows sequester and store more carbon per unit area than terrestrial forests and are now being recognised for their role in mitigating climate change. These ecosystems also provide essential benefits for climate change adaptation, including coastal protection and food security for many coastal communities. However, if the ecosystems are degraded or damaged, their carbon sink capacity is lost or adversely affected, and the carbon stored is released, resulting in emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) that contribute to climate change. Dedicated conservation efforts can ensure that coastal ecosystems continue to play their role as long-term carbon sinks. Download November 2017 What is the issue? The coastal ecosystems of mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrass meadows contain large stores of carbon deposited by vegetation and various natural processes over centuries. These ecosystems sequester and store more carbon \u2013 often referred to as \u2018blue carbon\u2019 \u2013 per unit area than terrestrial forests. The ability of these vegetated ecosystems to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere makes them significant net carbon sinks, and they are now being recognised for their role in mitigating climate change. However, if the ecosystems are degraded or damaged directly or indirectly by human activities, their carbon sink capacity is lost or adversely affected, and the carbon stored in the soil is released, resulting in CO2 emissions that contribute to climate change. The Blue Carbon Initiative Why is it important? Coastal ecosystems need to be conserved and restored as globally significant carbon sinks. Despite their small extent relative to other ecosystems, they sequester and store globally significant amounts of carbon in their soil. The ongoing destruction and loss of these systems contributes to additional human-induced greenhouse gases. Alongside tropical forests and peatlands, coastal ecosystems demonstrate how nature can be used to enhance climate change mitigation strategies and therefore offer opportunities for countries to achieve their emissions reduction targets and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. Additionally, these coastal ecosystems provide numerous benefits and services that are essential for climate change adaptation, including coastal protection and food security for many communities globally. What can be done? Conserving and restoring terrestrial forests, and more recently peatlands, has been recognised as an important component of climate change mitigation. Several countries are developing policies and programmes in support of sustainable development through initiatives that reduce the carbon footprint associated with the growth of their economies. These include actions to conserve and sustainably manage natural systems relevant to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), including through the reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries (REDD+) mechanism and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). These approaches can also apply to coastal systems \u2013 that contain rich carbon reservoirs. Dedicated conservation efforts can ensure that coastal ecosystems continue to play their role as long-term carbon sinks, by helping to ensure that no new emissions arise from their loss and degradation, whilst stimulating new carbon sequestration through the restoration of previously carbon-rich coastal habitats. Global averages for carbon pools (soil organic carbon and living biomass) of focal coastal habitats. Note: Tropical forests are included for comparison. Only the top metre of soil is included in the soil carbon estimates. Murray, B.C. et al. (2011) On an implementation level, mangroves, salt marshes and seagrasses can be included in national accounting, according to the IPCC 2013 Supplement to the 2006 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories: Wetlands. Some technical elements need to be fully integrated into these mechanisms to value the full coastal carbon potential, e.g. accounting for soil carbon. An expansion of the implementation of programmes and projects around the world is also needed to stop the ongoing loss of these ecosystems and curb resulting emissions. The management of marine ecosystems in the high seas as a climate mitigation option, and the use of the UNFCCC to incentivise better management action is currently an area of debate. These ecosystems either do not demonstrate globally relevant, long-term climate mitigation potential or have jurisdictional challenges related to the management and clear national carbon emissions or removals allocation. Further discussion and dialogue are now needed to analyse if, and how, an incentive mechanism for areas beyond national jurisdiction should be developed under the UN Climate Convention. What is clear, however, is that an ecologically degraded ocean loses its capacity to support the carbon cycle and act broadly as a carbon sink.

Many countries have included coastal ecosystem management in their national climate change mitigation activities, including under REDD+, NAMAs, NDCs and other mechanisms. These experiences show opportunities for further refinement as well as replication and expansion in other countries. More and more efforts now link the mitigation and adaptation benefits of these systems, and direct the appropriate management and policy responses through national development goals as well as coastal planning efforts.

Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA), involving the conservation, sustainable management and restoration of ecosystems can help people adapt to the impacts of climate change. Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) is a nature-based solution that harnesses biodiversity and ecosystem services to reduce vulnerability and build resilience to climate change. In order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, reach global biodiversity targets and effectively address climate change, nature-based solutions should be treated as integral to adaptation strategies at global, national and local levels. Download November 2017 What is the issue? Communities have been adapting to climate variability for centuries, but today their coping mechanisms are being outpaced by the fast-changing climate. Shifting weather patterns as a result of climate change, affecting rainfall and temperature, are likely to impact the ecosystem goods and services on which people rely. Climate change is also likely to magnify existing risks of and vulnerability to disasters. It is therefore critical to develop adaptation capabilities to be able to deal with these challenges. In response to global climate change impacts, most countries have focussed on \u2018hard\u2019 or \u2018grey\u2019 infrastructure options such as embankments for flood control or new reservoirs to cope with water shortages. These options can be costly to build and maintain, and generally do not take the benefits of ecosystem-based approaches into account. Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA), involving the conservation, sustainable management and restoration of ecosystems are cost-effective solutions that can help people adapt to the impacts of climate change. Examples of such nature-based solutions to climate change include sustainable agriculture, integrated water resource management and sustainable forest management. EbA harnesses biodiversity and ecosystem services to increase resilience and reduce the vulnerability of human communities and natural systems to climate change. Why is it important? Healthy ecosystems such as intact forests, wetlands and coastal areas provide many benefits to local communities including firewood, clean water, medicines, shelter and food. They can also form physical barriers against extreme weather events such as cyclones and storm surges. Biodiverse forests, for example, can protect roads and other infrastructure from erosion and landslides. Ecosystem-based Adaptation conceptualised in the Driving Forces-Pressures-State-Impacts-Responses (DPSIR) framework UNEP-UNDP-IUCN (2010) Making the Case for Ecosystem Based Adaptation: Building Resilience to Climate Change According to a study carried out by Costanza et al. on the 34 major hurricanes in the United States since 1980, and published in the journal AMBIO in 2008, the loss of one hectare of wetland results in an average US$ 33,000 increase in storm damage. It also estimated that wetlands in the US contribute US$ 23.2 billion in storm protection services. Another study published in the journal Nature Climate Change in 2013, showed that natural habitats currently protect 67% of US coastline. The success of ecosystem-based approaches depends on the recognition and uptake of local and traditional knowledge, and consideration of the needs of vulnerable community members such as women, the elderly and the poor. Through effective ecosystem management, EbA contributes to biodiversity conservation and to local economies. What can be done? EbA is now being used in hundreds of projects all over the world. Governments, civil society organisations and multilateral agencies are appreciating the effectiveness of EbA and its multiple benefits. The German Government\u2019s environment ministry (IKI-BMUB) for instance has funded EbA projects worldwide worth around \u20ac130 million since 2008. However, for ecosystem management approaches to effectively contribute to global climate change adaptation efforts at scale, more investment and the integration of EbA into climate policies are needed. Climate adaptation responses, both at the policy and field levels, can only be effective if they are fully integrated into development and conservation policies and projects. Efforts are needed to develop working links between the adaptation goals of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Aichi Targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to tackle climate change challenges in an integrated way.

MPAs support climate change adaptation and mitigation while providing other ecosystem services. Currently 6.35% of the ocean is protected, but only just over 1.89% is covered by exclusively no-take MPAs. Most existing MPAs do not have enough human and financial resources to properly implement conservation and management measures. Increased political commitments can help boost the governance of and resources available to MPAs. Download November 2017 What is the issue? Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) \u2013 areas of the ocean set aside for long-term conservation aims \u2013 are the only mainstream conservation-focussed, area-based measure to increase the quality and extent of ocean protection. MPAs and their network offer nature-based solution to support global efforts towards climate change adaptation and mitigation. MPAs \u2013 such as Cook Islands Marine Park and Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument in the US \u2013 currently cover about 6.35% of the ocean. However only just over 1.89% of that area is covered by exclusively no-take MPAs that do not allow any fishing, mining, drilling, or other extractive activities. This is far from the commitments of States made in relation to the Convention on Biological Diversity\u2019s (CBD) Aichi Target 11 of 10% MPA coverage by 2020, and even further from the recommendations made at the IUCN World Parks Congress 2014 that at least 30% no-take MPA coverage worldwide is needed. Most existing MPAs do not have enough human and financial resources to properly implement conservation and management measures. Added to this critical situation is a spatial disparity: seven countries have established around 80% of the surface of the MPAs in the ocean. The high seas, covering over half the Earth, still lack a framework through which MPAs can be established. Lack of strictly and permanently protected MPAs limits our ability to support climate change adaptation and mitigation. However, to reduce the overall climate change impacts on oceans, such as ocean warming, substantial cuts in greenhouse gas emissions are still urgently needed. Why is it important? Establishing MPA networks is critical to maintaining climate change resilience and rebuilding ecological and social resilience. For example, MPAs that protect coastal habitats such as barrier islands, coral reefs, mangroves and wetlands reduce human vulnerability in the face of climate change and provide the natural infrastructure (e.g. storm protection) on which people rely. Strictly protected MPA networks in coastal carbon habitats (mangroves, seagrasses, salt marshes) can ensure that no new emissions arise from the loss and degradation of these areas. At the same time, they stimulate new carbon sequestration through the restoration of degraded coastal habitats. MPAs, while not impervious to all climate change impacts, provide areas of reduced stress, improving the ability of marine organisms to adapt to climate change. Well-integrated MPA networks can increase species survival by allowing them to move around and escape certain pressures. In addition, MPAs where stressors are controlled can be used as sentinel (research) sites to help track the effects of climate change. This is consistent with the research and systematic observation obligations of countries under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and other international agreements. What can be done ? Measures to address current impacts of climate change on the ocean include significantly cutting emissions, upscaling proper protection for marine ecosystems to retain resistance and rebuild resilience, as well as implementing sustainable practices for all industries and uses across the ocean. Coastal states are well positioned to make use of MPAs for ecosystem-based adaptation and mitigation as a \u2018no-regret\u2019 climate change strategy. Processes such as Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) and Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) can be used by countries to improve the management of MPAs and help meet multiple objectives, including sustainable development, biodiversity conservation as well as climate change adaptation and mitigation. Adaptation strategies, including National Adaptation Plans and Programmes of Action, as well as mitigation efforts such as REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement, provide opportunities to use MPAs as an implementation tool for ecosystem-based adaptation and mitigation.

However, investment in \u2018natural infrastructure\u2019 is underexplored in policies aimed at reducing risk There is an urgent need to invest in nature-based solutions to disaster risk reduction in order to minimise our vulnerability to future events. Download November 2017 What is the issue? According to the Emergency Events Database, in the last ten years, over 730,000 people have lost their lives, over 1.9 million have been injured, and around 15 million have been made homeless as a result of disasters. A 2017 analysis by Munich Re revealed total economic losses from natural disaster events in 2016 reached US$ 175 billion \u2013 compared to US$ 103 billion in 2015. This was caused by natural catastrophes, such as forest fires in Canada and widespread flooding in the USA, Europe and Asia. Climate change is increasing the frequency, intensity and magnitude of disasters, leading to a higher number of deaths and injuries, as well as increased property and economic losses. In the past 20 years, 90% of major disasters have been caused by weather-related events such as heatwaves, storms, floods and droughts, according to the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR). Nature can provide cost-effective, no-regret solutions to disasters, complementing conventional engineering measures such as sea walls and storm channels. However, despite its value in reducing the risk of disasters and building communities\u2019 resilience to climate change, investment in \u2018natural infrastructure\u2019 has been underexplored in disaster risk reduction policies. Why is it important? Nature-based solutions, such as conserving forests, wetlands and coral reefs, can help communities prepare for, cope with, and recover from disasters, including slow-onset events such as drought. They can also reduce the secondary impacts from non-climate-related disasters such as landslides following an earthquake. Forests and other vegetation help stabilise slopes and therefore reduce the risk of landslides. Wetlands can help regulate floods. Coastal vegetation and natural features such as sand dunes and mangroves can provide protection from storm surges, strong winds and cyclones. Healthy coral reefs can reduce wave energy during coastal storms. In 2013, when Typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippine province of Leyte, 5,500 people died from storm surges along exposed coastlines. However, several communities in the same area remained relatively unaffected, and credited the presence of mangroves with saving their lives and properties. Following Hurricane Katrina, the US Congress in 2013 approved US$ 500 million to restore and reconnect ecosystems around the Gulf Islands and in the Jean Lafitte National Park on the New Orleans coast. These green spaces will help prevent economic damage and loss of lives from future extreme events. (Murti, R. and Buyck, C. (ed.) (2014). Safe Havens.) Nature-based solutions also generate local employment and economic opportunities, reducing the need to import technical expertise and labour as in the case of engineering and construction. Investment in these solutions to reduce risk can therefore be included in public-sector stimulus packages and social development programmes. What can be done? There is an urgent need to invest in disaster risk reduction to minimise our vulnerability to future events. To date, much of the focus has been on reactive measures to address sudden onset events such as storms and landslides, including humanitarian aid relief and preparedness. However, climate change is also responsible for slow onset disasters such as drought. While emergency measures are critical in times of disasters and require continued efforts, as a global community we must move from reactive to proactive risk reduction. Proactive investments in risk reduction can help countries prepare for this type of disaster that may be \u2018invisible\u2019 until a crisis point is reached, when more resources may be required to reverse the damage. Failing to address risk factors now means failure to secure investments in longer-term climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts.

Increasing ocean temperatures affect marine species and ecosystems, causing coral bleaching and the loss of breeding grounds for marine fishes and mammals. Rising ocean temperatures also affect the benefits humans derive from the ocean; threatening food security, increasing the prevalence of diseases, causing more extreme weather events and the loss of coastal protection. Achieving the mitigation targets set by the Paris Agreement on climate change and limiting the global average temperature increase to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels is crucial to prevent the massive, irreversible impacts of ocean warming. Establishing marine protected areas and putting in place adaptive measures, such as precautionary catch limits to prevent overfishing, can protect ocean ecosystems and shield humans from the effects of ocean warming. Download November 2017 What is the issue? The ocean absorbs vast quantities of heat as a result of increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, mainly from fossil fuel consumption. The Fifth Assessment Report published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2013 revealed that the ocean had absorbed more than 93% of the excess heat from greenhouse gas emissions since the 1970s. This is causing ocean temperatures to rise. Data from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) shows that the average global sea surface temperature \u2013 the temperature of the upper few metres of the ocean \u2013 has increased by approximately 0.13\u00b0C per decade over the past 100 years. A 2012 paper published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters revealed that the deep ocean is also affected, with one third of the excess heat absorbed 700 m below the sea surface. Modelling studies published in IPCC\u2019s 2013 Report predict that there is likely to be an increase in mean global ocean temperature of 1-4oC by 2100. Annual global sea surface temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2015 with superimposed linear trend (Base period 1951\u20131980), red positive, blue negative ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/time-series/global/globe/ocean/ytd/12/1880-2016 The distribution of excess heat in the ocean is not uniform, with the greatest ocean warming occurring in the Southern Hemisphere and contributing to the subsurface melting of Antarctic ice shelves. The ocean\u2019s ability to absorb excess heat has shielded humans from even more rapid changes in climate. Without this oceanic buffer, global temperatures would have risen much more than they have done to date. IPCC\u2019s Fourth Assessment Report published in 2007 estimated that the Earth had experienced a warming of 0.55\u00b0C since the 1970s. According to an analysis by the Grantham Institute, if the same amount of heat that has gone into the top 2,000 m of the ocean between 1955 and 2010 had gone into the lower 10 km of the atmosphere, the Earth would have seen a warming of 36\u00b0C. Maps of sea surface temperature anomalies for 2015 with a southern hemisphere polar and northern hemisphere semi-polar view Pierre H\u00e9laou\u00ebt, SAHFOS based on data: http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp Why is it important? Ocean warming leads to deoxygenation \u2013 a reduction in the amount of oxygen dissolved in the ocean \u2013 and sea-level rise \u2013 resulting from the thermal expansion of sea water and continental ice melting. The rising temperatures, coupled with ocean acidification (the decrease in pH of the ocean due to its uptake of CO2), affect marine species and ecosystems and, consequently, the fundamental benefits humans derive from the ocean. The consequences of excess heat from greenhouse gas emissions modified after von Schuckmann et al., 2016 Impact on marine species and ecosystems Marine fishes, seabirds and marine mammals all face very high risks from increasing temperatures, including high levels of mortalities, loss of breeding grounds and mass movements as species search for favourable environmental conditions. Coral reefs are also affected by increasing temperatures which cause coral bleaching and increase their risk of mortality. Impact on humans A 2012 report by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that marine and freshwater capture fisheries and aquaculture provide 4.3 billion people with about 15% of their animal protein. Fisheries and aquaculture are also a source of income for millions of people worldwide. By altering distributions of fish stocks and increasing the vulnerability of fish species to diseases, ocean warming is a serious risk to food security and people\u2019s livelihoods globally. Economic losses related to ocean warming are likely to run from tens to hundreds of millions of dollars. Rising temperatures also affect vegetation and reef-building species such as corals and mangroves, which protect coastlines from erosion and sea-level rise.

The rise in sea surface temperatures is causing more severe hurricanes and the intensification of El Ni\u00f1o events bringing droughts and floods. This can have significant socio-economic and health effects in some regions of the world. Warming ocean temperatures are linked to the increase and spread of diseases in marine species. Humans risk direct transmission of these diseases when consuming marine species, or from infections of wounds exposed in marine environments. What can be done? Limiting greenhouse gas emissions There is an urgent need to achieve the mitigation targets set by the Paris Agreement on climate change and hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. This will help prevent the massive and irreversible impacts of growing temperatures on ocean ecosystems and their services. Protecting marine and coastal ecosystems Well-managed protected areas can help conserve and protect ecologically and biologically significant marine habitats. This will regulate human activities in these habitats and prevent environmental degradation. Restoring marine and coastal ecosystems Elements of ecosystems that have already experienced damage can be restored. This can include building artificial structures such as rock pools that act as surrogate habitats for organisms, or boosting the resilience of species to warmer temperatures through assisted breeding techniques. Improving human adaptation Governments can introduce policies to keep fisheries production within sustainable limits, for example by setting precautionary catch limits and eliminating subsidies to prevent overfishing. Coastal setback zones which prohibit all or certain types of development along the shoreline can minimise the damage from coastal flooding and erosion. New monitoring tools can be developed to forecast and control marine disease outbreaks. Strengthening scientific research Governments can increase investments in scientific research to measure and monitor ocean warming and its effects. This will provide more precise data on the scale, nature and impacts of ocean warming, making it possible to design and implement adequate and appropriate mitigation and adaptation strategies.

This causes changes in water temperature, ocean acidification and deoxygenation, leading to changes in oceanic circulation and chemistry, rising sea levels, extreme weather, and changes in the diversity and abundance of marine species. Degradation of coastal and marine ecosystems threatens the physical, economic and food security of local communities, as well as resources for global businesses. Climate change weakens the ability of the ocean to provide critical ecosystem services such as food and oxygen, as well as to support Nature-based Solutions to climate change adaptation. The sustainable management, conservation and restoration of coastal and marine ecosystems are vital to support the provision of ecosystem services on which people depend; this requires a low carbon emissions trajectory. Download November 2017 What is the issue? At the front line of climate change, the ocean, the coastlines and coastal communities are being disproportionately impacted by increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from human activities. The ocean plays a central role in regulating the Earth\u2019s climate. The Fifth Assessment Report published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2013 revealed that it has thus far absorbed 93% of the extra energy from the enhanced greenhouse effect, with warming now being observed at depths of 1,000 m. As a consequence, this has led to increased ocean stratification (prevention of water mixing due to different properties of water masses), changes in ocean current regimes, and expansion of depleted oxygen zones. Changes in the geographical ranges of marine species and shifts in growing seasons, as well as in the diversity and abundance of species communities are now being observed. At the same time, weather patterns are changing, with extreme events increasing in frequency. Atmospheric warming is leading to the melting of inland glaciers and ice, causing rising sea levels with significant impacts on shorelines (coastal erosion, saltwater intrusion, habitat destruction) and coastal human settlements. The IPCC projects global mean sea level to increase by 0.40 [0.26\u20130.55] m for 2081\u20132100 compared with 1986\u20132005 for a low emission scenario, and by 0.63 [0.45\u20130.82] m for a high emission scenario. Extreme El Ni\u00f1o events are predicted to increase in frequency due to rising GHG emissions. CO2 emissions are also making the ocean more acidic, making many marine species and ecosystems increasingly vulnerable. Ocean acidification reduces the ability of marine organisms, such as corals, plankton and shellfish, to build their shells and skeletal structures. It also exacerbates existing physiological stresses (such as impeded respiration and reproduction) and reduces growth and survival rates during the early life stages of some species. Consequences of CO2 increase on the ecosystems Ocean Climate Platform Why is it important? The ocean and coasts provide critical ecosystem services such as carbon storage, oxygen generation, food and income generation. Coastal ecosystems like mangroves, salt marshes and seagrasses play a vital role in carbon storage and sequestration. Per unit of area, they sequester carbon faster and far more efficiently than terrestrial forests. When these ecosystems are degraded, lost or converted, massive amounts of CO2 \u2013 an estimated 0.15-1.02 billion tons every year \u2013 are released into the atmosphere or ocean, accounting for up to 19% of global carbon emissions from deforestation. The ecosystem services such as flood and storm protection that they provide are also lost. The impacts of ocean warming and acidification on coastal and marine species and ecosystems are already observable. For example, the current amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is already too high for coral reefs to thrive, putting at risk food provision, flood protection and other services corals provide. Moreover, increased GHG emissions exacerbate the impact of already existing stressors on coastal and marine environments from land-based activities (e.g. urban discharges, agricultural runoff and plastic waste) and the ongoing, unsustainable exploitation of these systems (e.g. overfishing, deep-sea mining and coastal development). These cumulative impacts weaken the ability of the ocean and coasts to continue to perform critical ecosystem services. The degradation of coastal and marine ecosystems threatens the physical, economic and food security of coastal communities \u2013 around 40% of the world population.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "985b3adb-645e-4e4e-9e6e-31197178f743": {"__data__": {"id_": "985b3adb-645e-4e4e-9e6e-31197178f743", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-brief/ocean-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Issue Brief"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The ocean and climate change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-brief/ocean-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Issue Brief"}, "hash": "aae673e209d3fd5dd5423621305c7fdc247313fd6364c1cdb0c8ae8dadeea64c"}, "2": {"node_id": "68708fe5-a28d-4475-8961-af6b12b7a3ac", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-brief/ocean-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Issue Brief"}, "hash": "eebeb9f1121876eb5bfd6b5cb410ab84592ba53f147acad294503addb888ab21"}}, "hash": "34cdd16a50c4cbc12f2aa11db71a0de113be93aad5db63c036bd260bd88f3cfd", "text": "Local fishers, indigenous and other coastal communities, international business organisations and the tourism industry are already seeing the effects of climate change particularly in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and many of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs).

What can be done? The sustainable management, conservation and restoration of coastal and marine ecosystems are vital to support the continued provision of carbon sequestration and other ecosystem services on which people depend. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) for example can protect ecologically and biologically significant marine habitats, including regulating human activities to prevent environmental degradation. At the IUCN World Conservation Congress 2016, IUCN Members approved a resolution calling for the protection of 30% of the planet\u2019s ocean by 2030. Protection and restoration of coastal ecosystems is also needed. Policies to prevent the conversion of these ecosystems to other land uses, for example regulating coastal development, can ensure their protection. Countries can also develop policies and ensure the implementation of sustainable practices in all industries that impact the ocean and coasts, including fisheries and the tourism industry. Support for scientific research is needed. This will ensure the continued monitoring and analyses of the impacts of climate change, with the knowledge gained used to design and implement adequate and appropriate mitigation and adaptation strategies. Globally ambitious efforts are also needed to reduce the use of fossil fuels, increase the use of renewable energy systems and enhance energy efficiency. This will reduce the impacts of CO2 and other GHGs on the ocean. The key is to harness existing opportunities, by, for example, conserving certain coastal carbon ecosystems under the reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) mechanism, as well as implementing the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement.

Many aspects of seamounts are poorly understood: fewer than 300 of 200,000 existing seamounts have been explored so far. There is an urgent need to ensure seamount conservation through measures such as marine protected areas. Threats to seamount ecosystems need to be taken into account when developing environmental impact assessments of activities that may affect them. A clear set of rules is needed for sample sharing and use of genetic resources derived from areas beyond national jurisdiction. Download April 2017 What is the issue? Seamounts are underwater mountains of volcanic origin that rise from the seafloor. Regarded as hotspots of biological diversity in the ocean, seamounts serve as spawning sites for many species. Marine mammals such as whales and dolphins and large predators such as sharks rely on them to feed and rest during migrations. Thanks to their isolation, seamounts can exhibit high levels of biological endemism, which means that many species that occur in or around seamounts cannot be found anywhere else on the planet. However, many aspects of seamounts are poorly understood: fewer than 300 out of 200,000 existing seamounts have been explored so far. Seamounts are mostly found in marine areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ) \u2013 areas covered by fragmented legal frameworks which leave their biodiversity vulnerable to growing threats. Discussions to fill these legal gaps by creating an implementing agreement to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) are currently underway. Global seamount distribution Yesson et al., 2011 Seamount biodiversity and ecosystems face a number of threats including deep sea bottom fishing and deep sea mining. Many seamount species grow and reproduce slowly and are therefore highly vulnerable to unsustainable fishing and mineral exploration, through potential overexploitation and habitat destruction. Seamount ecosystems have low ability to recover from such damage and no evidence of regrowth has been documented in these ecosystems. Other threats include pollution, invasive alien species, ocean warming, deoxygenation and ocean acidification. Why is it important? Seamounts play an important and only partially understood role in marine ecosystems, extending well beyond the seamounts themselves. Damage to seamounts and their overexploitation can have widespread consequences on ocean health, food security, medicine and other benefits that oceans provide to humans. Inversely, their conservation can help advance towards several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) including SDG2 \u2013 to end hunger and achieve food security, and SDG14 \u2013 to conserve and sustainably use the oceans. Two-thirds of fish stocks in areas beyond national jurisdiction are being fished beyond sustainable limits and this is also affecting fish yields in exclusive economic zones (EEZs) \u2013 zones in which states have sovereign rights and duties related to the use and management of natural resources. Overfishing in the oceans threatens global food security as it disrupts marine communities and creates an imbalance between species, with commercially-important fishes unable to replenish their stocks. The high level of biological endemism of seamount ecosystems and the fact that seamounts remain largely unexplored mean that they may contain new genetic resources that could be used to develop new medicines. What can be done? Threats to seamounts and their associated biodiversity need to be taken into account in the development of schemes aimed at conserving marine biodiversity in ABNJ. Improving global governance of ABNJ: The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) sets out the obligations of States to protect, conserve and manage the ocean, including ABNJ. However, it does not create comprehensive means for ensuring conservation, leaving most activities largely unchecked. Negotiations are underway to create an Implementing Agreement to UNCLOS, which would help close the existing ABNJ governance gap. The agreement would complement existing regional and sectoral conservation measures by creating a set of common principles, criteria and standards. It would also help ensure the coordination of the various sectoral and regional bodies involved in ABNJ, and adopt mechanisms to establish globally recognised marine protected areas. A clear set of rules for sample sharing and use of genetic resources derived from ABNJ, promoting transparency and the involvement of users from all countries, is also needed.

They cover over 40% of the earth's land surface, and are home to more than two billion people. They are highly adapted to climatic variability and water stress, but also extremely vulnerable to damaging human activities such as deforestation, overgrazing and unsustainable agricultural practices, which cause land degradation. Land degradation in drylands is known as desertification, and is the loss of the biological or economic productivity of land. Desertification reduces agricultural output, contributes to droughts and increases human vulnerability to climate change. The loss of biodiversity in drylands, including bacteria, fungi and insects living in the soil, is one of the major causes and outcomes of land degradation. Restoring rangelands and sustainable land management practices can preserve drylands biodiversity, restore ecosystem functions, and halt land degradation. Download June 2017 What is the issue? Drylands are places of water scarcity, where rainfall may be limited or may only be abundant for a short period. They experience high mean temperatures, leading to high rates of water loss to evaporation and transpiration. Drylands are also characterised by extremely high levels of climatic uncertainty, and many areas can experience varying amounts of annual precipitation for several years. Drylands are found on all continents, and include grasslands, savannahs, shrublands and woodlands. They are most common in Africa and Asia \u2013 for example, in the Sahel region in Africa and almost all of the Middle East. Drylands cover over 40% of the earth's land surface, provide 44% of the world\u2019s cultivated systems and 50% of the world\u2019s livestock, and are home to more than two billion people. Drylands are extremely vulnerable to climatic variations, and damaging human activities such as deforestation, overgrazing and unsustainable agricultural practices. The consequences of these include soil erosion, the loss of soil nutrients, changes to the amount of salt in the soil, and disruptions to the carbon, nitrogen and water cycles \u2013 collectively known as land degradation. Land degradation leads to the reduction or loss of the biological or economic productivity and complexity of land. In drylands, land degradation is known as desertification. It is estimated that 25-35% of drylands are already degraded, with over 250 million people directly affected and about one billion people in over one hundred countries at risk. Why is it important ? Biodiversity Drylands support an impressive array of biodiversity. This includes wild endemic species \u2013 such as the Saiga Antelope in the Asian steppe and American bison in the North American grasslands that do not occur anywhere else on earth \u2013 and cultivated plants and livestock varieties known as agrobiodiversity. Biodiversity in drylands also includes organisms which live in the soil, such as bacteria, fungi and insects \u2013 known as soil biodiversity \u2013 which are uniquely adapted to the conditions. Soil biodiversity comprises the largest variety of species in drylands \u2013 determining carbon, nitrogen and water cycles and thereby, the productivity and resilience of land. The loss of biodiversity in drylands is one of the major causes and outcomes of land degradation. Soil biodiversity and ecosystem functions IUCN Food and water provision Low precipitation and prolonged dry seasons in drylands can lead to water scarcity, and limit agricultural productivity and output. Drylands biodiversity maintains soil fertility and moisture to ensure agricultural growth, and reduces the risk of drought and other environmental hazards. For example, vegetation is decomposed in the stomachs of large herbivores in the drylands, after which the dung is transformed into nutrients by bacteria in the soil, which are absorbed by plants. Bacteria and other microbes also break down plants and animals into decomposing residues \u2013 soil organic matter, which helps the soil easily absorb rainwater and retain moisture. Each gram of organic matter can increase soil moisture by 10-20 grams, and each millimetre of additional infiltration of water into the soil represents one million additional litres of water per square kilometre. Poor crop and soil management, and habitat destruction undermine the ability of drylands biodiversity to perform nutrient recycling, and water storage and filtration services. On severely degraded land \u2013 devoid of biodiversity \u2013 as little as 5% of total rainfall may be used productively. An estimated 20 million hectares of fertile land is degraded every year, and in the next 25 years global food production could fall by up to 12% as a result of land degradation \u2013 threatening the food and water security of the rising human population.

The carbon stored in soil is released into the atmosphere when land is degraded, and about 60% of the earth\u2019s organic carbon has been lost through land degradation. This represents a significant contribution to man-made greenhouse gas emissions. Increasing the quantity of carbon contained in soil, for example through agriculture and pasture management practices which increase soil organic matter, can reduce the annual increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It is estimated that improved livestock rangeland management could potentially sequester a further 1,300-2,000 million metric tons of carbon dioxide by 2030. Climate change will also impact drylands, with models predicting even more climatic variability and extreme temperatures. Biodiversity in drylands has adapted over millennia to the seasonality, scarcity and variability of rainfall, and can be useful in helping people adapt to climate change. For example, the unique species in drylands provide a genetic reservoir for new varieties of cultivated plants and livestock breeds, which are resilient to the climatic variations. What can be done ? Conserving biodiversity in drylands, including soil biodiversity, ensures that vegetation for agriculture and livestock farming is maintained all year round, especially in between rainfall seasons. IUCN works with national governments, businesses and local communities to preserve and protect ecosystem functions in drylands by restoring rangelands for livestock and sustainable land management practices. Rangelands restoration Livestock farmers (pastoralists) depend on drylands resources such as grasslands and seasonal ponds to nourish their livestock. Sustainable pasture management through managed herd mobility can prevent degradation and sustain livelihoods. For example, the practice of Hima in Jordan takes into account the seasons and life cycle of grasses to prevent overgrazing by livestock herds, which also transport fertile seeds around the landscape. Governments can institute appropriate policies and grant rights to local communities to sustain these traditional practices. For example, grazing lands can be recognised as protected areas, to prevent their conversion to other land uses. Boran pastoralist with his cattle in northern Kenya Rafal Obrzud Sustainable land management practices Sustainable land management practices often involve protecting biodiversity to boost soil organic matter and soil moisture. Traditional crop farming practices used by communities in drylands build up soil moisture and restore degraded land. For example, the za\u00ef pits used by communities in the western Sahelian drylands (Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali) involves planting seeds in pits filled with organic manure to concentrate water and nutrients at the plant's base. Practices like agroforestry (planting trees together with agricultural crops) and low tillage agriculture (involving little or no ploughing of land) are based on traditional practices that have been revived and adapted to protect soil moisture and fertility of crop lands.

An increase of just 1% of the carbon stocks in the top metre of soils would be higher than the amount corresponding to the annual anthropogenic CO2 emissions from fossil fuel burning. Many innovations in sustainable land management are now known and recognised for their multiple environmental, social and economic benefits. Sustainable land management can be mainstreamed in national development and conservation planning based on existing commitments under the Sustainable Development Goals and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). Urgent improvements are needed to monitor soil organic carbon and increase awareness of, and capacity to pursue, the many opportunities of sustainable land management. Download November 2015 What is the issue? Soil is the biggest terrestrial carbon sink. The world\u2019s soils store more carbon than the planet\u2019s biomass and atmosphere combined. This includes soil organic carbon, which is essentially biodiversity: microbes, fungi and invertebrates, as well as root matter and decomposing vegetation. Soil carbon stocks can be increased through appropriate land management to provide many benefits besides offsetting greenhouse gas emissions. Loss of soil organic carbon is one of the principal signs of land degradation, and land degradation is one of the leading challenges for sustainable development, biodiversity conservation, and mitigating and adapting to climate change. It is defined as a reduction or loss of the biological or economic productivity and complexity of land. In drylands, land degradation is known as desertification. When land is degraded, soil carbon can be released into the atmosphere, along with nitrous oxide, making land degradation one of the biggest contributors to climate change. An estimated two-thirds of all terrestrial carbon stores from soils and vegetation have been lost since the 19th century through land degradation. Agriculture, forest and other land-use sectors generate roughly a quarter of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. UNCCD Science-Policy Interface Why is it important? Recent estimates of the global loss of ecosystem services due to land degradation and desertification are between US$ 6.3 and 10.6 trillion annually. These high costs have not received adequate attention, partly due to the complexity of accurately measuring the knock-on effects and externalities of land degradation. There is a tendency by countries to only consider the impact on food production and to overlook ecosystem services such as water supply and regulation or reduction in carbon sequestration. IUCN\u2019s work in Jordan has shown that these values can dwarf the value of food production by an order of magnitude. Managing land sustainably means less carbon emissions and more carbon capture. Soil organic carbon contributes to the fertility of the soil and to its capacity to hold water, and therefore to a large extent determines the capacity of the soil to produce food and to support other biodiversity. The resilience of societies and ecosystems is increased where soil productivity, and hence carbon stock, is increased. What can be done? A broad suite of agro-ecology practices can be used to increase carbon in the soil, including agroforestry, fallows (resting soil for a year or more), and sustainable pasture management through managed herd mobility. In many countries these are known \u2013 and even Indigenous \u2013 practices that can be revived with the right support. Recent studies suggest that soil carbon management presents one of the most cost-effective climate change mitigation options. Rangelands, for example, contain more than a third of all the terrestrial above- and below-ground carbon reserves. With improved rangeland management they could potentially sequester a further 1,300-2,000 million metric tons of CO2 by 2030. Small increases in global soil organic carbon will have a high impact on the global carbon cycle and on the atmospheric concentration of CO2. An increase of just 1% of the carbon stocks in the top metre of soils would be higher than the amount corresponding to the annual anthropogenic CO2 emissions from fossil fuel burning. Reversing land degradation and increasing soil organic carbon provides one of the surest and lowest-cost multiple-wins: climate change mitigation and adaptation, conservation of biodiversity, and increased food production. There are several options that countries can consider to increase soil organic carbon stocks. Sustainable land management can be accelerated through policy and financial instruments, to increase soil organic carbon in a way that simultaneously combats desertification, prevents biodiversity loss and helps climate change mitigation and adaptation. Other measures include treating land-based approaches to climate change mitigation as integral to global and national strategies; promoting awareness and sharing experience of the multiple benefits provided by sustainable land", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "48eec617-31e8-4570-bfb2-dd730d60548c": {"__data__": {"id_": "48eec617-31e8-4570-bfb2-dd730d60548c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-brief/land-degradation-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Issue Brief"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Land degradation and climate change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-brief/land-degradation-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Issue Brief"}, "hash": "5ecee8b2d3ac123f2535b88da1c6ba577c3764262dc29ebf1f1b0cbc1ad3c10d"}}, "hash": "5ecee8b2d3ac123f2535b88da1c6ba577c3764262dc29ebf1f1b0cbc1ad3c10d", "text": "management; and ensuring that soil organic carbon is fully accounted for across all sectors as an indicator of the multiple benefits of sustainable land management.

As climate changes, droughts, floods, melting glaciers, sea-level rise and storms intensify or alter, often with severe consequences. Climate change impacts have direct consequences for water security and conflict. In order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, climate change adaptation will have to build climate resilience. Climate resilience is strengthened through healthy ecosystem services that rely on well-functioning river basins. Effective country-driven climate change adaptation should reflect the importance of water management in reducing vulnerability and building climate resilience. Download November 2015 What is the issue? Water and weather, the delicate balance between evaporation and precipitation, is the primary cycle through which climate change is felt. As our climate changes, droughts, floods, melting glaciers, sea-level rise and storms intensify or alter, often with severe consequences. Only 3% of the planet\u2019s water is freshwater, and of this, two-thirds is captured in glaciers and polar ice. In the current climate predictions, safeguarding the water we have in the supplies we need for a global population set to reach 10 billion by 2050 will be a challenging task. Why is it important? There is much at stake. The World Economic Forum ranked water crises as number one in its 2015 assessment of global risks, with potential to cause damaging economic and social impacts across entire countries and sectors. Living with climate change will mean coping with the impacts on water, whether too much or too little, and taking the necessary steps to reduce the vulnerabilities of communities and economies. Water security Climate change impacts will have direct consequences for water security. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) alerted the global community to the great vulnerability of freshwater resources as a result of climate change. A recent study by the International Food Policy Research Institute found that 4.8 billion people \u2013 more than half the world\u2019s population \u2013 and approximately half of global grain production will be at risk due to water stress by 2050 if business-as-usual persists. Water cooperation Water management helps to drive transboundary cooperation, including on climate resilience. Water cooperation helps to reduce the risk of conflict within communities and among countries. What can be done? In order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, climate change adaptation will have to build climate resilience. Adaptation must better equip societies to withstand shocks and disasters. Nature-based solutions such as mangroves protecting shorelines from storms, lakes storing large water supplies and floodplains absorbing excess water runoff, are a key part of this strategy. These natural services perform an infrastructure-like function. Yet they are not built infrastructure, they are shaped, grown, eroded or deposited by nature. Working with this natural infrastructure can optimise the performance and financial benefits of engineered infrastructure. Climate resilience can be strengthened through healthy ecosystem services that rely on well-functioning river basins. The experience of the IUCN Global Water Programme in integrating environment and development has shown that four components combine to build climate resilience in practice: Transitioning dialogue into implementation Adaptation actions such as developing or adapting drainage or water storage, whether with built or natural infrastructure, should be implemented within this strategy. The strategy should guide policies, planning and investment across sectors, including economic planning, poverty reduction strategies, agriculture, energy and water resources development. The resilience framework is a practical means of mainstreaming climate change in development and implementing the Sustainable Development Goals. Global dialogue on climate change adaptation must transition into implementation and country-driven action. Support for country-driven implementation can be provided through the IUCN Global Water Programme for action on water and climate change that builds on three pillars. To guide effective country-driven climate change adaptation, activities should reflect the importance of water management for reducing vulnerability and building climate resilience, by: 1. Putting adaptive Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) at the centre of planning and investment for climate change adaptation. Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions also depend on access to reliable water resources, as all mitigation actions need water to succeed. 2. Promoting investment and implementation that incorporates management, restoration and sustainability of \u2018natural infrastructure\u2019 \u2013 the ecosystem services provided by healthy watersheds and coasts \u2013 and their benefits for climate resilient development of the food and energy sectors. 3. Supporting actions at scale to build climate resilience by combining watershed management, sustainable infrastructure, empowerment and learning through adaptive institutions. Climate-driven water hazards risk setting development off track.

Human-wildlife conflicts are becoming more frequent, serious and widespread as human populations grow and habitats are lost. Effectively managing human-wildlife conflicts protects communities, stops conflicts escalating, builds trust in conservation and avoids retaliation against wildlife. Human-wildlife conflicts have unique ecological, cultural, social, historical, physical, economic and political characteristics which strategies to manage conflicts must consider. Download June 2022 What is the issue? Wildlife can pose a direct threat to the safety, livelihoods and wellbeing of people. For example, when elephants forage on crops, seals damage fishing nets or jaguars kill livestock, people can lose their livelihoods. Retaliation against the species blamed often ensues. The term human-wildlife conflict has traditionally been applied only to these negative interactions between people and wildlife, but this implies deliberate action by wildlife species and ignores the conflicts between groups of people about what should be done to resolve the situation. The IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC) Human-Wildlife Conflict & Coexistence Specialist Group defines human-wildlife conflict as: struggles that emerge when the presence or behaviour of wildlife poses an actual or perceived, direct and recurring threat to human interests or needs, leading to disagreements between groups of people and negative impacts on people and/or wildlife. Human-wildlife conflicts are becoming more frequent, serious and widespread because of human population growth, agricultural expansion, infrastructure development, climate change and other drivers of habitat loss. Human-wildlife conflicts can occur wherever wildlife and human populations overlap, so any factor that forces wildlife and people into closer contact makes conflicts more likely. Much work to date has focussed on interventions to reduce impacts on people and retaliation against wildlife such as creating barriers, deploying deterrents or moving wildlife. In the absence of consultative, collaborative processes with stakeholders, these measures often have limited success. Lion killing a donkey on the boundary of Makgadikgadi Pans National Park, Botswana James Stevens Why is this important? Healthy ecosystems and the vital services they provide to people depend on wildlife. Managing human-wildlife conflicts is therefore crucial to achieve the UN Vision for Biodiversity 2050 in which \u2018humanity lives in harmony with nature and in which wildlife and other living species are protected\u2019. Human-wildlife conflicts have severe implications for communities\u2019 livelihoods, safety and wellbeing, and risk undermining conservation efforts by eroding support for protected areas, wildlife and biodiversity. Retaliation against wildlife can pose a serious threat to a species\u2019 survival, and reverse previous conservation progress. For example, wolves, bears and other large carnivores are recovering across Europe, leading to tensions over how to manage their presence, which is welcomed by some and perceived as a risk to safety and livelihoods by others. What can be done? Human-wildlife conflict is recognised as a global concern in the UN Convention on Biological Diversity\u2019s post-2020 global biodiversity framework (to be adopted by Parties at CBD COP15 Part Two). Related to this, many governments are beginning to include the management of human-wildlife conflict in national policies and strategies to ensure resources are made available to manage them. There are numerous approaches and measures that can be taken to reduce the damage or impacts, de-escalate tensions, address risks to income and poverty, and develop sustainable solutions. These sometimes include barriers (fences, nets, trenches), guarding and early-warning systems, deterrents and repellents (sirens, lights, beehives), translocation (moving wildlife), compensation or insurance, providing risk-reducing alternatives, as well as managing tensions between stakeholders involved in these situations. Effective planning and implementation of such measures requires consideration of good principles in community led-conservation, in collaboration with the communities affected. Asian elephants damage crops in Assam, India Assam Haathi Project, Chester Zoo Research has shown that conflicts are complex and each situation has unique ecological, cultural, social, historical, physical, economic and political characteristics. Although it is tempting to transfer approaches for damage reduction (e.g. fences, barriers) that appear helpful in one area directly to another, these only succeed if achieved through consultative, collaborative processes with stakeholders.

Depleting terrestrial deposits and rising demand for metals mean deep-sea mining may begin soon, even though research suggests that it could destroy habitats and wipe out species. Deep-sea mining should be halted until the criteria specified by IUCN are met, including the introduction of assessments, effective regulation and mitigation strategies. Comprehensive studies are needed to improve our understanding of deep-sea ecosystems and the vital services they provide to people, such as food and carbon sequestration. Download May 2022 What is the issue? Deep-sea mining is the process of extracting and often excavating mineral deposits from the deep seabed. The deep seabed is the seabed at ocean depths greater than 200m, and covers about two-thirds of the total seafloor. Research suggests deep-sea mining could severely harm marine biodiversity and ecosystems, but we still lack the knowledge and means to implement protections. Despite this, there is growing interest in the mineral deposits of the seabed. This is said to be due to depleting terrestrial deposits of metals such as copper, nickel, aluminium, manganese, zinc, lithium and cobalt. Demand for these metals is also increasing to produce technologies like smartphones, wind turbines, solar panels and batteries. ISA, 2021 By May 2022, the International Seabed Authority (ISA), which regulates activities in the seabed beyond national jurisdiction (\u2018the Area\u2019), had issued 31 contracts to explore deep-sea mineral deposits. More than 1.5 million km2 of international seabed, roughly the size of Mongolia, has been set aside for mineral exploration. To date, the ISA has only issued exploration contracts, but is developing regulations to govern the transition to exploitation. In June 2021, the Government of Nauru notified the ISA of their intention to start deep-sea mining, triggering a rush to finalise the ISA regulations. Mining in international waters could commence as soon as 2026; even though vital research and work to adopt the required regulations, standards and guidelines to manage deep-sea mining sustainably is far from complete. Why is this important? As the deep sea remains understudied and poorly understood, there are many gaps in our understanding of its biodiversity and ecosystems. This makes it difficult to assess the potential impacts of deep-sea mining or to put in place adequate safeguards to protect the marine environment, and the three billion people whose livelihoods depend on marine and coastal biodiversity. The seafloor contains an extensive array of geological features. These include abyssal plains 3,500\u20136,500m below the sea surface, volcanic underwater mountains known as seamounts, hydrothermal vents with bursting water heated by volcanic activity, and deep trenches such as the Mariana Trench. These remote places support species that are uniquely adapted to harsh conditions, such as lack of sunlight and high pressure. Experts predict that many of these species are unknown to science. Based on current knowledge of the deep sea, the following impacts of mining activities could affect its biodiversity and ecosystems: Disturbance of the seafloor The digging and gauging of the ocean floor by machines can alter or destroy deep-sea habitats. This leads to the loss of species, many of which are found nowhere else, and the fragmentation or loss of ecosystem structure and function. It is the most direct impact from deep-sea mining and the damage caused is most likely permanent. Potential impacts from deep-sea mining: doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2011914117 Amanda Dillon from Drazen et al. 2020 Sediment plumes Deep-sea mining will stir up fine sediments on the seafloor, creating plumes of suspended particles. This is exacerbated by mining ships discharging waste water at the surface. Scientists are concerned these particles may disperse for hundreds of kilometres, take a long time to resettle on the seafloor, and affect ecosystems and commercially important or vulnerable species. For instance, such plumes could smother animals, harm filter-feeding species, and block animals\u2019 visual communication. Pollution Species such as whales, tuna and sharks could be affected by noise, vibrations and light pollution caused by mining equipment and surface vessels, as well as potential leaks and spills of fuel and toxic products.

Species declines threaten the services that nature provides to people, which include functioning as carbon sinks and increasing our resilience to climate change. Environmental policies aimed at reducing CO2 emissions are essential for reducing the impact of climate change on species. Prioritising nature conservation and embracing strategies to promote climate change adaptation can enhance species survival. Tools are available to support species conservation under climate change, including the IUCN Red List, the IUCN SSC Guidelines for Assessing Species\u2019 Vulnerability to Climate Change, and the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool. Download October 2021 What is the issue? Mean global temperatures have risen ~1\u00baC since pre-industrial times as a result of human activities. In addition to increasing global temperatures, the impacts of climate change include extreme weather events such as drought, hurricanes and rising sea levels. Graph: Global mean temperature over time since 1880 (NASA, 2017) Nasa 2017 Species are already being impacted by anthropogenic climate change, and its rapid onset is limiting the ability of many species to adapt to their environments. Climate change currently affects at least 10,967 species on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species\u2122, increasing the likelihood of their extinction. The Bramble Cay melomys (Melomys rubicola) is the first mammal reported to have gone extinct as a direct result of climate change. Previously found only on the island of Bramble Cay in Great Barrier Reef, its habitat was destroyed by rising sea levels. Corals form one of the most biodiverse ecosystems, yet they are among the most rapidly declining species groups due to mass bleaching, disease and die-offs caused by rising ocean temperatures, as well ocean acidification. Meeting the Paris Agreement\u2019s target of less than 2\u00b0C rise in global temperatures is essential for the survival of coral reefs. In addition to increased rates of disease and degraded habitats, climate change is also causing changes in species themselves, which threaten their survival. Rising temperatures have led to ecological changes including the migration of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) to Arctic rivers, while behavioural changes in species include earlier breeding times for North American tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor). Climate change is also causing significant physiological changes. Warmer temperatures during egg incubation are causing imbalanced female to male sex ratios among Endangered green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas), with females accounting for 99% of newly hatched turtles on some nesting beaches. Genetic changes attributed to climate change include hybridisation \u2013 interbreeding as species\u2019 habitats change \u2013 affecting species such as the common toad (Bufo bufo) and green toad (Bufotes balearicus) in southern Italy. Why is it important? In addition to their intrinsic value, species play essential roles in ecosystems, which in turn provide vital services to humans. Climate change interacts with threats such as habitat loss and overharvesting to further exacerbate species declines. The decline of species and ecosystems can then accelerate climate change, creating a feedback loop that further exacerbates the situation. Altered food chains The effects of climate change on even the smallest species can threaten ecosystems and other species across the food chain. For example, increased sea-ice melt and ocean acidification in the Arctic Ocean is reducing krill populations, threatening the survival of whales, penguins and seals that depend on krill as a primary food source. Because species lowest in the food chain are often among the first impacted by climate change, the full impacts of species loss may not be seen for decades. The types and severity of diseases that affect crops are also changing. For example, incidences of Fusarium ear blight on wheat are increasing due to a rise in temperature and rainfall. These can produce mycotoxins that make wheat inedible and cause crop losses of up to 60%. Invasive alien species Invasive alien species are among the main causes of biodiversity loss and species extinctions, and the proliferation of invasive species is often exacerbated by climate change. Native to South America, the water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) can now be found in parts of every continent except Antarctica, and it is expected to increase its range as the climate warms. The hyacinth deoxygenates rivers, killing fish populations, which in turn reduces income and food supply for local communities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "30ad7489-f03e-4135-9eb0-dd536e9414cc": {"__data__": {"id_": "30ad7489-f03e-4135-9eb0-dd536e9414cc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-brief/species-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Issue Brief"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Species and climate change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-brief/species-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Issue Brief"}, "hash": "46b22aef4b69ebd0cc132ab5403aa2e963b55f66e21ff74a867558ec63bc0490"}, "2": {"node_id": "d1c08eef-ad93-45b7-8bf7-e74fefa695eb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-brief/species-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Issue Brief"}, "hash": "9cbb1db7b64e3745070ad53fd65ad773b7943f5bd9757c6919e27fc2743995ec"}}, "hash": "7b0037172a1afeb7b02877619cf26d0c406d9a7134ad75139a52a918b5d42752", "text": "Carbon sinks become sources Climate change affects the ability of plant species to sequester carbon, turning carbon sinks into carbon sources.

Warmer egg incubation periods lead to skewed gender ratios of the Endangered green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) \u00a9 Andre Seale / IUCN Photo Library What can be done? Efforts to conserve species and mitigate the impacts of climate change require an approach that includes meeting climate targets, conserving and securing habitats, and helping species adapt. Reduce CO2 emissions. Long-term and cohesive actions to meet Paris Agreement targets for emissions reductions can prevent temperature increases from exceeding the critical 2\u00b0 threshold. This will have greatest impact on reducing the impacts of climate change on species and ensuring ecosystems continue to provide habitats for species and their wide-ranging services to people. Help nature to help people. By functioning as carbon sinks, ecosystems like forests, wetlands and tundra combat climate change and play a key role in helping countries meet their Paris Agreement targets. Restoring ecosystems and reforesting in biodiversity-friendly ways with climate-change resilient species can further increase their effectiveness. Nature can also help people adapt. For example, conserving coastal species such as mangroves and coral provides an ongoing source of food and supports livelihoods, while also providing protection from tsunamis, storm surges, and other extreme weather caused by climate change. Help species cope. Species are the building blocks of ecosystems, and reducing the risks to species posed by climate change is critical. Sound conservation responses include helping species adapt to shifting climates and preparing strategies for coping with extreme weather events such as heat waves, floods and droughts. Minimising non-climate stressors is essential for increasing species\u2019 future resilience to climate change. Humans\u2019 responses to climate change, including changing land use (e.g. planting biofuels) and building hard infrastructure (e.g. wind turbines and dams), may have negative impacts on species if biodiversity is not considered. Make use of conservation tools. A variety of useful conservation tools is available. The IUCN Red List provides up-to-date information on species\u2019 threat statuses, while the IUCN Species Survival Commission offers guidelines for assessing species\u2019 vulnerability to climate change. The Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT) provides basic risk screening on biodiversity, enabling governments and businesses to mitigate their impacts on species and biodiversity. The US Army, for example, uses IBAT to better understand how potential bases might affect biodiversity.

This is known as Digital Sequence Information (DSI). International agreements are unclear on how to administer DSI and share the benefits arising from it. The benefits from genetic resources are therefore not always shared equitably, even though this is a responsibility of governments under international law. Openly accessible DSI is essential for research including vaccine development and species conservation, and any new rules to govern its use must not curtail access. The post-2020 global biodiversity framework is an opportunity to guarantee equitable sharing of DSI benefits, while ensuring essential research can continue. Download January 2022 What is the issue ? Differences in the way individuals and species look, act and function are the result of genetic diversity passed on by DNA or RNA. Genetic material that contains this information can have a commercial value, so many countries exercise sovereign rights over genetic resources that originate from within their territories. Many countries also require that the benefits of research or commercialisation are shared with the providing country or indigenous peoples and local communities before they grant access to genetic resources. At the international level, agreements to govern access and benefit sharing have been developed; for biodiversity the most prominent is the Nagoya Protocol to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Technological advances in recent years have made it simple and affordable to sequence genomes and store this data digitally. However, the Nagoya Protocol is unclear on how to administer genetic sequence data, known as Digital Sequence Information (DSI). The lack of international agreement on this issue means that benefits resulting from DSI are sometimes not shared equitably. At the same time, DSI is often made freely available to enable \u2018big data\u2019 science. Hundreds of billions of sequences are stored in public databases, which double in size every few years on average. This freely available DSI is used for research that benefits everyone such as vaccine development and species conservation. Clear rules administering the sharing of DSI benefits at the international level are therefore vital to ensure equity, but could risk undermining the use of DSI for essential research if not designed and implemented carefully. Growth of sequence records within GenBank, one of the main public DSI databases. Source: GenBank statistics Why is it important ? Ensuring equitable benefit sharing of genetic resources is a longstanding commitment of the global community, an objective of the CBD and therefore a responsibility of Parties under international law. Beyond fulfilling these legal obligations equitable benefit sharing can maximise the overall benefits for users and providers of genetic resources and the environment; strengthen the legitimacy of the CBD; and foster a sense of justice. Publicly accessible DSI is a tool for scientific research used by the public and private sectors. Much of this research supports sustainable development including advances in medicine, sustainable agriculture, conservation and ecosystem restoration. For example, virologists used SARS-CoV-2 DSI to design diagnostic kits for COVID-19 and then the vaccines now in global use, and conservationists relied on DSI to bring the California condor back from the brink of extinction. In fact, nearly all conservation research uses DSI, so researchers\u2019 access to it is important to deliver global sustainable development goals. All countries use and provide DSI, so any future agreement would affect every national government. DSI was used to guide breeding efforts that restored the California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) to the wild. By comparing DSI between California and Andean condors and with other birds, researchers revealed the species\u2019 population histories. Image: California condor juvenile and mother Photo: jprbelli What can be done? Policymakers should find a balance between \u2018open access\u2019 DSI, which is a scientific resource that can be used to benefit everyone, and the equitable sharing of benefits, which is an important principle of sustainable development. Parties to the CBD should first agree a definition for DSI to help clarify the structure of future arrangements, how these might be implemented and the necessary resources. The post-2020 global biodiversity framework offers governments an opportunity to do so and to consider mechanisms that recognise and reward sovereign contributions of DSI to public databases, while enabling research. Parties can find common ground on three principles: the need for DSI-based research to continue; DSI\u2019s contribution to protecting biodiversity; the need for fair and equitable sharing of benefits from DSI. To address these principles together, more research is needed to understand the trade-offs of various policy options.

Benefit sharing could be monetary, or non-monetary through other benefits such as reduced phosphate pollution and improved water quality. In public health applications, benefit sharing could take the form of vaccine and medicine distribution. Resolving the DSI issue will require compromises from multiple stakeholders.

Governments and environmental organisations need to better understand the links between gender-based violence and the environment, advance greater legal protections and take gender-specific risks into account in their policies and interventions. Download September 2020 What is the issue ? Evidence shows that there are direct links between environmental pressures and gender-based violence, and that the degradation of nature, competition over increasingly scarce resources and environmental crime can all exacerbate violence. Occurring in all societies, gender-based violence is used to keep gender inequalities intact, to the detriment of livelihoods, human rights, conservation and sustainable development. Expressions of gender-based violence affect an estimated one in three women and girls, but are also experienced by people of all sex and gender identities. They can include sexual assault, domestic violence, verbal abuse, harassment, stalking, child marriage, economic deprivation, survival sex (exploitation in exchange for access to subsistence resources) and forced prostitution Infographic by Estudio Relativo for IUCN, data from WHO (2017) and MSF (2005). Photo: IUCN Environmental degradation is a driver of gender-based violence. Resource scarcity, conflicts and displacement caused by environmental degradation deepen existing inequalities. In such cases, gender-based violence is often used as a means of reinforcing privileges and control over resources. Climate change worsens these effects. During prolonged drought, for example, child marriage is used by families as a strategy to cope with scarcity of food and income. In the aftermath of environmental disasters, intimate partner violence rates can rise \u2013 as they did e.g. in Vanuatu following two tropical cyclones (UN Women Fiji, 2014), in Zimbabwe after cyclone Idai (Chatiza, 2019), or in Bangladesh following cyclone Roanu (Rezwana and Pain, 2020). Overcrowded and unsafe conditions in disaster shelters and climate refugee camps can also expose women, girls and gender minorities to violence, while medical and legal services are overwhelmed, making it harder to get help. Environmental crime increases gender-based violence. Weak rule of law enables conditions in which violence flourishes, as documented in numerous case studies of sex trafficking, sexual abuse and child labour in illegal mining, fishing and logging operations around the world. For example, in Peru, illegal mining operations traffic girls as young as 12 years old (GI-TOC, 2016). In illegal fishing operations in South Asia, men and boys are subjected to sexual abuse and slave labour (IOM et al., 2016). In parts of Africa, the illegal logging and charcoal trade leads to extensive human rights abuses, including sexual exploitation (Dranginis, 2016). Environmental activists are increasingly victims of gender-based violence. Well-known movements in Africa, Asia and Latin America illustrate the importance of women\u2019s roles in protecting ecosystems worldwide. But as women\u2019s and girls\u2019 involvement in activism and political demonstrations in defence of the environment increases, so too do incidents of gender-based violence against environmental defenders as a tactic to intimidate and silence them, and this violence affects the ability of women and girls to equally and safely participate in these movements. Infographic by Estudio Relativo for IUCN, data from Osorio (2016). Photo: IUCN Why is it important ? Gender-based violence is a violation of human rights. Gender-based violence harms individuals and imposes direct and indirect costs on families, communities, economies, global public health and development. Individuals can suffer long-term effects as a result of gender-based violence, from the spread of infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS to psychological harm. Gender-based violence also prevents victims and survivors from exercising their economic and political rights and limits their access to education and work opportunities. Social stigma against victims can likewise create barriers to justice, reinforcing a culture of impunity. Gender-based violence is a barrier to conservation and sustainable development goals. Gender-based violence discourages women\u2019s participation in protecting and sustainably managing natural resources. For example, a project in Nepal found that sexual exploitation was used to intimidate women and prevent them from engaging in ecosystem restoration activities (IUCN, 2020).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "af675d2c-fe05-4276-bce2-a3986989a045": {"__data__": {"id_": "af675d2c-fe05-4276-bce2-a3986989a045", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-brief/gender-based-violence-and-environment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Issue Brief"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender-based violence and the environment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-brief/gender-based-violence-and-environment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Issue Brief"}, "hash": "af5f3eee39664946ed1fd3fb30da8df8190bbc6de4ec5762b8efb8911ec140ec"}, "2": {"node_id": "3cfe984e-06dc-462f-83b2-20bc0a3f6e71", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-brief/gender-based-violence-and-environment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Issue Brief"}, "hash": "665c7e4b503ce6e5359f0e05c5298cd442e5afdda88cf9c144f9ea777e9a1121"}}, "hash": "d1d98ce2a6ebca4d046224c2ac2c31bc440eb1855b9a5fc45e53211d3f8f5754", "text": "This is a lost opportunity, as evidence from around the world reaffirms that gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment are key to meeting conservation and Sustainable Development Goals.

Policy makers must close these gaps and ensure that effective gender-responsive environmental laws, policies, strategies and accountability mechanisms are in place; and that gender strategies and laws in turn take environmental factors such as land rights, climate change and control of natural resources into account. Address gender-based violence in environmental work. Environmental organisations have an important role to play in ending gender-based violence. Polices, standards and safeguards should include gender-based violence feedback and grievance mechanisms. Throughout project cycles, gender analyses should be conducted to identify gender-based violence and develop preventative and responsive measures, such as working directly with men to reduce potential tension and violence. Funders should require gender analyses and action that takes gender-based violence into account to ensure that these approaches are widely adopted. Draw from existing expertise. Governments and environmental organisations should partner with humanitarian and health organisations that have knowledge and expertise on gender-based violence to develop environmental policies and projects that help prevent violence and enable women to safely engage in environmental work and activism. Invest in knowledge and solutions. While we know that gender-based violence is exacerbated by environmental degradation and environmental crime, many gaps in our understanding remain. Public and private environment and gender-focused funders should prioritise research that enables evidence-based action, investing in promising practices that can be developed, replicated and scaled up.

Fragmented legal frameworks leave biodiversity in ABNJ vulnerable to growing threats. The degradation of biodiversity in ABNJ affects the ocean\u2019s resilience to climate change and its capacity to provide resources necessary for human survival. Negotiations are underway to create a new international instrument under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which would help strengthen ABNJ governance. A new international instrument can provide a global framework for protecting marine areas and species, assessing impacts of human activities, capacity building and transfer of technologies, and the equitable sharing of benefits from marine genetic resources. Download March 2022 What is the issue? Nearly two-thirds of the world\u2019s ocean is beyond national jurisdiction: where no single state has authority. This area reaches depths of over 10km and represents 95% of the Earth\u2019s total habitat by volume. Areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ) are home to significant biodiversity, including unique species that have evolved to survive extreme heat, cold, salinity, pressure and darkness. The dark blue areas of the map represent areas beyond national jurisdiction. Wikimedia Commons Just over 20% of the seafloor has been mapped to a 100m or higher resolution, and there is evidence that ecosystems and species in ABNJ have become seriously degraded because of human activities. The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) provides the overarching international legal framework for the ocean. It creates obligations to protect and preserve the marine environment and to conserve marine resources, but it does not specify mechanisms or processes for conserving marine biodiversity in ABNJ. Other legal instruments may address parts of the problem, such as unsustainable fishing or pollution from ships, or specific geographical areas, such as the Antarctic. However, a sectoral approach cannot address multiple pressures on the ocean and the different ways they interact. Regional approaches will also be insufficient given the connectivity of marine ecosystems, including long migratory pathways for species such as sharks, sea turtles, whales and salmon, as well as large-scale ocean currents. Through the UN, states have an opportunity to establish a comprehensive global framework for the conservation and sustainable use of ABNJ to prevent further degradation from human activities. Maritime zones and rights under UNCLOS Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment (PAME) and the Arctic Council Why is it important? Failure to take swift and effective action to address threats to marine life and biodiversity in ABNJ could compromise the ocean\u2019s resilience to climate change and its capacity to provide resources and services necessary for human survival. Ecosystems and species in ABNJ are affected by the cumulative effects of climate change (ocean warming, acidification, deoxygenation), pollution, fishing, shipping and other sectors. Two-thirds of fish stocks in ABNJ are being fished beyond sustainable limits. Overfishing disrupts marine communities and creates an imbalance between species, with commercially important fishes unable to replenish their stocks. Bycatch and underregulated fishing further threaten marine species and the stability of ecosystems. Biodiversity in ABNJ is also impacted by noise and other pollution from ships. Noise can disrupt animals\u2019 communication and displace them from breeding or feeding grounds. Marine debris entangles marine animals, causing severe injuries and death. Emerging activities such as deep-sea mining can destroy habitats, degrade water quality, contaminate seafood and wipe out species. Existing stressors are made worse by climate change; the ocean is disproportionately affected by increasing amounts of carbon dioxide, limiting its ability to regulate the climate and sustain marine life. Increasing temperatures for instance are causing species to move in search of more favourable environmental conditions. Billions of people depend on the ocean for food and income; marine fisheries directly or indirectly employ over 200 million people. This vast pool of marine genetic resources provides medicines and other products to the medical and pharmaceutical sectors. Phytoplankton, kelp and algal plankton produce more than half of the oxygen we breathe. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration What can be done? A new agreement under UNCLOS can provide the tools and capacity needed to conserve marine biodiversity in ABNJ by providing for: A network of marine protected areas (MPAs) The agreement could provide a means of creating a global network of marine protected areas (areas set aside for long-term conservation) and other types of area-based management tools (ABMTs) to support ecological connectivity and climate change resilience, and help preserve species and ecosystems.

Fair and equitable sharing of benefits from marine genetic resources Benefit sharing may include monetary and non-monetary benefits.

Facilitation of developing countries\u2019 involvement in marine genetic research can enhance results and lead to technical advances that benefit all. Standards for environmental impact assessments The agreement should improve consistency, legal certainty and the implementation of measures to protect the marine environment by: setting minimum global standards for screening, scoping, conducting and monitoring Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) and Strategic Environment Assessments; developing best practice guidelines for assessments and how to prohibit or manage activities that risk harm to ABNJ. Capacity building and technology transfer Effective conservation of the world\u2019s biodiversity requires significant administrative, legal, scientific, technical and technological capacity. The agreement can create mechanisms and requirements for capacity building and technology transfer that will enable its implementation and protect biodiversity in ABNJ. Implementation of the agreement will require appropriate institutional arrangements. A well-resourced clearing house mechanism could support coordination of and information exchange for sharing the benefits of marine resources, as well as EIA and MPA processes. Additionally, a scientific and technical body could independently advise and evaluate EIA and MPA processes. A global funding mechanism should also support the implementation of the agreement, including capacity building programmes.

These Marine Heat Waves (MHWs) threaten marine biodiversity and ecosystems, make extreme weather more likely, and negatively impact the fisheries, aquaculture and tourism industries. Governments must invest in nature-based solutions and ambitiously reduce fossil-fuel-based emissions to limit the impacts of the climate crisis. More research, better prediction and warning systems, and regional measures to build ocean resilience can help protect communities and ecosystems from MHWs. Download October 2021 What is the issue? The ocean\u2019s average temperature has increased by 1.5\u00b0C in the last century, and for the past 10 years average annual ocean temperatures have been the highest ever recorded. In addition to this long-term, persistent warming, discrete periods of extreme regional ocean warming called marine heatwaves (MHWs) are becoming more frequent. MHWs have increased by 50% over the past decade and now last longer and are more severe. MHWs can last for weeks or even years. They can affect small areas of coastline or span multiple oceans. MHWs have been recorded in surface and deep waters, across all latitudes, and in all types of marine ecosystems. Projections suggest that by 2100 MHWs will occur as many as 50 times as often as in pre-industrial times, and increase 20-50 times in frequency and 10 times in intensity. While these changes impact the entire ocean, the Arctic and tropical regions are expected to be most affected. Anthropogenically-driven climate change is causing ocean warming globally, and regionally MHWs are driven by unusual weather patterns and disruptions in ocean currents and mixing. Increasing average water temperatures reduce marine ecosystems\u2019 tolerance to local temperature rises. As MHWs become more frequent and extreme they risk pushing ecosystems beyond their threshold of recovery; with lasting consequences for marine biodiversity, and many millions of people whose livelihoods depend upon it. Sea surface temperature anomalies measured in September 2020. Blue shows where sea surface temperature is cooler than its long-term average (1981 to 2010). NOAA Why is it important? Higher water temperatures associated with MHWs can cause extreme weather events such as tropical storms and hurricanes, and disrupt the water cycle; making floods, droughts and wildfires on land more likely. MHWs have other profound socio-economic impacts for coastal communities. Aquaculture, for instance, requires water temperatures to remain suitable for farmed species, while fisheries rely on species that often relocate in response to changing environmental conditions. MHWs have been shown to kill or reduce the productivity of economically important species including lobster and snow crab in the northwest Atlantic and scallops off Western Australia. MHWs can also harm regional tourism. MHWs have repercussions throughout marine ecosystems. MHWs have been associated with the mass mortality of marine invertebrates, and may force species to change behaviour in a way that puts wildlife at increased risk of harm. MHWs have been linked to whale entanglements in fishing gear, for example. Changing conditions can also help invasive alien species to spread, which can be devastating for marine food webs. The impacts of MHWs IUCN Among the species most sensitive to MHWs are those that form the basis of the most biodiverse marine ecosystems: kelp forests, seagrass meadows, and coral reefs. The severe event affecting the west coast of Australia in 2011, for instance, wiped out entire ecosystems causing some species to disappear for hundreds of kilometres. MHWs are not the only threat to marine ecosystems; often they occur alongside other stressors such as ocean acidification, deoxygenation, and overfishing. In such cases, MHWs not only further damage habitats, but also increase the risk of deoxygenation and acidification. What can be done? Given the severe and long-lasting impacts of MHWs on marine life and human society, it is necessary to implement measures to slow ocean warming and counteract the impacts of MHWs by building ocean resilience. Governments must invest in nature-based solutions alongside ambitiously reducing fossil fuel-based emissions to achieve the goals agreed to under the Paris Agreement. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions should be applied throughout project design and implementation. Funding agencies and governments must build research capacity to monitor MHWs, understand their impacts, and predict future heatwave events. Research should aim to establish a temperature baseline which considers species\u2019 thermal limits, and combine physical and biological data to better predict future conditions and highlight biodiversity most at risk. Developing networks, such as the Marine Heatwave International Group, will allow experts to implement research programmes globally.

An ambitious new biodiversity framework is needed to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and the vision of living in harmony with nature by 2050. The framework must seek to halt and reverse biodiversity loss to achieve a nature-positive world by 2030, which requires investment of at least USD 200 billion per year. Targets in the framework should be measurable, underpinned by science, and have explicit outcomes. Download November 2022 What is the issue? In December 2022, Parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) will meet (COP15) to determine the post-2020 global biodiversity framework (the framework). IUCN Members see the framework as a global strategy for jointly safeguarding nature and securing our common future. Despite an increase in policies and actions to support biodiversity, indicators show that the drivers of biodiversity loss have worsened and biodiversity further declined between 2011 and 2020. At the global level none of the 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets agreed by Parties to the CBD in 2010 have been fully achieved. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species\u2122 Analysis suggests there have been gaps in the ambition and commitment of countries to address nature loss over the past decade; national plans have generally been poorly aligned to the Aichi Targets and insufficient in scope to meet them. Estimates based on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species\u2122 tell us that one million species are currently threatened with extinction, but modelling demonstrates it is not too late to reverse these trends. Why is this important? The degradation of ecosystems and decline of biodiversity exacerbate climate change and threaten the natural processes which protect human health and provide clean air, water and food. Healthy ecosystems support 55% of global GDP, and the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity underpins sustainable development. An ambitious new framework is therefore needed to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and the vision of living in harmony with nature by 2050. The framework and the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration are opportunities to reverse nature loss at scale. To do so is critical to solving the climate crisis. Healthy ecosystems protect communities from climate change impacts like extreme weather, and Nature-based Solutions could provide up to 37% of our climate change mitigation needs as per the Paris Agreement. What can be done? Parties to the CBD must agree to halt and reverse biodiversity loss to achieve a nature-positive world by 2030 for the benefit of the planet and people. Transformational change to humanity\u2019s current way of living is vital, requiring decisive local and global action from all countries and all sectors of society. IUCN is helping create the tools to guide, monitor and measure such action. Global targets must be measurable, underpinned by science, and have explicit outcomes. These should include action to tackle threats to biodiversity (specifically genes, species and ecosystems), and to protect and restore the benefits nature provides to people. The Global Species Action Plan highlights the importance of species conservation and supports implementation of the framework by setting out the actions required to achieve the species outcomes in the framework\u2019s mission, goals, and targets. Protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures should be expanded to cover at least 30% of the planet by 2030, while recognising the rights and roles of Indigenous peoples and local communities (\u201c30 x 30\u201d). The 30% must incorporate all areas of particular importance for biodiversity, including key biodiversity areas (KBAs), with steps taken to ensure habitat connectivity. As the global standard for effective area-based conservation, the IUCN Green List can both support the achievement of \u201c30 x 30\u201d and act as a simple indicator of progress. Given the links between the climate and nature crises, Parties should view targets within the framework as aligned to existing climate commitments. Two-thirds of governments supporting the Paris Agreement include Nature-based Solutions in their national climate plans, for example. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions will help Parties ensure such projects are as effective as possible. Monitoring the framework\u2019s implementation is essential and IUCN supports the programme of monitoring through indicators proposed in the draft framework. Parties should particularly consider the IUCN Red List of Threatened Speciesas the world\u2019s most comprehensive information source on global extinction risk. The framework must engage countries, cities, sub-national governments, Indigenous peoples and local communities, industry, women, youth, farmers, civil society and the private sector.

The Species Threat Abatement and Restoration (STAR) metric, co-created by IUCN, can be used to quantify the impact of specific actions in specific places towards halting global species extinctions. Species Threat Abatement and Restoration (STAR) metric IUCN Governments must guarantee the additional investment in nature every year for the framework to succeed. Financial resources from all sources must be increased to at least USD 200 billion per year. New and additional financing is urgently needed; private, public and philanthropic finance should be mobilised. As governments help economies recover from the COVID-19 crisis, they must ensure that stimulus investments do no additional harm to nature, and should direct at least 10% of the overall recovery investment to protecting and restoring nature. Before the framework\u2019s adoption and during its implementation, the conservation community should raise the awareness of all governments and all stakeholders on the urgency to act. Active implementation is the key to halt further biodiversity loss and achieve recovery and the vision of living in harmony with nature by 2050.

Misunderstanding of the rewilding concept has led to applications that harm communities and biodiversity, and threaten to undermine an approach with enormous conservation potential. Well-applied rewilding can restore ecosystems at a landscape scale, help mitigate climate change, and provide socio-economic opportunities for communities. Evidence-based rewilding principles will guide practitioners to rewild safely, help assess the effectiveness of projects, and incorporate rewilding into global conservation targets. Download June 2021 What is the issue ? Rewilding aims to restore healthy ecosystems by creating wild, biodiverse spaces. It rebuilds ecosystems that have previously been modified by human disturbance, using the plant and animal life that would have been present had the disturbance never occurred. In doing so rewilding restores the natural processes that provide humanity with clean air, water, food, shelter and medicine. This idea of reversing biodiversity loss and creating wild landscapes by allowing nature to reclaim areas no longer under human management has gained much attention as an optimistic approach to conservation. Well-intentioned governments, NGOs, communities and individuals are more frequently adopting \u2018rewilding\u2019 strategies but the principles are inconsistently defined, and often misrepresented and misapplied. Attention can focus on the reintroduction of large predators like grey wolves (Canis lupus), but rewilding principles apply more broadly \u00a9 christels, pixabay Misuse of the increasingly popular rewilding concept risks alienating communities, harming existing biodiversity and undermining confidence in a technique with enormous conservation potential. Rewilding principles agreed between over 150 rewilding experts guide practitioners to rewild safely, and suggest mechanisms for policymakers and funding agencies to assess the effectiveness of projects and so prioritise support. Why is it important ? Human activity is degrading ecosystems and driving biodiversity loss faster than ever before. The need to reverse these trends is formalised in Sustainable Development Goals 14 and 15. The UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration and the post-2020 global biodiversity framework provide opportunities to rebuild the biodiverse ecosystems which sustain all life on Earth. Rewilding has the potential to do so at a landscape scale, and brings other important benefits for society. Rewilded ecosystems can help mitigate climate change by increasing carbon removal from the atmosphere and protect against climate change impacts by reducing soil erosion and flood risk, for example. Rewilded ecosystems can also create socio-economic opportunities for local communities, reduce the effects of and costs associated with environmental hazards (such as flooding), and improve human health and wellbeing by improving access to nature. A project in Chacabuco Valley in northern Chile is one example of successfully applied rewilding. Following a land purchase in 2004, Rewilding Patagonia removed livestock and farming infrastructure from 890 km2. Native vegetation and wildlife have since recreated Patagonian steppe and temperate beech forest systems which function without human intervention. The project also supports ranchers around the rewilded landscapes to implement sustainable land management practices. Poorly managed rewilding, however, carries risks for biodiversity and local people. A 2019 study evaluates the Oostvaardersplassen (OVP) project in the Netherlands which began in 1983 with the introduction of Heck cattle, Konik horses and red deer to reclaimed land. Their numbers were not managed and the animals could not move to new habitats, so populations were largely regulated by food availability. Native vegetation was degraded by overgrazing, and up to 30% of the animals died over winter periods when food was scarce. In 2018 the management plan for OVP was revised, with reduced herbivore numbers. Rewilding projects should identify core rewilded areas and ways to connect them. \u00a9 Soul\u00e9 and Noss, 1998 Without proper consultation rewilding may not benefit local communities, especially those with histories of traditional land management such as hunting, farming, forestry and fisheries. Inappropriate plans to reinstate natural habitats and reintroduce animals that may have originally been extirpated because of conflicts with human interests are often controversial. Projects risk alienating local people unless stakeholders are involved in planning that identifies and mitigates such concerns. In several cases, a lack of consultation has led to local anti-rewilding campaigns causing projects to be abandoned. What can be done?

Rewilding plans should identify core rewilded areas, ways to connect them, and ensure outcomes are to the mutual benefit of people and nature. 3. Rewilding requires local engagement and community support. 4. Rewilding focuses on the recovery of ecological processes, interactions and conditions based on similar healthy ecosystems. 5. Rewilding recognises that ecosystems are dynamic and constantly changing. 6. Rewilding should anticipate the effects of climate change and act as a tool to mitigate its impacts. 7. Rewilding is informed by science and considers local knowledge. 8. Rewilding recognises the intrinsic value of all species. 9. Rewilding is adaptive and dependent on monitoring and feedback. 10. Rewilding is a paradigm shift in the coexistence of humans and nature. These ten principles provide a reference point for rewilding, and support the incorporation of the technique into global conservation targets. Governments and civil society should consider these principles and follow IUCN's Guidelines for Reintroductions and Other Conservation Translocations throughout rewilding projects. This is one way to ensure that rewilding does not negatively impact the lives and livelihoods of local people, or harm the environment. While the overall aim is a self-sustaining ecosystem, the rewilding process can involve significant activity and investment. Governments, financial institutions, private funders, and businesses should recognise the potential of evidence-based rewilding. With cross-societal support, this approach to rewilding can offer an effective nature-based solution to help achieve sustainable development. In addition to the ten principles outlined above, actors and investors can apply the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions during project design and implementation.

Nature and biodiversity are mostly neglected in existing stimulus packages. Globally, economic stimulus funding that is harming nature exceeds that benefiting it. Unless stimulus is redirected to nature, recovery investments risk exacerbating the biodiversity and climate crises and ultimately damaging economies. To prevent this, governments should ensure that economic investment in response to COVID-19 does no additional harm to nature, and direct at least 10% of the overall recovery investment to protecting and restoring nature. Download Updated April 2021 What is the issue ? The COVID-19 pandemic caused the global economy to shrink by an estimated 3.5% in 2020. 8.8% of global working hours were lost, equivalent to 255 million full-time jobs, and severe long-term economic consequences are predicted. Governments are allocating funds to recover their economies from the pandemic. Global fiscal support to stimulate and recover economies has reached USD 16.7 trillion (April 2021). Fiscal policy actions have concentrated in advanced economies but are constrained by financing in many developing countries. Nature has been largely neglected in existing stimulus packages, even though nature supports the majority of global GDP and the processes that provide humanity with clean air, food, and water. So far, only USD 56 billion of spending is directed towards natural capital measures (UNEP). Moreover, stimulus with harmful effects on the environment exceeds that with beneficial effects on nature. Unless much more stimulus is redirected to initiatives that protect and restore nature, recovery investments risk exacerbating the biodiversity and climate crises and so ultimately undermining economies in the future. Over half (55%) of global GDP depends on healthy ecosystems but unsustainable economic activity is driving nature loss faster than ever before. This degradation of nature puts economies at risk. Changes in crop supplies caused by the decline in pollinating insects alone, for instance, could result in an annual net loss of USD 191 billion globally. Why is it important ? Nature is a source of economic prosperity for many countries, especially those that rely heavily upon it for resources and production. Investment in nature can create jobs, aid economic recovery, bring economic benefits for society, and support nature-based solutions to global goals. Nature, for example, increases the resilience of countries to climate change, helps reduce the risk of disasters, protects human health, and improves water and food security. El Salvador: comparison of job creation per USD 1 million injected into various industries (Source: IUCN) IUCN Investment in nature provides effective policy options to create jobs and support socio-economic development. For example, IUCN found that forest landscape restoration in El Salvador created approximately 50 jobs per USD 1 million invested in ecosystem restoration. This is more jobs than were created by a similar investment in the manufacturing sector amongst others, and these jobs were concentrated in rural and low-income areas. Unlike many other sectors, the benefits of these jobs can support those who the pandemic has hit hardest. For example, the jobs created from Rwanda\u2019s efforts to restore forests under the Bonn Challenge accrued roughly equally between women and men, with women gaining 49% of the short-term jobs and 46% of the long-term jobs. This is important because worldwide women are over-represented in informal and vulnerable employment that has been particularly impacted by the pandemic. Photo: Community restoration projects support the Rwanda government's pledge to restore two million hectares as part of the Bonn Challenge. \u00a9 IUCN IUCN In addition to creating more than 60,000 jobs planting trees to support unemployed workers due to the pandemic, Pakistan has created about 5,000 jobs specifically for young people through projects to expand protected area coverage and list national parks on the IUCN Green List of Protected and Conserved Areas. To mitigate the expansion of the Sahara Desert, the Great Green Wall Initiative aims to provide food security for 20 million people, create 350,000 jobs and sequester 250 million tonnes of carbon by 2030. The Initiative, a partnership of 21 African countries and international organisations, restored approximately 18 million hectares of land, created over 350,000 jobs, and generated around USD 90 million between 2007 and 2018. What can be done? Governments should ensure that investment to aid economic recovery does no additional harm to nature and livelihoods. Furthermore at least 10% of the total global recovery investment should be directed to initiatives that protect and restore nature.

The economic impact of the pandemic varies considerably around the world. Fiscal distress due to debt has increased, often affecting countries with a high number of threatened species. Programmes of debt relief and restructure offer another opportunity to invest in nature conservation. Cross-referencing data from the IUCN Red List of Threatened SpeciesTMwith measures of debt distress and potential for nature-based solutions for climate change shows countries in urgent need of assistance to overcome the triple crises of economy, nature, and climate.

Businesses, governments and civil society around the world lack the ability to measure their potential positive impacts on biodiversity in comparable and consistent ways. To deliver the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, which will guide conservation action over the next decade and beyond, we need to be able to quantify contributions to conserving biodiversity around the world. The new Species Threat Abatement and Restoration (STAR) metric estimates the potential contributions of specific actions in specific places towards international biodiversity targets. Download The STAR metric can help all actors \u2013 companies, the finance industry, governments and civil society \u2013 better plan projects that would bring benefits for threatened species, assess biodiversity risk, and align contributions to achieve global targets. April 2021 What is the issue ? Global biodiversity is declining at a faster rate than at any other time in human history. This is driven by pressures from human actions, including commercial activities. For example, species are being lost through the conversion of natural habitat to agriculture, forestry and urban expansion, and through hunting, fishing or collection for local consumption or international trade. Consequently, reversing species loss requires action from a range of actors \u2013 national and subnational governments, business, industry, cities, civil society, the finance industry and investors. However, we lack the ability to measure contributions made by these actors to biodiversity conservation and restoration, and to add up the potential impact from different sectors, and from around the world. This leaves efforts to tackle biodiversity loss uncoordinated, and hampers the implementation of international goals aimed at conserving biodiversity. Why is it important ? The \u2018transformational change\u2019 required to bend the curve of biodiversity loss will only be realised if everyone can identify and deliver their potential contributions towards global biodiversity targets. As with climate change mitigation, it is essential to quantify contributions by specific actors to achieve global impact. The post-2020 global biodiversity framework will guide global conservation action over the next decade, aligned in turn to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. To deliver the post-2020 framework, we need to be able to quantify and add up potential contributions to biodiversity conservation from around the world. The ability to quantify contributions will make it easier to reward positive action, as well as highlighting where change is needed to mitigate negative impact. Enabling effective conservation action would in turn improve human well-being, prosperity and health, which are inextricably linked to the health of the natural world. The Species Threat Abatement and Restoration (STAR) metric allows business, governments and civil society to quantify their potential contributions to stemming global species loss. IUCN What can be done? The Species Threat Abatement and Restoration (STAR) metric allows business, governments and civil society to quantify their potential contributions to stemming global species loss, and can be used to calculate national, regional, sector-based, or institution-specific targets. The STAR metric (Mair et al. 2021) was developed based on the IUCN Red List of Threatened SpeciesTM, in a collaboration between 55 organisations. The IUCN Red List is the most comprehensive global assessment of the status of biodiversity. Because biodiversity is distributed unequally around the world, STAR assesses the potential of specific actions at specific locations to contribute to international conservation targets. STAR estimates the contribution of two kinds of action to reduce species extinction risk \u2013 threat abatement and habitat restoration. This makes it possible to compare specific threat abatement and habitat restoration actions in different places toward reducing global species extinction risk, which will help companies, countries and others plan their conservation efforts. It also permits actors to add up their total contributions. Setting science-based targets STAR scores for a particular location (which can be of any size e.g. a site, landscape, country) show the potential contribution of conservation or restoration actions in that location to reducing the extinction risk for all species globally. STAR can therefore be used to establish science-based targets that reflect contributions from individual actors towards goals under the post-2020 global biodiversity framework. The STAR metric can be used by individual institutions. For instance, an extractives company can use STAR to measure the impact of restoring habitat for threatened species across a network of mines. The Species Threat Abatement and Restoration (STAR) metric allows business, governments and civil society to quantify their potential contributions to stemming global species loss.

At a country scale, STAR scores show how governments can plan their policy to deliver on post-2020 global biodiversity framework commitments, for example by increasing protected areas, incentivising sustainable agriculture or developing reporting and disclosure requirements. Use of STAR can also help governments to fit corporate commitments into their national targets. Currently STAR uses extinction risk and threat information on birds, amphibians and mammals. This will soon be augmented by marine and freshwater species as well as plants and reptiles. In due course, the STAR methodology will be extended to apply to genetic diversity and to ecosystems, the latter likely drawing from the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems Categories and Criteria. The proposed post-2020 global biodiversity framework includes a target for safeguarding sites of particular importance to biodiversity through protected areas or other area-based conservation measures. Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) correspond to such sites, and so far cover 8.8% of land surface but capture 47% of the global STAR threat-abatement score for vertebrate species. Protecting KBAs account for large proportions of some national STAR threat-abatement scores: >70% in Mexico and Venezuela, and >50% in Madagascar, Ecuador, the Philippines and Tanzania. This indicates the particularly strong contribution that tackling biodiversity threats in KBAs would have to conserving global biodiversity.

Until now, there has been no agreed framework or standard as to what constitutes an effective NbS. Misunderstanding and misuse of NbS have led to applications that cause harm to biodiversity and communities and threaten to erode stakeholders\u2019 trust in the approach. The IUCN Global Standard for NbS is a tool to help governments, communities, business and NGOs implement strong, effective NbS projects that are ambitious in scale and sustainable, prevent misuse and safeguard people and planet. Download July 2020 What is the issue? Nature-based Solutions are actions addressing key societal challenges through the protection, sustainable management and restoration of both natural and modified ecosystems, benefiting both biodiversity and human well-being. NbS have significant, but currently underutilised potential to help address global challenges such as climate change, human health, food and water security, natural disasters and biodiversity loss. An IUCN report found that NbS projects were not large enough in scale, that the NbS approach was insufficiently integrated into policy, and that more collaborative NbS projects were needed for increased efficiency (Cohen-Shacham, 2019). If delivered appropriately, NbS can significantly contribute to addressing multiple societal challenges. For example, NbS have the potential to supply up to 37% of our climate change mitigation needs (Griscom et al., 2017). They can also reduce the negative effects of the climate crisis on people and nature by decreasing the impact of disasters and providing resilience to communities. Mangroves alone, if healthy and sustainably managed, could reduce annual flooding for more than 18 million people globally (Beck et al., 2018), averting flood damage totalling up to US$ 57 billion in China, India, Mexico, US and Viet Nam each year (Reguero et al., 2018). NbS can also help address biodiversity loss, for example through forest landscape restoration. Governments, communities, business and NGOs are increasingly embracing the NbS approach. For instance, two-thirds of the governments supporting the Paris Agreement included NbS actions in their national climate plans. However, until now, there has been a lack of clear parameters defining NbS and a common framework. Such a framework is essential in order to increase the scale and impact of the NbS approach, to prevent unanticipated negative outcomes or misuse, and help funding agencies, policy makers and other stakeholders assess the effectiveness of interventions. Why is it important? Increased demand and use of NbS has led to cases of misuse of the NbS concept, where even good intentions can result in harm to nature and people. In the worst-case scenarios, misuse runs the risk of damaging biodiversity, eroding the nature that we depend upon for services such as clean water and food. For example, a tree-planting climate mitigation project using just one non-native species could create poor soils, ultimately degrading biodiversity and making it more costly or impossible to sustain the forest in the future. Similarly, restoring a mangrove forest to reduce the risk of storm damage could be doomed from the start if upstream and downstream processes are not considered. Lack of consideration of water use can lead to restored ecosystems using too much water, creating pressure on local communities. Failure to take into account social and economic factors has meant that even seemingly successful pilot applications of NbS have ultimately not been sustainable outside of the timeframe of a project. Figure 1: NbS simultaneously support human well-being needs and biodiversity benefits through actions of protection, restoration and sustainable management. The detinition serves as a basis tor issue-specific and intrastructure-specific approaches to be leveraged as solutions. If NbS are only implemented as uncoordinated small-scale pilots and applications, their substantial potential to address societal challenges will not be fulfilled. Worse, weak or mislabelled NbS projects can water down the case for the NbS approach, de-incentivising its use, eroding donor confidence and misdirecting efforts. Funders, investors and decision makers need to be confident that the NbS initiatives they support are effective and scalable and consider potential externalities.

The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions, launched in July 2020, addresses this need. It consists of eight criteria and their associated indicators, which address the pillars of sustainable development (biodiversity, economy and society) and resilient project management. These criteria directly respond to the existing gaps found in the 2019 IUCN report: scale, policy and complementarity to other interventions. The governance structure of the IUCN Global Standard will be responsible for revising the criteria every four years, enabling improvement and incentivising engagement with the NbS approach across sectors. Implementers of NbS can use the Global Standard, its user guide and self-assessment tool to consistently design effective NbS projects that are ambitious in scale and sustainability, creating a shared language for stakeholders and facilitating innovative partnerships. Donors and financers can invest in NbS with the Global Standard as a benchmark minimising risks and providing increased security. All user groups across the public and private sectors can also further engage with the governance structure of the Global Standard, which connects stakeholders worldwide and ensures via feedback that the Global Standard is used for its full potential to mainstream NbS. With involvement across sectors, the Standard will enable Nature-based Solutions to be implemented worldwide, contributing their full potential to addressing societal challenges.

Drylands are particularly affected by climate change through changing rainfall patterns and land degradation, which reduces the ability of species and people to cope with dryland conditions. Climate change will likely aggravate poverty, food and water insecurity in drylands. Alongside ambitious emission cuts, countries can restore dryland ecosystems and sustainably manage land to address climate change in drylands. Download September 2019 What is the issue? Drylands are ecosystems, such as rangelands, grasslands and woodlands, which occupy over 40% of the terrestrial surface, and are characterised by high temporal and spatial rainfall variability. Drylands are dominated by grasslands, which cover more than one fifth of the planet\u2019s terrestrial surface. Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005) People and species living in drylands have adapted over millennia to cope with extreme climatic variability. Plants and animals such as the African elephant and the Bactrian camel in Central Asia have developed unique physiological and behavioural adaptations. Human populations have similarly adapted management and behavioural strategies that enable them to use highly variable resources. However, climate change is presenting an unprecedented threat to drylands with far reaching environmental, social and economic consequences. Climate scientists predict that global drylands will expand by up to 10% under a high greenhouse gas emission scenario by the end of the21st century, with as much as 80% of this expansion occurring in developing countries. The dramatic shifts in rainfall patterns caused by climate change are expected to affect both the quantity and distribution of water. Loss of vegetation could lead to the hardening of the soil surface, increased water runoff and consequently reduced ground water recharge. The frequency and intensity of droughts are also expected to increase with climate change. This is of particular concern in drylands, where species and communities already have to cope with dramatic climatic variations. Climate change is likely to accelerate land degradation, referred to in drylands as desertification. Land degradation is defined as a loss of the ecological and economic productivity of land. About 20-35% of drylands already suffer some form of land degradation, and this is expected to expand significantly under different emission scenarios. Soil erosion is one of the more significant causes of land degradation in drylands, resulting in the loss of soil organic carbon present in roots and woody components of the soil, and the subsequent loss of land productivity. Converting dryland areas to other uses, especially to cropland, can also cause land degradation. This can result in the loss of up to 60% of soil organic carbon below ground, and up to 95% of above-ground carbon. These losses contribute directly to greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, and reduce the capacity of drylands to sequester carbon. Due to the biophysical, socioeconomic and cultural uniqueness of species and people living in drylands, they remain poorly understood and continue to be dominated by inappropriate investments and land management practices that contribute to further degradation. This increases the vulnerability of drylands to environmental shocks including climate change. Why is it important? Drylands are home to more than two billion people, and are the source of a large proportion of the food and fibre used around the world. Grasslands alone produce 27% and 23% of the world\u2019s milk and meat respectively, and support more than one billion livelihoods. The complex changes in land productivity and disruption of dryland ecosystems due to climate change will affect more than 44% of the world\u2019s food system, contributing to food insecurity and persistent poverty. Unreliable water resources will also have a negative impact on land productivity and consequently on livelihoods. Dryland soils store at least one third of the world\u2019s soil organic carbon, which is important in enhancing soil structure and function, and determining soil productivity. Grasslands hold more than 10% of the terrestrial carbon and can store up to 70 tonnes/ha of soil carbon. Grasslands, especially those dominated by perennials, can withstand conditions of high temperature and high carbon dioxide (CO\u00ad2) concentrations more than most other plants. These qualities mean that grasslands provide opportunities for adaptation and can continue to produce forage for grazing livestock as atmospheric CO\u00ad2 concentrations and temperatures increase due to climate change. What can be done ? Conserving and restoring drylands presents an enormous opportunity to address climate change in this unique environment. Investing in dryland restoration is a cost-effective approach to climate change mitigation. Maintaining soil health, and the organic carbon in the soil, can be achieved by increasing vegetative plant cover.

The key to climate change adaptation in drylands lies in recognising and respecting the role of traditional governance structures and practices in building resilience to extreme events. These adaptation strategies include planting drought-tolerant crops, water-efficient cropping practices, herd diversification practices that keep mixed herds of cattle, camel, sheep or goat, and maintaining livestock mobility across communal lands and borders. Policy processes governing dryland development should therefore strongly engage with communities within their existing local governance framework. WWF, 2016 Mobility is a complex but key adaptation strategy to climate change in drylands. It hinges on the opportunistic exploitation of sporadic grazing and water resources. Mobility is rooted in a larger system of governance, rights and responsibilities that allow communities to manage and share resources through long-term traditional tenure agreements. It allows humans and livestock to use the vast natural resources in a landscape without overexploiting specific sites. These traditional structures of governance have changed over time, disrupting the access and use of grazing and pastureland. Dryland development policies should recognise and enable pastoral mobility as a strategy for climate change adaptation and sustainable land management.

At least 14 million tons of plastic end up in the ocean every year, and plastic makes up 80% of all marine debris found from surface waters to deep-sea sediments. Marine species ingest or are entangled by plastic debris, which causes severe injuries and death. Plastic pollution threatens food safety and quality, human health, coastal tourism, and contributes to climate change. There is an urgent need to explore new and existing legally binding agreements to address marine plastic pollution. Download November 2021 What is the issue ? Plastic is a synthetic organic polymer made from petroleum with properties ideally suited for a wide variety of applications including: packaging, building and construction, household and sports equipment, vehicles, electronics and agriculture. Over 400 million tons of plastic are produced every year, half of which is used to create single-use items such as shopping bags, cups and straws. If discarded improperly, plastic waste can harm the environment and biodiversity. At least 14 million tons of plastic end up in the ocean every year. Plastic debris is currently the most abundant type of litter in the ocean, making up 80% of all marine debris found from surface waters to deep-sea sediments. Plastic is found on the shorelines of every continent, with more plastic waste found near popular tourist destinations and densely populated areas. The main sources of plastic debris found in the ocean are land-based, coming from urban and stormwater runoff, sewer overflows, littering, inadequate waste disposal and management, industrial activities, tyre abrasion, construction and illegal dumping. Ocean-based plastic pollution originates primarily from the fishing industry, nautical activities and aquaculture. Under the influence of solar UV radiation, wind, currents and other natural factors, plastic breaks down into small particles called microplastics (particles smaller than 5 mm) or nanoplastics (particles smaller than 100 nm). The small size makes them easy for marine life to ingest accidentally. Many countries lack the infrastructure to prevent plastic pollution such as: sanitary landfills; incineration facilities; recycling capacity and circular economy infrastructure; proper management and disposal of waste systems. This leads to \u2018plastic leakage\u2019 into rivers and the ocean. The legal and illegal global trade of plastic waste may also damage ecosystems, where waste management systems are not sufficient to contain plastic waste. Plastic pollution is found in all areas of the ocean and in marine organisms. \u00a9 IUCN Why is it important ? Plastic pollution is a widespread problem affecting the marine environment. It threatens ocean health, the health of marine species, food safety and quality, human health, coastal tourism, and contributes to climate change. Impacts on marine ecosystems The most visible impacts of plastic debris are the ingestion, suffocation and entanglement of hundreds of marine species. Marine wildlife such as seabirds, whales, fish and turtles mistake plastic waste for prey; most then die of starvation as their stomachs become filled with plastic. They also suffer from lacerations, infections, reduced ability to swim, and internal injuries. Floating plastics also help transport invasive marine species, thereby threatening marine biodiversity and the food web. Impacts on food and human health Microplastics have been found in tap water, beer, salt and are present in all samples collected in the world\u2019s oceans, including the Arctic. Several chemicals used in the production of plastic materials are known to be carcinogenic and to interfere with the body\u2019s endocrine system, causing developmental, reproductive, neurological, and immune disorders in both humans and wildlife. Recently, microplastics were found in human placentas but more research is needed to determine if this is a widespread problem. Toxic contaminants also accumulate on the surface of plastic as a result of prolonged exposure to seawater. When marine organisms ingest plastic debris, these contaminants enter their digestive systems, and over time accumulate in the food web. The transfer of contaminants between marine species and humans through consumption of seafood has been identified as a health hazard, and research is ongoing. Impacts on tourism Plastic waste damages the aesthetic value of tourist destinations, leading to decreased income from tourism. It also generates major economic costs related to the cleaning and maintenance of the sites. The build-up of plastic litter on beaches can have a negative impact on a country\u2019s economy, wildlife, and the physical and psychological wellbeing of people. Impacts on climate change Plastic production contributes to climate change. If plastic waste is incinerated, it releases carbon dioxide and methane (from landfills) into the atmosphere, thereby increasing emissions.

Efforts should be made to adhere to and strengthen existing international legislative frameworks that address marine plastic pollution. The most important are the 1972 Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping Wastes and Other Matter (the London Convention), the 1996 Protocol to the London Convention (the London Protocol) and the 1978 Protocol to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL). Regional and national governments should also explore national legislative frameworks on Extended Producer Responsibility. These are emerging as innovative, low-cost solutions, as are policies to promote circular economies. Governments, research institutions and industries need to work collaboratively to redesign products, and rethink their use and disposal to reduce microplastic waste from pellets, synthetic textiles and tyres. Consumers and society must shift to more sustainable consumption patterns. This will require solutions which go beyond waste management and consider the whole lifecycle of plastic products; from design to infrastructure, and household use. More funding for research and innovation should be made available to provide policymakers, manufacturers and consumers with the evidence needed to implement technological, behavioural and policy solutions to address marine plastic pollution. Methodologies to identify, measure and address marine plastic pollution sources and plastic leakage are available, including from IUCN.

They regulate ecosystems, protect biodiversity, play an integral part in the carbon cycle, support livelihoods, and can help drive sustainable growth. To maximise the climate benefits of forests, we must keep more forest landscapes intact, manage them more sustainably, and restore more of those landscapes which we have lost. Halting the loss and degradation of natural systems and promoting their restoration have the potential to contribute over one-third of the total climate change mitigation scientists say is required by 2030. Restoring 350 million hectares of degraded land in line with the Bonn Challenge could sequester up to 1.7 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent annually. Download February 2021 What is the issue? Forests are a stabilising force for the climate. They regulate ecosystems, protect biodiversity, play an integral part in the carbon cycle, support livelihoods, and supply goods and services that can drive sustainable growth. Forests\u2019 role in climate change is two-fold. They act as both a cause and a solution for greenhouse gas emissions. Around 25% of global emissions come from the land sector, the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions after the energy sector. About half of these (5-10 GtCO2e annually) comes from deforestation and forest degradation. Forests are also one of the most important solutions to addressing the effects of climate change. Approximately 2.6 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, one-third of the CO2 released from burning fossil fuels, is absorbed by forests every year. Estimates show that nearly two billion hectares of degraded land across the world \u2013 an area the size of South America \u2013 offer opportunities for restoration. Increasing and maintaining forests is therefore an essential solution to climate change. Why is it important? Halting the loss and degradation of forest ecosystems and promoting their restoration have the potential to contribute over one-third of the total climate change mitigation that scientists say is required by 2030 to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement. Other benefits in support of both people and nature are considerable: Globally, 1.6 billion people (nearly 25% of the world\u2019s population) rely on forests for their livelihoods, many of whom are the world\u2019s poorest. Forests provide US$ 75\u2013100 billion per year in goods and services such as clean water and healthy soils Forests are home to 80% of the world\u2019s terrestrial biodiversity. Mount Elgon, Uganda \u00a9 Edmund Barrow / IUCN What can be done? IUCN\u2019s forest work tackles the role of trees and forests in building resilience to climate change in several ways: Combatting deforestation and forest degradation in areas of high biodiversity and cultural significance, such as primary forests and World Heritage sites. This helps conserve the benefits that people and societies get from forests, including forest carbon stocks and livelihoods. Restoring forest landscapes helps enhance climate change mitigation and adaptation. As the co-founder and Secretariat of the Bonn Challenge \u2013 a global effort to bring 350 million hectares of deforested and degraded land under restoration by 2030 \u2013 IUCN supports national and sub-national decision makers in reaching this important goal. Reaching the 350 million hectare target could sequester up to 1.7 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent annually. Enabling rights-based land use ensures community involvement in land-use outcomes. IUCN produces results on the ground through partners and projects worldwide to help strengthen community control over forests, alleviate poverty, empower women and men, enhance biodiversity, and sustainably manage forests. Unlocking forest benefits is critical to a sustainable and equitable supply of forest goods and services. IUCN builds capacity for implementing restoration, engaging the private sector and striving to make sure benefits \u2013 such as those from Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) \u2013 are equitably shared with local landowners and forest communities. Today, more and more consumers are demanding forest products from sustainable sources, and an increasing number of major palm oil, timber, paper and other forest product corporations are beginning the conversion to deforestation-free supply chains. In addition to creating and maintaining protected areas and launching initiatives towards more sustainable management, many countries, subnational governments and private landowners are restoring degraded and deforested land. This helps to take pressure off healthy, intact forests and reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. As the world debates how to operationalise the Paris Agreement, it is imperative that national leaders accelerate these actions. This can be done by subscribing to and implementing the New York Declaration on Forests, sustain forest climate financing, and include forest and land use in countries\u2019 Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement.

Over half of the tropical forests worldwide have been destroyed since the 1960s, and every second, more than one hectare of tropical forests is destroyed or drastically degraded. The degradation and loss of forests threatens the survival of many species, and reduces the ability of forests to provide essential services. Deforestation and forest degradation impact the lives of 1.6 billion people whose livelihoods depend on forests. One billion of them are among the world\u2019s poorest. Nature-based Solutions such as forest landscape restoration (FLR) can reverse the effects of deforestation and degradation and regain the ecological, social, climatic and economic benefits of forests. Download February 2021 What is the issue ? Deforestation and forest degradation are the biggest threats to forests worldwide. Deforestation occurs when forests are converted to non-forest uses, such as agriculture and road construction. Forest degradation occurs when forest ecosystems lose their capacity to provide important goods and services to people and nature. Over half of the tropical forests worldwide have been destroyed since the 1960s, and every second, more than one hectare of tropical forests is destroyed or drastically degraded. This intense and devastating pressure on forests is not limited to the tropics \u2013 an estimated 3.7 million hectares of Europe\u2019s forests are damaged by livestock, insects, diseases, forest fires, and other human-linked activities. Deforestation in Myanmar Li Jia/IUCN Why is it important ? Biodiversity Over 80% of the world\u2019s terrestrial biodiversity can be found in forests - from pine trees in the boreal North to the rainforests in the tropics. The degradation and loss of forests threaten the survival of many species, and reduce the ability of forests to provide essential services such as clean air and water, healthy soils for agriculture, and climate regulation. Sustainable livelihoods Healthy forests support the livelihoods of 1.6 billion people globally, one billion of whom are among the world\u2019s poorest. Deforestation and forest degradation have real and tangible impacts on the lives of these vulnerable communities. For example, 52 per cent of all land used for food production is moderately or severely impacted by the erosion of healthy soil. This occurs when trees are removed from a landscape, leading to increased food insecurity. Climate mitigation and adaptation The world\u2019s forests absorb 2.4 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year, one-third of the annual CO2 released from burning fossil fuels. Forest destruction emits further carbon into the atmosphere, with 4.3\u20135.5 GtCO2eq/yr generated annually, largely from deforestation and forest degradation. Protecting and restoring this vast carbon sink is essential for mitigating climate change. Forests also play a crucial role in climate change adaptation efforts. They act as a food safety net during climate shocks, reduce risks from disasters like coastal flooding, and help regulate water flows and microclimates. Improving the health of these forest ecosystems and introducing sustainable management practices increase the resilience of human and natural systems to the impacts of climate change. What can be done? Forest landscape restoration (FLR) Nature-based Solutions such as forest landscape restoration can help countries reverse the effects of deforestation and degradation and regain the ecological, social, climatic and economic benefits of forests. FLR brings people together to identify and implement the most appropriate restoration interventions in a landscape. It seeks to accommodate the needs of all land users and multiple land uses. FLR is not just about planting trees \u2013 it can include multiple activities like agroforestry, erosion control and natural forest regeneration. FLR also addresses the underlying drivers of forest loss. For example, it provides farming communities living in and around forests with knowledge on sustainable agricultural methods that do not rely on destroying forests. The Bonn Challenge Countries and other land owners are committing to FLR through the Bonn Challenge \u2013 a global effort to restore 350 million hectares by 2030, launched by IUCN and Germany in 2011. The Bonn Challenge has so far generated pledges from governments and organisations to restore over 210 million hectares. Learn more at BonnChallenge.or Assessing restoration opportunities With IUCN\u2019s support, over 30 countries are applying the Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM) \u2013 a framework that assesses the extent of degraded and deforested landscapes in a country or area, and identifies the best strategies for restoring them. ROAM helps governments and decision makers use FLR interventions to meet multiple national priorities and international goals on climate, biodiversity and land degradation. For example, a ROAM assessment in Malawi helped the government introduce sustainable agricultural systems to address food insecurity.

Peatlands are the largest natural terrestrial carbon store. They store more carbon than all other vegetation types in the world combined. Damaged peatlands are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, responsible for almost 5% of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Peatland restoration can reduce emissions significantly. Countries should include peatland conservation and restoration in their commitments to international agreements, including the Paris Agreement on climate change. Download What is the issue? Peatlands are a type of wetland which occur in almost every country and are known to cover at least 3% of global land surface. The term \u2018peatland\u2019 refers to the peat soil and the wetland habitats growing on the surface. Estimated global distribution of peatlands \u00a9 IUCN In peatlands, year-round water-logged conditions slow plant decomposition to such an extent that dead plants accumulate to form peat. This stores the carbon the plants absorbed from the atmosphere within peat soils, providing a net-cooling effect and helping to mitigate the climate crisis. Peatland landscapes are varied: from temperate blanket mires with open, treeless vegetation such as the Flow Country of Scotland to swamp forests in Southeast Asia. New areas are still being discovered. The world\u2019s largest tropical peatland was identified beneath the forests of the Congo Basin in 2017. Degradation and overexploitation of peatland landscapes release huge quantities of greenhouse gasses. This results mainly from a lack of awareness of the benefits of peatlands and includes actions such as: drainage, conversion for agriculture, burning, and mining for fuel. In some regions, up to 80% of peatlands have been damaged. Why is it important? Peatlands are significant to global efforts to combat climate change and achieve other Sustainable Development Goals. Their protection and restoration are vital in the transition to a zero-carbon society. Emissions from drained peatlands are estimated at 1.9 gigatonnes of CO2e annually. This is equivalent to 5% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, a disproportionate amount considering damaged peatlands cover just 0.3% of landmass. Fires in Indonesian peat swamp forests in 2015, for example, emitted nearly 16 million tonnes of CO2 a day; which is more than the entire economy of the United States. Worldwide, the remaining area of near natural peatland (over 3 million km2) sequesters 0.37 gigatonnes of CO2 a year. Peat soils contain more than 600 gigatonnes of carbon which represents up to 44% of all soil carbon, and exceeds the carbon stored in all other vegetation types including the world\u2019s forests. In their natural, wet state, peatlands provide indispensable Nature-based Solutions for adapting to and mitigating the effects of climate change, including regulating water flows, minimising the risk of flooding and drought, and preventing seawater intrusion. Wet peatlands lower ambient temperatures in surrounding areas, providing refuge from extreme heat, and are less likely to burn during wildfires. This helps to preserve air quality. Draining peatlands reduces the quality of drinking water as water becomes polluted with organic carbon and pollutants historically absorbed within peat. In many parts of the world, peatlands supply food, fibre and other local products that sustain economies. They also preserve important ecological and archaeological information such as pollen records and human artefacts. Damage to peatlands causes biodiversity loss. For example, the decline of the Bornean orang-utan population by 60% within 60 years is largely attributed to the loss of peat swamp habitat. The species is now listed as Critically Endangered on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species\u2122. What can be done? Urgent action worldwide to protect, sustainably manage, and restore peatlands is essential. This involves stopping degrading activities such as agricultural conversion and drainage, and restoring the waterlogged conditions required for peat formation.

IAS are one of the biggest causes of biodiversity loss and species extinctions, and are also a global threat to food IAS are compounded by climate change. Climate change facilitates the spread and establishment of many alien species and creates new opportunities for them to become invasive. IAS can reduce the resilience of natural habitats, agricultural systems and urban areas to climate change. Conversely, climate change reduces the resilience of habitats to biological invasions. security and livelihoods. Download It is essential that IAS be incorporated into climate change policies. This includes biosecurity measures to prevent the introduction of IAS to new regions as a result of climate change, and rapid response measures to monitor and eradicate alien species that may become invasive due to climate change. February 2021 What is the issue ? Over the recent decades globalisation has increased the movement of people and goods around the world, leading to a rise in the number of species introduced to areas outside their natural ranges. A 2017 study found that over one third of all introductions in the past 200 years occurred after 1970 and the rate of introductions is showing no sign of slowing down. In fact, a 2020 study predicts that the number of established alien species will increase by 36% between 2005 and 2050. An alien species is an animal, plant or other organism that is introduced by humans, either intentionally or accidentally, into places outside its natural range. Some alien species \u2013 classed as \u2018invasive\u2019 \u2013 become established and negatively impact native biodiversity, as well as ecosystem services on which humans depend. The Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) forms a dense cover on the surface of freshwater bodies. Its populations are known to double in as little as 12 days, blocking waterways, limiting boat traffic, and affecting fishing and trade. In Lake Victoria in Eastern Africa, it can grow to such densities that ships are unable to leave docks.Rats are frequently identified with catastrophic declines of birds on islands, and transmit the plague bacterium via fleas in certain areas of the world. The Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) is the greatest threat to the survival of various endemic Hawaiian arthropods, including insects and crustaceans. It displaces native ant species, some of which may be important seed-dispersers or plant-pollinators, leading to the disruption of native ecosystems. The Emerald Ash Borer beetle (Agrilus planipennis) is decimating some of the most prominent ash tree species in North America. It has the potential to destroy over eight billion ash trees. The impacts from invasive alien species (IAS) can be compounded by climate change \u2013 the change in the Earth\u2019s climate due to rising greenhouse gas emissions. Extreme climatic events resulting from climate change, such as hurricanes, floods and droughts can transport IAS to new areas and decrease the resistance of habitats to invasions. Climate change is also opening up new pathways of introduction of IAS. For example, emerging Arctic shipping passages due to melting ice caps will greatly reduce the time taken for ships to travel from Asia to Europe. This will increase the risk of alien species surviving the journey. Many IAS have the ability to expand rapidly to higher latitudes and altitudes as the climate warms, out-pacing native species. Alien species that are regularly introduced by humans but have so far failed to establish may succeed in doing so thanks to climate change, creating new sets of invaders. Some habitats, such as temperate forests and freshwater systems that currently have thermal barriers limiting the establishment of IAS will become more suitable for alien species as the climate changes. Why is it important ? The increase and geographic redistribution of IAS will have diverse societal and environmental impacts. Biological invasions are a major threat to global food security and livelihoods, with developing countries being the most susceptible. These countries, which have high levels of subsistence and smallholder farming, often lack the capacity to prevent and manage biological invasions. IAS reduce the resilience of natural habitats, making them more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. For example, some grasses and trees that have become IAS can significantly alter fire regimes, especially in areas that are becoming warmer and drier. This increases the frequency and severity of wildfires and puts habitats, urban areas and human life at risk. IAS can also impact agricultural systems, by reducing crop and animal health.

Photo: IUCN What can be done? As the impacts of IAS are increasingly compounded by a changing climate, policy responses addressing these issues need to take into account the links between the two issues. Climate change policies can incorporate IAS, by including IAS prevention and control, and by ensuring that measures to address climate change do not increase the threat of IAS. For example native tree species should be used for carbon sequestration or erosion control rather than introduced species such as Acacia or Eucalyptus occurring outside their native range. Climate change should also be explicitly incorporated into risk assessments of IAS, to help identify those alien species that could become a threat in the future. Ecosystems need to be prioritised according to their vulnerability to climate change and IAS, making it possible to establish measures that will prevent IAS introduction. This should include establishing effective biosecurity measures to manage priority pathways of introduction, supported by early warning and rapid eradication to tackle alien species before they become invasive. International cooperation is key. Adapted from the Invasive Plants and Animals Policy Framework, State of Victoria Department of Primary Industries, 2010 To improve ecosystem resilience to a changing climate, ecosystems that are already threatened by IAS need to be prioritised for IAS control or eradication. And finally, those alien species that are likely to become invasive due to climate change (\u2018sleepers\u2019) need to be identified and eradicated or controlled before they spread and become invasive.

Present ocean acidification occurs approximately ten times faster than anything experienced during the last 300 million years, jeopardising the ability of ocean systems to adapt to changes in ocean chemistry due to CO2. Ocean acidification has the potential to change marine ecosystems and impact many ocean-related benefits to society such as coastal protection or provision of food and income. Increased ocean temperatures and oxygen loss act concurrently with ocean acidification and constitute the \u2018deadly trio\u2019 of climate change pressures on the marine environment. To combat the worst effects of the deadly trio, CO2 emissions need to be cut significantly and immediately at the source. Sustainable management, conservation, restoration and strong, permanent protection of at least 30% of the ocean are urgently needed. Download November 2017 What is the issue? Ocean acidification is a direct consequence of increased human-induced carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in the atmosphere. The ocean absorbs over 25% of all anthropogenic emissions from the atmosphere each year. As CO2 dissolves in sea water it forms carbonic acid, thereby decreasing the ocean\u2019s pH, leading to a suite of changes collectively known as ocean acidification. Ocean acidification is happening in parallel with other climate-related stressors, including ocean warming and deoxygenation. This completes the set of climate change pressures on the marine environment \u2013 heat, acidity and oxygen loss \u2013 often referred to as the \u2018deadly trio\u2019. Interaction between these stressors is often cumulative or even multiplicative, resulting in combined effects that are more severe than the sum of their individual impacts. Why is it important? Present ocean acidity change is unprecedented in magnitude, occurring at a rate approximately ten times faster than anything experienced during the last 300 million years. This rapid timeline is jeopardising the ability of ocean systems to adapt to changes in CO2 \u2013 a process that naturally occurs over millennia. Changes in ocean pH levels will persist as long as concentrations of atmospheric CO2 continue to rise. To avoid significant harm, atmospheric concentrations of CO2 need to get back to at least the 320-350 ppm range of CO2 in the atmosphere. Compared to other similar events in Earth's history, ocean acidification, over hundreds of years, has been happening very fast. However, its recovery has been very slow due to the inherent time lags in the carbon and ocean cycles. Laffoley, D. d\u2019A. and Baxter, J.M. (eds) (2010). Ocean Acidification: Questions Answered Ocean acidification has the potential to change marine ecosystems and impact many ocean-related benefits to society such as coastal protection or provision of food and income. Although more knowledge on the impacts of ocean acidification on marine life is needed, changes in many ecosystems and the services they provide to society can be extrapolated from current understanding. Some of the strongest evidence of the potential effects of ocean acidification on marine ecosystems stems from experiments on calcifying organisms. Increased sea water acidity has been demonstrated to affect the formation and dissolution of calcium carbonate shells and skeletons in a range of marine species, including corals, molluscs such as oysters and mussels, and many phytoplankton and zooplankton species that form the base of marine food webs. Changes in species growth and reproduction, as well as structural and functional alterations in ecosystems, will threaten food security, harm fishing industries and decrease natural shoreline protection. They will also increase the risk of inundation and erosion in low-lying areas, thereby hampering climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction efforts. Increased ocean temperatures are likely to have direct effects on the physiology of marine organisms and influence the geographical distribution of species. Some species such as reef-forming corals, already living at their upper tolerance level, will have more difficulties \u2018moving\u2019 fast enough to new areas. Drastic changes in ocean temperature can also lead to coral bleaching events, where corals expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, causing them to turn completely white. The role of coral reefs in buffering coastal communities from storm waves and erosion, and in supporting income generation (fisheries and tourism) for local communities and commercial businesses, is jeopardised. The potential recovery of such bleaching events is hampered due to the declining calcification rates on reefs caused by ocean acidification. What can be done? The long time lags inherent in the marine carbon cycle put an added penalty on delaying limits on CO2 emissions and a premium on early action if the worst damages associated with ocean acidification are to be avoided.

The current emissions targets need significant tightening if they are to tackle the issue of ocean acidification and ocean warming. Limiting the global average temperature increase to well below 2\u00b0C, rather than a lower level, will significantly harm the ocean life on which we all depend in some form or another. Scientists even suggest that a healthy ocean needs an atmospheric carbon concentration of much less than 400 ppm. This benchmark has recently been exceeded. Other initiatives such as the Ocean Acidification international Reference User Group (OAiRUG), composed of scientists and various stakeholders, need to be engaged as a key means of conveying scientific results.

Biodiversity offsets are only appropriate for projects which have rigorously applied the mitigation hierarchy framework, a widely accepted approach for biodiversity conservation. The aim of offsets is to achieve No Net Loss (NNL) and preferably a Net Gain (NG) of biodiversity when projects take place. Measures that are not designed to result in NNL and preferably NG are not biodiversity offsets. The achievement of NNL/NG is dependent on measurable, appropriately implemented, monitored, evaluated and enforced offset schemes. Biodiversity offsets must be a measure of last resort; and in certain cases offsets are not appropriate and should not be used. Download February 2021 What is the issue ? Public and private sector investments in projects such as infrastructure development, mining and oil exploration are among the current drivers of economic growth. However, biodiversity is not well accounted for under our present economic system and such projects can have important impacts on species and ecosystems more generally. There is growing interest by governments and the private sector to look for ways of compensating for these biodiversity impacts, and achieve a No Net Loss (NNL) and preferably a Net Gain (NG) of biodiversity when projects take place. Photo: IUCN Measures to compensate for negative impacts, for example by protecting threatened forests or restoring wetlands, collectively known as biodiversity offsets, are increasingly being used by governments and the private sector. Biodiversity offsets are conservation actions intended to compensate for the residual, unavoidable impact on biodiversity caused by projects, to ensure at least a no net loss of biodiversity and, where possible, a net gain. Why is it important ? Biodiversity is the variability among living organisms including diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems. The reduced abundance of species from overexploitation, the fragmentation and degradation of habitats, pollution and other pressures driving biodiversity loss are constant, and even increasing as a result of development and increasing human populations. Conservation of biodiversity is necessary to ensure the continued survival of species, and ecosystems in general. Given the importance of biodiversity, \u2018No Net Loss\u2019 (NNL) and \u2018Net gain\u2019 (NG) approaches for biodiversity use targeted and measureable environmental goals that allow governments and companies to take into account biodiversity when engaging in any type of project. These goals can only be achieved systematically through the application of the mitigation hierarchy, which is a decision-making framework involving a sequence of steps starting with the avoidance of impacts, followed by the minimization of inevitable impacts, on-site restoration and finally, where feasible and necessary, biodiversity offsets. The correct application of the mitigation hierarchy can potentially limit the adverse impacts of projects on biodiversity, and may deliver additional biodiversity conservation. However, an improper application, especially if implemented with unresolved but fundamental knowledge gaps, and poor corporate, financial and regulatory policy may undermine established approaches to managing biodiversity risk. In certain cases, biodiversity offsets are not appropriate and should not be used. What can be done? To achieve NNL/NG goals, there needs to be clarity on what biodiversity offsets mean, when they cannot or should not be used as a conservation approach, and how to design and implement them. Measures that are not designed to result in NNL and preferably NG are not biodiversity offsets. Biodiversity offsets are only appropriate for projects which have rigorously applied the mitigation hierarchy and when a full set of alternatives to the project have been considered. Priority must be given to avoiding any damage to biodiversity. The reality is that some biodiversity will always be lost in offset exchanges as no two areas of habitat or species populations are identical. Therefore, biodiversity offsets must be a measure of last resort after all other attempts at preventing or reducing impacts have been considered. Biodiversity offsets must not be used in certain circumstances. For example, when a project may result in the extinction of species, when there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the success of the offset, a clear lack of governance, or the values that will be lost are specific to a particular place, and therefore cannot be found elsewhere. Implementing biodiversity offsets is a long-term exercise. Biodiversity offset schemes should be measurable and appropriately implemented, monitored, evaluated and enforced, and take full account of direct, indirect and cumulative impacts, geographically and over time. National laws and circumstances vary around the world, so there is no single approach to designing and implementing biodiversity offsets.

IUCN\u2019s Policy on Biodiversity Offsets, adopted by the Members\u2019 Assembly of the World Conservation Congress, which took place 1-10 September 2016 in Hawai\u2018i, provides a framework to guide the design, implementation and governance of biodiversity offset schemes and projects. It also provides guidance as to where offsets are, and are not, an appropriate conservation tool to ensure that, when offset schemes are used they lead to positive conservation outcomes. Key elements of biodiversity offsets included in IUCN\u2019s Policy are:Measuring and exchanging biodiversity, defensible and replicable measures and units of exchange, sufficient baseline surveys, and established exchange rules governing which residual impacts can be offset by what type of gains. Additionality, biodiversity offsets must secure additional conservation outcomes that would not have happened otherwise. Timeframe, the offset gain should last at least as long as the impact being addressed which in most cases means in perpetuity. Uncertainty, offsets must account for uncertainty by clearly documenting data sources, assumptions, and knowledge gaps. Monitoring and evaluation, continued surveys of impacts and offset activities to measure the losses and gains that have actually transpired.
