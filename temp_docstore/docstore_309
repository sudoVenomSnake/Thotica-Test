ility and empowerment have been discussed in the last several weeks: e.g., do all people benefit from increased national revenue generated from mining sector? Does governing of financial and environmental resources not compromise the ability of future generations to improve their welfare? Are people participating in decision-making processes that affect their lives? The HDIA should also look at direct impacts as well as subsequent impacts. While an example of the direct impacts can be environmental impacts such as land degradation from the mineral extraction, subsequent impacts also can be loss of livelihoods in the affected communities. Its gendered impacts can stem from the gender division of labour in agriculture and forestry and on an increase in unpaid work to mitigate or adapt to the negative environmental impacts (****). It is possible to undertake a HDIA before, during, and/or after extractive projects are in place. An ex- ante assessment is intended to identify in advance the effect of extraction. It can inform the choice, design, and sequencing of alternative policy options. After the project starts, the monitoring of its impacts can lead to refinement of the policy; to a reconsideration of the pace/sequencing or institutional arrangements of the policy; or to the introduction or strengthening of mitigation 118 measures. An ex-ante assessment examines the actual impacts of extraction, which helps to suggest mitigation measures if negative impacts (e.g., land degradation, widening inequalities) are observed. Ideally, governments would lead the HDIA since governments need to verify the outcomes of the assessment and implement policy measures that facilitate positive impacts (e.g., revenue redistribution mechanisms) or ameliorate the negative impacts of extraction.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "14bf341f-97b0-4215-b9ec-e3cb0b471bac": {"__data__": {"id_": "14bf341f-97b0-4215-b9ec-e3cb0b471bac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing Sustainable Development: The Case of Extractive Industries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b32ee68c7870141d9022d32b79285ba06b49dd896e432ee20e7ede09e669f37f"}, "2": {"node_id": "4243030f-e3e9-4132-b9dd-e15f91d9baa0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7fa7e0700792ef3a2ca4906d90d79d85b6fb54ac745a301d1f6f7e62badd2d20"}}, "hash": "bf9e174d87a00adf2ca76bce90ac577144a332c3090e0021dc1de30165fdc1b4", "text": "Policy-makers from all relevant ministries (*****) and the parliament -- together with representatives of the groups (likely to be) affected by extraction, experts from academia, and CSOs -- need to be part of the HDIA exercise in order to democratize the debate on which groups are most likely to be affected and how they are affected.

For example, male share of employment in mining and quarrying are 86.3 percent in Bangladesh (2005), 79.4 percent in China (2007), 87.7 percent in Indonesia (2008), and 64.3 percent in Mongolia (2008) (Employment general level by economic activity, LABORSTA Internet - Last accessed on 13 September 2012). Similar to other industries however, men and women have different statuses in mining. Men tend to get the high-paid formal jobs in capital-intensive large mines while women are concentrated in smaller-scale, often informal and low-paid mining such as in gem mining. (****) Another example of direct impacts can be job creation in large-scale mines. Subsequent impacts include the emergence of new services sector near mining sites, including lodges and dining. Such - women are also drawn into commercial and transactional sex with male migrant workers. An HIV risk exposure is also high in mining and logging towns.

Resource revenue sharing with subnational governments: Opportunities and challenges Varsha Venugopal, Revenue Watch Institute Several national governments share resource revenues with regional and local governments (*) for reasons including compensation for negative social/environmental impacts and in response to the notion of local ownership of resources (**). In the Democratic Republic of Congo, the 2005 constitution established that provinces receive 40 percent of central government revenue, quadrupling their budgets. In Peru, oil and mineral producing regions receive 50 percent of the income tax paid by extractive sector companies. Within the regions, regional governments and public universities are assigned 20 percent of that amount, while local governments are assigned the remaining 80 percent. In all cases citizens can only benefit from revenue sharing if there are sound and transparent systems and processes for generating, sharing and spending resource revenues and subnational governments can effectively manage such revenues. A sound and transparent national and subnational regulatory framework can enable subnational actors to manage natural resources effectively and minimize opportunities for wastage, mismanagement or conflict. For example, the Indonesian revenue sharing regime has created a disincentive for districts to save windfall revenues by effectively taxing away unspent funds. Aligning the regulations with incentives for districts to spend effectively with allow for citizen priorities to be met. Transparency in production volumes, sale prices and the revenue sharing formula will allow citizens to monitor revenue collection and spending and ensure public confidence in the distributions of revenues from companies and the national government. A recent Revenue Watch Institute (RWI) research paper focusing on two districts in Indonesia observed that expenditure transparency can have a significant impact on citizen political engagement and demand for good governance in windfall environments (***). While potentially creating a unique opportunity to finance local development needs, sub-national revenue sharing can produce unprecedented challenges to local fiscal management and development planning capacities while potentially transmitting price volatility and other economic shocks to local economies.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c46ad5df-c370-45d4-9075-0cf136224506": {"__data__": {"id_": "c46ad5df-c370-45d4-9075-0cf136224506", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing Sustainable Development: The Case of Extractive Industries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b9c2a423b937135cab55c63ae3bc337223b3e96d2146cc57f81cb9296fdccf01"}, "2": {"node_id": "893bd651-1c89-443f-8eba-cf3ff4e41b1f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "555f9da98cdeb4293dea618f35ca1ef4dc660cc4d99d9c2f5e6aba765fca7ac2"}}, "hash": "9d3febd315994f1a405ecb6870e241f9182816159da4c0b14eade036060845f3", "text": "Relevant subnational government knowledge and capacities are required to collect and spend revenues effectively.

Despite addressing leakage issues, Ghanaian district governments continue to spend resource revenues primarily for recurrent expenditures, neglecting that these revenues will dry up once extractive projects close. To optimize benefits from shared revenues for the citizens, RWI promotes sound, transparent systems and processes and builds subnational government capacities to manage resource revenues. Sound regulations include improved resource revenue sharing laws. In Peru, RWI and its local partners assisted subnational governments and civil society to formulate a proposal for improved resource revenue sharing and a bill is currently being debated in the national parliament. Transparent systems and processes could be accomplished through laws as well as through other institutionalized mechanisms. In Indonesia, advice and assistance by RWI to local Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) led to the passage of local transparency legislations in two districts. These laws require transparency in resource revenue received and spent by district governments as well as social and environmental impacts of extractive companies (****). In Nigeria, RWI in partnership with local CSOs developed a multi-stakeholder platform to monitor resource revenues collected and spent by the Bayelsa regional government (*****). Increased subnational government capacity includes increased information, knowledge and technical know-how and having systems in place to institutionalize learning. RWI and its local partners assisted Peruvian regional governments with predicting resource revenues they should receive from the central government. As a result, absolute spending, spending effectiveness and allocations to priority sectors improved in regions that benefited from the assistance. Resource revenue sharing with subnational governments can only benefit citizens if accompanied by enabling regulatory framework, transparency in processes and outputs, and increased local government capacity to manage resource revenues.

Reflecting on some of them I would however offer a few words of caution in relation Melanesian setting (and Papua New Guinea) and focus development of an Inward Migration Plan. Many of the best practice models (e.g., codes around involuntary resettlement and free, prior informed consent [FPIC]) advocated by institutions such as the World Bank/International Finance stability of membership and institutional relationships -- particularly difficult. As Macintyre (2007) has demonstrated with regard to FPIC, and Filer (1997) has diversity and instability of the political relationships between persons, institutions, and communities and NGOs need to be wary of and constantly vigilant to the shifting internal dynamics and tensions with around them need to be flexible enough to be able to accommodate (and monitor) these shifts. In terms of Impact Assessments, I was involved last year in the development of an Inward Migration Plan (IMP) for a proposed major mining development in Papua New Guinea. Inward migration is regarded as perhaps the most destructive of the social processes associated with large-scale mining in Melanesia. Driven by economic opportunities associated with the mines, much of the inward migration is along kinship lines. It generates complex local contests around identity and representation, puts immense pressure on already stretched environmental resources, and adds to social problems such as sex work, alcoholism and violence (Banks 2009). As a result, communities and the companies seek to find ways limit this migration of people to the mine area.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b8019ea-8eda-4759-bc10-5cf13abf77f1": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b8019ea-8eda-4759-bc10-5cf13abf77f1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing Sustainable Development: The Case of Extractive Industries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b32e33c36d86d13b319cc77ec0981bcf79e10ae5529f6a958a1fc0207bb31b40"}, "2": {"node_id": "08fcbbaa-dbf7-4477-acd2-18acf8b5b31a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4c3c6e3edcebcfb48c982e9036d2216b62f259f407b1603b1e7f16692e9ff3a6"}}, "hash": "5787146863f04bbcf3b2a341213623aaa62f92096336e0c94cb0d358850df228", "text": "The IMP sat alongside, and to a large extent was integrated with, a series of other Social Management Plans, that in turn fed into and were also derived from a typically systematic social impact assessment (SIA).

Indige -making that affects their territories Juan Pablo Soler Villamizar, Movimiento R\u00edos Vivos In Colombia, the 1991 Constitution has radically changed the participation of the indigenous communities in the decision-making that affects their territories. The recognition of ethnic communities as individuals with rights and their ability to participate in the National Congress was a significant progress for the country. However, several bills have been pushed forward, such as the draft Statute of Rural Development and the Forest Law, which may threaten the well-being of indigenous communities and other ethnic groups. For instance, the Law 21 (1991), related to the consultation with indigenous communities, ratified the provisions under the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention 169. The Decree 1320 (1998) was aimed at regulating the prior consultation for natural resource mining exploitation. Nevertheless, this prior consultation is not applied to ancestral, collective or untitled lands. It should be noted that even if the mentioned legislation establishes specific provisions regarding the Constitutional Court declared that the Statute of Rural Development and the Forest Law was incompatible with both the Constitution and the ILO Convention 169, since the indigenous communities were not consulted in legislation that affects Colombia as a whole. In the same way, the courts have tried to annul it and clarify its scope. These mentioned cases were considered a stated under the 1991 Constitution (*). -size-fits- 123 courts take into account the ILO Convention 169 (Art 6 and 7), which establishes that the consultation processes must respect the practices, customs, methods and decision-making procedures of indigenous peoples. It was great progress for indigenous peoples but they were not completely in indigenous languages, in order to avoid their possible manipulation when accepting the projects, since they do not clearly understand Spanish. Recently, the courts have attempted to clarify the consultation process in the extractive projects with indigenous peoples, which show its increased commitment in the protection of their rights. However, it is not completely clear whether result of this enquiry is relevant in the implementation of extractive projects. legislation that affects their autonomy in their territories, so as to assure that their rights are respected. Indigenous communities and their legal partners must ensure the inexistence of defects and/or irregularities in the provided instruments for their decision-making participation in the extractive- related projects and its legislation. Otherwise the achievements reached that protect indigenous rights are reversed. In the second place, it is urgent to understand that indigenous communities have been victims of the colonial invasion, in various parts of the world. This has resulted in the occupation of many of their territories. Indigenous peoples have experienced forced displacement from their territories, and have had to live in inhospitable places in order to survive. Nowadays, extractive industries have raised their interests in further developing the now occupied places. In the neoclassical economic conception, the be respected. In our experience, this limited understanding results in the disrespect of indigenous beliefs, as well as their perceptions of the world. For example, in Colombia, since the late 1990s there is an oil exploration project in the indigenous U'wa territory. The U'wa have stated that oil is the blood of Mother Earth in their culture, just like the blood in our body. For this reason, allowing its extraction involves losing their beliefs and allows their destruction of their culture, people and Mother Nature. In this sense, it is a priority to reflect about the extractive model, which should be to readdress the necessary or minimum required consumption. This would try to protect ecosystems and communities dependent on them for their inherent water sources. Extractive industries should consider the impacts that their operations would have beyond borders.

Esto, sin lugar a duradas, fue un gran avance para los derechos ind\u00edgenas en el pa\u00eds. Sin embargo, varios proyectos de ley que han sido promovidos posteriormente, como el proyecto de Estatuto de Desarrollo Rural y la Ley Forestal, han puesto en riesgo el bienestar y los derechos ganados por los ind\u00edgenas, comunidades ind\u00edgenas y otros grupos \u00e9tnicos. La Ley 21 (1991) ratific\u00f3 las disposiciones contenidas en el Convenio de la Organizaci\u00f3n Internacional del Trabajo (OIT) 169 (relativa a las consultas con las comunidades ind\u00edgenas; posteriormente el Decreto 1320 (1998) intent\u00f3 reglamentar la consulta previa para la explotaci\u00f3n minera de los recursos naturales, pero la consulta no se aplica a ancestrales o colectivo, tierras sin t\u00edtulo. Aunque estas leyes tuvieron discusi\u00f3n respecto a las comunidades ind\u00edgenas y establece disposiciones relativas a sus vidas y medios de subsistencia, las comunidades ind\u00edgenas no fueron consultados. Sobre la base del hecho de que las comunidades no fueron consultadas por la legislaci\u00f3n que afecta a todo el pa\u00eds, en 2011, la Corte Constitucional declar\u00f3 el Estatuto de Desarrollo Rural y la Ley Forestal incompatible con la Constituci\u00f3n y el Convenio 169.

It has perhaps been too often presumed that benefits from natural resource exploitation in the extractive sector are largely defined quantitatively and in terms of contribution to GDP and further broken down into GDP per capita. The assumption being that directly or indirectly such benefits will accrue to the country and by extension to its people. Overwhelmingly, the evidence suggests that this approach is flawed and that even such benefits are not automatically fairly or equitably distributed across society and sometimes can be more intangible than tangible, i.e. being macro benefits which do not immediately provide either income, services or employment to society. It therefore begs the question if the current advances towards greener economies and greener growth will perpetuate the same mistake. Similarly, that analysis is based on industrial factors, finance and investment with similar hopes that secondary benefits to poverty reduction efforts and equity will be derived. For this reason, important questions of rights, benefit-sharing and participation are unavoidable. The GDP or financial benefits are necessary but insufficient by themselves for human development. Whether we consider the recent patterns of growth in Africa, or we consider high growth in local consumption, rapid growth and booming manufacturing sectors in India, China and Indonesia, we cannot forget that these come accompanied by concomitant levels of pollution, significant poverty and inequality.

Overall, these are still not comprehensive enough. Few tend to tackle participation and define benefit- sharing at the same time. Tackling the broader issue of other benefits, and more importantly the balance between public (common) and private (individual) benefits, is still the Achilles heel of the public policy process. The Nagoya Protocol is one of the clearest examples in the global environmental policy framew -sharing. Defining benefits as economic, political, social and justice, it also suggests explicitly that, on balance, sharing point for further reforms in the extractive sector and making benefits more inclusive particularly for rural and indigenous communities. One interesting approach, which seems to provide this kind of balance, emerges from the forestry sector in Cameroon. The 1994 Forestry Law of Cameroon is the basis for the approach, establishing community forestry as a policy and formally transferring the management of forest resources to local actors and institutions. According to the Forestry Law (Article 37) and the Manual of Procedure of the -permanent forest estate, measuring up to 5000 hectare acres, that is the object of an agreement between government and a community in which communities undertake sustainable forest management for a period of 25 generally make rules in the common interest in order to reduce the loss of the forest resources on which they depend, thereby reconciling short-term and long- reduction side, the approach has led to direct benefits to communities in the form of revenues to the community, cash payments for individuals and employment. It also meets the participation test as it works on the basis of local management (not just agreement or consent) and clearly defined ownership, rights and responsibilities. Other benefits accrue from public goods such as local infrastructure and educational facilities. Though issues of corruption can and have arisen there too, this example still provides some clear pathways to resolving some of the persistent issues which have plagued the extractive sector for some time. Looking forward, our thinking about benefits will possibly be as important as who gets them. It may be important to consider the following in getting the concepts and policy right: \uf0b7 The International Policy Centre for Inclusive Growth (IPC- one whi outcome and a process. On the one hand, it ensures that everyone can participate in the growth process, both in terms of decision-making for organising the growth progression as well as in participating in the growth itself. On the other hand, it makes sure that everyone shares equitably the benefits of growth. Inclusive growth implies participation and benefit- sharing. Participation without benefit-sharing makes growth unjust and sharing benefits \uf0b7 Given the environmental consequences of rapid and extensive exploitation of natural resources, there can really be no discussion about benefit-sharing without also discussing burden-sharing. Research suggests that the major environmental impacts from the mineral industry occur at the point of extraction and most of those burdens are often borne, largely, 128 by local communities. Participatory and benefit-sharing mechanisms must work towards the reduction and sharing of these burdens across society as a whole as well as how communities -term. \uf0b7 In order to improve the balance between benefits and risks and benefits and burdens, integrated poverty, social and environmental impact analysis needs to be applied, ex ante and ex post, to proposed policy reforms. Such a tool is highly relevant in changing the current dynamic from good intentions to better results. In this context, impact assessment must consider both the process of change as well as absolute change. Perhaps the most important lesson of all might be that some, if not most, of the answers to the challenges in the extractive sector exist in other fields of study, policy and research. This perhaps offers a pivotal opportunity for achieving inclusive development and doing so sustainably. Note - References Khoday, Kishan and Leisa Perch. 2012.

It also provides new and arresting evidence on how, where and why disaster risk is increasing globally. That risk is highly concentrated in middle- and low-income countries, and is felt most acutely by people living in poor rural areas and slums. But of course, wealthier countries are not immune, as bush fires in Australia reminded us so tragically at the start of this year. The risk of disaster touches every woman, man and child on Earth. Drawing on detailed studies, this Global Assessment urges a radical shift in development practices, and a major new emphasis on resilience and disaster planning. Floods, droughts, storms, earthquakes, fires and other events, when combined with \u2018risk drivers\u2019 such as increasing urbanization, poor urban governance, vulnerable rural livelihoods and the decline of ecosystems, can lead to massive human misery and crippling economic losses. The risks posed by global climate change and rising sea levels carry additional grave implications for how we will live in the near future. While we cannot prevent natural phenomena such as earthquakes and cyclones, we can limit their impacts. The scale of any disaster is linked closely to past decisions taken by citizens and governments \u2013 or the absence of such decisions. Pre-emptive risk reduction is the key. Sound response mechanisms after the event, however effective, are never enough. The current rate of progress is inadequate if we are to achieve, by 2015, the substantial reduction of disaster losses called for in The Hyogo Framework for Action and in the Millennium Development Goals. Fortunately, we know what to do. This Report sets out a range of much-needed action and provides compelling evidence that investing in disaster risk reduction is a cost-effective means to protect development, reduce poverty and adapt to climate change. I commend this important and impressive collaborative effort by the UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction system to policymakers and all others involved in the essential quest to build a safer world. Ban Ki-moon Secretary-General of the United Nations v Development efforts are increasingly at risk. A faltering global economy, food and energy insecurity, conflict, global climate change, declining ecosystems, extreme poverty and the threat of pandemics are amongst the factors challenging progress towards improving social welfare and economic stability in many developing countries. As a series of catastrophes in 2008 yet again reminded us, disaster risks associated with hazards such as tropical cyclones, floods, earthquakes, droughts and other natural hazards form a critical part of this interlocking constellation of threats and constitute a critical challenge to development. The 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction focuses attention on this challenge. The Report identifies disaster risk, analyses its causes and effects, shows that these causes can be addressed and recommends means to do so. The central message of the Report is that reducing disaster risk can provide a vehicle to reduce poverty, safeguard development and adapt to climate change, with beneficial effects on broader global stability and sustainability. The 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction is the first biennial global assessment of disaster risk reduction prepared in the context of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR). The ISDR, launched in 2000, provides a framework to coordinate actions to address disaster risks at the local, national, regional and international levels. The Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA), endorsed by UN member states at the World Conference on Disaster Reduction, Kobe, Japan, in 2005, commits all countries to make major efforts to reduce their disaster risk by 2015. It is expected that this Report will help focus international attention on the problem of disaster risk and to consolidate political and economic support and commitment to disaster risk reduction. The focus of this Report is the nexus between disaster risk and poverty, in a context of global climate change. Both mortality and Preface economic loss risk are heavily concentrated in developing countries and within these countries they disproportionately affect the poor. Disaster impacts have persistent, long- term negative impacts on poverty and human development that undermine the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The Report identifies underlying risk drivers such as vulnerable rural livelihoods, poor urban governance and declining ecosystems that shape the relationship between disaster risk and poverty. It also shows how climate change will magnify the uneven social and territorial distribution of risk, increasing the risks faced", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e5ad425-3560-4233-be3c-bddced0c5728": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e5ad425-3560-4233-be3c-bddced0c5728", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "57a2c0065cbd22a8e79fa5c3bd3741f32ff936e42df8ec5163a6b55b26e5209e"}}, "hash": "57a2c0065cbd22a8e79fa5c3bd3741f32ff936e42df8ec5163a6b55b26e5209e", "text": "by the poor and further amplifying poverty. The Report argues the need for an urgent paradigm shift in disaster risk reduction. Current progress in implementing the HFA is failing to address these underlying risk drivers and the translation of disaster impacts into poverty outcomes. Efforts to reduce disaster risk, reduce poverty and adapt to climate change are poorly coordinated. At the same time, however, innovative approaches and tools, in areas such as urban governance, ecosystem management, sustainable rural livelihoods, risk transfer and local and community-based approaches, exist and are being applied creatively at the local level and in different sectors throughout the developing world. The challenge identified by the Report is to link and focus the policy and governance frameworks for disaster risk reduction, poverty reduction and climate change adaptation in a way that can bring these local and sectoral approaches into the mainstream. This will not only facilitate the achievement of the HFA: it will contribute towards poverty reduction and the achievement of the MDGs. Importantly, it also provides a vehicle to enable countries to adapt to global climate change. The 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction is a collaborative effort of the ISDR system. The Report has been prepared and coordinated by UNISDR in partnership with 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate vi the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the World Bank, United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), World Meteorlogical Organization (WMO), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the ProVention Consortium, regional intergovernmental and technical institutions, national governments, civil society networks, academic institutions and many other ISDR system partners. A number of parallel activity streams, undertaken over an 18-month period, have contributed to the Report: A global disaster risk analysis was carried \ufffd \ufffd out involving a major global effort by a large number of scientific and technical institutions. Major methodological innovations have enabled a more accurate characterization of global mortality and economic loss risk for natural hazards such as floods, tropical cyclones and landslides, the identification of key risk drivers and trends and an initial characterization of economic resilience. Each of the hazard updates was reviewed by a panel of international scientists. An analysis of disaster risk at the local level \ufffd \ufffd was similarly based on a major coordinated effort by a large number of institutions to compile, update and validate data from national disaster databases in 12 countries. This analysis sheds light on the emergence of patterns and trends of extensive disaster risk, affecting wide areas and manifested as frequent, but relatively low-intensity, losses. In addition, empirical research was conducted to examine disaster risk\u2013poverty interactions at the local- and household levels. Specialized international research institutes \ufffd \ufffd were commissioned to produce a series of issue papers that provided the basis for an analysis of the underlying risk drivers that configure the disaster risk\u2013poverty nexus in both rural and urban contexts. A review of progress towards the achievement \ufffd \ufffd of the HFA was completed by 62 countries (as of February 2009), against 22 core indicators and 5 benchmarks, using an on-line \u2018HFA Monitor\u2019 tool. Thematic practice reviews were also produced for the Report on early warning systems, financial mechanisms, local- and community-level approaches, urban disaster risk reduction, environmental management, disaster risk reduction governance, climate change adaptation and sustainable livelihoods. Other partners contributed case studies and practice reviews across a wide range of disaster risk reduction practice areas. The review process not only highlighted the progress being made against the HFA but also a range of innovative approaches and practices that address the underlying risk drivers. The Report has been drafted to inform the Second Session of the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction to be held in Geneva on 16\u201319 June, 2009. As such its principal audience is national-level policy makers in disaster prone countries as well as the regional and international organizations that support such countries. While the Report addresses the relationship between disaster risk and poverty in a context of climate change, its central focus is on disaster risk reduction. It has not been possible, nor was it intended, to provide a comprehensive review of policies, research and practice in poverty reduction and climate change adaptation. Nevertheless, disaster risk reduction is a key paradigm through which both poverty reduction and climate change adaptation can be addressed. One of the key messages of the Report is that by addressing the underlying drivers of disaster risk it is possible to reduce poverty and to adapt to climate change.

This is an important point given that both the poverty reduction and climate change communities assign different meanings to terms such as hazard, vulnerability, risk and mitigation. Unless otherwise stated, the termin- ology used in this report is that contained in a glossary recently published by UNISDR 1. The Report is presented in three different formats for different audiences: A short Summary and Recommendations document provides an overview of the key findings and recommendations of the Report for vii Preface national governments, regional and international organizations as well as for policy makers from civil society and the private sector. The main body of the Report is structured around seven chapters and provides technical information for disaster risk reduction policy makers, practitioners and researchers: Chapter 1: \ufffd\ufffd The global challenge: disaster risk, poverty and climate change provides an overview of the key policy issues addressed in the Report. Chapter 2: \ufffd\ufffd Global disaster risk: patterns, trends and drivers presents the findings of the global risk analysis. Chapter 3: \ufffd\ufffd Deconstructing disaster: risk patterns and poverty trends at the local level presents an analysis of national level disaster and poverty data. Chapter 4: \ufffd\ufffd The heart of the matter: the underlying risk drivers analyses the role of vulnerable rural livelihoods, poor urban governance, declining ecosystems and global climate change in configuring disaster risk. Chapter 5: \ufffd\ufffd Review of progress in the implementation of the Hyogo Framework for Action presents an overview and analysis of the progress reports prepared by countries, a desk review of the integration of disaster risk reduction into poverty reduction strategies and climate change adaptation policy, and a review of progress in thematic areas such as early warning. Chapter 6: \ufffd\ufffd Addressing the underlying risk drivers identifies and examines best practice for addressing the disaster risk\u2013poverty nexus in areas such as good urban and local governance, strengthening rural livelihoods, ecosystem management, innovative financial mechanisms and local- and community-level disaster risk reduction. Chapter 7: \ufffd\ufffd Investing today for a safer tomorrow presents the conclusions and recommendations of the Report. A series of Appendices, as well as background papers commissioned for the Report, are available in the accompanying CD-Rom and also online at PreventionWeb 2. These are made available for specialists who wish to have a more in-depth exploration of the issues addressed in the Report. The quantitative data used to produce the Report are also available as an online Global Risk Data Platform at PreventionWeb, allowing researchers to perform their own analysis. It is expected that this will encourage innovative new research that in turn will feed back into future iterations of the ISDR Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction. While a considerable body of evidence has been produced to support the recommendations of the Report, it is also necessary to highlight areas that have not been addressed. Constraints in data and methodology have not allowed the modelling of drought risk or an adequate characterization of losses in the agricultural sector and rural areas. Qualitative evidence from case studies and the results of empirical microstudies of disaster risk\u2013poverty interactions provide insights into the impacts of drought on rural livelihoods. However, drought risk is a major gap in the report, in particular for regions such as sub-Saharan Africa where it is associated with major disaster impacts and poverty outcomes. Data constraints also limit the global relevance and representativeness of the disaster risk and poverty analysis at the local level. Progress in compiling national disaster loss data has been largely limited to Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean. Similarly, poverty panel data that include modules on natural hazards and with a local-level resolution are not widely available in most countries. As such the empirical evidence linking disaster risk to poverty is limited to microstudies from particular countries. While this evidence in itself is compelling, with existing data it is not possible to generate comparable findings across countries and regions. The HFA progress review is based on information provided by national governments, normally from the organization or focal point responsible for disaster risk reduction. It was not possible in this exercise to systematically review progress being made by regional or international organizations or by other national stakeholders such as the private sector or civil society. The findings, therefore, do not necessarily reflect a complete picture of the progress being made in each HFA Priority Area. 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate viii Finally, the focus of this Report is on the disaster risk and poverty nexus in a context of global climate change.

In May, the tropical cyclone Nargis caused an estimated 140,000 mortalities in Myanmar, primarily due to a storm surge in the low-lying, densely populated Irrawaddy River delta. In May, China\u2019s most powerful earthquake since 1976 affected Sichuan and parts of Chongqing, Gansu, Hubei, Shaanxi and Yunnan killing at least 87,556 people, injuring more than 365,000 1 and affecting more than 60 million people in ten provinces and regions. An estimated 5.36 million buildings collapsed and more than 21 million buildings were damaged. Figure 1.1 shows the locations of large and medium urban centres in areas that experienced strong earthquake intensities. Also in August 2008, the Kosi River in Bihar, India, broke through an embankment and changed its course 120 km eastwards, rendering useless more than 300 km of flood defences that had been built to protect towns and villages. Flowing into supposedly flood safe areas, the river affected 3.3 million people in 1,598 villages located in 15 districts 2. It was characterized as the worst flood in the area for 50 years, prompting the Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh, to declare a \u201cnational calamity\u201d on 28th August. Internationally reported disaster loss is heavily concentrated in a small number of infrequently occurring events. Between January 1975 and October 2008 and excluding epidemics, the International Emergency Disasters Database Intensive and extensive disaster risk EMDAT recorded 8,866 events killing 2,283,767 people. Of these, 23 mega-disasters (listed in Table 1.1) killed 1,786,084 people, mainly in developing countries. In other words, 0.26% of the events accounted for 78.2% of the mortality 3. 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 4 Table 1.1: Disasters with more than 10,000 fatalities, January 1975 \u2013 June 2008 4 (Highlighting denotes disasters within the five-year period, 2003\u20132008.)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c1bdcedc-b9da-46e2-9d36-fb170fcbef97": {"__data__": {"id_": "c1bdcedc-b9da-46e2-9d36-fb170fcbef97", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d6d600a1d0cfbb5b0e71b968deebc820345ae0e30420e8f8769e3b0c795d23c3"}, "2": {"node_id": "617fe001-83f0-4611-af38-de4ae8377532", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9c5069723083bc7cf15164c66bd096c2b007b1a3e5d3dda95800489c9235e851"}}, "hash": "f95880a6fbcec8624e375180bc8a2977b07adbe27377b7d6c504238c443c8898", "text": "Source: EMDAT; Analysis by ISDR, 2008 (data as of September 2008) Year Country Disaster Fatalities 1983 Ethiopia Ethiopian drought 300,000 1976 China Tangshan earthquake 242,000 2004 South Indian Ocean Indian Ocean tsunami 226,408 1983 Sudan Sudan drought 150,000 1991 Bangladesh Cyclone Gorky 138,866 2008 Myanmar Cyclone Nargis 133,655 1981 Mozambique Southern Mozambique drought 100,000 2008 China Sichuan earthquake 87,476 2005 India, Pakistan Kashmir earthquake 73,338 2003 Europe European heat wave 56,809 1990 Iran Manjil-Rudbar earthquake 40,000 1999 Venezuela Vargas floods 30,000 2003 Iran Bam earthquake 26,796 1978 Iran Tabas earthquake 25,000 1988 Soviet Union Spitak earthquake 25,000 1976 Guatemala The Guatemala earthquake 23,000 1985 Colombia Nevado Del Ruiz volcano 21,800 2001 India Gujarat earthquake 20,005 1999 Turkey Izmit earthquake 17,127 1998 Honduras Hurricane Mitch 14,600 1977 India Andhra Pradesh cyclone 14,204 1985 Bangladesh Bangladesh cyclone 10,000 1975 China Haicheng earthquake 10,000 In the same period, recorded economic losses were US$ 1,527.6 billion.

Destruction in the housing sector usually accounts for a significant proportion of direct economic loss in disasters. At whatever scale disaster losses are viewed, therefore, mortality and direct economic loss appear to be highly concentrated geographically and associated with a very small number of hazard events. These are areas where major concentrations of vulnerable people and economic assets are exposed to very severe hazards. In this report the term intensive risk is used to refer to these concentrations. In contrast, and at whatever scale disaster losses are viewed, wide regions are exposed to more frequently occurring low-intensity losses. These widespread low-intensity losses are associated with other risk impacts such as a large number of affected people and damage to housing and local infrastructure, but not to major mortality or destruction of economic assets. For example, 99.3% of local loss reports in the 12 countries mentioned accounted for only 16% of the mortality but 51% of housing damage. These losses are pervasive in both space and time.

This geographically dispersed exposure of vulnerable people and economic assets to mainly low or moderate intensity hazard is described as extensive risk in this report. Intensive and extensive risk, therefore, refer to the relative concentration or spread of disaster risk in space and time, at whatever scale risk is observed. The configuration of disaster risk Disasters are often viewed as exogenous shocks that destroy and erode development gains. Disaster risk, however, is far from exogenous to development. It is configured over time through a complex interaction between development processes that generate conditions of exposure, vulnerability and hazard. Globally, disaster risk is increasing for most hazards, although the risk of economic loss is increasing far faster than the risk of mortality. For example, assuming constant hazard it is estimated that global flood mortality risk increased by 13% between 1990 and 2007, while economic loss risk increased by 33%. The main driver of this trend is rapidly increasing exposure. As countries develop, and both economic conditions and governance improve, vulnerability decreases but not sufficiently rapidly to compensate for the increase in exposure, particularly in the case of very rapidly growing low-income and low- to middle-income countries. When economic development stabilizes and slows down, the rate 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 6 Box 1.1: Components of disaster risk Exposure People and economic assets become concen- trated in areas exposed to severe hazards through processes such as population growth, migration, urbanization and economic development. This process operates over time, and risk in these areas therefore becomes more intensive, as more people and assets are exposed. Many hazard prone areas, such as coastlines, attract economic and urban development or offer significant economic benefits.

At the same time as risk becomes more intensive in some areas, it also spreads out exten- sively as cities expand into their hinterlands and as economic and urban development transform previously sparsely populated areas. Vulnerability and resilience The degree to which exposed people or economic assets are actually at risk is a function of their vulnerability. Vulnerability refers to a propensity or susceptibility to suffer loss and is associated with a range of physical, social, political, economic, cultural and institutional characterisitcs. For example, unsafe poorly built housing, schools, hospitals and lifeline infrastructure are characteristics of physical vulnerability. The difficulty faced by poor households without a car in evacuating New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina was a characteristic of both social and institutional vulnerability. Resilience refers to the capacity of people or economies to absorb loss and recover. Poor households often have low resilience to loss due to a lack of savings, reserves or insurance. However, social factors such as extended families and community networks increase resilience. Vulnerability is sometimes used in a wider sense to encompass the concept of resilience 6. Vulnerability and resilience also change over time. For example, if due to rapid urban growth an increasing proportion of a city\u2019s population lives in unsafe housing, vulnerability will increase; conversely, if more rural families have access to crop insurance, their resilience will increase. Hazards Patterns of geological hazard are mainly determined by the location of seismic fault lines, the presence of active volcanoes or tsunami-exposed coastlines and are relatively static. However, environmental change and urbanization are changing the magnitude, spatial distribution and frequency of floods, droughts, tropical cyclones, landslides and other weather-related hazards. The decline in the regulating services provided by many ecosystems has been observed in the 2005 Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 7 as a factor that increases flood and drought hazard. In urban areas flooding is often caused by a combination of more intense run-off during heavy rainfall events due to an increase in the built area; inadequate drainage; the disappearance of wetlands that traditionally absorbed and moderated peak flooding; and the encroachment of housing on floodplains. On a global scale the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has confirmed that climate change is now altering the predictability, intensity and geographical distribution of many weather-related hazards through increased intensity of the water cycle and other effects such as glacial melt and sea level rise. of increase in exposure may decelerate and be overtaken by reductions in vulnerability, leading to a lowering of risk. Extensive risk patterns, associated with weather-related hazards, are also expanding rapidly in the sample of low- and middle-income countries in Asia and Latin America examined in this Report. Part of this expansion can be explained by improved disaster reporting. Similarly, climate change is altering hazard patterns. However, the principal risk drivers are locally specific increases in exposure, vulnerability and hazard in the context of broader processes of urbanization, economic and territorial development, and ecosystem decline (see Box 1.1). 7 Chapter 1 The global challenge: disaster risk, poverty and climate change 7 P h i l i p p i n e S e a S u l u S e a S o u t h C h i n a S e a P h i l i p p i n e S e a S e a o f J a p a n 0 250 500 125 Kilometres N N Modelled mortality risk class 1 class 0 class 5 class 4 class 3 class 2 class 6 class 8 class 9 class 10 class 7 0 250 500 125 Kilometres 140\u00b0 E 140\u00b0 E 135\u00b0 E 135\u00b0 E 40\u00b0 N 40\u00b0 N 35\u00b0 N 35\u00b0 N 125\u00b0 E 125\u00b0 E 120\u00b0 E 120\u00b0 E 15\u00b0 N 15\u00b0 N 10\u00b0 N 10\u00b0 N 1.3 Figure 1.2: Mortality risk for tropical cyclones in two countries with similar exposure: Japan and the Philippines Note: Classes as defined in Box 2.2, p.21 Source: Cartography and geographic information system (GIS) analysis: UNEP/GRID-Europe 2008 The disaster risk\u2013poverty nexus The fact that disasters have a disproportionate impact on the poor in developing countries has been highlighted in research for at least 30 years 8.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c25bf06b-ac88-4300-a834-87adcd0fdf95": {"__data__": {"id_": "c25bf06b-ac88-4300-a834-87adcd0fdf95", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dfbd38d51ec46bfa93746ea7fe01f5d5e83fb8d5c82bce4e13f35de04a4d7b9f"}, "2": {"node_id": "fdc42f18-cae9-47c9-b7e2-0a3039943324", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "80887c5e4b46fcff3232de328420a4a73590b1f718125b6110229b9744e263f2"}}, "hash": "be2c27134ffc597c70738af5ebf14f71f1d5276b6884388dc7174cb34dcadb2b", "text": "The 2004 UNDP/Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery (BCPR) report Reducing Disaster Risk: a Challenge for Development 9 highlighted the fact that while only 11% of those exposed to hazards live in low human development countries, 53% of disaster mortality is concentrated in those countries.

For example, globally, high-income countries account for 39% of the exposure to tropical cyclones but only 1% of the mortality risk. Low- income countries represent 13% of the exposure but no less than 81% of the mortality risk. For example, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in Japan is US$ 31,267 com pared to US$ 5,137 in the Philippines, and Japan has a human development index of 0.953 compared to 0.771 in the Philippines 10. Japan also has about 1.4 times as many people exposed to tropical cyclones than the Philippines. However, if affected by a cyclone of the same magnitude, mortality in the Philippines would be 17 times higher than that in Japan (see Figure 1.2). Countries with small and vulnerable economies, such as many Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Land-Locked Developing Countries (LLDCs) not only suffer higher relative levels of economic loss, with respect to the size of their GDPs. They also have a particularly low resilience to loss, meaning that disaster losses can lead to major setbacks in economic development.

Case study evidence from particular cities also shows that both disaster occurrence and loss are associated with processes that increase the hazard exposure of the poor \u2013 for example, the expansion of informal settlements in hazard prone areas. Considerable empirical evidence from all regions shows that while disaster losses lead to measurable decreases in income, consumption and human development indicators, these effects are far more accentuated in poor households and communities. The evidence points to increases in the depth and breadth of poverty, long-term difficulties in recovery and very negative human development impacts in areas such as education and health, which also have long-term consequences. Interpreting the disaster\u2013risk poverty nexus At the global level, drivers such as economic development and urbanization, climate change and the strength or weakness of a range of endogenous capacities condition the landscape of both poverty and disaster risk in any given country. Figure 1.3 illustrates schematically some of the key interactions between disaster risk and poverty analysed in this Report. 1.4.1 The translation of poverty into disaster risk Poverty 11 and associated conditions of everyday risk underpin the configuration of patterns of extensive and intensive risk. In general, both the urban and rural poor face very high levels of everyday risk, associated with traffic and occupational accidents, malaria and health 9 Chapter 1 The global challenge: disaster risk, poverty and climate change 9 hazards associated with a lack of clean water, sanitation or pollution, crime, unemployment and underemployment, and other factors. For example, under-five mortality rates in many developing country cities are typically in a range of 80\u2013160 per thousand live births while in most developed country cities they are under 10 per thousand live births. A range of underlying risk drivers, such as poor urban governance, vulnerable rural livelihoods and declining ecosystems, contribute to the translation of poverty and every day risk into disaster risk, in a context of broader economic and political processes.

But at the same time it is the low institutional capacity of city governments to provide land and services to the poor that has led to a model of urban growth characterized by the expansion of informal settlements in hazard prone areas. At least 900 million people now live in informal settlements in developing country cities. Many of these are in hazard prone areas. Urban hazards, such as flooding, are exacerbated by lack of investment in infrastructure. Households live in structurally weak and badly built housing and with deficient infrastructure and services. Unsurprisingly, the urban poor often have high levels of disaster risk. In poor rural areas, poverty is translated into disaster risk through the vulnerability of rural livelihoods. A constrained access to productive land, technology, credit and other productive assets means that poor rural households are largely dependent on rain-fed agriculture for their livelihoods and subsistence, and thus are highly vulnerable to even small seasonal variations in weather. Difficulties in accessing markets, adverse trade policies and a lack of investment in infrastructure compound this vulnerability. In sub-Saharan Africa alone, 268 million people in rural areas live below a poverty line of US$ 1.25 per day. The absence of safe housing, infrastructure and public services in poor rural areas that could protect households from earthquakes, cyclones and major floods also increases mortality risk. In rural and urban areas, the disaster risk\u2013 poverty nexus is further fuelled by environmental degradation. The 2005 Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 12 highlighted significant declines in many key ecosystems. Natural ecosystems such as wetlands, forests, mangroves and watersheds fulfil an essential function in regulating the frequency and intensity of hazards, such as flooding and landslides. They also often provide important additional sources of income for the poor. When ecosystems decline, their capacity to provide these services decreases and both hazard and vulnerability increase. Poor communities in developing countries are usually disproportionately dependent on ecosystem services. According to the last UNEP Atlas over Africa 13, deforestation is one the most significant environmental issues in 35 African countries. In Cameroon alone, for example, 200,000 ha are deforested every year, as shown in Figure 1.4. 1.4.2 From disaster risk to poverty outcomes Poor households often have a very limited capacity to access and use assets in order to buffer disaster losses. These losses include both infrequently occurring major mortality, and economic loss from concentrations of intensive risk, as well as the lower intensity patterns of damage associated with the spread of extensive risk. The low resilience of the poor is further undermined by risk drivers, including weak or absent social protection measures and the low penetration of catastrophe insurance in most developing countries, which contribute to the translation of disaster impacts into poverty outcomes. While the losses associated with intensive risk often overwhelm household, local and even national coping capacities in poor countries, the more frequent and low-intensity losses associated with extensive risk undermine resilience over time. Both kinds of risk, therefore, have a critical influence. The resulting poverty outcomes include reductions in income and consumption as well as both short- and long-term negative impacts in human development, welfare and equality. As a consequence, following disasters economic 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 10 10 1.5 In El Salvador, the 2001 earthquakes killed more than 1,200 people, affected approximately 300,000 houses (or 32% of the stock) and caused US$ 1.6 billion in direct and indirect damage (12% of GDP in 2000). Between 2000 and 2002, average household income per capita actually increased in El Salvador, while extreme poverty rates fell from 33.8% to 26.6%. In poor rural households affected by the earthquakes, however, average household income per capita was reduced by approximately one third. Those most affected by the earthquakes suffered higher loss of housing, land, livestock, farm machinery and other physical capital, reducing their future earning capacity. Box 1.2: The impact of the 2001 El Salvador earthquakes on poverty14 Figure 1.4: Deforestation in Cameroon between 1973 and 2001 Source: UNEP DEWA, 2008 poverty may increase in incidence and depth, while welfare indicators of human development tend to decrease. But disasters do not make everyone poorer; their impact is highly unequal. Poor households tend to be far less resilient to loss than wealthier households, are pushed deeper into poverty, and have more difficulty recovering. Furthermore, disasters have long-term impacts (Box 1.2) on the poor, particularly on vulnerable groups like young children and women. While normally only the short-term impacts of disasters, such as mortality or direct economic loss are highlighted, disaster impacts may impair the long-term health,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e2140db3-82ff-41c8-8d20-425e808c14da": {"__data__": {"id_": "e2140db3-82ff-41c8-8d20-425e808c14da", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "35b3f7ef3a5a995808f29c89cc1b0db9ca72fa48365262bb0522924e6c140040"}}, "hash": "35b3f7ef3a5a995808f29c89cc1b0db9ca72fa48365262bb0522924e6c140040", "text": "human development and productivity of the poor, exacerbating chronic poverty. Global climate change Climate change is perhaps the greatest global outcome of environmental inequity, since it is driven by the emissions that have brought benefits to affluent individuals and societies yet most of the burdens fall on poorer individuals and societies, with developing countries and their poorest citizens being the most vulnerable15. The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report has emphasized that if the planet\u2019s surface temperature increases by 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, then a catastrophic collapse of ecosystems becomes possible with unforeseen, non-linear impacts on poverty and disaster risk16. The IPCC has also confirmed that the geographic 11 Chapter 1 The global challenge: disaster risk, poverty and climate change 11 1.6 distribution, frequency and intensity of these hazards are already being altered significantly by climate change 17. Changes are occurring in the amount, intensity, frequency and type of precipitation. This is associated with increases in the extent of the areas affected by drought, in the numbers of heavy daily precipitation events that lead to flooding, and increases in the intensity and duration of certain kinds of tropical storms. As outlined above, the concentration of disaster risk in poor communities in developing countries and the translation of disaster impacts into poverty outcomes are configured by drivers such as vulnerable rural livelihoods, poor urban governance, declining ecosystems and an absence of social protection. Unless those drivers are addressed the poor will continue to suffer disproportionately from disaster loss whether the climate changes or not. For example, it is estimated that the global population living in urban informal settlements, many of which are in hazard prone locations, is increasing by 25 million per year. This increase in itself is a key driver of disaster risk. However, climate change magnifies the interactions between disaster risk and poverty. On the one hand it magnifies weather-related and climatic hazards. On the other hand, it will decrease the resilience of many poor households and communities to absorb the impact and recover from disaster loss, due to factors such as decreases in agricultural productivity, increases in disease vectors and shortages of water and energy in many disaster prone regions. Climate change, therefore, is now a key global driver of disaster risk. Globally, disaster risk is increasing for weather-related hazards such as floods and tropical cyclones, even if hazard levels remain constant. Locally, the rapid expansion of weather- related extensive risk documented in this report is particularly dramatic. Even small increases in hazard levels due to climate change will have an enormous magnifying effect on disaster risk. Critically, these increases will magnify even further the uneven distribution of risk between wealthier and poorer countries and between the wealthy and the poor in those countries. For example, if mortality levels relative to hazard exposure to tropical cyclones are currently 200 times greater in low-income countries than in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, then the consequences of increasing cyclone severity due to climate change will also be unequally distributed. Climate change, therefore, will turbo-charge the disaster risk\u2013poverty nexus, drastically increasing disaster impacts on the poor and resulting poverty outcomes. Interlocked global risks Disaster risk is now widely recognized as an integral part of a wider constellation of risks related to food and energy insecurity, financial and economic instability, global climate change, environmental degradation, disease and epidemics, conflict and extreme poverty. Recent global reports by the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (UN HABITAT) 18 and UNEP 19 have stressed the threat posed by disaster risk in the urban and environmental sectors. Other reports by the United Nations Department for Social and Economic Affairs (UNDESA) 20 and by the World Economic Forum 21 have argued that different kinds of risk now form an interlocked system, implying that impacts in one sphere spill over into other areas, and that actions to reduce one risk may imply trade-offs in reducing others. The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report 22 in 2007 dispelled any remaining doubt that climate change is a catastrophic threat on a global scale. These interlinkages are becoming increasingly visible. In 2008, successive global crises hit the headlines as the prices of grain and energy sources fluctuated wildly and the global financial system threatened to collapse, 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 12 12 1.7 all in the context of ongoing concerns about global climate change, conflict, security and extreme poverty.

The way disaster risk is magnified by other kinds of global risk, and in turn feeds back into them, can be illustrated by a hypothetical but plausible example. If global climate change magnifies the severity of drought in a key grain producing region causing harvest failure, this could feed back into speculative increases in food prices. The most affected will not only be those living in the region but poor households in other parts of the world who spend a large proportion of their income on food. Faced with chronic food insecurity and with their resilience undermined by other hazards such as poor health or conflict, poor rural households may then migrate to urban areas. In many towns and cities across developing countries migration from rural areas is absorbed through the growth of informal settlements in areas prone to hazards such as floods. Flood risk in turn may also be further magnified by climate change. Other examples of the interlocked nature of risk include the increase of oil prices when hurricanes threaten the Gulf of Mexico at the same time as conflict threatens oil production in Nigeria. As the credit crisis in developed countries is pushing economies into recession, the construction boom in the Persian Gulf is faltering, leading to a decrease in remittances from migrant workers to relatives in the Indian sub-continent. This in turn may lead to decreasing economic resilience in poor households in that region, increased rural\u2013urban migration and subsequent increases in the population exposed to weather-related hazards in cities. The linkages between disaster risk, poverty and climate change, described above, form a particularly tightly interlocked group of global challenges, in which impacts in any one sphere spill over into the other two and which have to be addressed in a way that recognizes their inter-connectedness. Reducing disaster risk and poverty in a context of global climate change Globally, efforts to address climate change through reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption are of critical importance if potentially catastrophic increases in weather-related and climatic hazard are to be avoided in the future. In the meantime, existing hazard levels and increases that are taking place due to already committed climate change are essentially locked in to the disaster risk equation. Major concentrations of both people and economic assets exposed to hazard are similarly difficult to address given the economic advantages offered by many hazardous locations such as coastlines and fertile floodplains. Wealthier countries have lower risk levels than poorer countries. Economic growth may reduce poverty. But economic growth per se does not lead to reduced disaster risk: as economies grow, exposure tends to increase at a faster rate than vulnerability can decrease, particularly in economically dynamic low- and low-to-middle income countries. The principal opportunities, therefore, for reducing disaster risk are to be found in addressing the different factors that characterize a country\u2019s vulnerability and lack of resilience. This Report shows that by addressing the underlying risk drivers that translate poverty into disaster risk, such as poor urban governance, vulnerable rural livelihoods and ecosystem decline, it is possible to develop in a way that does not lead to increased risk. Similarly, by addressing 13 Chapter 1 The global challenge: disaster risk, poverty and climate change 13 Box 1.3: International commitments to addressing the disaster risk\u2013 poverty nexus In 1994, at the first World Conference on Disaster Reduction, the Yokohama Declaration and Plan of Action for a Safe World provided guidelines for national and international action on natural disaster prevention, preparedness and mitigation. Ten years later, in 2005, the HFA called for building the resilience of nations and communities to disasters. Other international declarations on poverty, social and sustainable development have also recognized the disaster risk\u2013development linkages. At the World Summit on Sustainable Develop- ment in Johannesburg in 2002 the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation23 stated: \u201cAn integrated, multi- hazard, inclusive approach to address vulnerability, risk assessment and disaster management, including prevention, mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery, is an essential element of a safer world in the twenty-first century.\u201d The formulation and adoption of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) was a watershed in mobil- izing international commitment to poverty reduction. While there was no specific MDG addressing disaster risk, many of the MDGs refer to actions that will address the underlying risk factors 24. Subsequently, developing countries have reaffirmed their commitment to reducing poverty through the achievement of the MDGs. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was signed in 1992.

The IPCC Fourth Assessment stressed that climate change will erode nations\u2019 capacities to achieve the MDGs, measured in terms of reduced poverty, particularly in Africa and parts of Asia 25. Subsequently, the Bali Action Plan 26 reaffirms that economic and social development and poverty eradication are global priorities. Bilateral agencies, such as the UK\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID) 27 and Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (German Technical Cooperation) (GTZ) 28, have recently produced policy statements that specifically address the disaster risk\u2013poverty nexus. The World Bank has recently also made climate change an important part of its policy agenda, by adopting a Strategic Framework for Development and Climate Change in October 2008. Major attention is given to climate risk management and adaptation, which is a top climate- related priority in most developing countries 29. the underlying risk drivers that translate disaster impacts into poverty outcomes, such as the lack of access to social protection and risk transfer, it is possible to ensure that continuing disaster losses do not feed back into worsening poverty. If these drivers are addressed then it is possible for even poor countries to reduce their vulnerability in a way that outweighs increases in exposure and hazard. Addressing these drivers, therefore, would not only contribute to reducing disaster risk \u2013 it would also contribute to poverty reduction. Importantly, it also offers the best opportunity to adapt to climate change. If disaster risk can be reduced, then the magnifying effect of climate change on risk will also diminish. In contrast, if these drivers are not addressed, disaster risk will continue to grow due to increasing hazard and exposure. If disaster risk continues to increase, it will seriously compromise efforts to reduce global poverty and countries with increasing disaster risk and poverty will be progressively less adapted to climate change. 1.7.1 Progress in disaster risk reduction In 2005, 168 member states of the United Nations agreed the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) that called for building the resilience of nations and communities to disasters with the objective of reducing disaster risk by 2015. As Box 1.3 indicates the HFA forms part of a growing number of international declarations, frameworks and agreements, which indicate both a recognition of the links between disaster risk reduction, poverty reduction and climate change, and a growing political commitment to address these issues. Interim national reports were completed by 62 countries in 2008, describing progress in achieving the strategic goals of the HFA. These indicate that many countries are making very good progress in developing institutional systems, legislation, policy and plans to improve disaster preparedness, and response and early warning. Due to such efforts, many low-income countries have dramatically reduced their mortality risk to hazards such as tropical cyclones and floods. 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 14 14 However, reported progress in addressing other underlying risk drivers is less encouraging. Many of the institutional and legislative systems created for disaster risk reduction have had little influence on development sectors, due to a lack of political authority and technical capacity, particularly in countries where much development is unregulated and occurs in the informal sector. Progress in addressing issues of social equity and gender through disaster risk reduction has been similarly elusive. Few countries have mechanisms in place to protect the most vulnerable social groups from the long term impacts of disaster on poverty and human development. Many Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) acknowledge the impact of disaster loss on poverty and a significant number include a section on disaster risk reduction. PRSPs and other poverty reduction instruments clearly have enormous potential to address the underlying risk drivers highlighted above. However, there is little evidence of real synergy between policies and strategies on poverty and disaster reduction, which may undermine the effectiveness of PRSPs as disaster risk reduction instruments. With respect to climate change adaptation, in some countries planning tools such as National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) have facilitated integration between disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. NAPAs focus on urgent and immediate adaptation needs, and disaster risk reduction provides a good entry point to immediately address climate-related risks. In general, however, the institutional frameworks for adaptation are also still largely divorced from those for disaster risk reduction, and are more focused on specific measures such as climate proofing infrastructure than on addressing the underlying risk drivers. Planning instruments, such as NAPAs, and funding mechanisms for adaptation have been created which offer tremendous potential.

Many of the tools and approaches required to address these drivers are already being successfully applied in many developing countries both at the local and sectoral levels. Successful cases abound of strengthened livelihoods reducing vulnerability, poverty and disaster risk in rural areas. Many cities have applied innovative methods to provide access to secure land tenure, infrastructure and services for the urban poor. Improvements in environmental management are demonstrating ways to simultaneously regulate hazard and support livelihoods. Examples of innovative financial mechanisms, such as index-based crop insurance, catastrophe pools and applications of microfinance and microinsurance are gaining momentum. In practice, many local initiatives to adapt to climate change also address the underlying risk drivers. Many of the above approaches build on community and local-level participation in a way that reduces costs, builds social capital and enhances the relevance and sustainability of investments. 1.7.3 The missing link To summarize, there is a growing international commitment to addressing disaster risk, poverty and climate change. At the national level good progress is being made in strengthening some disaster reduction capacities, particularly those associated with disaster preparedness, response and early warning. The fact that many low- income countries, from Bangladesh to Cuba, have been able to achieve quite dramatic reductions in mortality risk to some hazards is proof that progress is being made. Similarly, progress is being made in addressing the underlying risk drivers in many localities and sectors in developing countries, highlighting the effective approaches and tools that exist and are already being applied. 15 Chapter 1 The global challenge: disaster risk, poverty and climate change 15 1.8 There is, however, a gap between the international frameworks and commitments on the one hand, and local and sectoral good practice on the other. At both the international and national levels, the policy and strategy frameworks for disaster risk reduction, poverty reduction and climate change adaptation are not effectively integrated, are not focused on addressing the underlying risk drivers and are insufficiently articulated to and supportive of effective local and sectoral actions. This is the missing link that is holding back progress in addressing the disaster risk\u2013poverty nexus in the context of climate change. The way forward Given the urgency posed by climate change, a business as usual approach to disaster risk reduction, poverty reduction and climate change adaptation will not lead to the achievement of the HFA or the MDGs. On the contrary both disaster risk and poverty may be pushed to new, more extreme levels. This Report concludes that more drastic measures are required. Given the strong interlinkages between disaster risk, poverty and climate change, the principal recommendation of the Report is that countries need to adopt overarching policy and strategy frameworks for risk reduction, focused on addressing the underlying risk drivers described above, and supported by both resources and political authority. In risk prone countries, the implementation of such frameworks must be the key development priority of the state as a whole, rather than of a particular department or ministry. In practical terms, the adoption of an overarching policy framework for risk reduction should provide a vehicle for a closer integration of existing policy and strategy instruments such as PRSPs, NAPAs and action plans to implement the HFA, thus improving coherence and gaining synergy. In turn this will be facilitated if the plethora of planning, reporting and funding mechanisms at the international level is streamlined. It should also facilitate a more inclusive approach to addressing the underlying risk drivers that is supportive of the many local and sectoral initiatives already underway and that builds on innovative partnerships with civil society. This Report stresses that such partnerships are essential to ensure that risk reduction measures are appropriate, cost effective and sustainable. A further challenge is to incorporate innovations into the governance arrangements for disaster risk reduction that ensure that risk reduction considerations are factored into all investments to address the underlying risk factors. Illustrative good practices exist. Many governments have put in place striking innovations, for example, incorporating disaster risk reduction into national development plans and budgets; using cost\u2013benefit analysis to factor disaster risk reduction into public investment systems; creating harmonized platforms for hazard and risk information to support decision-making; or addressing the issue of accountability and enforcement. Enhancing policy and governance in this way can defuse the disaster\u2013risk poverty nexus and facilitate climate change adaptation. At the same time it can be cost effective.

Disbursement on humanitarian aid in 2007 was more than US$ 120 billion 31. Other estimates indicate that international assistance for recovery and reconstruction only covers 10% of the real costs. These amounts are high and becoming unsustainable, diverting resources that could have been used for poverty reduction and development. Data put together for the Millennium Project 32 provides an indicative estimate of some of the costs required to address the 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 16 16 underlying factors that underpin disaster risk. Some of these costs can be drastically reduced by adopting participatory approaches to project and programme implementation but there is no getting round the fact that several hundred billion dollars are required. Incorporating risk reduction measures into such investments is usually seen as an additional cost. However, many investments in disaster risk reduction produce benefits in terms of reduced future losses and avoided reconstruction that considerably outweigh the costs, even without accounting for indirect benefits to health, human development and productivity. Innovative ways of financing risk reduction, through mechanisms such as catastrophe pools and payment for ecosystem services, can reduce the costs and enhance the benefits further still. In other words, it costs far less to avoid the configuration of risk in the first place than to correct it once it exists, or to compensate for it once it is realized. For example, it is generally cheaper and easier to correct newly arising extensive risk than major historical concentrations of intensive risk. The emphasis of policy therefore should be on factoring disaster risk reduction considerations into new development and during periodic renewal or upgrading of building stock and infrastructure, which provides opportunities to reduce risks. Similar opportunities arise in recovery and reconstruction after old concentrations of risk have been swept away in a disaster. Seen in this way investment in disaster risk reduction is actually a way of dramatically reducing the cost of achieving the MDGs and of adapting to climate change. Resources are also required to build the capacities necessary to put in place the policy and governance frameworks that can allow the investment described above to be organized, coordinated and sustained. As described above this is essential if future growth is not to lead to increasing risk. However, the major investment required now is political rather than financial. It is hoped that the evidence presented in this Report contributes to building that political capital.

The analysis presented in this chapter, developed by a large, interdisciplinary group of researchers from around the world, makes global disaster risk more visible \u2013 a key step towards mobilizing the political and economic commitment needed to reduce it. Given the growing influence of climate change, the centrepiece of this chapter is an analysis of the mortality and economic loss 4 risk for three weather-related hazards: tropical cyclones, floods and landslides. In addition new insights have been gained into other hazards such as earthquakes, tsunami and drought. Summary of findings 1. Risk concentration Disaster risk is geographically highly concentrated. A very small portion of the Earth\u2019s surface contains most of the risk and most future large-scale disasters will occur in these areas. Risk will increase further if exposure continues to increase, for example in tropical cyclone prone coastal cities. 2. The uneven distribution of risk Disaster risk is very unevenly distributed. Hazards affect both poorer and richer countries. For example, tropical cyclones hit both Japan and Bangladesh. Severe earthquakes occur in the United States and in India. However, for hazards of a similar severity, countries with higher incomes and, importantly, higher human development levels generally experience lower mortality and smaller losses when measured against the country\u2019s total wealth. In absolute terms economic losses are higher in richer countries, but less so once they are seen as a share of overall wealth. 3. Risk drivers In addition to hazard severity and exposure a range of other risk drivers related to economic and social development play a crucial role in the configuration of disaster risk. These include not only income and economic strength, but also governance factors such as the quality of institutions, openness and government accountability. Income is a driver in its own right, but also conditions other drivers. Wealthier countries tend to have better institutions, more effective early-warning, and disaster preparedness and response systems, and more open government that tends to be more supportive of disaster risk reduction. 4. Disaster risk is increasing Risk levels for most of the hazards are increasing over time, even assuming constant hazard frequency and severity. Economic loss risk is increasing faster than mortality risk. These increases in risk are being driven by the growing exposure of people and assets, for example through rapid economic and urban growth in cyclone prone coastal areas and earthquake prone cities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a4bd894d-83bb-4dfe-8f96-f3f56caeb9e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4bd894d-83bb-4dfe-8f96-f3f56caeb9e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a05889c13fc9a4cace7ebbe402d959e81ace49d6c3d3f733e9e01b6febaa2efa"}, "2": {"node_id": "def19c25-8815-41e1-9835-6592e3cc934c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2bdb1d45f9a303e5f596371536d49f4a5e9db2b68bb43f4d862610229e1c8d12"}}, "hash": "e806f08581e76c4b36b3e53ffddce4439cc84705e14ca82ff630b680c23d4378", "text": "Vulnerability decreases as countries develop, but not enough to compensate for the increase in exposure. 5. Climate change Weather-related hazard is critically important in the configuration of global risk patterns.

Changes are already occurring in the amount, intensity, frequency and type of precipitation. This is associated with increases in the extent of the areas 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 20 20 affected by drought, in the numbers of heavy daily precipitation events that lead to flooding, and increases in the intensity and duration of certain kinds of tropical storms. Individual events, such as recent large tropical cyclones in the United States and Myanmar, cannot be attributed to climate change. However, given the concentration and uneven distribution of risk described above, the impact of any increases in weather-related hazard will be highly asymmetric. Poorer countries that concentrate most existing risk will be disproportionately affected by climate change. 6. Economic resilience, vulnerability and development constraints A group of developing countries, including many SIDS, LLDCs and others with small and weak economies are particularly vulnerable to economic loss, have low resilience to that loss and are particularly exposed to climate change. Disaster impacts compromise their prospects for economic growth, poverty reduction and development at large, to the extent that the capacity of the most vulnerable countries to benefit from their insertion in the global economy is severely constrained.

This permits event-level analysis of the influence of exposure, vulnerability and hazard severity and the imputation of disaster losses for events for which no loss data were recorded. \ufffdIncorporation of new global data sets on \ufffd social, economic and other vulnerability factors, such as governance and corruption. Box 2.1: Innovations in data and methodology 2.1 Improvements in methodology and data now enable a much more accurate characterization of disaster risk than was possible when compre- hensive global assessments were published by the UNDP and the World Bank 8 five years ago. Several factors have contributed to these improve- ments, outlined in Box 2.1. Following the basic risk model that guides this Report (Box 1.1), disaster risk for a given location is determined by the probability that a hazard event of a given magnitude will occur, the number of exposed people or the value of exposed assets, and the level of vulnerability. The latter refers to characteristics of the exposed population, public infrastructure and economic assets that increase or decrease the likelihood of damages when a hazard event occurs, as well as factors such as effective governance and higher levels of social coherence, which influence and condition those characteristics. Analysing the mortality and economic loss experienced in past disasters permits an assessment to be made of the role played by each of the three main risk factors \u2013 hazard event characteristics, exposure and vulnerability \u2013 in configuring risk. With data for each of these risk factors for many individual disaster events, their relative importance can be statistically analysed. For instance, controlling for the magnitude of a tropical cyclone and the size of the population or economy in the affected area, it is possible to measure how vulnerability factors (such as a country\u2019s institutional quality) affect mortality or the size of economic losses. Box 2.2 presents the methodology that was followed for each hazard type. 21 Chapter 2 Global disaster risk: patterns, trends and drivers 21 While understanding of disaster risk has increased steadily, data limitations combined with the unpredictable and unique nature of hazard mean that much uncertainty remains. Rapid increases in vulnerability and in the exposure of population and economic assets, as well as the possibility of shifting climatic conditions affecting hazard location, frequency or magnitude, imply that risk cannot be modelled deterministically. Despite improvements in disaster reporting, loss information for individual events is incomplete and suffers from inconsistent measurement of damages and broader losses, particularly in the case of economic losses. Box 2.3 illustrates the difficulties in obtaining Box 2.2: Risk analysis procedure The application of the risk model involved the following steps for each hazard type: 1. Compile geographical and physical information on specific hazard events such as tropical cyclone track data, areas of flood extent, or earthquake location and magnitude. 2.

See Figures 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3. 3. For each impact area, compute exposure as the number of people and economic assets within that area. 4. Link available loss information for each hazard event (sourced from EMDAT) to the hazard event information (hazard severity and exposure). 5. Add information on vulnerability. Since global data on direct vulnerability factors such as building quality are unavailable, this analysis uses country-level indicators for the year in which the event occurred, such as government accountability or per capita income. 6. Estimate empirical loss functions that relate event mortality or economic losses to risk factors (hazard characteristics, exposure and vulnerability) using statistical regression techniques. 7. Derive an estimate of expected average annual losses and exposure. The estimated loss functions are used to impute disaster outcomes for all recorded events, whether or not a loss estimate is available in EMDAT or not. This is done using data on exposure and vulnerability for 2007 such that annualized average estimates reflect current conditions. 8. Apply estimates to all pixels in a geographic grid. The loss estimates are aggregated at different levels (1 km x 1 km cells; sub-national administrative areas; countries) allowing the identification of geographic concentrations of risk. Mortality risk is classed in deciles using a logarithmic index with values ranging from 1 = negligible to 10 = extreme risk (see below). Economic loss risk is calculated for World Bank regions and country income groups. accurate data. While disaster mortality data are considered to be better recorded and more robust than economic loss data, uncertainties still exist. Sub-national data on the exposure of economic assets and vulnerability factors are scarce or non-existent, meaning that proxies have to be used. Higher resolution data on disaster impacts that capture smaller-scale events and locally specific hazards are not globally available. Steady improvements in data collection will address these shortcomings and national data collection efforts will filter up to provide better global information, but these processes will take time.

This means that if the models in this analysis predict an annual average of 1,000 people killed by a given hazard type globally, there could be one event killing 10,000 people followed by 9 years of almost no casualties. A number of hazard types have been left out or covered less comprehensively in this global analysis. Most importantly, although new indicators of drought occurrence have been developed and are discussed, the analysis did not yield sufficiently accurate estimates of global risk. This is a significant gap especially for sub- Saharan Africa, where drought is a major hazard facing rural populations. As a slow onset hazard, drought impacts are very different from those in sudden impact disasters such as earthquakes or storms.

After a forensic investiga- tion into the deaths occurred in Vargas state, Altez documented a total of only 521 corpses attributed to the disaster, including 290 that had never been identified. In addition only 331 people had been reported missing. Given the likelihood that some of those reported missing were amongst the 290 unidentified corpses, Altez concluded that \u201cthe total number of deaths does not exceed 700\u201d.

The key message from Altez\u2019s study is that there are still major deficiencies in the way corpses are dealt with after many large natural disasters around the world, with documented cases of mass cremations and burials without an adequate proc- ess of identification or even quantification of the victims, often due to unjustified fear of epidemics. While the Venezuelan case may be unique, it does highlight the need for a critical approach when dealing with disaster mortality data. Box 2.3: Disaster mortality data \u2013 when the dead go missing and economic consequences do not, in fact, show recorded mortality in international disaster databases 12. The Report looks briefly at forest and other biomass fires, which account for a mere 0.1% of the fatalities recorded in EMDAT, but have major impacts on climate change, deforestation, soil productivity and biodiversity. This hazard is both exacerbated by and influences climate change, and is the second largest source of human-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Given these limitations and uncertainties the estimates of exposure and risk provided can only be taken as indicative. They do not describe and cannot predict disaster risk in specific locations. As such, while many of the results can be displayed at quite high geographic resolutions, these should not be used for planning or decision making at the national or local levels. The purpose of this global risk analysis is to decipher global patterns and trends in risk and it does not and cannot substitute for detailed national and local-level risk assessments. 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 26 26 Weather-related disaster risk 2.2.1 Tropical cyclones Tropical cyclones, also called typhoons and hurricanes, are powerful storms generated over tropical or sub-tropical waters. They have multiple impacts including extremely strong winds, torrential rains leading to floods or landslides, high waves and damaging storm surge, leading to extensive coastal flooding. Tropical cyclone risk has been modelled using the procedure described in Box 2.2 and further elaborated in Appendix 1. Disaster risk for tropical cyclones has been calculated taking into account hazard associated with both wind speed and storm surge for different categories of cyclones on the Saffir\u2013 Simpson scale. Figure 2.4 shows the geographic distribution of mortality risk for 10 km \u00d7 10 km squares in Asia, Africa and the Americas. Figure 2.5 shows the distribution of both absolute and relative mortality risk from all categories of tropical cyclones aggregated at the country level. Absolute risk is the average annual expected mortality; relative risk describes the average annual expected number of deaths as a proportion of national population. The statistical level of confidence in the model is good, particularly for Category 4 and 5 cyclones 13. However, these are average annual estimates and cannot be used to predict specific events. The top ten countries on the Mortality Risk Index and their respective values are Bangladesh (8.5), the Philippines (6.5), India (6), Madagascar (6), the Dominican Republic (6), Haiti (6), Myanmar (5.5), Vanuatu (5.5), Mozambique (5) and Fiji (5). Geographically, tropical cyclone mortality risk is highly concentrated. For example, 75.5% of the expected mortality is concentrated in Bangladesh and 10.8% in India. There are also large differences in risk between different groups of countries. Relative mortality risk is approximately 200 times higher in low- 2.2 income countries than in OECD countries and approximately 30 times greater in low human development countries than in high human development countries. Economic loss risk due to tropical cyclones can be estimated using a model similar to that for mortality. However, the results tend to be less reliable because loss estimates are available for fewer events. There are also difficulties in defining and estimating losses, and there is an incentive to exaggerate damages in anticipation of greater external support. Because of these data constraints this chapter reports economic loss risk aggregated by broad regions and categories of countries. As Table 2.1 shows, OECD countries including those prone to tropical cyclones such as Japan, the United States of America and Australia, account for almost 70% of estimated annual economic losses in absolute terms, followed by East Asia and the Pacific, and Latin America and the Caribbean. Sub-Saharan African countries, such as Madagascar and Mozambique, suffer the highest relative economic loss risk as a proportion of the size of the affected economy. Across all regions, estimated economic losses are highly concentrated in a few countries. The top five countries account for 80% of all estimated losses, with the remainder spread", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3ec62265-1fe4-4405-8731-f7428c214613": {"__data__": {"id_": "3ec62265-1fe4-4405-8731-f7428c214613", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "53a35115a6e072d4dd9c160cf2168eda3b181adedfc5d2fc47b96b6f79da9555"}, "3": {"node_id": "8d7a567e-ad33-4e9e-ac99-a818550e2a42", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b3a249f00cf9fc5589568801417ab0ea103b540a19159355eea41c5af97b0bfe"}}, "hash": "5009e83d71325fc49758664460a6338ec444b4b1971aef4d7ad6fcae9b0830c7", "text": "over more than 50 countries and areas.

Today there is still no scientific agreement on the cause of the Catarina cyclone, but it provides a clear demonstration that unexpected events can occur in places where they have not happened before. Longer-term changes in the Earth\u2019s oceans and atmosphere may bring more such surprises. Table 2.2 shows the number of people and GDP exposed to tropical cyclones and related storm surge hazards, for different tropical cyclone categories. An average of 78 million people world wide are exposed each year to tropical cyclone wind hazard and a further 1.6 million to storm surge. Asian countries have the largest absolute population exposed, while SIDS have the highest proportion of their population exposed. In particular, SIDS have a far greater relative exposure to highly destructive Category 3 and 4 storms than larger countries. Some countries, such as the Philippines have a very high absolute and relative exposure. In terms of economic exposure, an annual average of US$ 1,284 billion of GDP is exposed to tropical cyclones. The country with the highest absolute exposure is Japan. The countries with the highest relative exposure, however, are almost all SIDS. The strength of a tropical cyclone and the number of people or exposed economic assets in the area affected explain a large part of the risk (see Figures 2.7, 2.8 and 2.9). However, even for comparable storms and exposure, large differences persist between countries (also see Box 2.4 for unexpected events). 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 30 30 Cyclone category Annual population exposure (millions) Annual GDP exposure (US$ millions) Category 1: Winds (Km/hour) 118\u2013153, Surge: less than 2 m 57.8 942,300 Category 2: Winds (Km/hour) 154\u2013177, Surge: 2\u20133 m 13.5 229,025 Category 3: Winds (Km/hour) 178\u2013210, Surge: 3\u20134 m 5.5 100,684 Category 4: Winds (Km/hour) 211\u2013249, Surge: 4\u20135 m 0.8 11,623 Category 5: Winds (Km/hour) more than 249, Surge 5\u201310 m 0.2 824 Total 77.7 1,284,456 Table 2.2: Annual exposure to tropical cyclones by classes of intensity (Saffir\u2013 Simpson)* Source: Adapted from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Hurricane Center (NHC) 17 * Modelled Figure 2.8: People exposed to storm surge for all categories of tropical cyclone 50 000 100 000 150 000 200 000 250 000 300 000 350 000 400 000 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 3.87 Bahamas Cayman Islands Mozambique Fiji Cuba Haiti Jamaica Hong Kong Madagascar Puerto Rico Dominican Republic Viet Nam Philippines Mexico United States of America Taiwan, province of China India China Bangladesh Myanmar Bangladesh Anguilla Guadeloupe Fiji Martinique Netherlands Antilles Tonga United States Virgin Islands Bermuda Puerto Rico Bahamas New Caledonia Antigua and Barbuda Saint Kitts and Nevis Belize Saint Pierre et Miquelon Jamaica Turks and Caicos islands Taiwan, province of China Cayman Islands Absolute: people exposed per year Relative: people exposed per year, percentage Figure 2.7: People exposed to tropical cyclones (wind speed categories) Japan Philippines China India Taiwan, province of China Bangladesh United States of America Republic of Korea Madagascar Viet Nam Myanmar Mexico Dominican Republic Cuba Hong Kong, special admin.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "28ec6301-f34c-4ee2-bc45-62cd2bcbb585": {"__data__": {"id_": "28ec6301-f34c-4ee2-bc45-62cd2bcbb585", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "97f8dfa44a2f3d138064fd2923e7441d40d8f96ef1f103ca76124e3e3a619f8e"}, "2": {"node_id": "9a93f03e-6336-4956-8fb8-f8b57f22d006", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6badac2efecd18f939c07991de464558a884a53828314e2fe909dff1e383ed4e"}}, "hash": "7a64545ec8e7f4f9702d4886a9ba866afdbc0c949138b7dfb79098dfb8fd0910", "text": "region of China Puerto Rico Pakistan Jamaica Haiti Mauritius Guam Northern Mariana Islands Taiwan, province of China Montserrat Mauritius Philippines Japan Samoa British Virgin Islands Fiji United States Virgin Islands Vanuatu New Caledonia Anguilla Cayman Islands R\u00e9union Bahamas Niue Saint Kitts and Nevis Jamaica 4 5 3 2 1 Tropical cyclones Saffir\u2013Simpson categories Absolute: people exposed per year Relative: people exposed per year, percentage 5 000 000 10 000 000 15 000 000 20 000 000 25 000 000 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 31 Chapter 2 Global disaster risk: patterns, trends and drivers 31 Figure 2.10 shows that in general, low- income countries are far more likely to suffer mortality for a given number of people exposed and, in particular, for powerful Category 3 and 4 tropical cyclones.

As exposure increases and income decreases there is a greater risk of tropical cyclone mortality. Areas that are remote with respect to the main administrative and economic centre of the country, tend to suffer more. The case of tropical cyclone Nargis in Myanmar in 2008 is an example. Densely populated, very poor remote rural areas were devastated by a Category 4 tropical cyclone and associated storm surge. In the case of economic losses, well- governed countries seem to experience lower damages in comparable tropical cyclones with similar magnitude and exposure, than poorly governed countries. In contrast, income inequality is associated with higher levels of damage. To illustrate the effect of these variables, the economic risk model suggests that if Bangladesh had the significantly higher institutional quality and lower levels of inequality found in Japan, its annual economic loss from tropical cyclones could be about 60% lower, even if exposure and hazard severity remained unchanged. Finally, even after controlling for popula- tion size, SIDS generally experience greater economic losses. 2.2.2 Floods Disaster risk for floods has been calculated for large rural flood events. The risk calculations do not include flash floods or urban flooding from inadequate drainage. Figure 2.11 shows the geographic distribution of mortality risk for 10 km \u00d7 10 km squares of the Earth\u2019s surface. Figure 2.12 shows the distribution of both absolute and relative mortality risk for floods aggregated at the country level. As with cyclones, absolute risk is the average annual expected mortality, while relative risk is measured as the average annual expected number of deaths as a proportion of national population. The geographical distribution of flood mortality risk mirrors that for exposure. It is heavily concentrated in Asia, especially in India, Bangladesh and China. Between them these countries concentrate 75% of the modelled annual global mortality. Viet Nam also has high absolute and relative flood risks. The top ten countries on the Mortality Risk Index for floods and their respective values are India (7.5), Bangladesh (6.5), China (6), Viet Nam(6), Figure 2.9: GDP exposed to tropical cyclones 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 Japan United States of America Taiwan, province of China Republic of Korea China Philippines Hong Kong, special admin. region of China Puerto Rico India Mexico Guam Dominican Republic Bangladesh Cuba Jamaica R\u00e9union Mauritius Guadeloupe Northern Mariana Islands United States Virgin Islands Guam Northern Mariana Islands Taiwan, province of China Vanuatu Mauritius Philippines Japan Fiji British Virgin Islands United States Virgin Islands New Caledonia Samoa Saint Kitts and Nevis Bahamas Antigua and Barbuda R\u00e9union Montserrat Cayman Islands Anguilla Madagascar 4 5 3 2 1 Tropical cyclones Saffir\u2013Simpson categories Absolute: GDP exposed per year, billion US$ Relative: GDP exposed per year, percentage 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 32 32 Figure 2.10: Mortality and economic loss from tropical cyclones compared to exposure for income classes Modelled economic loss from tropical cyclones per year 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 All Saffir\u2013Simpson categories 74.1 % 5.9 % 16.8 % 3.1 % Economic exposure to tropical cyclones Billion US$ per year 10-8 10-7 10-6 10-5 10-4 10-3 10-2 0.1 1 10 100 1 000 All Saffir\u2013Simpson categories S.

By far the largest economic losses in relation to the size of economies occur in South Asia, followed by sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia. The ratio of losses to GDP exposure in the OECD countries is far higher than in Latin America and the Caribbean, or South Asia.

The effect of a country\u2019s wealth is much less pronounced for floods than for other disaster types. While mortality is concentrated in developing countries, significant economic damages from floods also occur regularly in North America and Central Europe, for instance.

landslides triggered by earthquakes. The risk model therefore focuses on precipitation triggered landslides (Fig. 2.17). Exposure, however, has been calculated for both kinds of landslide. Figure 2.18 shows absolute and relative mortality risk for precipitation triggered landslides. Countries with very high absolute and relative risk include Guatemala, Nepal and Papua New Guinea. Compared to other hazards, global landslide mortality risk is relatively low, although many small landslide events causing deaths are not internationally reported. The predicted mortality risk, even in very large countries such as India or China, is less than 100 deaths per year.

In absolute terms, exposure is very high in a number of large Asian countries, especially India, Indonesia and China. Relative exposure is highest in small countries with steep terrain including a number of small island nations. The relative importance of the triggering mechanism varies widely among countries. Taiwan, Province of China, has the highest absolute GDP, as well as the highest relative GDP exposure, both due to earthquake triggered landslides. As illustrated in Figure 2.21, lower- middle income countries in general experience greater mortality with respect to the population exposed. This is confirmed by the identification of vulnerability factors. Precipitation triggered landslide mortality is best explained by the exposure of the population and by local GDP per capita. As in the case of tropical cyclones, poor countries have significantly more landslide mortality than wealthier countries.

State of) Risk classes 9 10 8 7 6 4 5 3 2 1 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 42 42 suggests that 86% of mortality risk is manifested in disasters with more than 10,000 fatalities. This is consistent with the observed losses. Of the 246,200 people killed by earthquakes over the last ten years 20, 226,000 (91.8%) were killed in just five mega-disasters 21. The top ten countries on the Mortality Risk Index for earthquakes and their respective values are China (8.5), India (8.5), Indonesia (8.5), Colombia (8.5), Myanmar (8.5), Guatemala (8), Pakistan (7.5), Afghanistan (7.5), Iran (7.5) and Peru (7.5). Table 2.5 shows the modelled economic losses from earthquakes. OECD countries account for 58% of the modelled annual total losses. East Asia also has high absolute modelled economic losses, followed by Latin America and the Caribbean. Relative to GDP, modelled losses are most significant in the Middle East and North Africa region, followed by Eastern Europe and Central Asia. The vulnerability of economic infrastructure appears to be much higher in both Asia and the Pacific, and Eastern Europe and Central Asia, than elsewhere. The ratio of modelled damages to exposed GDP is between 8 and 10 times greater in these two regions than in OECD countries. Risk drivers and vulnerability factors Earthquake hazard is shown for each region in the regional multi-hazard maps presented in Figures 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3. Figure 2.24 shows the number of people exposed to each category of earthquake hazard. More than one hundred million people worldwide (103.2 million) are exposed to an average of 144 earthquake events per year, with intensities higher than V on the MMI scale. As with other hazard types, absolute exposure is concentrated in large countries, particularly in Asia, but also in the United States of America and parts of Latin America. Relative exposure is higher in smaller countries. Figure 2.25 shows that exposure is higher in lower middle-income countries than in all other income classes. However, altogether, 85.3% of mortality risk is concentrated in lower middle-income countries. Upper middle and high-income countries concentrate only 1.7% and 0.9% of the risk respectively. This means that the countries with the highest human vulnerability are lower middle-income countries. Both low- and high-income countries have relatively lower levels of vulnerability.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "02285c94-98d9-4325-a21c-c5a6eed4a591": {"__data__": {"id_": "02285c94-98d9-4325-a21c-c5a6eed4a591", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d2d7a2fd89cdc04debb5aa1763eb55f7594dfbcf5687b3f4ef53265e8f9b5d2e"}, "2": {"node_id": "eb634515-e84c-4e75-99f9-f68aa5bac7ac", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "641ad63fee19937f5ce0f30218c51c945d89326f860b1a9195ff98f7ad5851ff"}}, "hash": "f96ccd01b1977362e2b515ca2273bbdc4bbde32ef74bcd76f0873fb488b2ad1c", "text": "Both low- and high-income countries have relatively lower levels of vulnerability.

that have not yet put in place planning and regulatory frameworks capable of factoring disaster risk reduction considerations into urban development. Structural collapse of buildings is more frequent in countries with fast rates of urbanization and weak enforcement of building codes, especially where informal construction is prevalent. Some low-income countries have yet to urbanize sufficiently to increase their earthquake risk. High-income countries on the other hand have been able to regulate development through tools such as building codes and land-use zoning and have invested in retro-fitting buildings to withstand strong shaking. Examination of the risk drivers associated with earthquake damage reinforces these findings. Earthquake mortality for all categories is correlated positively with exposure and, in the case of Category 1 and 3 earthquakes, negatively with GDP per capita. In the case of Category 2 earthquakes, mortality was correlated with rapid urban growth 22, while Category 4 earthquakes mortality was negatively correlated with voice and accountability. Typically, therefore, poorer countries with high exposure, rapid urban growth and weaker governance have the highest mortality. In the case of economic loss risk, richer countries have higher absolute, and poorer countries greater relative, damages from earthquakes. A country with a GDP of US$ 20,000 per capita would experience 2.3 times the absolute economic losses of a country with a GDP of US$ 2,500 per capita 23. But relative to GDP, economic losses in the rich country would be only 43% of those in the poorer country. Institutional quality as measured by voice and accountability, and government effectiveness were also identified as relevant to economic loss risk. The model suggests that a country with average per capita income and the highest score in the voice and accountability indicator would experience only a quarter of the economic losses from a Category 4 earthquake than a country with the lowest institutional quality. This provides further evidence that earthquake loss risk is strongly associated with the quality of urban governance, and in particular with the lack of regulation of urban development and the ineffectiveness of building codes. 2.3.2 Drought Drought differs from other hazard types in several ways.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "98c524ad-a7b0-42ea-8244-282a3328d66a": {"__data__": {"id_": "98c524ad-a7b0-42ea-8244-282a3328d66a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3839ca2d0e0b8423207fa3265d1d8df9500058de354144983dd0d935352aca54"}, "2": {"node_id": "75a984e8-2973-4eee-b9f7-1628eb5f6105", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6f8bf9b7e20eba386527ba4f6d31942b22bca01b4cee47d5ba2c3d3de194b713"}}, "hash": "79f6441dc4920a3578d245e9f9b199d5026e36fe7e06d9fc70797ba06ce05b4e", "text": "2.3.2 Drought Drought differs from other hazard types in several ways.

Drought ultimately represents a condition of insufficient water supply relative to demand, both being highly location specific. For example, a few months of deficient rainfall may adversely affect rain-fed agriculture but not a reservoir system with substantial storage capacity, and defining what constitutes \u2018deficient\u2019 precipitation depends on the local climate. Scientists therefore distinguish between three general categories of drought: meteorological, agricultural and hydrologic. Meteorological drought refers to a prolonged period of deficient precipitation, while agricultural drought occurs when soil moisture is depleted to the point where crops, pastures or rangelands are impacted. Hydrologic drought refers to a prolonged period with below-average water levels in rivers and streams, lakes and reservoirs, or groundwater. Drought also differs from other hazard types in the way losses are incurred. Few droughts lead directly to mortality. Those that do cause mortality have generally occurred during a political crisis or civil conflict where aid could not reach the affected population. In these cases the mortality should more properly be attributed to the conflict than to the drought. Impacts might also be highest even after the meteorological drought event has ended, for instance when people have exhausted their food supplies long before the next harvest. Overall, the unique characteristics of drought make it difficult to analyse vulnerability and risk in the same framework as the other 45 Chapter 2 Global disaster risk: patterns, trends and drivers 45 hazard types. Available loss data sets do not provide information on the factors contributing indirectly to drought mortality, while mortality itself is not a good indicator of impact. Similarly, there is also no clear way to translate meteorological drought into agricultural drought since it depends on the farming system and even on individual crop choice. Specific risk and vulnerability to droughts and how they affect income, consumption, health, human development and productivity are therefore best analysed in detailed local and context specific studies (see Chapter 3) 24. Given the varying impacts of drought, several drought indicators are in use around the globe. These include the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the coefficient of variation (CV) 25. Drought intensity and frequency are captured by the SPI. The CV gives additional information since it is a summary measure of how large the variability of precipitation is from year-to-year, relative to the amount of mean annual rainfall. The CV tends to be high in semi-arid regions, where there tends to be both high variability of rainfall and a small mean annual rainfall. In Figures 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 drought hazard was calculated by multiplying the SPI-defined drought event frequency by the CV therefore combining drought intensity, frequency and information on where interannual precipitation variability is high or low (Fig. 2.26). Approximately 400 geo-referenced drought disasters recorded in EMDAT were also compared with various SPI drought indicators. The EMDAT disasters were best matched with severe droughts identified using a SPI indicator for six-month total precipitation. This is consistent with the observation that the majority of EMDAT drought disasters are in tropical areas that experience a distinct rainy season with a typical duration of six months or less. Again, the drought indicator showing the best correspondence with EMDAT disasters (or other impacts) may vary locally. Drought Exposure Figures 2.27 and 2.28 show the number of people and areas of crops exposed to drought hazard as measured by the six month SPI. In terms of relative exposure, sub-Saharan African countries are highly exposed in both categories. For the reasons explained above, exposure does not necessarily indicate a risk of mortality, crop or economic loss.

Tsunamis slow down as they approach the shoreline but their height increases. Because of their relatively large wavelength, tsunamis may travel far inland, and because of their relatively short wave period, they cause flooding faster than tidal waves and storm surges. Their enormous capacity to erode the landscape and destroy buildings makes them highly destructive both in terms of mortality and economic loss. The Indian Ocean tsunami is estimated to have caused 47 Chapter 2 Global disaster risk: patterns, trends and drivers 47 210,000 deaths and more than US$ 10 billion in damages. Figure 2.29 shows the distribution of tsunami hazard globally. Large and infrequent, but highly destructive tsunami events generally pose greater mortality risk than the cumulative effect of smaller and more frequent events.

Chile, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Peru, the Solomon Islands, Portugal, Tonga, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea and the Philippines all have particularly high levels of hazard, given that tsunamis could hit the shoreline in less than 15 minutes with wave heights in excess of 6 metres. It is important to emphasize once again that hazard is modelled with a 10% probability of occurrence every 50 years, or in other words, a 500-year return period. Similarly, the actual tsunami hazard in any particular area in these countries depends on local topography, bathymetry and other factors. For example, while the Philippines could be subject to wave heights of up to 16 metres hitting the shoreline in only 9 minutes, Figure 2.32 shows that the most severe impact zones are outside of the city of Manila. 2.3.4 Forest and other biomass fires According to a recent inventory 26 wild land fires and other biomass fires annually burn a total land area of between 3.5 and 4.5 million km2, equivalent to the surface area of India and Pakistan together, or more than half of Australia. This makes it makes it one of the most spatially prevalent hazards after drought. Emissions from biomass burning inject pollutants into the atmosphere, as well as GHGs. The IPCC attributes 17.3% of total anthropogenic emissions to biomass burning27, making it the second largest source of GHGs from human activities after the burning of fossil fuel. However, this figure may in reality be even higher, as it is based on pre-2000 data. Biomass fire is the only hazard that has both an impact on, and is exacerbated by, climate change. Most fires have human causes. Figure 2.33 shows the average density of fires per 100 km2, between 1997 and 2008. Not all high temperature events are biomass fires, as gas flares and other high temperature events are also detected. However, most fires are due to biomass burning. 60\u00b0S 180\u00b0 180\u00b0 150\u00b0E 150\u00b0E 120\u00b0E 120\u00b0E 90\u00b0E 90\u00b0E 60\u00b0E 60\u00b0E 30\u00b0E 30\u00b0E 0\u00b0 0\u00b0 30\u00b0W 30\u00b0W 60\u00b0W 60\u00b0W 90\u00b0W 90\u00b0W 120\u00b0W 120\u00b0W 150\u00b0W 150\u00b0W 60\u00b0N 60\u00b0N 30\u00b0N 30\u00b0N 0\u00b0 0\u00b0 30\u00b0S 30\u00b0S 60\u00b0S 1\u201330 30\u201350 >50 Fire occurence Per 100 km2 Figure 2.33: Distribution of average density of fires per 100 km2 (1997\u20132008) GIS analysis and cartography: P.

However, relative risk when measured as a proportion of population or GDP is stable and, in the case of mortality, may be declining. Many readers will be familiar with graphs such as Figure 2.36, which show an exponential increase in economic loss from disasters since the 1970s. Figure 2.37 shows that when these losses are adjusted for inflation and expressed as a percentage of global GDP, the trend is far less pronounced and statistically insignificant. 2.5.1 Risk, exposure and vulnerability In order to see how risk patterns are changing over time, modelled mortality and economic loss in 1990 and 2007 were compared, assuming constant levels of hazard. In the case of floods, modelled mortality increased by 13% from 1990 to 2007. This in- crease was driven by a 28% increase in modelled exposure. Vulnerability actually declined by 11%. Modelled economic loss over the same period increased by 33%, while GDP exposure increased by 98%. Vulnerability actually declined by 33%. This concurs with the fact that globally GDP increased by 64% over the same period, but countries with very high flood exposure, such as China and India, increased their GDP by more, in this case 420% and 185% respectively. In the case of landslides, mortality risk was stable from 1990 to 2007 (the model indicates a decrease of 1%). Exposure increased by 23%, while vulnerability decreased by 20%, reflecting GDP growth in the countries exposed. These simulations of risk indicate that increases in weather-related disaster risk are principally being driven by increases in exposure. Vulnerability actually appears to be going down although these simulations do not indicate which specific factors are increasing or decreasing over time. The overall implication is that while economic development can reduce vulnerability, at the same time it drives increased exposure of people and economic assets in areas prone to weather-related hazards, particularly urban and coastal areas. Economic loss risk appears to be increasing faster than mortality risk, reflecting a faster increase in GDP exposure than population exposure.

Although solid data are hard to come by, there is evidence that economic activities, assets and productive infrastructure are also further concentrated within countries. Growth has been fastest in coastal regions and near large navigable rivers, many of which are prone to natural hazard events 31. Urban growth has added significant economic assets to large cities in developing countries, some of which are located in geologically unstable areas. Earthquake prone Tehran and Istanbul, for instance, experienced faster urban and economic growth than the Islamic Republic of Iran and Turkey as a whole. As populations concentrate and economic activity in those centres grows even faster, exposure also increases significantly. It is also likely that risk is increasing fastest in low and lower-middle income countries with rapidly growing economies. These countries have rapidly increasing exposure at the same time as only slowly improving vulnerability indicators. In contrast, most high-income countries experience more sedate increases in exposure, with very low vulnerability. 2.5.2 Is hazard increasing? The above simulations of loss trends assume constant hazard levels. Yet hazard is changing, due to climate change, urbanization and environmental degradation. In the case of tropical cyclones, Table 2.6 shows that there has been an increase in the frequency of Category 4 events during warm years. These results are in line with findings published recently 32 in which it was calculated that a 1\u00baC increase in sea surface temperatures would result in a 31% increase in the global frequency of Category 4 and 5 storms per year. This is also consistent with the IPCC\u2019s 4th Assessment report (p. 795)33 which states that \u201cTropical cyclones (including hurricanes and typhoons), are likely to become more intense with sea surface temperature increases.\u201d Table 2.6 shows that the average number of tropical cyclones between cold, average and hot years is fairly stable (between 56 and 58 tropical cyclones per year). However, Category 3 and 4 cyclones show a marked increase in average and hot years compared with cold years. Global sea surface temperature data are available only since 1985. The \u201cNo data\u201d years (1976\u20131984) show more Category 1 and fewer Category 3, 4 and 5 cyclones. Any increase in the severity of cyclones will magnify the unevenness of disaster risk distribution. For example, the economic risk model shows that 1.9% of the GDP of Madagascar is at risk annually from Category 3 cyclones, but only 0.09% of the GDP of Japan. If these cyclones were to increase to Category 4 storms, 3.2% of the GDP of Madagascar would be at risk, but only 0.16% of the GDP of Japan.

Estimates prepared for this report show that disasters have a major impact on the accumulation of capital stock in a small number of vulnerable countries. The top three countries in this situation, in which the ratio of economic losses to capital stock was highest are all SIDS, namely Samoa, Saint Lucia and Grenada. The next two most affected countries, Afghanistan and Tajikistan, are land-locked countries 36. Figure 2.38 clearly shows the differential impact of economic loss in countries with different characteristics. In Samoa, for example, economic losses in a series of disasters including a tropical storm and forest fire in 1983, and a series of back-to- back tropical cyclones between 1989 and 1990 appear to have set back the country\u2019s economy by about 30 years. It was not until 2000 that the island\u2019s capital stock recovered to its 1970\u2019s level. A similar pattern is presented in Saint Lucia due to the impacts of Hurricane Allen in 1980 and Figure 2.38: Impact of economic loss Cumulative net capital formation (NCF) from 1970 to 2006, in millions of constant 2000 US$, with (red lines) and without (blue lines) the effect of economic losses in disasters. 50 000 100 000 150 000 200 000 250 000 300 000 Colombia 1970 1980 1990 2000 200 000 400 000 600 000 800 000 1 000 000 1 200 000 1 400 000 1976 1986 1996 India \u2013400 \u2013200 0 200 400 600 800 1 000 Samoa 1970 1980 1990 2000 2 000 000 4 000 000 6 000 000 8 000 000 10 000 000 12 000 000 14 000 000 16 000 000 18 000 000 20 000 000 1970 1980 1990 2000 United States of America 2 000 4 000 6 000 8 000 10 000 12 000 1970 1980 1990 2000 Madagascar \u20131 000 \u2013500 0 500 1 000 1 500 2 000 2 500 3 000 1970 1980 1990 2000 St. Lucia 2.6 55 Chapter 2 Global disaster risk: patterns, trends and drivers 55 Hurricane Gilbert in 1986. Madagascar shows a different pattern but a clear impact of disaster loss on cumulative net capital formation. In contrast, the impact of major disasters on high-income countries such as the United States of America is imperceptible, even though that country has experienced disasters with enormous absolute economic loss. Similarly, the effect in large low- income countries such as India or middle- income countries such as Colombia is not so significant. The implications are that disasters do not have a significant impact on economic growth in countries with large economies, but a devastating impact on those with small economies. Such economies are highly vulnerable to disaster loss. While in large countries disasters may have a devastating impact on the localities and regions where they occur, as Hurricane Katrina demonstrated, this is not necessarily translated into a national impact unless the affected area concentrates a significant proportion of a country\u2019s capital. Approaches to measuring the resilience of a country to economic shocks have included the Disaster Deficit Index, mentioned above, and others 37. Another approach is to use net savings as a proxy of a country\u2019s ability to absorb the impact and recover from disaster losses. Net savings is probably a better proxy of resilience than GDP per capita because it more accurately estimates the available internal resources, which could be invested in the recovery of losses including capital stock. However, the factors that influence a country\u2019s resilience (i.e. its capacity to recover from deviations in its development path caused by disaster impacts) are complex and cannot be reduced easily to any one variable. Nevertheless, five groups of countries can be identified that share common characteristics in terms of their vulnerability and resilience to disaster loss and their development limitations, particularly their capacity to benefit from international trade 38. Table 2.7 shows the countries in this classification. Groups 4 and 5 are those with high and very high economic vulnerability to natural hazards. The table also shows the number of developing countries (including LLDCs) in those groups that experience extreme limitations in their ability to benefit from international trade. Countries suffering extreme trade limitations are characterized by a very low participation in world export markets (less than 0.1%) and simultaneously show low export diversification, which render them highly exposed to trade shocks.

In the groups with high and very high vulnerability (i.e. Groups 4 and 5), 81% of all countries suffer extreme trade limitations (reaching 100% in Group 5), while in groups with very low, low and medium vulnerability (Groups 1, 2 and 3), only 4% suffer such limitations. It is also clear that SIDS and LLDCs represent the majority of countries with high and very high vulnerability and those suffering extreme trade limitations. In fact, SIDS and LLDCs together constitute 60% and 67% of all countries in Groups 4 and 5 respectively, and about two thirds of all countries in the groups affected by extreme trade limitations. Given that the risk circumstances of many SIDS and LLDCs are likely to worsen because of climate change trends, in the absence of particular attention from the international community, their prospects for a positive insertion in the global economy will further deteriorate, and even their economic and social viability as nations could be seriously compromised. Given the limitations on economic loss data mentioned in Section 2.2, it is likely that with more complete information, the specific countries identified in each of those groups would change. The exercises mentioned above should, therefore, be considered illustrative only. Nevertheless, a key conclusion is that SIDS, landlocked countries, LLDCs and others with small and vulnerable economies and low levels of resilience to economic loss will require a specific policy focus that takes into account the complexity of the factors involved.

National disaster databases contain disaster loss reports aggregated at the local government level1. Databases from a sample of 12 Asian and Latin American countries document a total of 126,620 such reports between 1970 and 20072 and show that, as at the global level, mortality and direct economic loss are highly concentrated. Just 0.7% of the reports cover 84% of the total mortality and 75% of the destroyed housing across the 12 countries. In contrast other risk attributes are more evenly spread. For example, 51% of housing damage is distributed across the other 125,632 loss reports. These patterns illustrate concentrations of intensive risk and geographically dispersed patterns of extensive risk.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ecda2ea3-29d2-4bf5-8fc3-560c0d5c8b62": {"__data__": {"id_": "ecda2ea3-29d2-4bf5-8fc3-560c0d5c8b62", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "40c1e3bc47e6955c0e57fde72a237b406887312cc64df8df43160f6861b2fb65"}, "2": {"node_id": "a16c3fed-9186-46b9-9350-628a7f1b5f78", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5242d2d6806197af9c3fe57054806b25a6628b950d01c3f8aea31d75b680cc39"}}, "hash": "22eaf5cd1147abf5674757abf8a7d967d309e3123a40c118b49f58f880571f3c", "text": "These patterns illustrate concentrations of intensive risk and geographically dispersed patterns of extensive risk. The first part of this chapter opens a window on both kinds of risk, viewed at the local level. The second part then examines the empirical evidence on how poverty is translated into disaster risk and how disaster impacts are translated into poverty outcomes at the same scale. Summary of findings 1. Low-intensity damage and asset loss is extensively spread Mortality and housing destruction are highly concentrated in infrequently occurring events affecting a small number of geographic areas. However, housing damage is both widely spread and frequently occurring and is indicative of similar impacts in local infrastructure in other sectors. These low-intensity but widespread losses represent a significant and largely unrecognized component of disaster impacts and costs. 2. Weather-related extensive risk is increasing rapidly Extensive manifestations of risk associated with weather-related hazards are expanding geographically, occurring with more frequency and leading to increased damage levels. These loss patterns reflect ongoing patterns of risk configuration, illustrating a tendency of increasing exposure of people and assets at the local level.

Urbanization, territorial occupation and environmental degradation have been identified as underlying risk drivers At least part of the increase in losses associated with extensive risk can be explained by improved disaster reporting. It may also already reflect climate change, which is increasing the frequency and intensity of precipitation events in some areas. However, urbanization, territorial occupation and environmental degradation have also been identified as key risk drivers. There is evidence to show that in some areas risk is becoming more intensive over time. 4. Disaster impacts are associated with both short- and long-term poverty outcomes There is empirical evidence to show that poor communities are far more vulnerable to, and disproportionately affected by, natural hazards, mirroring the uneven distribution of disaster risk observed at the global level. At the same time, evidence from a range of microstudies indicates that poor households are also less resilient and face greater difficulties in absorbing and recovering from disaster impacts. Both intensive and extensive impacts have both short- and long-term poverty outcomes, including reductions in income and consumption, increases in poverty and inequality, and decreases in human development and welfare. Inadequately targeted and untimely relief and assistance, and a lack of access to insurance and social protection are all underlying drivers of the translation of disaster impacts into poverty outcomes. 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 62 62 Data and method The analysis builds on important recent advances in the compilation of national disaster databases in both Asia and Latin America3 that for the first time enable the exploration of loss patterns at the local level. The data used in this analysis has been extracted from these databases and restricted to those reports with identified losses, associated with weather-related4 and geological5 hazards and with verifiable source data. Approximately one third of the reports from the national databases were not used in this analysis because they did not comply with one or more of the above conditions. The country sample analysed is characterized by a wide range of hazard types, development contexts and geographic conditions. Nevertheless, high-resolution disaster data is still not widely available for Africa, Europe and other regions. As such, while the findings point to many broad patterns and trends across different contexts they may not be globally valid. Case study evidence from Africa has been used to complement the analysis in Asia and Latin America. Relatively robust and comparable disaster loss data exists for attributes such as mortality, housing destruction and damage. Data on crop and livestock loss is far less robust. As a result, risks associated with droughts and rural agricultural livelihoods have not been covered. In contrast microstudies on the impact of disasters on poverty have tended to focus on rural areas. While disaster losses are indicative of realized risk, they do not indicate risk levels in a probabilistic sense. Current data does not allow an assessment of local risk levels analogous to the global analysis presented in Chapter 2. Information on local-level hazards, such as urban flooding, does not systematically exist. Global data sets on hazard and population exposure become inaccurate when examined at a high resolution. This chapter, therefore, presents an analysis of patterns and trends in losses and impacts, rather than of probabilistic risk levels. The spatial units of analysis are local government areas or second or third tier administrative units according to the political\u2013 3.1 administrative division of each country. These areas are highly heterogeneous both within and between countries, ranging from densely populated urban municipalities, where populations of several hundred thousand may be concentrated in a small area, to sparsely populated rural districts, where a much smaller population is spread over several thousand square kilometres. This heterogeneity again means that absolute losses cannot be used to impute a given level of risk. However, these spatial units are not arbitrarily defined. They reflect the way territory is organized and managed politically and administratively in each country. Demographic, social and economic data, including on poverty attributes, is usually aggregated in the same units. While influenced by global processes such as climate change and economic flows, risk is shaped locally at this level. The losses reported in each local area reflect complex local interactions between hazard, exposure and vulnerability. In many ways they represent the social territory of risk at the local level in the same way as countries do at the global level.

For this sample, the threshold was established at 50 deaths or 500 houses. Those loss reports with 50 deaths or 500 destroyed houses or more are characterized in this chapter as manifestations of intensive risk and those with less than 50 deaths and 500 destroyed houses are characterized as manifestations of extensive risk. Taking into account the characteristics of the available data and the spatial units in which this data is aggregated, the application of this threshold to the data does not impute higher or lower levels of risk in specific local areas. However, it does enable a characterization of the extensive spread and intensive concentration of losses. Table 3.1 summarizes the loss reports across the sample by hazard type, by loss attribute and by the type of risk manifestation. 63 63 Chapter 3 Deconstructing disaster risk: patterns and poverty trends at the local level 3.2 Figure 3.1 shows the distribution of mortality across the sample between 1980 and 2006. The application of the threshold to this mortality distribution clearly illustrates a number of intensive peaks of mortality underpinned by a continuous extensive mortality stream. The fact that loss attributes such as mortality and destroyed housing are so intensively concentrated in such a small number of reports Figure 3.1: Distribution of mortality associated with intensive and extensive risk across the data set (1980\u20132006) Table 3.1: Extensive and intensive loss reports associated with weather-related and geological hazards Risk type Hazard type Loss reports % Deaths % Houses destroyed % Houses damaged % Extensive Weather-related 121,373 95.9 48,392 15.5 739,002 24.1 3,654,596 48.3 Extensive Geological 4,259 3.4 2,406 0.8 40,684 1.3 226,545 3.0 Intensive Weather-related 801 0.6 58,559 18.7 1,618,682 52.7 3,235,176 42.7 Intensive Geological 187 0.1 203,524 65.0 671,980 21.9 453,094 6.0 Total 126,620 100.0 312,881 100.0 3,070,348 100.0 7,569,411 100.0 presents challenges for the identification of patterns and trends. For example, more than two-thirds of the reported mortality in Colombia since 1970 was associated with a single event: the eruption of the Armero Volcano in 1985. The intensive\u2013extensive threshold described above was used as a simple and transparent procedure to filter out these intensive manifestations of risk. Given the large number of remaining extensive manifestations, the trends and patterns identified are then statistically robust. Poverty data at a local or household resolution also exists in many of the same countries and has been compared with disaster data in a series of case studies in nine countries6. Together with a systematization of the findings of previous studies on disaster and poverty in Africa, this has enabled the identification of the different mechanisms through which disaster risk and poverty interact. The comparison of disaster loss reports and poverty data presents an additional set of data and methodological complications that are examined in Section 3.7.1.

Most of the loss reports characterized as extensive in this analysis are associated with highly localized hazard events, such as flooding, landslides, fires and storms. However, a major flood or cyclonic event may also lead to extensive losses in multiple local areas, as well as intensive losses in others. Similarly, some small-scale hazards may have intensive impacts, for example the landslide that killed more than 500 people in a single neighbourhood in Villa Tina, Medellin in Colombia in 1987. Disasters are socially constructed. Whether a series of loss reports is characterized as a single large disaster or multiple small disasters, 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 64 64 3.3 therefore, depends on the perspective of the observer. Extensive loss reports associated with specific localized hazard events are normally classified as small-scale disasters.

In Orissa, India, for example, fires account for almost 59% of the extensive loss reports due to rural villages of tightly packed thatch houses that are extremely vulnerable to fire. As Figure 3.5 indicates, in Iran 42.9% of extensive loss reports are associated with earthquakes. While mortality and housing destruction is intensively concentrated, extensive risk disasters account for 51.3% of damaged housing across the sample. In most Latin American countries over 75% of housing damage is extensive. In Asia the Figure 3.4: Weather-related extensive loss reports by hazard type across sample Floods, flash floods, urban floods, rains (40.91%) Fires, forest fires (24.69%) Alluvion, avalanches, landslides (13.96%) Droughts, heat waves (4.60%) Cold, cold waves, frost, snowstorms (3.50%) Surges, tidal waves (0.01%) Cyclones, storms, gale, winds, hailstorms, tornadoes, electric storms, lightning, thunderstorms, strong wind (12.32%) percentage is less \u2013 given that no less than 58.5% of the housing damage reported in Asia occurred in Orissa where 84.8% of the housing damage was intensive. This loss pattern is compatible with the fact that most extensive risk loss reports are associated with floods, rains and storms, which are more likely to damage housing than cause mortality or destruction. Research from other countries suggests that mortality and injury only increase significantly in very severe floods, with a large number of affected buildings 7. And, effectively, flood mortality in the sample is mainly concentrated in the intensive loss reports. Floods were associated with 34.7% of weather-related extensive risk loss reports but with over 60% of corresponding housing damage. Heavy rains were associated with only 6% of the loss reports but 26.7% of the housing damage. To further illustrate this point, Figure 3.6 shows how housing damage is extensively spread while housing destruction is intensively concentrated in Tamil Nadu, India.

The most robust attribute in the disaster databases is that of destruction and damage in the housing sector. In Mexico, for example, the disaster loss reports documented 316,928 destroyed and 471,708 damaged houses associated with manifestations of intensive risk between 1980 and 2006, and 29,510 houses destroyed and 1,468,509 damaged houses associated with manifestations of extensive risk. The cost of a destroyed house in Mexico has been estimated as US$ 16,8008 and the cost of a damaged house as 20% of that value. Based on these values, the cost of destroyed and damaged housing associated with intensive risk between 1980 and 2007 was US$ 6,909 million compared with US$ 5,429 million associated with extensive risk. In other words the losses associated with extensive risk represented approximately 44% of total economic losses in the housing sector. Applying the same methodology across the whole sample, the damage and destruction associated with extensive risk would represent approximately 34% of the value of economic losses in the housing sector. Table 3.3 illustrates that, across the sample, a significant proportion of losses in other sectors such as education, health and transport, as well as of the people affected, are also associated with extensive risk: 57% of schools, 65% of hospitals, Table 3.3: Loss attributes by risk category across the sample (1970 \u20132007) Loss attribute Total Risk category Extensive risk % Intensive risk % Schools 32,157 18,488 57 13,669 43 Hospitals 1,037 677 65 360 35 Kilometres of roads 64,917 57,695 89 7,221 11 People affected 182,989,857 144,627,235 79 38,362,622 21 3.4 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 68 68 89% of damaged and destroyed roads, and 79% of the people affected. Disaster loss data in these sectors is less robust than in housing, meaning that the absolute figures are not meaningful. The proportional distribution between extensive and intensive risk manifestations, however, is valid given the size of the sample. While the costs associated with extensive risk are clearly additional to those associated with intensive risk, it is not possible to directly compare these estimates with internationally reported economic losses. Around two thirds of internationally reported disasters do not have economic loss data and most of those that do include impacts associated with both intensive and extensive risk. What can be demonstrated is that international attention to disasters \u2013 as measured by the release of UN situation reports; international appeals for assistance launched by the UN or by the IFRC; and post-disaster damage and loss assessments by the World Bank, regional development banks or the UN9 \u2013 is usually triggered by intensive losses. For example, of 2,281 disasters registered by the IFRC between 2004 and 2009 only 142 led to emergency appeals and only 398 lead to the involvement of IFRC delegations.

The average annual occurrence of extensive weather-related disasters has doubled over the last 27 years across the sample. As Figure 3.7 shows, the average number of deaths per loss report is actually going down while the number of houses damaged per loss report is increasing. This finding is coherent with the trends identified in Chapter 2 at the global level, which indicate that economic loss is growing faster than mortality. As countries develop, improvements in risk-reducing capacities lead to reductions in mortality but do not compensate for the increasing exposure of assets. A comparison of these trends in mortality and housing damage with the average annual population growth in each country confirms this hypothesis (Table 3.4). In most of Latin America, with the exception of Ecuador and Mexico, mortality is falling relative to population size, whereas in Asia, except in Iran, it is increasing, probably reflecting differences in income and 3.5 Figure 3.7: Extensive weather-related mortality (left) and housing damage (right) \u2013 all countries (1980\u20132006) Number of houses damaged per loss report 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 Number of dead per loss report 69 69 Chapter 3 Deconstructing disaster risk: patterns and poverty trends at the local level Table 3.4: Annual increase in mortality and housing damage compared with annual population growth (1980\u20132006) Country name Average annual % change in mortality (1970\u20132007 unless otherwise indicated) from extensive weather- related events Average annual % change in houses damaged 1970\u20132007 from extensive weather-related events Average annual % increase in population 1970\u20132007 11 Argentina 0.90 2.92 1.33 Bolivia 1.48 0.03 2.17 Colombia \u20130.95 9.48 1.89 Costa Rica 0.93 8.18 2.35 Ecuador 3.93 26.12 2.09 Iran (1980\u20132007) \u20131.23 \u20139.05 2.37 Mexico (1980\u20132007) 6.48 17.94 1.88 Nepal (1971\u20132007) 4.47 8.28 2.25 Orissa 5.75 7.80 1.6612 Peru (1970\u20132006) 1.31 3.03 1.96 Sri Lanka (1974\u20132007) 1.70 5.68 1.15 Tamil Nadu (1976\u20132007) 11.67 12.23 1.2513 Venezuela 0.51 5.96 2.49 human development between countries in both regions. In contrast, with the exception of Bolivia and Iran, housing damage is increasing far faster than population growth. The identified trend of increasing exposure is associated with a centrifugal geographical expansion of extensive weather-related risk. Figure 3.8 illustrates the consistent increase in the annual number of affected local administrative areas. The number of local areas with 1\u20139 loss reports between 1980 and 2007 has doubled and those with 10\u201349 loss reports has almost quintupled. This confirms that many new local areas are now characterized by weather-related extensive risk, while the frequency of losses has also increased. For example, Figure 3.9 highlights that the number of states with manifestations of extensive risk in Mexico has consistently grown over recent decades. Extensive risk configuring intensive risk Extensive risk can become intensive over time in areas that are subject to severe levels of similar kinds of hazard. For example, areas with very frequent manifestations of extensive flood risks are likely to experience intensive impacts during major cyclonic events. Figure 3.10 indicates that in Orissa manifestations of intensive risk tend to occur in areas with the most frequent manifestations of extensive risk. Similar patterns can be seen in other countries14. In other words, intensive risk is often superimposed on patterns of extensive risk.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template":

As Figure 3.11 illustrates, the number of loss reports associated with floods and heavy rains is increasing at a far faster rate than all other categories of weather-related hazards, particularly since 1990. In Mexico, for example, the annual average number of extensive loss reports associated with floods, rains and flash floods has increased eight- fold since 1980. These hazards accounted for 31% of all extensive weather-related loss reports in the 1980s but over 40% in the last decade. Similarly, in Colombia (Figure 3.12), floods, flash floods and heavy rains accounted for 43% of extensive weather-related disasters in the 1970s but 53% in the last decade. 71 71 Chapter 3 Deconstructing disaster risk: patterns and poverty trends at the local level 3.6 Interpreting the trend Floods, flash floods, rains (53.30%) Fires, forest fires (10.73%) Landslides, avalanches (19.35%) Droughts, heat waves (2.21%) Frost (0.13%) Storms, electric storms, hailstorms, strong wind (14.28%) 1998\u20132007 Landslides (32.94%) Droughts, heat waves (1.99%) Storms, electric storms, hailstorms, strong wind (6.04%) Floods, flash floods, rains (43.19%) Frost, snowstorms (0.24%) 1970\u20131979 Fires, forest fires (15.60%) Figure 3.12: Floods and rains in Colombia as a proportion of all extensive weather-related loss reports, 1970\u20131979 and 1998\u20132007 Floods, flash floods, rains (53.30%) Fires, forest fires (10.73%) Landslides, avalanches (19.35%) Droughts, heat waves (2.21%) Frost (0.13%) Storms, electric storms, hailstorms, strong wind (14.28%) 1998\u20132007 Landslides (32.94%) Droughts, heat waves (1.99%) Storms, electric storms, hailstorms, strong wind (6.04%) Floods, flash floods, rains (43.19%) Frost, snowstorms (0.24%) 1970\u20131979 Fires, forest fires (15.60%) Figure 3.11: Number of flood and rain extensive risk loss reports (1980\u20132006) Floods, flash floods, urban floods, rains Fires, forest fires Alluvions, avalanches, landslides Droughts, heat waves Cold, cold waves, frost, snowstorm Surge, tidal wave Cyclones, storms, gales, winds, hailstorms, tornadoes, electric storms, lightning, thunderstorms, strong wind 500 1 000 1 500 2 000 2 500 3 000 3 500 4 000 4 500 Number of events 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 3.6.1 Improved disaster reporting and a bias in the data? As in the case of the global trends identified in Chapter 2, it is very likely that improved reporting of disaster events due to enhanced communications, the introduction of the Internet and more systematic government reporting 15 is responsible for an increase in the number of loss reports. However, improved reporting alone is not sufficient to explain the trends identified. Improved reporting should lead to an even increase in loss reports across all hazard categories and not just floods and rains. Similarly the number of loss reports is increasing not only in remote rural areas, where disasters may previously have gone unreported, but also in major metropolitan areas, such as Buenos Aires or Mexico City. Evidence from Colombia and Peru indicate that many more loss reports originate in major cities and from provincial capitals than from isolated rural areas 16. This may reflect a bias in the reporting, given that losses occurring in centres of political administration are more likely to be reported than in remote rural areas. All the losses reported from urban areas are documented and therefore did occur. While it is likely that many small-scale losses in remote rural areas go unrecorded, it is unlikely that this includes nationally significant losses. In parts of Asia, in contrast, it is likely that losses in rural areas may be more consistently reported than in some cities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "590467fd-82ab-43bd-bdbc-7278805f2a1c": {"__data__": {"id_": "590467fd-82ab-43bd-bdbc-7278805f2a1c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6fabc5e43fd5778e95926c2a2f52ec4638f5428c9d8543588ed7774b957d1fe2"}, "2": {"node_id": "0de4f307-5321-4be7-93f9-4af7ad6d5e05", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b955364e43d90d8fe170909e64dbad5ebcfe442f1d889e9320ae1be441e373d1"}}, "hash": "4fd3ac9da39282f354d3f2376b1ab988bfbd60af32e759d711788c2f1ee990a1", "text": "3.6.2 Climate variability and change The IPCC has confirmed that the geographic distribution, frequency and intensity of 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 72 72 precipitation events is already being altered significantly by climate change17, although these effects will have different manifestations in different regions. It is likely therefore, at least in some regions, that climate change, as well as cyclical patterns of climate variability, is influencing the doubling of the number of loss reports associated with weather-related extensive risk over the last 27 years and the even more rapid increase in those reports associated with floods and rains. Without a detailed analysis at the watershed level, however, it is impossible to determine the influence of climate variability and change. In some countries, such as Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador and Venezuela, the increase in flood- and rain-related reports since the mid-1990s has coincided with a period of increased annual average precipitation, as Figures 3.13 and 3.14 highlight in the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5122af2-e580-44aa-b22c-a5720a88bd01": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5122af2-e580-44aa-b22c-a5720a88bd01", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "04fbe20cdaa14a36631cc1b62aa0f69ea242377baf0a9d890edab514947c9307"}}, "hash": "04fbe20cdaa14a36631cc1b62aa0f69ea242377baf0a9d890edab514947c9307", "text": "case of Costa Rica18. However, in Mexico and Nepal, the number of loss reports is increasing while average precipitation is decreasing. In Peru, average precipitation is increasing while the number of loss reports is decreasing. In other words, there is no consistent relationship between both variables across the sample. 3.6.3 Urbanization, environmental change and territorial occupation Aggregate national statistics on variables such as deforestation and urban growth similarly provide little insight into the trend of increasing weather- related risk. Continuing with the example of Costa Rica, forest cover has increased, due to environmental protection policies and the application of a system of payment for ecosystem services, over the same period that a dramatic increase in flood and rain loss reports has occurred. In contrast, case study evidence from Latin America, Asia and Africa demonstrates how drivers such as urbanization, environmental change and territorial occupation are funda mental ly shaping the geography and evolution of extensive risk. A detailed description of evidence from national case studies is presented in Appendix 2, Note 2.4. Urban expansion Case studies from Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica and Mexico indicate how extensive risk is generated through processes of urban expansion. Extensive flood risk is closely linked to the increased run-off caused by new urban development, a chronic underinvestment in city- wide pluvial drainage, the location of informal settlements and social housing projects in low- lying flood prone areas and inadequate water management in the surrounding watersheds. In other words, the urbanization process not only leads to increasing exposure of vulnerable people and assets in hazard prone areas but is also responsible for magnifying the hazards themselves, particularly floods. In the metropolitan area of San Salvador, for example, the municipalities with recurrent extensive loss reports were those with the most rapid urban growth19, in some cases up to 16% per year. And, according to the Municipality of San Jose, Costa Rica, more than 80% of the floods occurring in the country\u2019s capital are caused by either inadequate drainage to cope with the Figure 3.13: Extensive flood and rain loss reports in Costa Rica (1990\u20132007) Number of flood, rain and flash flood events 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1 000 1990 1995 2000 2005 Figure 3.14: Precipitation in Costa Rica: 10-year averages (1957\u20132007) 1957\u20131989 precipitation trend 1990\u20132007 precipitation trend 2 600 2 700 2 800 2 900 3 000 Average annual precipitation in mm 3 100 1955 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 73 73 Chapter 3 Deconstructing disaster risk: patterns and poverty trends at the local level increased run-off caused by urban growth or by the accumulation of garbage and waste in drainage channels. Most housing damage is concentrated in precarios occupying marginal land adjacent to the streams and torrents that drain the city. Many cities in Asia are also increasingly experiencing losses due to urban flooding. For example, there were 240 reports of flood loss in Colombo since 1974. Almost half these reports and about 80% of the associated housing damage have occurred since 2005. Chennai similarly experienced major flooding in 1990, 1994 and 1996 and Kathmandu in 2000 and 2002. Flooding in these, as in other cities across South Asia, would tend to suggest that rapid urban growth, the expansion of informal settlements, inadequate water management and an underinvestment in drainage are driving risk in a way that is analogous to Latin America, although with very different characteristics. Some cases also indicate how extensive risk in cities can be reduced over time through investment in public infrastructure as urban areas are consolidated. In some cities, this means that extensive risk patterns expand concentrically from the centre towards the periphery of the city following the logic of informal settlement, while at the same time progressively reducing in the centre. In other cases extensive risk is con centrated in pockets of land ignored by formal urbanization, for example in ravines or riverbanks. Figure 3.15 shows local loss reports from floods in Cali, Colombia since the 1950s. The number of flood loss reports mirrors the expansion of the city, mainly through the occupation of land for informal settlement without a corresponding investment in drainage infrastructure. Flooding reported in early November 2006 in the Colombo District, Sri Lanka, destroyed 221 houses, damaged 1,674 houses and affected 80,128 people. Figure 3.16 shows the distribution of flooded areas overlaid with population density. The flooding illustrated the typical problems of settlements in low-lying areas and inadequate drainage.

According to Action Aid, the first two kinds of flood are most prevalent. The underlying cause has been the gap between the very rapid growth in the population of many urban centres and the capacity of urban governments to cope (see Box 3.1). Although growth rates in many urban centres have declined, far too little attention has been given to needed measures to improve urban governance. Very poor conditions in many rural areas, including the combined impacts of conflict, floods and drought, have underpinned much rural to urban migration. Due to poor urban governance, most cities absorb growth through the expansion of informal settlements, Figure 3.15: Extensive flood reports in Cali, Colombia (1950\u20132000) 1 0 2\u20133 4\u20136 >7 1950\u20131959 1990\u20132000 1980\u20131989 1970\u20131979 1960\u20131969 Number of flood events 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 74 74 which often occupy low-lying flood prone areas. 72% of Africa\u2019s urban population lives in informal settlements. Investment in drainage infrastructure is often non-existent and there is little or no maintenance of existing infrastructure. Territorial occupation Case studies from Ecuador, Mexico and Peru show how in parallel to mirroring the growth of large cities, extensive risk also expands concentrically in a country\u2019s territory, following the construction or improvement of roads, the opening of the agricultural frontier and the growth of small and medium urban centres. Increasing extensive risk associated with floods, for example, is often related to a combination of factors including a decline in the regulatory services provided by ecosystems, inadequate water management, land-use changes, rural\u2013urban migration, unplanned urban growth, the expansion of informal settlements in low- lying areas and an under-investment in drainage infrastructure. Figure 3.17 shows how over the last four decades the distribution of extensive weather- related loss reports in Ecuador has followed the process of territorial occupation, from the country\u2019s Andean backbone westwards into the Pacific lowlands and eastwards into the Amazon. Figure 3.18 shows a similar process in Peru, where the distribution of loss reports associated with landslides has moved eastwards, following the opening of new roads into the Amazon. Figure 3.19 shows the devastating flooding in Tabasco, Mexico in 2007 due to a combination of inadequate water management in an 80,000 km2 watershed and the urbanization of low-lying areas without adequate investment in drainage. Densely populated rural areas In contrast to Latin America, all the Asian countries, except for Iran, are still markedly rural. In Iran, 66.9% of the population was classified as living in urban areas in 2005 compared with 28.7% in India, 15.8% in Nepal and 15.1% in Sri Lanka. In these predominantly rural countries extensive risk flood losses are associated not only with urban growth and territorial occupation but also with major concentrations of the rural population living on floodplains, near major river deltas and along coastal plains.

While poorly studied, flooding would seem to be associated with the high level of urbanization and associated problems of settlement of low-lying areas, increased run- off and inadequate drainage. In Chennai, for example, 18.9% of the urban population was living in slums in 200126. However, the other Box 3.1: Flooding in African cities22 Kampala, Uganda Construction of unregulated settlements has reduced infiltration of rainfall and changed land cover leading to runoff six times higher than occurs in natural terrain. After the 1960 floods a channel from Nsooba to Lubigi was dug and workers were employed to clean it regularly. There were no further flood problems until the 1980s but since then residents have had to re-build their houses after flooding up to six times. Some of this is because the main drainage channel, originally two metres deep, is now only 30 cm deep because of an accumulation of sediment and rubbish. Nairobi, Kenya Flooding is a major problem in all of Nairobi\u2019s informal settlements. Houses are built of weak, inadequate building materials. Migration has led to more houses being built close to streams, with consequent greater disruption when floods occur. Many local residents link increased flooding to both local activities and climate change. Slum inhabitants agree that floods now occur in places where they did not two decades ago. Accra, Ghana Women in Alajo, Accra, observed that patterns of rain and flooding have become unpredictable since the 1980s. They noted that it used to rain heavily in June and July but since 2000 the heavy rains sometimes start earlier and in other years start only after July. Consequently, it is difficult for them to prepare for flooding in Alajo. Since slum dwellers\u2019 livelihoods depend on activities such as small-scale commerce, petty trading and artisanal trades conducted in wooden kiosks that do not withstand the force of the floods, people lose working time, economic opportunities and income. The immediate impact is loss of income for food and bills, including children\u2019s education and medical costs. Bamenda, Cameroon Bamenda\u2019s population expanded more than 10-fold between 1965 and 1993, to reach around 270,000 in 1993. Human settlements have expanded up hill-slopes and onto wetlands because land is much cheaper (land can be 300\u2013400 times more expensive within the urban district compared to the very steep slopes and wetlands) but it is difficult (and expensive) to build stable, safe homes there. Around 20% of Bamenda\u2019s population lives on floodplains and around 7% lives in informal settlements on steep slopes. There is a serious lack of provision of water, sanitation, schools, health posts, roads and drainage. Land clearance for settlement and for quarrying and sand-mining, along with other land-use changes caused by urban expansion, have created serious problems of soil erosion \u2013 with the soil that is washed down the hills blocking drainage channels and changing peak water flows. These have exacerbated the long-standing problems with floods in the area. It is difficult to address these problems, especially given the economic crisis and the absence of capacity and skills within the local authority23. Saint Louis, Senegal24 The population of Saint Louis almost doubled between 1998 and 2002, from 115,000 to 200,000. Floods affect low-lying areas with no drainage that have been settled by very poor rural migrants fleeing the effects of rural drought. In order to protect against the floodwaters, residents make barriers using household waste, but this increases the incidence of health hazards. Flood risk in Saint Louis is basically a problem of poor urban governance.

concentration of housing damage is along the floodplain of the Kaveri River, in the watershed of the Ponnaiyar River and in the Kambam Valley. Tamil Nadu has a long history of chain- tank irrigation \u2013 a system that has fallen into disuse. Much flood damage in rural areas is associated with chain-tank failure and the silting of irrigation channels. In upland areas, increasing extensive flood risk may be associated with issues of environmental degradation. In Nepal, extensive flood risk and associated housing damage is concentrated in the densely populated alluvial plains of south-eastern Nepal in the Terai region (Figure 3.21). Floods in this case are not a consequence of urbanization or population density, but a cause. The richness of the soils is due to the frequent replenishment of nutrients through flooding and the reason why the region can support such a large dense population.

Similarly, countries with small and vulnerable economies, such as many SIDS, were shown to be far less resilient to disaster loss than those with larger and more diversified economies.

Spatially aggregated data may smooth \ufffd \ufffd important local differences in both disaster risk and poverty, making it difficult or impossible to identify statistically valid relationships. Disaster losses are often measured only in \ufffd \ufffd terms of mortality or direct economic impact. There is little systematic data collection on longer-term human development impacts in dimensions such as health, education and nutrition. Documenting impacts in these dimensions is not simple given the sparse survey data covering the same units of analysis over long periods of time. Few national statistical systems collect time series household panel data that incorporates information on hazard impacts. Hazard levels explain a large part of the \ufffd \ufffd variance in disaster incidence and loss between different local areas. However, information on the distribution and intensity of localized hazards is often not available, making it difficult to control for what may be a key variable. In Latin America, national disaster data may \ufffd \ufffd have an urban bias and over-estimate impacts in cities and under-estimate disaster risk in poor and dispersed rural areas. In Asia disaster data may be less reliable in urban areas due to the spatial resolution with which it is captured. When disaster impacts are compared \ufffd \ufffd nationally with data on the poverty headcount, poverty gap or unsatisfied basic needs, counter-intuitive results may be produced in countries with predominantly urban populations given relative differences between urban and rural poverty. A number of case studies from Latin America and Asia were commissioned specially for this Report in countries where both poverty and disaster data were available. Despite the challenges mentioned above they do provide empirical insight into how poverty shapes disaster risk and vice versa. These case studies were complemented by a systematization of the results of other studies in Africa. Many of these empirical studies address drought and rural livelihoods, complementing the analysis on floods and the housing sector that characterized the previous section. Appendix 2 summarizes the empirical results of the country case studies commissioned for this report, other studies within both regions, as well as results from analysis of Africa poverty studies. 3.7.2 Assets, poverty and disaster risk Households and communities exposed to natural hazards take decisions to manage the risks they face. Ex ante decisions in areas such as housing and livelihood have important short- and long- term implications for both welfare and human development as people seek to manage not only the risks associated with natural hazards, but also other everyday risks. Poor households may accept high levels of disaster risk and thus a higher risk of incurring losses in order to maximize income opportunities. Others may organize their livelihoods in such a way that overall risks are lowered, even if that means a reduction in income and increased poverty. When disaster losses are incurred, ex post responses or the inability to respond also have implications for short- and long-term welfare and human development outcomes 27.Both ex 79 79 Chapter 3 Deconstructing disaster risk: patterns and poverty trends at the local level ante and ex post responses to disaster impacts are influenced by the range of tangible (natural, physical and financial capitals) and intangible assets (human capital, social ties and networks, intrahousehold relations) at people\u2019s disposal, which in turn are shaped by broader economic, social and political considerations in each context. Asset holdings have a positive impact on welfare in at least two distinct ways. First, higher net asset holdings can increase the income- generating potential of poor households leading to higher welfare and less poverty during normal times. For example it may enable a household to choose a less hazardous location or to live in less vulnerable housing. Second, asset holdings offer a crucial means to buffer disaster losses28. The ability of a household to access and mobilize assets therefore has a dramatic influence on both the ex ante and ex post capacity of households and communities to manage disaster risk. Households with limited ability to mobilize assets are less resilient when assets are lost in a disaster \u2013 for example, when houses are damaged or livestock killed. In the absence (or delayed activation) of formal and informal credit and insurance markets and state-funded mechanisms, such as safety nets and social security, these impacts can reduce consumption in the short term and also lead to an observable deterioration in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b4b52f2-cbf1-423a-8e93-060860da915b": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b4b52f2-cbf1-423a-8e93-060860da915b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3b76b5afcb83ec73f1fb3f820fd012acb5158a6f8a9d5ce89794082bf542c56d"}}, "hash": "3b76b5afcb83ec73f1fb3f820fd012acb5158a6f8a9d5ce89794082bf542c56d", "text": "health, nutritional and educational status and other long-term human development problems. When assets are available, asset sales can buffer income and consumption fluctuations. However, particularly in the case of large disasters, such strategies are often ineffective when many households simultaneously decide to dispose of the same kind of asset in the context of limited demand. Moreover, in contexts of deprivation, where assets are already scarce, asset disposal makes recovery harder by affecting the ability to generate income in the future. Reduced future income further entrenches poverty and associated poor nutritional, educational or health status. The role that assets play in managing disaster risk is also influenced by whether the risk is extensive or intensive in character. The impacts associated with both intensively concentrated and extensively spread risk have very different but equally important implications for the translation of disaster impacts into poverty outcomes. As discussed earlier in the chapter, manifestations of intensive risk are characterized by major mortality and asset destruction, which can seriously compromise the capacity of a household to buffer losses and recover: for example when household income earners are killed or injured or where an asset such as a house, which may represent a reserve of inter- generational savings, is lost. In contrast, it is more likely that the low-intensity damages associated with extensive risk can be more easily buffered. Similarly, manifestations of intensive risk are more likely to be associated with large-scale hazards that simultaneously affect large numbers of households, stretching and often overwhelming not only local but even national coping mechanisms. In contrast, in the case of extensive risk impacts affecting smaller numbers of households and communities, local and national coping mechanisms are more likely to be effective. This effectiveness will also be challenged, however, when a large number of extensive impacts occur, for example during an ENSO episode. At the same time, intensive losses occur infrequently and only affect very specific areas and are more likely to be buffered by national and international assistance. In contrast, recurrent extensive losses affect wide areas on a regular basis and can lead to asset depletion and erosion, which significantly affects capacity to absorb future losses and recover. 3.7.3 Poverty, exposure and vulnerability: the uneven distribution of disaster occurrence and loss Evidence that demonstrates that the poor are more exposed and vulnerable to natural hazards sometimes appears counter-intuitive. In some countries, the areas that experience most disasters are actually those with the most dynamic economic and urban growth or with prosperous rural economies. However, there is evidence to show that communities in poor areas lose a far higher proportion of their assets, confirming that they have far higher levels of vulnerability (Table 3.5). 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 80 80 Table 3.5: Summary of case study findings on the social distribution of disaster loss Country Findings Burkino Faso The 1984\u20131985 drought affected the poorest third of a sample of rural household\u2019s 10% more than the wealthier third: the former experienced crop-income losses of 69% versus 58% drop for the latter. Madagascar Tropical cyclone impacts led to a reduction of 11% in the volume of agricultural production of the poorest 20% households compared to a reduction of only 6% in the case of the richest 20% 29. Mexico Municipalities with the highest number of loss reports also had large percentages of their population with high or very high levels of marginality, according to an Index of Municipal Marginality developed by the National Population Council. For example, Acapulco (54.4%), Coatzocoalcos (54.1%), Juarez (45%), Tapachula (54.1%), Tijuana (31.3%) or Veracruz (31%) 30. Municipalities with high or very high levels of marginality had high proportions of damaged and destroyed housing. In a third of these municipalities, between 10 and 25% of the housing stock was damaged or destroyed, while in another third this proportion was more than 25%. Over 20% had more than 50% of their housing stock affected. In contrast, only 8% of the housing stock was affected in municipalities with low or very low levels of marginality. Nepal Areas affected by floods tended to have lower poverty rates and higher per capita expenditures. Flooding incidence and impacts are concentrated in the highly productive lowland agricultural plains of the Terai belt in south-eastern Nepal. As flooding contributes to the fertility of the soil of the region, it contributes to the wealth of the area. Areas affected by landslides tend to have higher poverty and mortality rates. Landslide impacts are heavily concentrated in districts in mountainous western Nepal with marginal rain-fed agriculture and which concentrate the country\u2019s rural poverty.

The incidence of extensive risk loss reports was higher in the central eastern coastal region where there are higher levels of urbanization and relatively affluent agricultural areas on floodplains and deltas. Mortality in extensive risk disasters was concentrated in the districts of Bolangir, Kalahandi and Koraput in southern Orissa, which are characterized by repeated droughts, floods, food insecurity and chronic income poverty and localized near-famine conditions. Peru Rural households that reported a disaster impact in 2002 on average had less access to public services, were less well integrated into the market and had a higher proportion of agricultural income. Sri Lanka A very strong correlation was found between the proportion of population living below the poverty line and the number of houses damaged due to floods, and a less strong but significant correlation between this population group and houses damaged due to landslides. This highlights that exposed human settlements and unsafe, vulnerable housing are poverty factors that increase the likelihood of suffering greater loss due to natural hazard. Tamil Nadu, India Mortality in areas with manifestations of extensive flood risk was higher in areas with vulnerable housing. Similarly, tropical cyclone housing damage was inversely related to the literacy rate. If literacy is taken to be a proxy for poverty again this indicates that the poor were more likely to suffer housing damage typically because their houses are more vulnerable or situated in more exposed locations. Mortality amongst the socially and economically excluded scheduled castes was also higher in blocks with a high proportion of vulnerable housing. 3.7.4 Disaster impacts and poverty outcomes Disaster impacts include death, injury, acute and chronic illness, disruption of socio-economic activities and damage or destruction to property and natural resources and other physical assets. In rural areas, hazard impacts may include the loss of crops and livestock due to flood or drought with a consequent reduction in income from loss of cash crops and dairy output, or food intake from loss of staple foods. Similarly, loss of assets can affect income-producing activities, including transport, infrastructure, housing and livestock-raising; but can also lead to income or welfare reductions, for example reduced expenditure on education to fund house repair. The effectiveness of assets to buffer household losses If households have not lost assets these can be sold to buffer losses. However, asset prices tend to be depressed after a disaster, as many people 81 81 Chapter 3 Deconstructing disaster risk: patterns and poverty trends at the local level sell possessions at the same time, therefore compromising the effectiveness of the coping response. This is particularly the case for livestock or other possessions in remote rural areas or in conflict zones with limited access to markets. The limited success of asset-coping strategies translates into consumption or income shortfalls. The loss of a house can be particularly catastrophic, given that for many poor households it may represent the capitalized savings of multiple generations. It is often also the site of livelihood activities. House sales, however, are rare after disasters and in most cases this is a last resort strategy. Table 3.6 summarizes key findings from national cases. Local and regional outcomes: poverty, income and consumption The empirical evidence also confirms that disaster impacts have a direct and negative effect on welfare at the local and regional levels. Impacts may include reductions in income and consumption, an immediate increase in monetary poverty, both in terms of its depth and breadth, as well as deterioration in other welfare indicators. Table 3.7 gives examples of national case studies. Human development outcomes: education, health and gender inequality Disaster impacts, however, not only lead to reductions in income or consumption but can also negatively affect other aspects of human development. For example, in countries where the socio-economic status of women is low, disasters have a significant effect on the gender gap in life-expectancy given that disasters exacerbate previously existing patterns of discrimination that make women more vulnerable. Table 3.8 gives examples of national case studies. Inequality outcomes Disaster impacts translate into more severe poverty outcomes in poorer households, thus increasing inequality. Table 3.9 gives examples of national case studies. Country Findings Burkina Faso In a sample of rural farmers, livestock sales during the 1984\u20131985 drought only covered 20\u201330% of crop income short-falls due to rainfall deficiencies 31.

Other studies, however, show livestock sales counterbalancing disaster losses: inequalities between household incomes actually fell in the Sahel, the most affected zone. El Salvador In the aftermath of the 2001 earthquakes, affected rural households had to sell productive assets such as animals or land, use savings or borrow, and stop or cancel planned investments in physical capital. Between 2000 and 2002 average household income per capita actually increased in El Salvador (from 5449 to 6957 colones per annum) and extreme poverty rates fell from 33.8 to 26.6%. In poor rural households affected by the earthquakes, average household income per capita was reduced by approximately one third of the pre-shock average (a reduction of 1,760 colones). Those most affected suffered higher loss of housing, productive assets (such as livestock, farm machinery) and other physical and human capital, which reduced their future earning capacity. Ethiopia During the 1999 drought in Ethiopia livestock herds declined by almost 40% and it was estimated that 25% of livestock reductions were distress sales where the seller received less than 50% of the normal price. In a 2004 study of Ethiopian rural households it was found that those affected by a serious drought in the last two years had consumption levels 16% lower per adult than other households, 80% of consumption being basic food 32. Iran Larger families suffered smaller decreases in expenditure following disaster losses in a number of provinces, notably Ardebil, Fars, Gilan, Khorasa, Kordestan, Lorestan and Tehran. Peru Rural families with more livestock holdings had less probability of being \u2018always poor\u2019. Zimbabwe During the 1994\u20131995 drought in Zimbabwe, livestock holdings appeared to buffer drought impacts on children living in poor households 33. Table 3.6: The effectiveness of assets to buffer household losses 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 82 82 Long-term poverty outcomes Short-term impacts can last a few weeks or months. Effective responses, through mech anisms such as food relief, cash transfers, microcredits, insurance and public health interventions, can all contribute to avoiding the translation of disaster impacts into poverty outcomes. The recovery of basic services such as water, sanitation and power is likewise critical. In contrast, if households and communities have few assets to buffer asset losses and if outside assistance is non-existent, late or poorly targeted, disaster impacts may lead to longer-term outcomes, particularly in the case of highly vulnerable groups such as children. Table 3.7: Summary of findings of case studies on local and regional outcomes Country Findings Bolivia A major flood in the city of Trinidad in 2006 increased poverty levels by 12% compared with pre-disaster levels. This increase was 5 times more than the national increment over the same period. A similar situation was observed with the poverty gap, which widened by more than 6% 34. Iran With an urban population of 69%, earthquakes affecting entire provinces are associated with most mortality (95%) and housing destruction (73%) 35. The impact of disaster losses on the expenditure of urban households varied from province to province, according to hazard type, family size and kind of loss, including loss of life and housing damage and destruction. There were significant negative effects in Ardebil, Fars, Gilan, Golestan, Khorasa, Khuzestan and Kordestan, most of which are highly disaster prone provinces 36. Mexico Municipalities that reported disaster losses between 2000 and 2005 experienced a 3.6% increase in food poverty, a 3% increase in capacity poverty and a 1.5% increase in asset poverty 37. Municipalities that reported losses associated with floods experienced an increase in food poverty of 3.5%, and with drought by 4.2%. Municipalities that reported disaster losses experienced an average reduction of 0.006 in their Human Development Index, equivalent to losing on average 2 years of human development gains over the same period: a very substantial reversal 38.

Children in communities with 50% of their crop affected and aged 6\u201324 months at the time gained 0.9 cm less in height over a six-month period when compared to communities whose percentage of damaged crop area was 25% 42. Evidence of short-term impacts on adults has also been found. For instance, a study on a group of 1,447 households in Ethiopia during the 1994\u20131995 drought found that the Body Mass Index in communities with poor rainfall and low landholdings had dropped by 0.9% 43. Nepal People living in areas that had been affected by floods in the past were more likely to suffer from wasting and low weight. Similarly the population in areas affected by landslides was associated with higher percentages of stunting. Zimbabwe Women along with young children were the most affected by the 1994\u20131995 drought 44. Women\u2019s body mass fell by about 3% while no impact was found on men\u2019s health. With good rains the following year, women regained much of the lost body mass but the effects of drought on health might not always be temporary. 83 83 Chapter 3 Deconstructing disaster risk: patterns and poverty trends at the local level Nutritional shortfalls in children can affect their human development later in life. Although there is evidence that children can catch up over time if they recover the lost nutrition48, stunting is a serious problem with far-reaching consequences. Children with slow height growth are found to perform less well in school, score poorly on tests of cognitive functions and generally develop more slowly. The permanent effects from disasters are not restricted to nutrition or health. Given the very low penetration of catastrophe insurance in rural areas in Africa, Asia and Latin America, many households have major difficulties in recovering productive assets lost in, or sold to cope with, a disaster. This means that many years after disaster rural households are still facing difficulties in recovery. When households start with very few physical assets, for example, livestock in a rural context, recovery is challenged. Finally, it is clear that successive disaster impacts seriously undermine coping strategies 49. This is particularly critical in areas exposed to multiple hazards or to recurring drought or flood. Table 3.10 presents key findings in the above contexts. Table 3.9: Summary of findings of case studies on inequality outcomes Country Findings Honduras In 1998, Hurricane Mitch destroyed over a quarter of the household implements, tools or animals of the wealthiest 20% of households but only a tenth in the case of the poorest 20% of households. But because these latter had so few assets to start with, they experienced more severe outcomes due to hurricane losses. The poorest group lost nearly 18% of their pre-Mitch asset value and 40% of their total crop value, compared to just 3% and 25% respectively for the wealthiest group 45. A different study showed that poorer households lost a greater percentage of their productive wealth (31%) than did wealthier households (8%) 46. Indonesia Following the 2005 tsunami in Aceh, a World Bank study identified two overlapping but distinct vulnerable groups: those who were structurally poor before the tsunami and those who lost assets due to the tsunami. After the tsunami, the recovery of this second group was facilitated because they retained capacities, such as their education, that facilitated recovery, which the structurally poor never had 47. Mexico The reduction in the HDI in those municipalities that had suffered disaster impacts was significantly greater in those that already had the lowest levels of human development. Peru Disasters between 2002 and 2006 had a drastic effect on the monthly per capita consumption of rural households in 2006. This impact was significantly greater in the poorest quarter of families, whose consumption was reduced by 3.85%, compared to the wealthiest quarter, whose consumption was reduced by only 1.2%. Country Findings Bangladesh Improved targeting of assistance to the poor and the positive impact of food assistance after the 1998 floods meant that per capita consumption actually increased in the case of households whose head had less than four years of schooling and with less than median assets 50. The 1998 floods had a lower impact on the affected population than the 1988 floods, even though the 1998 floods were of a considerably longer duration in most places. One of the reasons for this was that previous to 1988 there had been two major floods, in 1984 and 1987, which undoubtedly left many poorer households in a precarious situation and unable to recover their pre-disaster situation before the next disaster", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f5dfb99d-23ef-45d4-9594-2f186514430f": {"__data__": {"id_": "f5dfb99d-23ef-45d4-9594-2f186514430f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "22b772ecef61f042f7a1d01f3cde703fd2e76c93a2b2855a0851e08a97716800"}, "3": {"node_id": "97799df6-44aa-4ec5-bf8c-356112189881", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4bbc6f8ec2a57a2c5c649a3a05a523b05f4d3a62f4b173772510b0c69355b5d0"}}, "hash": "16642d5f2a334e1bacc7c6424f7fc0de868befed2efd37bd74432e4bd2dbd82e", "text": "occurred 51. Ethiopia Children between the womb and 36 months of age at the time of the 1984 drought-induced famine in Ethiopia and living in drought shock villages were almost 3 cm shorter ten years after the disaster than their non-affected counterparts 52. Ten years after the famines in Ethiopia in the mid-1980s, cattle holdings in asset-poor households were still only two-thirds what they were just before the famine 53. Households that had most difficulty in coping with the droughts of the mid-1980s had about 4\u201316% lower growth between 1994 and 1997 \u2013 on average a period of substantial recovery of food consumption and nutrition levels 54. Table 3.10: Summary of findings from long-term effects of disasters 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 84 84 Country Findings Honduras Households without asset losses in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch showed substantially higher growth 30 months later than those that suffered losses. Amongst the poorest quarter of households, those who had suffered losses had experienced growth of \u20135% by 2001 while those that hadn\u2019t experienced growth of 8.8%: a gap of 13.8%. This gap was much smaller (5.1%) in the case of wealthier quartile of households 55. Indonesia Poverty increased only slightly after the tsunami, probably reflecting the influx of humanitarian assistance compensating for losses. Since 2006, poverty has declined below pre-tsunami levels facilitated by reconstruction activities and the end of the conflict. At the household level, the receipt of government and non-government organization (NGO) aid increased the likelihood of escaping from poverty by 43% and 23%, respectively. India (Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh) The proportion of households experiencing longer (3\u20135 year) spells of poverty increased from 5.5% to 14.8% in the case of households that had experienced crop losses due to deficient or delayed rainfall 56. When crop shocks occur in three consecutive years there is an increase in the proportion of \u2018always poor\u2019 (6\u20137 years). Even relatively affluent households (i.e. owning large amounts of land, possessing a few years of education and affiliated to upper castes) are highly vulnerable to persistent poverty under consecutive droughts. Iran Housing damage and destruction had a positive impact on consumption in a number of provinces including Khuzestan (climatic disasters), Kerman and Lorestan due to assistance in recovery and reconstruction by the government. Nicaragua Households that experienced a drought between 1998 and 2001 had 10\u201315% more probability of a downward welfare trajectory, with a 10% higher probability of remaining at the bottom of the welfare distribution in 2005 57. Peru Between 2004 and 2005 households that experienced a disaster in those years were up to 4.6 times more likely to be \u2018always poor\u2019 than \u2018never poor\u2019. Zimbabwe Coping actions in the 1991\u20131992 drought, the worst in living memory, both by households themselves as well as by the public sector were limited by the demands placed on such mechanisms by previous droughts in 1982\u20131984 and 1986\u20131987. Food consumption fell in spite of the variety of smoothing mechanisms employed by households and government. Quite dramatic negative impacts were found in a group of 400 households if nutritional deficiencies occur in children between the womb and about 2 years of age. In this case, temporary poor health and malnutrition during the drought lead to stunting, lower school achievement and levels of attainment later in life, as well as lower health and lower wages and productivity as adults. Sixteen years after the 1982\u20131984 droughts the affected children had 7% lower adult earnings than those not affected by the drought 58.

Additionally the chapter looks at the magnifying effect of climate change as a global driver of risk. Summary of findings 1. Vulnerable rural livelihoods Livelihood vulnerability is an underlying driver of disaster risk in many rural areas. Poverty and constrained access to productive assets mean that rural livelihoods that depend on agriculture and other natural resources are vulnerable to even slight variations in weather and seasonality.

Very low resilience means that even small disaster impacts are translated into poverty outcomes. Resilience is further undermined by the impacts of other hazards such as conflict and HIV/AIDS. 2. Poor urban and local governance Most cities in developing countries have only been able to absorb urban growth through the expansion of informal settlements. The location of such settlements in hazard prone areas, the vulnerability of housing and local services and the lack of provision of the infrastructure necessary to reduce hazard configure urban disaster risk. Poverty limits the capacity of many households in such cities to gain access to well- sited land and safe housing. However, the translation of poverty into risk is conditioned by the capacity of urban and local governments to plan and regulate urban development, enable access to safe land and provide hazard mitigating infrastructure and protection for poor households. 3. Ecosystem decline Ecosystems have a declining capacity to provide both provisioning and regulating services in both rural and urban areas. Ecosystem decline increases hazard levels at the same time as it decreases resilience, acting as a third underlying risk driver. 4. Climate change Climate change will have an asymmetric impact on disaster risk, magnifying its already disproportionate impact on the rural and urban poor. The interactions of climate change with hazard levels; exposure, vulnerability and resilience are mediated by the underlying drivers that translate poverty into disaster risk, such as vulnerable rural livelihoods, poor urban and local governance, and declining ecosystems. If the underlying drivers of risk are addressed then climate change impacts could also be addressed. Rural livelihoods Approximately 75% of the people living below the international poverty line of US$ 1.25 per day live and work in rural areas 1: 268 million in sub-Saharan Africa; 223 million in East Asia and the Pacific, and 394 million in South Asia alone. Even in countries experiencing rapid economic development, such as China, there are 175 million rural dwellers below this poverty line. Rural poverty, therefore, not only characterizes least developed countries in regions such as sub- Saharan Africa, but also stagnating rural areas in countries that are developing rapidly 2. In such contexts, disaster risk is associated with livelihoods unable to sustain minimum levels of welfare and which are often exposed and vulnerable to even minor weather variations. In poor rural areas, as demonstrated by the empirical evidence presented in Section 3.7, disaster impacts are then translated into both short-term and long-term poverty outcomes, which in turn 4.1 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 90 90 increase vulnerability and decrease resilience to future disaster losses. Disaster losses affect huge numbers of people in poor rural areas. In sub- Saharan Africa, during the 2001\u20132003 drought, it was estimated that 206 million people, or 32% of the region\u2019s population, were undernourished \u2013 a little less than the total 268 million rural poor in the region 3. Poor rural areas, particularly isolated and remote regions, are often characterized by highly vulnerable housing, weak or non-existent emergency services and infrastructure (including health services and disaster preparedness and response organizations), as well as isolation and remoteness. Densely populated but poor rural areas, exposed to tropical cyclones, major floods and earthquakes, therefore have a very high mortality risk, as was documented in Chapter 2. 4.1.1 Rural livelihoods and poverty In many rural areas across developing countries, people\u2019s livelihoods still depend heavily on agriculture and other natural resources. Rural farm-based livelihoods are generally characterized by low input and low output agriculture due to limited access to productive assets such as land, labour, fertilizers, irrigation, infrastructure and financial services. For households without the minimum assets necessary to support a viable livelihood, the result is poverty. Without access to the necessary inputs, poor households harvest extremely low yields. Low crop yields result in low incomes and chronic food insecurity, leaving many rural households close to the poverty line. For example, average maize yields in Malawi are only one tenth of yields in the United States of America 4. Opportunities for processing and adding value to agricultural production are also often limited, due to asset constraints, trade barriers and poor market access. Economic poverty in rural areas is usually underpinned by a range of other factors including: lack of political participation; scant or non-existent provision of health and education services; geographical isolation or marginalization; discrimination and exclusion due to caste, race, gender or ethnicity; and the migration of the young to cities. Such factors often influence access to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8688fe3e-e5f8-4218-aef9-42da26a36d66": {"__data__": {"id_": "8688fe3e-e5f8-4218-aef9-42da26a36d66", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fc728fcafb8880ae668d9a2fb1d205e335f4ad95cbc35d79be6e76764d7c507e"}}, "hash": "fc728fcafb8880ae668d9a2fb1d205e335f4ad95cbc35d79be6e76764d7c507e", "text": "infrastructure, health and education, and either obliquely or directly determine economic entitlements. Economic poverty and lack of entitlements then reiterate these other poverty factors, which in turn further limit access to assets. Livelihoods in rural areas are further limited by a lack of economic diversification, thin markets and weak and costly mechanisms of exchange. This exposes rural producers to price swings in response to local variations in production, that can drastically reduce the income that can be obtained from harvests and may encourage a risk-averse preference for subsistence rather than market-based agriculture. The strength of markets tends to be inversely related to their distance from urban centres. Remote rural areas are more likely to have imperfect or missing markets than those closer to urban centres, often due to a lack of access to decent roads 5. Conversely, rural areas with strong urban networks have deeper markets and a more intense exchange of commodities and services, leading to enhanced livelihood opportunities. Rural livelihoods are also subject to the operation of national and global markets for agricultural products. Some countries open domestic markets for imported food, which keeps prices low for urban consumers, while others protect national production through import tariffs. This affects rural households differentially, according to whether they are net producers or consumers of food. Import tariffs and subsidies to agricultural production in developed countries likewise have drastic impacts on rural livelihoods in developing countries. Box 4.1 illustrates how a food crisis in Niger was conditioned by the operation of markets. In the light of all the above factors, and in the absence of formalized microfinance institutions in many countries, poor rural households are often forced into taking loans from money lenders at very high rates of interest. In India, close to 50% of farm households are indebted to a level that could thwart their long-term livelihood security 9. In several Latin 91 Chapter 4 The heart of the matter: the underlying risk drivers 91 entire harvest. Major drought events can destroy agricultural production and livestock over wide areas for several years. Poor rural households are often disproportionately exposed to weather-related hazards. Historical patterns of land distribution and land tenure tend to discriminate against the poor who may only have access to marginal and unproductive land including areas prone to flooding, with erratic or minimum rainfall or with poor soil. Patterns of rural land distribution remain highly unequal in many regions, particularly in Latin America. At the same time, poor rural households are more vulnerable. For example, they usually do not have access to improved seeds, irrigation technology and other inputs that can reduce the vulnerability of crops to drought, and are often dependent on rain-fed agriculture, which is far more sensitive to even small variations in weather than irrigated agriculture. Household dependence on a single main harvest for most annual requirements of food and income further increases vulnerability. Poor and indebted households also have little or no surplus capacity to absorb crop or livestock income losses and to recover. They thus have very low resilience to even the smallest weather irregularity or hazard impact. A small loss in income may be devastating and set off a ratchet effect that feeds back into further poverty and future vulnerability, due to a lack of asset reserves, the absence of other income earning opportunities, and the non-existence of economic and social safety-nets. Even in good rainfall years, the annual hungry season in rural areas can last for several months, characterized by high food prices, hunger, malnutrition and debilitating diseases such as diarrhoea and malaria. There are few employment opportunities; most available work is low-paid agricultural labour, which can only be undertaken at the cost of neglecting the household\u2019s own farm, again setting up a poverty ratchet effect of low-yielding harvests, working on neighbours\u2019 farms for food and further under- production in future years. Box 4.1: Niger food crises 6 The 2005 Niger food crisis is an extreme manifestation of how structural problems and negative socio-economic conditions in countries such as Niger can create a risk nexus in the region. Food production records for 2005 show a cereal shortfall of 9% or 250,000 tonnes in Niger mainly due to drought and locust infestations in 2004\u20132005. According to Oxfam, the Niger 2004 harvest was, in fact, not the lowest the country experienced in past years. It was only 11% below the 5-year average and food was available in the region during the crisis. However, cereal shortage increased to about 16% due to a fall in purchasing capacity, especially among agropastoral populations who were isolated from trading networks and highly dependent on cereal", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "78c4bd5f-f1a6-4fea-a230-5495e8933ec8": {"__data__": {"id_": "78c4bd5f-f1a6-4fea-a230-5495e8933ec8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fe601c43657c4ba9ba309d4310564375d49cb4f0f333ddc68d4fbb44d046f0b9"}}, "hash": "fe601c43657c4ba9ba309d4310564375d49cb4f0f333ddc68d4fbb44d046f0b9", "text": "traders especially near the Nigerian border. Weak socio-economic and political structures underpinned the very high vulnerability of these particular groups who were worst affected 7. High market prices and increasing poverty (which increased from 40% of the population below poverty line in 1990 to 66% in 2004) provoked the food crisis in Niger, even though food was available for purchase. Eventually, some 12 million people needed food aid in Niger and the surrounding region, with about 800,000 children affected 8. American countries access to formal credit is only half as common in rural areas as in urban areas, while in Pakistan and in Cameroon less than 5% of the amount borrowed by poor rural households is obtained from formal lenders. Indebtedness further constrains access to assets, entrenching poverty 10. 4.1.2 High exposure and vulnerability to weather-related hazards and low resilience to loss Agricultural livelihoods are highly sensitive to weather irregularities associated with seasonality per se. Even a brief break in rains at a key stage of the growing cycle can spell significant harvest loss. Localized weather-related hazards such as storms, frosts, floods, heat waves, cold spells and minor droughts can mean the loss of an 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 92 92 4.1.3 Disaster losses feeding back into poverty Livelihood strategies to minimize risks include diversifying livelihoods to spread risk, farming in different ecological niches 11 and building social networks that pool risk. However, many such strategies are simply short-term responses to poverty and food insecurity that may exacerbate and increase poverty and reduce human development in the longer term. For example, farmers with insecure land tenure do not invest in land improvement. Families with limited access to formal employment prefer to send their children to work rather than to school. Entrepreneurs without access to microfinance or insurance do not undertake potentially lucrative, but high risk activities. As Box 4.2 shows, households may concentrate on low risk and diversified activities, foregoing higher returns from specialization. For example, a shift from cash crops to subsistence farming, and from labour-intensive to less intensive but less profitable crops may reduce short-term risk but may exacerbate longer-term food availability and access, due to reduced production and income 14. Furthermore, faced with scarcity, poor households may have to adopt depleting coping strategies, such as overgrazing, deforestation or unsustainable extraction of water resources that in the long-term magnify hazard levels and further aggravate disaster risk. When such mechanisms fail, for example during an intensive drought event, households become acutely vulnerable to even minor losses. As Figure 4.1 shows, ex post coping typically follows a predictable and logical sequence, starting with strategies that are easily reversed, such as a mild reduction in food consumption, cutting back on non-essential spending or selling surplus livestock to buy food. These are followed by higher cost strategies that are less easily reversed, such as selling breeding livestock, borrowing at high interest rates or begging from friends and neighbours, with high social costs in terms of lost status and self-respect. Once these strategies are exhausted, families must sell their key productive assets (such as land) and migrate to survive. As the empirical cases presented in Section 3.7 show, in general terms, households with more assets are less vulnerable because assets provide buffers against disaster loss. These include not only physical assets, such as land and livestock, but also financial assets like savings; human capital assets such as marketable skills; or social capital assets such as networks of influential friends 16. For example, rural families that own many livestock can sell some animals to buy food if a drought devastates their harvest. The relationship between vulnerability and assets, however, is often not so simple. Intensive disasters may destroy all assets, reducing the value of asset buffers. Converting future streams of income to buy food may ensure short-term survival but Box 4.2: Risk averse livelihood strategies Farmers in rural Ethiopia between 1994 and 1999 were less likely to invest in fertilizer in drought prone areas, because the investment would be lost if the harvest failed due to drought 12. However, without fertilizer productivity is very low, constraining the capacity of farmers to accumulate sufficient assets to absorb loss when a drought occurs. It was estimated that fertilizer application rates would have been 43% higher if variations in village level rainfall during this period were reduced by one standard deviation. Livestock often act as a \u2018liquid asset\u2019, permitting their owners to undertake other, more risky, activities.

Two- thirds of this loss was due to ex ante strategies by which households try to minimize the impact of risk (for example, by building up livestock holdings to cope with consumption risk) 13. 93 Chapter 4 The heart of the matter: the underlying risk drivers 93 ultimately decreases livelihood viability and increases long-term poverty and disaster risk. Rather than coping strategies, they could perhaps be better characterized as a failure to cope with disaster risk, with far-reaching and damaging effects on other activities and asset holdings. Over time, repeated disasters have a poverty ratchet effect on increasingly weakened livelihoods, steadily undermining the ability to recover and pushing rural households further towards chronic poverty and deprivation. Again as highlighted by the empirical evidence presented in Section 3.7, pastoralists, in particular, take much longer to recover from asset depletion than crop farmers, as they depend on reproductive capital, which once eliminated takes a long period of time to recover. In the case of repeated droughts, pastoralists do not have time to recover before another event occurs 17. Distress sales of assets also act as poverty ratchets, with irrecoverable losses of productive resources, locking people into poverty traps from which they cannot escape without external support. For example, during the food crisis in Malawi in 2002, desperate rural families sold off their most valuable possessions such as livestock, radios, cooking utensils and furniture at distress prices of less than half their replacement cost 18. This further polarizes rural societies because it enables wealthy households to accumulate assets at undervalued prices. Households may be forced into selling some of their food production at low prices after harvest to meet urgent cash needs, only to buy this food back later in the year at two or three times the selling price in order to bridge the consumption gap before the next harvest. Surplus producers benefit from price rises because their income from crop sales increases but deficit producers are impoverished by having to buy food at high prices. This issue is illustrated by Figure 4.2, which projects the effect of a 10% increase in maize prices on the welfare of different wealth groups in rural Malawi 19. While such seasonal price variations are normal in tropical agriculture, they are magnified following disaster losses. If food is scarce and rural households are forced into selling assets to finance food purchases, usually food prices are forced up while asset prices are forced down. In intensive drought disasters that can affect entire regions over several years, the coping mechanism breaks down completely as households have no more assets to sell and food is not simply overpriced, but generally unavailable. In many rural contexts, the loss of produc- tion and income due to weather irregularities is only one, and not necessarily the most impor- tant, of a number of risks. Households are often faced with other hazards such as market shocks, health risks including malaria, HIV/AIDS and diarrhoeal diseases, and conflict: these configure scenarios of compound risk, where the impact of one hazard increases vulnerability to another. Disaster impacts are magnified in households where resilience has been heavily reduced by these other hazards. In such multi-hazard scenarios, it 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Asset sales Migration Informal transfers Livestock sales Famine foods Borrowing Reduced spending Rationing 6 8 27 34 36 37 40 64 % of households (n = 830) Figure 4.1: Coping strategies during a drought in Namibia, 1992 15 Source: Sabates- Wheeler, et al., 2008.

The impact of these other hazards is examined in Appendix 2, Note 2.3. 4.1.4 Non-farm income and social protection Household and community-level coping strategies are increasingly supported by non-farm income. At present, non-farm activities provide up to 42% of rural household income and employ up to one third of the rural labour force in the developing world. Sources of non-farm income include agroprocessing, other manufacturing, trade and transport, construction, finance and personal services, and remittances. These latter now account for a large share of non-farm income in many countries 20. Migration, both seasonal and more permanent, is another key coping strategy as it allows those household members who migrated to provide income to those who remain. For example, seasonal migration in Bangladesh has always been employed by poor rural households as a strategy to maintain livelihoods and cope with drought 21. In addition, there is growing evidence, from South Asia in particular, that financial assistance from government and local institutions (see Box 4.3), such as NGOs, is becoming more widely available to strengthen rural livelihoods, including microfinance schemes and social protection measures 22. When such schemes are available, rural households are less likely to reduce food intake or dispose of productive assets as coping mechanisms. For example, decades before cash-for-work became a popular relief exercise, the Indian Government adopted a drought relief programme for rural communities affected by seasonal droughts. This gave them alternative seasonal employment in construction or other services with the aim of assuring a minimum wage for poor households in times of rural distress. Subsidies towards or exemptions from fees for state services is another common channel of social assistance in low-income countries, as are programmes which target cash or in-kind benefits to children in school (e.g. the Bangladesh Food-For-Education or the Brazilian Bolsa Escola programmes). The effective application of exemption from user fees on the basis of poverty criteria is, like other forms of social assistance, a major administrative challenge \u2013 and the experience in the health field in poor countries is not always encouraging 24. Similarly, as will be discussed in Chapter 6, financial mechanisms to increase resilience, such as microcredit and index-based crop insurance, are now becoming more widely available to rural households in many countries 25. 4.1.5 Disaster mortality risk in poor rural areas The high structural vulnerability of housing, schools, infrastructure and other assets in poor rural areas exposed to floods, tropical cyclones and earthquakes is a direct consequence of rural poverty. Rural housing is usually built with local Box 4.3: National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme (NREGP), India 23 The National Rural Employment Guarantee Act was notified on 7 September 2005 with the aim of reinforcing the Indian State\u2019s commitment to livelihood security in rural areas. The programme is significant in that it creates a rights-based framework for wage employment programmes and makes the government legally bound to provide employment to those who seek it. The National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme (NREGP) marks a paradigm shift from previous wage employment programmes by providing a statutory guarantee of wage employment. The objective of the NREGP is to enhance the livelihood security of people in rural areas by guaranteeing 100 days of wage employment per financial year to any rural household whose members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. The Act further aims to create durable assets and strengthen the livelihood resource base of the rural poor. The choice of works suggested in the Act address the causes of chronic poverty such as drought, deforestation, soil erosion, etc., so that the process of employment generation is on a sustainable basis. The experience with NREGP so far suggests that it is one of the main planks of rapid poverty reduction in India\u2019s Eleventh Five Year Plan. 95 Chapter 4 The heart of the matter: the underlying risk drivers 95 materials and labour, but crucially with building techniques that do not provide hazard resistance. The collapse of heavy earth walls in rural housing in Kashmir in the 2005 earthquake and the lack of protection offered by flimsy bamboo and thatch houses in the 2008 Myanmar tropical cyclone, contributed to the massive mortality in both cases. The isolation of many poor rural areas combined with under-investment by government in infrastructure, such as roads, educational or health facilities, or in disaster preparedness and response capacities, further increases asset and mortality risk. For example, as highlighted in Chapter 2, mortality risk to floods is highest in remote rural areas in poor countries.

The direct economic cost of asset loss in rural areas may be very low, precisely because of the low monetary value and scarcity of rural assets and under-investment in infrastructure and services. The replacement of assets such as houses may be less of a challenge than in urban areas, precisely because so many of the inputs are non-monetary. However, the apparent rapidity of recovery is deceptive. Large-scale mortality and injury and the loss of livestock and household possessions can devastate rural livelihoods, feeding back into increased poverty and vulnerability in the face of more frequently occurring localized weather events. Case studies from Pakistan (see Box 4.4) and Myanmar (see Box 4.5) illustrate how poor rural livelihoods in remote areas configure mortality risk for earthquakes and tropical cyclones. Box 4.4: Earthquake impacts in rural Kashmir, Pakistan26 In 2005, the Kashmir region in Pakistan experienced an earthquake of 7.6 magnitude. Four districts \u2013 Bagh, Muzafarabad, Neelum and Rawlakot \u2013 in the Kashmir region were affected by the disaster. The earthquake killed over 46,500 people, while 33,489 were injured. Around 329,600 houses collapsed, which resulted in displacement of over 2 million people. Casualties and injuries in the region were attributed to the collapse of poor quality, single storey, un-reinforced stone masonry buildings and reinforced concrete frame school buildings. The stone masonry walls consisted of irregularly placed undressed and mostly rounded stones that were laid in mud mortar or even dry in some cases. It was observed that local people did not have knowledge about earthquake resilient construction technologies, the cost of which was beyond the capacity of the majority. Kashmir is a predominantly rural society, with the majority living in small settlements on mountain sides. The rural economy mainly depends upon agriculture and livestock rearing. There is no irrigation system and the crops are mainly rain-fed. Some households have orchards of fruit trees, such as apple and almond. The little income that people have from crops and orchards is barely enough for their subsistence. People do not have savings to use on improving their living or housing standards or to develop other income generating ventures. The second key source of income is remittances from migrants. In the earthquake affected area of Northern Kashmir, skilled people from the region migrate in search of better opportunities. Those left behind are mainly the unskilled, illiterate, women and the elderly. They are dependent for their survival upon remittances and are responsible for taking day-to- day decisions, such as about the construction of a house. Most of the mountainous settlements are not connected to paved roads and transport to and from cities is scarce. Given the geography of the region and the lack of proper road infrastructure, it is extremely difficult for people to bring in construction materials such as steel, bricks and cement from outside even if they could afford it. In this scenario it is unrealistic to expect safer construction practices in Kashmir. In the aftermath of the earthquake, the Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority, in collaboration with the National Society of Earthquake Technology, have trained thousands of masons in safer construction practices. However, since local people cannot afford the higher wages demanded by the trained masons, many have left for cities, such as Karachi, where they are better paid. This indicates the difficulty of promoting earthquake safety in Kashmir until development conditions such as income, education and road networks are improved. 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 96 96 Box 4.5: Tropical cyclone Nargis in the delta region of Myanmar 27 Tropical cyclone Nargis was the worst disaster in the recorded history of Myanmar and the sheer magnitude of devastation typifies how lack of development configures disaster risk. On the 2nd and 3rd May 2008, the Ayeyarwady Delta region of Myanmar was battered by the tropical cyclone. Official government figures put the number of dead or missing at more than 130,000. About 2.4 million people were severely affected out of a total of 4.7 million people living in the affected areas. During the Village Tract Assessment (VTA) carried out under the Post-Nargis Joint Assessment, more than a quarter of those interviewed at the community level cited late or incomplete warning as one of the primary reasons for widespread destruction. At the same time, Myanmar\u2019s Department of Meteorology and Hydrology indicates that it was continuously tracking the tropical cyclone and issued timely warnings of an impending landfall. However, the warning never reached the communities at risk.

As a result, on the eve of the tropical cyclone making landfall in the delta, most residents were asleep when the last warning was issued on national radio. More than 75% of those interviewed by the VTA cited weak buildings, particularly houses, as the primary cause of the widespread destruction. More than 80% of rural houses were made of poorly constructed wattle-and-daub walls (a coarse wooden lattice covered with clay) and thatch roofs providing barely adequate protection during normal monsoon months. More robust forms of construction, using brick, cement and steel and better building skills, have not penetrated the rural areas of the Ayeyarwady Delta. The State plays a negligible role in the day-to- day life of most rural communities in the Delta. Even in a highly centralized system of governance and decision-making, the presence of the State below the township/district level is minimal. Communities rely on themselves for almost all the basic services \u2013 water supply, transport, health and basic agricultural extension services \u2013 and have devised their own coping mechanisms including rainwater harvesting and community managed seed banks and systems for production of building materials. These coping mechanisms have served them well in the cases of small- and medium-scale events that occur every three to five years. But a large-scale event like Nargis overwhelmed these community-level systems. The unique development assistance context of Myanmar has meant that support is targeted almost exclusively at the lowest income households. While this has kept the targeted households just above the subsistence level, local small enterprises \u2013 such as rice mills that employ up to 50 workers each \u2013 are outside the net of most assistance. As a result, local economies have not developed resilience to absorb shocks from major natural hazards. In such a context, a discussion on disaster reduction \u2013 whether community-based or focused on country- wide system building \u2013 that is divorced from local development issues and resilience of rural livelihoods seems superfluous. Urban and local governance, poverty and disaster risk People, poverty and disaster risk are increasingly concentrated in cities. By 2008, over half the world\u2019s population was living in urban areas. Since 1950, the urban population of low- and middle-income nations has increased sevenfold. By 2010, it is projected that 73% of the world\u2019s urban population and most of its largest cities will be in low- and middle-income nations 28. In Asia, 43% of the population (or 1,770 million people) will be urban; 79.4% (or 471 million people) in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 40% (or 412 million people) in Africa. Almost all global population growth until 2025 will be in urban areas in these regions 29. How this large and rapid increase in urban population is governed will have major implications as to whether disaster risk can be reduced. In 2000, it was estimated that there were 258 million urban poor 30. However, as poverty becomes urbanized, the structure of household income and consumption changes dramatically. The proportion of income spent on housing, water, sanitation, health care, education and transport increases. The use of a US$ 1.25 4.2 97 Chapter 4 The heart of the matter: the underlying risk drivers 97 poverty line disguises the real dimension of urban poverty, given the high monetary costs of non-food necessities. If poverty includes all those with insufficient income to cover basic needs and who are either homeless or live in poor quality, overcrowded and often illegal accommodation, at least 900 million urban dwellers were poor in 2000. Similarly, at least 900 million urban dwellers lack protection from common life- and health-threatening diseases and injuries31. Chapters 2 and 3 highlighted two concatenated processes through which the urban poor become prone to disaster risk. On the one hand, urban and economic development expanding outwards generates new patterns of extensive risk, associated mainly with flooding and other weather-related hazards and affecting informal settlements on the periphery of large cities, as well as those in small and medium urban centres. At the same time, as cities grow and develop there is an inward concentration, or intensification of disaster risk, associated mainly with earthquakes, tropical cyclones, floods and other major hazards and that causes major asset loss and mortality amongst the urban poor. In both processes, the damage to and destruction of assets, such as housing and local infrastructure, negatively impact the urban poor. For many poor households, houses are assets that not only represent the pooling of inter-generational savings, but also provide a base for livelihood activities. The following section explores how poor urban and local governance", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c42d02b4-f33e-4c4e-a8ae-f5e1ee80f387": {"__data__": {"id_": "c42d02b4-f33e-4c4e-a8ae-f5e1ee80f387", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "80f0b7d5f077a529cb85f27a9b30546318289ece4f4a20fa86e45e72e190a38e"}}, "hash": "80f0b7d5f077a529cb85f27a9b30546318289ece4f4a20fa86e45e72e190a38e", "text": "in many rapidly urbanizing contexts is the underlying risk factor that shapes both these processes. Urban and local governance influences not only how and where cities develop, but in particular, whether the urban poor have access to safe land, housing and the essential infrastructure and services required to live in security. 4.2.1 From poverty to risk Urbanization, understood as an increasing proportion of a nation\u2019s population living in urban centres, is strongly associated with economic growth. By 1940 more than half of global GDP was generated by industry and services. Currently this figure is 97%. By 1980 more than half the global labour force was working in industry and services, a figure that now stands at 65% 32. The nations with the wealthiest economies are all heavily urbanized. Unless they are already predominantly urban, those with the fastest growing economies are urbanizing most rapidly. Nations with stagnant economies are generally those that are urbanizing least. There is also an economic logic to the location of large cities and where rapid city growth takes place; globally and within each continent, the largest cities are heavily concentrated in the largest economies 33. Cities in low- and middle-income nations concentrate a large proportion of global urban poverty because their economic base does not generate sufficient employment and livelihoods to sustain a rapidly growing population. There are no precise figures on urban poverty because many aspects are not measured. Most poor urban households derive most or all their income from work in the informal economy for which there are no income data, while many poverty lines are set without data on the costs of non-food necessities 34. If allowance is made for the cost of non-food necessities, it is common for 35\u201360% of the urban population in low- and middle-income countries to have incomes below the poverty line. Table 4.1 provides estimates for different aspects of poverty in low- and middle-income nations. Cities in high-income countries typically have a life expectancy of 75\u201385 years, under- five mortality rates of less than 10 per 1,000 live births, no informal settlements and close to 100% coverage of water, sanitation and health services. In contrast, cities in least developed and low-income countries, particularly in sub- Saharan Africa and the poorer parts of Asia, often have an average life expectancy of only 40\u201355 years, under-five mortality rates of 80\u2013160 per 1,000 live births, 40\u201370% of their population in informal settlements, and low levels of access to water, sanitation and health services. Within informal settlements in poor cities, these figures are usually higher still. For example, in Nairobi, under-five mortality rates were 150 per 1,000 live births in informal settlements but only 61.5 for the city as a whole 39. Urban poverty is associated with a range of everyday risks including the 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 98 98 impacts of house fires, traffic accidents, pollution and domestic and occupational accidents. These losses feed back into increased poverty and decreased resilience to disaster risk. Informal settlement, inadequate housing, non-existent services and poor health, are reflections of poverty. However, they are also reflections of weaknesses in the way urban growth is planned and managed. The concentration of private capital and economic opportunity in a city does not of itself produce the institutional means to ensure that the supply of land for housing, infrastructure and services keeps up with population growth; nor does it produce the regulatory framework to ensure that the environmental, occupational and natural- hazard related risks generated through urban growth are managed. In poor countries, there is often a mismatch between the economic drivers of urban expansion and the institutional mechanisms to manage or govern the direct and indirect implications of this concentration. This mismatch may be aggravated in some cities by a lack of real will to engage with the urban poor by both national and local governments and by the relative voicelessness of the urban poor 40 including those at risk 41. Many hazard prone cities in wealthy countries, such as in Japan or the United States of America, have been able to grow and adapt without an unmanageable explosion of disaster risk. Urban populations in high income nations take for granted that a web of institutions, infrastructure, services and regulations protect them from hazards. In contrast, only a very small proportion of urban centres in low- and middle- income nations have these capacities, although there are very large variations between cities.

Additionally, support for disaster response and recovery is often limited for the urban poor and may actively discourage the recovery of their land and the rebuilding of their homes and livelihoods.

There are also large numbers of people living on temporary sites (for instance construction workers and often their families living on construction sites) that are close to homeless. Table 4.1: Estimates for the scale of different aspects of urban poverty in low- and middle- income nations 99 Chapter 4 The heart of the matter: the underlying risk drivers 99 only way to absorb large increases in population is through the uncontrolled growth of informal settlements. Inevitably, those with the least purchasing power and least political influence have to occupy land or housing that no-one else wants. Household and community-based action can help reduce disaster risk in urban areas but there are limitations to what this can achieve without government support and without the broader infrastructure and service framework into which community provision can integrate. Many of underlying factors, such as land tenure and the legal status of informal settlements are structural and cannot be addressed easily through local community initiatives. On its own, community- based action cannot finance and build trunk infrastructure, deal with the causes of flooding that are outside their community, equip and staff hospitals, and so on. The translation of urban poverty into disaster risk therefore is related to the quality of urban and local governance: the risks faced by the urban poor have often been constructed and amplified by poor governance. As will be highlighted later in this Report, good urban governance both in the sense of competent, effective, accountable local government and good working relationships with civil society is perhaps the most important factor that can limit, reduce or break the relationship between poverty and disaster risk in cities 43. Extensive risk As documented in Chapter 3, extensive risk, in urban areas, is strongly associated with the impact of localized flooding, fires and landslides in informal settlements. The evolution of extensive risk patterns mirrors that of urban development and territorial occupation and is associated with the increasing hazard exposure of the urban poor, the vulnerability of housing and local infrastructure to hazards and a chronic under-investment in infrastructure such as drainage by city authorities. In most cities, extensive disaster risk is configured by a significant proportion of the population living in informal settlements on dangerous sites and lacking infrastructure and services. Sites exposed to hazard include steep landslide prone slopes, ravine sides and river banks subject to erosion in areas with poor drainage and subject to flooding, and those on landfill and reclaimed land with high levels of seismic hazard. Informal settlements on landslide prone hillsides exist in cities such as Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), La Paz (Bolivia) and Caracas (Venezuela); in deep ravines in Guatemala City; or on land prone to flooding or tidal inundation in Guayaquil (Ecuador), Recife (Brazil), Monrovia (Liberia), and many others 44. Informal settlements, and occasionally government sponsored, low-income housing 45, develop on such sites because the land is deemed unsuitable for residential or commercial development, and because city governments have usually been incapable of addressing the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "437f0846-0d0b-4a1c-9c8f-fda251cb7c3c": {"__data__": {"id_": "437f0846-0d0b-4a1c-9c8f-fda251cb7c3c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d116289b4d17bc5519a61fa8099517c795a88b0276d86964ef14df3aac171a2d"}}, "hash": "d116289b4d17bc5519a61fa8099517c795a88b0276d86964ef14df3aac171a2d", "text": "land needs of the urban poor. Because most informal settlements are illegal, they usually have serious deficiencies in infrastructure and service provision. Those who settle and build their homes in such areas have more chance of avoiding eviction because of their proximity to income-earning opportunities. Accepting disaster risk may, in itself, be a strategy to cope with and minimize other kinds of risk. Access to employment, markets, transport and economic opportunities usually plays a vital role in defining where poor people choose to live in a city. Having to cope with periodic flooding may be considered a minor nuisance if livelihood security is increased. This kind of urban development also magnifies hazard levels. In many urban areas flooding is a product of increased run-off due to building on green areas, an underinvestment in drainage with sufficient capacity to evacuate the run-off, and the encroachment by urban development on natural drainage channels or areas such as flood plains that dissipate flood waters. These factors are often aggravated by the lack of maintenance of existing drainage channels or their obstruction with garbage. As informal settlements are often located in low-lying areas with poor natural drainage and where investment in infrastructure is lowest it is unsurprising that 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 100 100 increasing flood risk predominantly affects the urban poor. Informal settlements often occupy steep slopes, which decreases slope stability and increases the risk of landslide and rockslide hazards, as described in Box 4.6. In other cases (Box 4.7) they may be located on garbage tips. Building on landfill sites or swampy areas is often extremely hazardous in earthquake prone areas. Closely packed settlements of wooden or thatch houses exacerbate fire hazard. The loss of mangrove ecosystems on urban fringes aggravates coastal erosion and increases exposure to storm surges. The housing stock in informal settlements is often highly vulnerable to hazard events. Houses are built and modified informally and illegally and, therefore, without reference to hazard resistant building standards where these exist. The absence of land titles often means that households have neither the incentive to improve housing standards, due to the risk of eviction, nor access to housing finance and technical assistance. When land tenure is obtained it is common for additional stories to be added to buildings without reference to the bearing capacity of walls and foundations. Structurally weak and badly built houses are highly vulnerable to earthquakes, tropical cyclones and floods, further increasing the propensity of the urban poor to suffer loss. The high vulnerability of housing usually extends to infrastructure and basic services. The development of infrastructure and provision of services, including emergency services, often ignore or discriminate against informal settlements, due to legal or other reasons. Much service provision (for example water, sanitation, health care, solid waste management, and sometimes even schools) is therefore private, informal and of poor quality or with inadequate coverage. A high proportion of urban economic activity and the livelihoods it provides, is also outside the formal, regulated economy. Table 4.2 summarizes the different factors that increase both everyday as well as extensive and intensive disaster risk for the urban poor. The informal settlement called 9 October was founded in 1975 on a rocky hillside in the district of El Agustino, Lima. The hillside was urbanized informally from the bottom upwards by nearby agricultural workers. Early constructions of bamboo matting were soon replaced by multi- storey concrete and brick houses and by the 1990s, 9 October had a population of more than 1,300, as well as domestic electricity, water and telephone connections, and property titles. In 1999, a local development plan classified the area as a zone of environmental risk and social vulnerability due to high salinity in the soil which was eroding foundations and containing walls; two and three story houses occupying unstable sites without load-bearing capacity; and leaks from a deteriorated water and sanitation network, which were causing subterranean erosion. In June 2003, part of the hillside subsided and collapsed, damaging 280 houses of which 70 were destroyed. Box 4.6: Hillside collapse in El Agustino, Lima46 Intensive risk Extensive risk characterizes areas, usually settled by the urban poor, in and around both large cities and small urban centres. Localized hazards may also cause intensive impacts as Box 4.7 illustrates. Often, however, intensive risk affects entire cities \u2013 or large areas of cities \u2013 when they develop and expand on seismic fault lines, close to active volcanoes or on coastlines exposed to tropical cyclones, coastal flooding or tsunamis.

Inadequate and often unstable income and thus inadequate access to necessities (food, safe and sufficient water, rent, transport, access to toilets, school fees); indebtedness, with debt repayments significantly reducing income available for necessities; and/or incapacity to afford rising prices of necessities. Very limited capacity to pay for housing, which in urban areas means living in the worst quality homes and neighbourhoods in the least advantageous locations. This often means living in poor quality housing in illegal settlements on dangerous sites lacking provision for infrastructure and services. In most cities and many urban centres in low- and middle-income nations, most low-cost housing is on land sites at risk from flooding, landslides or other hazards, in part because of the location, in part because of the lack of public provision for infrastructure and services. Housing is often of poor quality, so is at risk from storms/high winds and earthquakes. 2. Inadequate, unstable or risky asset base (non-material and material assets, including educational attainment and housing) for individuals, households or communities, including those assets that help low-income groups cope with fluctuating prices or incomes. Very limited capacity to cope with stresses or shocks in everyday life, including rising prices or falling incomes, injuries and diseases. Very limited capacity to cope with disaster events when they occur. 3. Poor quality and often insecure, hazardous and overcrowded housing. High risk levels from physical accidents, fires, extreme weather and infectious diseases. High risk of household accidental fires becoming larger settlement-wide fires; conditions favouring disease transmission may cause epidemics. Housing at risk of damage or collapse from storms and earthquakes. 4. Inadequate provision of \u2018public\u2019 infrastructure (piped water, sanitation, drainage, roads, footpaths, etc.), which increases the health burden and often the work burden. High levels of risk from contaminated water, inadequate sanitation, house flooding from lack of drainage. Lack of infrastructure often the main problem underpinning flooding. Lack of roads, footpaths and drains inhibit evacuation when disaster threatens or happens. 5. Inadequate provision of basic services such as day care/schools/vocational training, health care, emergency services, public transport, communications, law enforcement. Unnecessarily high health burden from diseases and injuries because of lack of treatment including emergency response.. Lack of health care, emergency services and disaster preparedness that should provide rapid response to disaster (and should have a role in reducing disaster risk). 6. Limited or no safety net to ensure basic consumption can be maintained when income falls; also to ensure access to housing, health care and other necessities when these can no longer be paid for (or fully paid for). Very limited capacity to cope with stresses or shocks in everyday life, including rising prices or falling incomes, injuries and diseases. Very limited capacity to recover from disaster \u2013 for instance to afford sufficient food and water, rebuild homes and livelihoods.

Most relied on river or sea ports as their main transport and communication link with other places \u2013 and, of course, river and ocean transport is still a key part of the increasingly globalized economy. 2. The city has outgrown its original site: While the original city site may have been safe, the city has outgrown this site and expanded onto land that is at risk, for instance onto floodplains or unstable hillsides. Many city sites that were safe and well-chosen for cities of 50,000 inhabitants (a comparatively large city 200 years ago) are not safe when the city expands to several million inhabitants. 3. City expansion and development can create new risks: For instance, where urban development occurs without the necessary investments in protective infrastructure, it creates a fast-growing, concentrated, impermeable surface. A lack of investment in storm and surface drains and new urban developments encroaching on important natural drains, exacerbate the risk. 4. Dangerous sites serve low-income households well in that they are the only places where they can find accommodation close to income-earning/livelihood opportunities. The cost of urban housing is inversely related to distance from economic opportunity (which means long and expensive commutes). Low- income households can afford only poor quality, overcrowded and often insecure housing (lacking in infrastructure and services), subject to intensive or extensive risk (e.g. sites at risk of flooding, landslides or earthquakes). 5. Once a city has developed, it rarely disappears, even if it experiences some disastrous flood or earthquake, because there are too many individuals, enterprises and institutions with an interest in that city\u2019s economy. Most of the world\u2019s largest cities have been successful for hundreds of years; many have experienced catastrophic disasters but were rebuilt rather than being relocated. 6. The wealthier groups and most formal enterprises do not face serious risks from floods and storms, due to safer locations, well-built housing, infrastructure provision and insurance. In July 2005 a week of incessant rainfall caused floods in several low-lying areas of Mumbai causing nearly 600 deaths, seriously affecting more than a million people, and dislocating the lives of many millions. Lifeline infrastructure and services including water, sewerage, drainage, road, rail and air transport, power and telecommunications stopped functioning across one of the world\u2019s largest cities. The Government of Maharashtra had developed India\u2019s first urban Disaster Management Plan for Mumbai in the late 1990s, which highlighted flooding as a significant risk, pinpointed bottleneck locations in each ward, and identified vulnerable slums and settlements. However, no systematic action was taken over half a decade to mitigate the risk. Effective mechanisms for disaster management operations were found to be missing; the Disaster Box 4.9: The 2005 Mumbai flooding49 Management Plan existed only on paper. Short- term development gains had been prioritized at the cost of the city\u2019s sustainability. Key development norms were bypassed with results that included rapid urbanization, a constant modification of building norms, the narrowing and congestion of the Mithi River by development, and the construction of informal settlements adjacent to the river. Additionally land reclamation continues to denude the city\u2019s mangroves, mudflats and creeks, which make up its natural drainage systems. A strong political framework for long-term urban infrastructure development and risk reduction will need to be constructed in Mumbai. A culture of risk mitigation and emergency preparedness must be built, involving communities, the private sector, civil society, state and national governments. 103 Chapter 4 The heart of the matter: the underlying risk drivers 103 transport, and the collapse of hospitals, schools and public administration buildings. However, housing destruction and mortality are usually concentrated in the same poor areas that manifest extensive risk. Similarly, the interruption or collapse of economic activities has a greater impact on the economy of the urban poor than on wealthier households with economic reserves. 4.2.2 Disaster impacts and poverty outcomes The losses experienced by poor urban households, as manifestations of extensive and intensive risks, feed back into poverty.

The apparently low economic value of lost assets in informal settlements is a reflection of the deficits in housing, infrastructure and services and understates the impact on poor households. In addition, many losses are qualitative and hard to measure \u2013 for instance work and school days lost and disruptions to informal income-earning activities 51. The empirical evidence of disaster impacts on urban areas presented in Chapter 3, however, showed a resulting increase in poverty (for example in Trinidad, Bolivia) or reductions in expenditure (as in Iran). Within poor urban areas, women are often particularly vulnerable as a result of a range of gender-related inequalities, affecting access to income, land tenure and services. A higher proportion of women\u2019s income is often generated from home-based activities, with the result that they are most affected when houses and neighbourhoods are damaged and destroyed. Existing gender inequalities are also frequently manifested in differential access to the resources and services available to support recovery and reconstruction. It is rare for women\u2019s and children\u2019s needs and priorities to be addressed adequately in the provision of temporary post- disaster settlement, for example, ensuring that health needs are met and protection given against domestic and sexual violence. In general, their needs are not adequately factored into post- disaster recovery and reconstruction planning. 4.2.3 The urbanization of risk in rural economies Extensive disaster risk is not only a characteristic of large cities but also expands centrifugally within countries, mirroring patterns of territorial occupation and economic and urban development. Such patterns in turn reflect broader global economic change: for example, intensive agricultural development for export markets; the demand for biofuels or for drugs such as cocaine and heroine; the expansion of the agricultural frontier, through the construction of roads and settlements in previously sparsely populated areas; the decentralization of manufacturing to areas with low labour costs; and coastal and island tourist development. While these processes manifest differently in each country, their outcomes often include increased migration from rural areas, attracted by income and livelihood opportunities, improved markets for surrounding rural areas, and the rapid growth of small and medium-sized urban centres. Such outcomes transform the risks faced by people in rural economies while configuring new risks in small and medium urban centres. Transformed rural livelihoods In rural economies, the opening of new urban markets may improve the viability of rural livelihoods, increase household incomes and contribute to a reduction in both vulnerability and poverty, through better and easier opportunities to sell agricultural products or to engage in non-agricultural work. Seasonal or permanent migration to urban areas by household members helps to diversify the livelihoods of rural households and remittances now provide an important source of income in many rural areas, 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 104 104 as described in Box 4.10. Worldwide remittance flows are estimated to have exceeded US$ 318 billion in 2007, of which developing countries received US$ 240 billion. The true size, including unrecorded flows through formal and informal channels, is believed to be significantly larger 55. The risks associated with vulnerable rural livelihoods, highlighted in Section 4.1, are rarely found to the same degree in rural areas that are integrated into a strong urban network. Urbanization, however, may also have negative effects on surrounding rural areas. Towns and cities often displace their environmental burdens and risks to rural hinterlands, including pollution, waste and over-extraction of water resources. Migration to urban areas may increase the risk of HIV/AIDS transmission. Household decomposition and depopulation lead to the breakdown of traditional rural coping and risk management mechanisms. At the same time, urbanization often radically restructures social and gender relations, meaning that potential changes in risk affect men and women, the old and young, the wealthy and the poor in different ways. Evidence from Thailand and the Philippines, for example, suggests that more and more migrants are moving alone, either temporarily or permanently, and leaving their families behind due to increasing livelihood pressures. In India, there has been a rapid increase in the number of female headed households as men migrate to cities in search of employment 56. Surveys by the Development Bank of South Africa show that three out of four rural respondents (76%) wanted to remain in their area, despite high levels of poverty. That so many migrate to cities underlines the fact that they move only when they have the means, and see a clear advantage to doing so, in the context of the information and contacts they have available.

Rapid growth both in economic activity and population occurs through the exploitation of new economic opportunities in sectors such as tourism, agro-industry, decentralized manufacturing and illegal drugs, often enhanced by improved communications through the construction of new roads and airports. Already, far more people live in small and medium urban centres in low- and middle-income countries than in mega-cities. In these countries, urban areas with fewer than 500,000 inhabitants account for 22.1% of the population, compared to only 6.6% in large cities with over 5 million inhabitants. However, not all small urban centres are growing rapidly. Isolated towns serving stagnating rural economies may be declining, while at the other extreme urban population growth rates of 20% a year or more have been recorded, for example in the coca growing regions of the Andes 57. Economically dynamic small and medium urban centres attract migrants not only from surrounding rural areas but also from other cities and regions, due to the promise of potentially lucrative income-generating activities. Almost all small and at least some medium urban centres, have weak and poorly resourced local governments, large backlogs in provision of infrastructure, little investment capacity and Box 4.10: Changing livelihood practices: urbanizing rural economies in Africa 52 In many countries, farmers have ceased to grow traditional export crops and commercial staple foods in rural areas remote from roads and urban markets, and instead, diversification into non-farm activities and migration to urban areas have become important livelihood strategies 53. In sub-Saharan Africa linkages between family members in urban and rural areas are traditionally very strong and represent a strategy to spread resources in a risk-prone environment. Economic hardship in urban areas, however, affects such linkages. In Senegal and Zimbabwe, for example, economic downturns forced urban residents to decrease financial support to rural-based relatives, negatively affecting the remittance economy on which so many of the rural poor depend. In Botswana and South Africa, however, urban dwellers\u2019 investment in livestock and housing in home rural areas is a safety net and has continued despite growing uncertainty in the urban centres. Economic crisis may also be encouraging urban to rural movement, especially among retrenched formal sector workers, but the evidence for this remains anecdotal 54. 105 Chapter 4 The heart of the matter: the underlying risk drivers 105 limited technical capacity and knowledge in managing urban development in general and disaster risk in particular. Informal settlements in small urban centres are likely to be poorer and even less well served by infrastructure and services than their counterparts in large cities. While land constraints may be less apparent, many informal settlements exist around small urban centres in hazard exposed locations, due to rapid and haphazard growth, an absence of urban Experiences in the recent past have highlighted the urgent need to increase attention to the threat of earthquakes and other natural hazards that expose students to hazards in schools. The 7.9 magnitude earthquake in Sichuan, China in 2008 caused damage to more than 10,000 school buildings and almost 7,000 schools were completely destroyed. UNICEF estimates that millions of school children were affected; 9,000 children and teachers died. Unfortunately this is not the first such loss. In October 2005, the earthquake in Kashmir was yet another cruel reminder of how vulnerable the region\u2019s schools actually are. In Pakistan over 8,000 out of 9,000 schools were either destroyed or damaged beyond repair by the earthquake. Over 17,000 school-age children died in the collapsed schools, approximately 23% of the total deaths in the earthquake, and over 20,000 more suffered serious injury. Over 80% of schools in Pakistan are unprotected from similar risks 60. Box 4.11: Poorly constructed schools kill pupils during earthquakes 59 The earthquakes of 1995 and 1999 caused significant destruction and damage to housing built on former landfills in the Egoya and other watersheds in the city of Pereira, where there are high levels of seismic hazard. While this area represents only 7% of the urbanized area of Pereira, it concentrated 43% of the damages in the 1999 earthquake. This manifest disaster risk, however, had been gradually constructed over 65 years, through multiple decisions by a wide range of stakeholders, none of whom were aware of the risk accumulation process. Due to high levels of contamination, the river Egoya had been channelled into a culvert. Given the shortage of landfills, the area had then been levelled with garbage and rubble, permitting its urbanization.

Most of these changes were justified at the time for other reasons: the river was made into a culvert for environmental health reasons; the city required land for urban expansion; building in brick rather than bamboo was a sign of modernity. By the time of the 1995 and 1999 earthquakes, the area\u2019s residents had forgotten this history and were unaware of the seismic risk or even that the river Egoya and the landfill had existed. Subsequently, the municipality of Periera carried out a study of seismic microzoning, prohibiting rebuilding in the most hazard prone areas, meaning that at least legally the risk cannot be rebuilt. planning policies and instruments, and a lack of awareness of local hazard patterns by arriving migrants. Housing is also likely to be more vulnerable. This reflects not only the fact that households may be poorer than in large cities: the adaptation of traditional rural building typologies to the realities of urban economies often produces new structural vulnerabilities, as households have to buy materials and labour on the market and have to adapt to a reduced plot size 58. Additionally, as Box 4.11 shows, infrastructure and services provided by and for the poor, in both urban and rural areas, often do not meet even minimum safety standards. The environmental transformation of surrounding rural areas through deforestation, mineral extraction, and the construction of roads and other infrastructure, often dramatically increases the incidence of hazards, such as floods, flash floods and landslides. The processes through which disaster risk evolves in such contexts are far from linear. Risk arises over time through a concatenation of a large number of different individual and collective decisions often involving land speculation, settlement by the poor of some areas and their eviction from others, the mismanagement of environmental resources and many others, in an overall context of weak local governance. The case of Pereira in Colombia (Box 4.12) illustrates these processes in all their dimensions. 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 106 106 Ecosystem decline unintentionally led to the decline of regulating ecosystem services, including those responsible for reducing people\u2019s exposure to hazards, such as fires and floods. An increase in landslide hazard on deforested slopes and of storm surges in areas where mangroves have been destroyed, are other examples of how an increase in provisioning ecosystem services may decrease regulating ecosystem services. While such changes in the distribution of ecosystem services often benefit specific economic interests, the costs are frequently borne by poor urban and rural households. Changes in the supply of ecosystem services may also increase livelihood vulnerability, particularly when livelihoods depend on common pool resources. As Box 4.13 highlights, the destruction of mangroves not only reduces protection against coastal erosion and storm surges but negatively affects artisanal coastal fisheries and the communities that depend on them. The Fourth Global Environment Outlook 63 highlighted the declining capacity of many ecosystems to provide regulating services, including the regulation of flood, drought, People receive substantial benefits or services from ecosystems, categorized as provisioning services (such as food and fibre), cultural services (such as a sense of place or tourism), and regulating services (such as climate moderation or flood reduction). Most ecosystems have been intentionally or unintentionally modified to increase the supply of certain categories of services, and institutions have been developed to govern access to, and use of, these services. However, because ecosystems produce many services simultaneously, an increase in the supply of one service, such as food, can frequently lead to declines in other services, such as flood protection. The Millennium Assessment found that the supply of approximately 60% (15 of 24) of the ecosystem services evaluated were in decline (Table 4.3), while consumption of over 80% of the services was found to be increasing. In other words, the flow of most ecosystem services is increasing at the same time as the total stock is decreasing. In particular, the Millennium Assessment identified that while people have modified ecosystems to increase the supply of food and fibre, these modifications have 4.3 Provisioning ES Regulating ES Cultural ES Crops + Air quality control + Spiritual and religious values + Livestock + Global climate regulation + Aesthetic Values + Capture fisheries \u2013 Local climate regulation + Recreation and ecotourism + Aquaculture + Water flow regulation + Wild foods \u2013 Erosion control + Timber + Water quality regulation + Cotton +/\u2013 Disease control + Wood fuel +/\u2013 Pest control + Genetic resources + Pollination + Biochemicals + Natural hazard", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c4eb965-fd7e-4918-9fd6-88ade3ba0142": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c4eb965-fd7e-4918-9fd6-88ade3ba0142", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2541dd1a4bcc8c0414139a5a73b2e16620329b313a982e23794918eb7658d8c1"}, "3": {"node_id": "91f1d9bb-6a45-46c4-8a94-21cda19589b7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "66552ffcc82180d20b70e941d12ea07e904ecf773b1e8eb645ae05b6438c0e58"}}, "hash": "098afcd02f475127e90dcada068ffba7b7e6ab6e066531cb78f8fdffe226e144", "text": "regulation + Freshwater + ES = ecosystem service.

Several large areas of mangrove were cleared for agriculture and other uses (e.g. paddy fields and salt pans) between 1979 and 2000. The large areas of grey and tan that appear in the previously deep green areas in Figure 4.3 show where the mangroves have been cleared. Mangrove ecosystems occur at the transition between marine and terrestrial ecosystems and provide important services to both. They provide nursery and breeding areas for many marine species and are essential Box 4.13: Mangroves in Myebon, Myanmar for maintaining healthy fisheries. They are also a prime habitat for migratory birds, amphibians and many terrestrial species. In terms of their regulating services, mangroves play a vital role in protecting coastlines from storm surges, flooding and erosion. Mangroves are under pressure throughout much of coastal South Asia where they are being cleared for agriculture, aquaculture and urbanization. Protection of mangroves, as part of overall coastal zone management, will become increasingly important. landslide and other weather-related hazards, as well as to support the livelihoods of poor households through provisioning services. Key examples of ecosystem decline include the decrease in supply of tropical forest ecosystem services, land degradation in the form of soil erosion, nutrient depletion, salinity, the disruption of biological cycles, and increasing water scarcity. Between 1995 and 2005, the global forest area shrank at an annual rate of 0.2%. However, this global figure hides critical regional differences. It is estimated that over the last 15 years approximately 50,000 km2 of primary forest were lost per year, while the area of planted or semi-natural forest has increased by 30,000 km2 64. The loss of primary forest was greatest in Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia and the Pacific, and Africa. Given that forests play a key role in the protection and regulation of soil as well as water catchments, their decline in many countries in these regions may be contributing to the intensification of flooding and drought cycles, as well as landslides due to the deforestation of steep slopes. In addition, forests play a key role in sustaining rural livelihoods. A recent synthesis of data from 17 countries found that 22% of 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 108 108 rural household income in forested regions comes from harvesting wild food, firewood, fodder and medicinal plants, generating a much higher proportion of income for poor rather than wealthy households. Poor rural households in developing countries also suffer disproportionately from land degradation. The direct effects include losses of soil organic content, nutrients, and water storage and regulation, which in turn lead to a loss of productive capacity and wildlife habitat, as well as increases in salinity. The Fourth Global Environment Outlook report 66 indicates a considerable increase in land degradation between 1981 and 2003, characterized by an absolute decline in net primary productivity or biomass production across 12% of the global land area, with an absolute decrease in rain-water efficiency affecting 29% of the global land area. Approximately 15% of the global population of 1 billion people live in the affected areas. The impact of land degradation on rural livelihoods is greater in those areas where livelihoods are already characterized by poverty and vulnerability, such as in sub-Saharan Africa. In the low input\u2013low output agricultural systems common to poor rural areas in such regions, nutrient inputs to the soil are almost always less than the outputs, due to reduced fallow periods and insufficient use of inorganic fertilizer, which may be only 5% of the levels applied in developed countries.

Box 4.14: Rural livelihoods and ecosystem services65 109 Chapter 4 The heart of the matter: the underlying risk drivers 109 Global climate change represents environmental inequity in a most pervasive form, since it is driven by historical levels of emissions that have brought enormous benefits to affluent individuals and societies, yet most of the resulting burdens fall on poorer individuals and societies. A large number of global reports already published or in preparation have described in detail the current and projected changes in climatic factors and the likely impacts 68. As highlighted by the empirical evidence presented in Chapters 2 and 3, disaster risk associated with weather-related hazards is disproportionately concentrated in developing countries and within these countries in poorer sectors of the population. Climate change will act on this uneven and asymmetric distribution of risk and therefore further magnify the disproportionate social and economic impacts of disaster loss on the rural and urban poor. The Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC states that the Earth\u2019s climate system has been undergoing warming over the last 50 years. Mean temperatures are likely to increase, mean precipitation will fluctuate, and mean sea level will rise. By the decade 2090\u20132099, global average surface temperature is predicted to be Global climate change 1.1\u20136.4\u00b0C higher than the 1990\u20131998 average. Sea levels are predicted to rise 18\u201359 cm by the same decade 69. The IPCC indicates that any increase in mean global surface temperature of more than 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, or 1.5\u00b0C above 1990 levels, would lead to a dangerous degree of climate change. The IPCC has developed a set of six scenarios identifying plausible emissions pathways for the rest of this century. None of the IPCC scenarios points to a future below the 2\u00b0C threshold. The possibility is real that a change of 3\u00b0C or more will occur, leading to ecosystem collapse, drastic sea level rise, severe water insecurity and other catastrophic outcomes on a global scale. Changes in climate can decrease the resilience of households and communities, while at the same time increasing hazard. Some of the projected impacts of climate change in Africa, Asia and Latin America are shown in Table 4.4. In general the IPCC has predicted decreasing agricultural yields in warmer environments due to heat stress, aggravated by increased insect outbreaks and wildfires; increased soil erosion and land degradation due to extreme precipitation events; greater livestock deaths caused by an increase in the area affected 4.4 The drainage of approximately 4,800 km2 of wetlands in the Mississippi Delta in the United States of America was one of the underlying factors behind the scale of the flooding associated with Hurricane Katrina. Many areas formerly above sea level were below sea level at the time of Katrina, due to wetland drainage, while the capacity of the wetlands to dissipate storm surge and absorb flood waters had diminished. The forested riparian Box 4.15: The Mississippi wetlands67 wetlands adjacent to the Mississippi River during pre-settlement times had the capacity to store about 60 days of river discharge. Today, the few remaining wetlands have a reduced storage capacity of less than 12 days discharge, implying an 80% reduction of flood storage capacity. This loss of wetlands also contributed substantially to the severity and damage experienced in the 1993 flood in the Mississippi Basin. yields and fish productivity, damage the health of coastal wetlands, and increase coastal flood hazard levels. Excessive groundwater extraction is leading to a potentially irreversible degradation of aquifers, again with compound effects on rural livelihoods.

By the 2080s, agricultural potential could increase by 8% in developed countries, primarily as a result of longer growing seasons. In contrast, in developing countries it would fall by 9% with sub-Saharan Africa projected to experience the greatest fall. Yields from rain-fed agriculture in Southern Africa could be reduced by up to 50% between 2000 and 2020 according to the IPCC. The size of arid and semi-arid areas is projected by the Hadley Centre to increase by 60\u201390 million hectares. In Malawi for example, the production potential for maize is expected to fall by over 10% due to reduced water availability. Maize is the source of 75% of calorie consumption, so this will aggravate the country\u2019s already extreme vulnerability to existing hazard levels. In a normal year, two-thirds of households in Malawi are unable to produce enough maize to cover household needs, and declining soil fertility has reduced maize productivity from 2 tonnes per hectare to 0.8 tonnes over the last 20 years. As described in Section 4.1, the livelihoods of the rural poor often rely heavily on climate sensitive sectors. Climate change will therefore translate into decreased resilience, particularly in areas such as sub-Saharan Africa. Apart from reduced agricultural productivity, resilience will also be affected by direct health impacts from water-borne diseases and malnutrition and indirect impacts for parents who must tend to sick children and the elderly. Rising sea levels also pose a challenge by increasing hazards in low-lying coastal areas. As was discussed in Chapter 2, the population living in coastal areas has grown faster than the overall increase in global population. GDP growth has also been faster in coastal regions. Currently 10% of the world\u2019s total population (over 600 million people) and 13% of its urban population (over 360 million people) live on the 2% of the world\u2019s land area that is less than 10 metres above sea level, known as the Low Elevation Coastal Zone (LECZ) 72. In Asia, 18% of the urban population lives in the LECZ; in small island states this is 16%; in Africa, 12%; and in Latin America, 7%. There are evident risks associated with increased flooding and storm surges exacerbated by sea level rise in cities such as Dhaka, Mumbai and Shanghai, large sections of which are only 1\u20135 metres above sea level. Box 4.16 illustrates the kind of impacts that can be expected in a number of cities in Africa. Apart from those mentioned, others such as Abidjan, Banjul, Port Harcourt and Mombassa are at high risk 73. The impacts of climate change in rural and urban areas are intimately linked. As the Africa By 2020, between 75 and 250 million of people are projected to be exposed to increased water stress due to climate change. Yields from rain-fed agriculture could be reduced by up to 50% in some countries. Agricultural production, including access to food, in many African countries is projected to be severely compromised. This would further adversely affect food security and exacerbate malnutrition. Asia By the 2050s, freshwater availability in Central, South, East and South-East Asia, particularly in large river basins, is projected to decrease. Coastal areas, especially heavily populated mega-delta regions in South, East and South- East Asia, will be at greatest risk due to increased flooding from the sea and, in some mega-deltas, flooding from the rivers. Latin America By 2050, increases in temperature and associated decreases in soil water are projected to lead to gradual replacement of tropical forest by savannah in eastern Amazonia. Semi-arid vegetation will tend to be replaced by arid-land vegetation. Productivity of some important crops is projected to decrease and livestock productivity to decline, with adverse consequences for food security. In temperate zones, soybean yields are projected to increase. Changes in precipitation patterns and the disappearance of glaciers are projected to significantly affect water availability for human consumption, agriculture and energy generation.

Existing patterns of extensive risks, for example flooding and landslides, affecting urban informal settlements may intensify due to more severe and frequent extreme precipitation events and increases in the population and assets exposed, as a result of migration from rural areas. New patterns of risk may also emerge as a result of changes in the geographic distribution of weather-related hazards. In addition, climate change will lead to decreasing resilience, which is likely to disproportionately affect poorer countries and communities. Climate change is therefore also a driver of increasing poverty. However, it is not inevitable that climate change leads to increasing disaster risk. As Chapter 3 illustrated, the rapid increase in the number of extensive floods reported in urban areas in Latin American countries is driven by factors such as the growth of informal settlements in low-lying areas and a chronic underinvestment in the construction and maintenance of drainage infrastructure by both city and national governments. These factors in turn reflect deficiencies in urban and local governance. Increases in the number or severity of extreme precipitation events, due to climate change, will lead to more urban poor households being more affected by more floods. But the changing climate is not responsible for the growth of informal settlements in flood prone areas nor for the lack of investment in urban infrastructure such as drainage. This finding has been reiterated in recent research on the impact of ENSO in the Americas 80. Box 4.16: Impacts of sea level rise in urban areas in Africa Alexandria, Egypt: An assessment of the vulnerability of the most important economic and historic centres along the Mediterranean coast (the cities of Alexandria, Rosetta and Port-Said) suggests that, for a sea level rise of 50 cm, over 2 million people will have to abandon their homes; 214,000 jobs would be lost, and the cost in land and property value and tourism income lost would be over US$ 35 billion. Alexandria alone has more than 3 million inhabitants. However, it is not really possible to put a monetary value on the loss of the world-famous historic, cultural and archaeological sites 74. Lagos, Nigeria: With a total population of around 10 million inhabitants 75, Lagos has very inadequate provision for basic infrastructure to cope with flooding. \u2018Normal\u2019 rainfall brings flooding to many areas of the city, largely as a result of the inadequate provision of sewers, drains and wastewater management. Any increase in the intensity of storms and storm surges is likely to increase such problems; much of the land in and around Lagos is less than 2 metres above sea level. In many areas, roads have been built without complementary gutters for rainwater. Where a drainage system exists, it is often not properly constructed and maintained. The lack of solid waste collection compounds the problem as waste blocks gutters and drains. In addition, many buildings have been erected in ways that block storm-water routes. Little attention is given to clearing the drains in advance of periods of the year when rain is expected. Many low-income settlements are built in areas at high risk of flooding (many on stilts), largely because safer sites are too expensive 76. Cotonou, Benin: Cotonou is Benin\u2019s largest urban centre, its main port and a key part of the national economy; it has around 700,000 inhabitants. The continued advance of the sea, coastal erosion and the rise in sea level, exacerbated by human activity on the coast, have medium- and long-term consequences that are already threatening vulnerable communities and disrupting the least-protected sensitive ecosystems. Some roads, beaches and buildings have already been destroyed by the coastline\u2019s regression in the last ten years 77. In addition, provision for drainage is inadequate; the city has no sewer system and only a small proportion of solid wastes are collected; in addition, most of the population lives in informal settlements 78. 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 112 112 In rural areas more frequent and extreme droughts as well as changes in mean temperatures and precipitation levels will cause further stress to already vulnerable livelihoods. The risk levels faced by rural households will increase as both the number and intensity of hazard events and livelihood vulnerability increase. But again, the changing climate cannot be blamed for risk factors such as chronic rural poverty, lack of market access, HIV/AIDS and the absence of social safety nets. If these factors were addressed, climate change would not necessarily lead to worsening risk for the rural poor.

To reduce the latter, it is necessary to address the underlying drivers that configure risk in the first place. If these drivers are not addressed disaster risk will continue to increase even if climate change is successfully mitigated. Conversely if the drivers can be addressed not only will disaster risk be reduced but also the impacts of climate change. Addressing the underlying risk drivers, therefore, is key not only to disaster risk reduction but also to climate change adaptation. This conclusion has very important policy implications that will be examined in Chapters 5, 6 and 7.

This chapter reviews countries\u2019 progress towards the achievement of the strategic goals and priorities for action. The analysis is based on interim national HFA progress reports completed by 62 national authorities for the period June 2007 to May 2009 (referred to as 2007\u20132009). The methodology and tools adopted for facilitating the global 2007\u20132009 HFA progress review are summarized in Appendix 3, which includes a description of progress and challenges against each of the core indicators and benchmarks applied. The Appendix also contains a list of countries that have completed interim national HFA progress reports as of February 2009. The chapter also examines the extent to which disaster risk reduction is being addressed in strategies for poverty reduction and adaptation to climate change. Summary of findings 1. Areas of HFA progress reported Significant progress has been made in strengthening capacities, institutional systems and legislation to address deficiencies in disaster preparedness and response. Good progress is also being made in the identification, assessment and monitoring of disaster risks and in the enhancement of early warning systems.

Progress by income and regional classification High-income countries have achieved greater progress across all HFA Priorities for Action than middle- and low-income countries. However, while disaster risk reduction considerations are well integrated into different sectors, many countries lack a holistic policy and strategic framework for addressing disaster risk. Some least developed countries report major gaps in institutional, technical, human and financial capacities, which limit their ability to address the HFA. While many low- and middle-income countries have made good progress in developing national policies, legislation and institutional systems, they are challenged by the issue of mainstreaming disaster risk reduction into sectoral and local development. 3. Challenges reported Specific challenges were highlighted by the review, including an ad hoc and dispersed approach to hazard monitoring and risk identification that does not facilitate comprehensive multi-hazard risk assessments; difficulties faced by national disaster risk reduction organizations in engaging development sectors; and a lack of accountability and enforcement in implementation. At the same time, however, the review highlights innovations in disaster risk reduction governance, showing that some of these challenges can be addressed. 4. Climate change and disaster risk reduction Adaptation to climate change faces many of the same challenges as disaster risk reduction. In addition, implementation is still incipient and its policy and planning frameworks are rarely integrated with those for disaster risk reduction. 5. Poverty reduction and underlying risk drivers Many poverty reduction strategies have potential to address the underlying risk drivers and do recognize disaster impacts as a contributing factor to poverty. However, the disaster risk reduction components in such strategies are often limited to preparedness and response aspects. In many countries, poverty reduction and disaster risk reduction are not strongly integrated in terms of policy and planning. 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 118 118 This first biennial HFA review has some limitations that must be made explicit at the outset. The national reports provide a reasonable sample of all regions and income classifications, but many countries remain unrepresented. While in some countries consultation exercises were held as part of the review process, the progress reports are self-assessments by the national authorities and in most countries prepared by the designated HFA focal point or organization responsible for disaster risk management. Reports do not always fully reflect the perspectives of other stakeholders, such as the private sector or civil society, or all sectors of government. Similarly, while some international organizations have contributed thematic reviews of progress for different areas, this iteration of the biennial review did not include modules for regional and international progress reporting. Nevertheless, as the first comprehensive global exercise in reporting progress on the Hyogo Framework\u2019s implementation, this review does provide a unique insight into the current level of commitment to and achievement of the HFA\u2019s strategic goals. Three Strategic Goals 1. More effective integration of disaster risk consideration into sustainable development policies, planning and programming at all levels, with a special emphasis on disaster prevention, mitigation, preparedness and vulnerability reduction. 2. Development and strengthening of institutions, mechanisms and capacities at all levels, in particular at the community level, that can systematically contribute to building resilience to hazards. 3. Systematic incorporation of risk reduction approaches into the design and implementation of emergency preparedness, response and recovery programmes in the reconstruction of affected communities. Five Priorities for Action and 22 Core Indicators HFA Priority for Action 1: Ensure that disaster risk reduction is a national and local priority with a strong institutional basis for implementation.

By February 2009, 99 countries were in the process of preparing national reports using the online HFA Monitor tool, of which 62 provided completed interim progress reports as of 28 February 2009. Proportionally, the Americas and Africa were the regions where most countries initiated reporting in 2008. In the Americas, 50% of countries participated; 49% of countries from Africa; 40% from Asia; 34% from Europe, and 29% from the Pacific. Absolute numbers of participants by region are shown in Figure 5.1. As Figure 5.2 indicates, more countries participated from the medium (64%) and low (54%) human development categories than high (40%).

In other words, there is an overall improvement of capacities, policy, legislation, plans and mechanisms for the reduction of mortality risk, in particular for weather-related hazards. This is consistent with the findings of Section 2.5 that mortality risk is increasing at a slower rate than economic loss risk, and is actually decreasing in relation to the size of the exposed population. Consistent progress has been reported across HFA Priority for Action 2 \u2013 identifying, assessing and monitoring disaster risks and enhancing early warning \u2013 although all countries acknowledge the need for more focused efforts on this front. Countries are still challenged to compile comprehensive risk assessments in a way that can inform disaster risk reduction, link early warning with disaster preparedness and response planning, and use national information to inform local action.

It is important to interpret this trend as a marker of the extent of progress being made relative to efforts in the respective areas of education, development of tools and research methods, and public awareness. In other words, a lot is being done with regard to each of these indicators, but countries report the need to do more and better. Critically, average global progress is also weak on HFA Priority for Action 4 \u2013 reducing the underlying risk factors \u2013 which refers to the integration of disaster risk reduction into social, economic, environmental and urban development, and into the planning of infrastructure projects. This is consistent with the trends reported in Section 2.5 that in many low- and middle income countries, economic loss risk is increasing faster than mortality risk, and in Section 3.3 that there has been a rapid increase in housing damage. As described in Chapter 4, these increases are often a consequence of badly planned and weakly regulated development. It would appear that countries have difficulty addressing underlying risk drivers such as poor urban and local governance, vulnerable rural livelihoods and ecosystem decline in a way that leads to a reduction in the risk of damages and economic loss. At the same time, the governance arrangements for disaster risk reduction in many countries do not facilitate the integration of risk considerations into development. In general, the institutional and legislative arrangements for disaster risk reduction are weakly connected to development sectors. Globally, therefore, the results indicate that national efforts remain focused on strengthening policy, legislation, institutional frameworks and capacities for disaster preparedness, response, risk assessments, and early warning (HFA Priorities 1, 2 and 5). In contrast, much more effort needs to be made in using knowledge, education and innovative outreach programmes to stimulate a culture of disaster resilience, and to address the underlying drivers that configure disaster risk in social, economic and infrastructure development across rural and urban contexts (HFA Priorities 3 and 4). The regional distribution of reported results (Figure 5.4) indicates that Europe, which is mostly represented by high-income and some upper\u2013middle-income countries, reports higher progress than all other regions and across all priorities. Africa, with a majority of low-income countries, has made similar progress to other developing regions, except in Priorities for Action 2 and 3.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e66d45ec-5e6e-4375-aae6-c9c556dec031": {"__data__": {"id_": "e66d45ec-5e6e-4375-aae6-c9c556dec031", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5991d05b3df2dd9d31e93144b1ffc70dfae834775ffae783e8e7da80c0cf792c"}}, "hash": "5991d05b3df2dd9d31e93144b1ffc70dfae834775ffae783e8e7da80c0cf792c", "text": "The Pacific, weighted by the presence of high income countries like Australia and New Zealand, has made more progress in Priorities for Actions 1, 3 and 4 than all other regions except Europe. The Americas have made more progress than Asia, except in Priorities for Actions 2 and 4. When the distribution of results is examined by income class (Figure 5.5), high- income countries, including most European countries, the United States of America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Bahrain and the Cayman Islands perform well across all Priorities for Action, whereas low-income countries, mainly in Africa, underperform in Priorities for Action 1, 2, 3 and 5. This result is coherent with the findings of Chapter 2 that, as countries develop, the governance capacities to reduce disaster risk generally improve. Middle-income countries outperform low-income countries in all Priorities for Action except Priority 4, though Figure 5.4: Regional progress on HFA implementation Priority 1 Levels of progress HFA Priorities for Action 2.5 3 3.5 4 2 1.5 1 0.5 0 Priority 2 Priority 3 Priority 4 Priority 5 Africa Asia Pacific Americas Europe 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 122 122 the differences between middle and low-income countries are far less significant than between high-income and the other two categories. This reinforces the finding that fast growing low- and low-middle income countries have not been able to improve their risk-reducing capacities in a way that compensates for the rapid increase in exposure. As highlighted above, capacities to reduce mortality risk have been strengthened more effectively than capacities to reduce damage and economic loss. Trends in progress: Implementation of the Hyogo Framework for Action Figure 5.6: Average progress towards indicators for Priority for Action 1 by income class and region 5.2 Figure 5.5: Hyogo Framework progress by income classification The sections below discuss the trends in progress and challenges reported in relation to the 22 indicators for the five Hyogo Framework Priorities for Action. While the analysis is illustrated by examples drawn from interim national reports, a more detailed description is provided in Appendix 3. Interim national reports are available in the accompanying CD and online 3. Detailed regional reports cataloguing country-level progress prepared for the ISDR Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction4 are also available online 5. 5.2.1 Hyogo Framework Priority for Action 1: Ensure that disaster risk reduction is a national and local priority with a strong institutional basis for implementation Countries that develop policy, legislative and institutional frameworks for disaster risk reduction and are able to develop and track progress through specific and measurable indicators have greater capacity to manage risks and to achieve widespread consensus for, engagement in and compliance with disaster risk reduction measures across all sectors of society. Figure 5.6 shows the average progress towards the four indicators for this priority for high-, medium- and low-income countries, and the average progress by region.

Lack of an overarching national policy and legal framework on disaster risk reduction, which does not facilitate a holistic approach, particularly in high-income countries. 2. Political inertia in approving legislation and in developing the necessary technical and legal instrumentation and administrative arrangements for its implementation. 3. Lack of adequate financial, human and technical capacities to address disaster risk reduction is reported as the major reason for underachievement in this area, particularly in low-income countries. 4. No explicit link between national policies on disaster risk reduction and sector policies (such as for land use, building, social and economic development and environment) and which leads to confusion regarding mandates and responsibilities for implementation, gaps and overlaps. 1.

Bahrain has instituted a National Committee on Disaster Management but also recognizes the need for a national policy. 3. Ecuador has included disaster risk management in its new constitution and, like Colombia, in its national development plan. 4. Decentralized systems of governance for disaster risk reduction in countries across Asia (the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Iran, among others) provide opportunities for participation at the local governance and community levels. Indicator 2 Dedicated and adequate resources are available to implement disaster risk reduction plans and activities at all administrative levels. 1. No systematic policy or institutional commitment has been made to providing dedicated or adequate resources for disaster risk reduction. 2. Competing national priorities, the absence of legislation that makes financial allocations legally binding, and lack of political will if the short-term benefits of disaster risk reduction are not visible. 3. Disaster risk reduction still heavily depends on resources from bilateral and multilateral cooperation. As a result, it is often implemented using short-term, stand-alone project or programme modalities, which generally do not facilitate its institutionalization or sustainability. 1. In Vanuatu the National Action Plan clearly tasks the Ministry of Finance and Economic Management with allocating ministerial budgets for disaster risk reduction to different ministries and departments. 2. Only a few countries, such as Colombia and Iran, report the inclusion of disaster risk reduction in their national budgets. Indicator 3 Community participation and decentralization are ensured through the delegation of authority and resources to local levels. 1. Countries from Asia, Africa and Latin America report a substantial number of community-based risk reduction initiatives. However, coverage and quality is often uneven and projects are yet to be linked into a wider risk reduction system integrating the local, provincial and national levels. 2. Reporting indicates a growing dedication of efforts and resources towards strengthening capacities at both the local government and community levels. 3. Existence of national decentralization processes has been identified as a key success factor in strengthening and sustaining disaster risk reduction capacities at the local and community levels. 4. Active coordination of NGOs interested in work at the community level remains a challenge for national and local governments, particularly in those countries with limited resources to strengthen community capacities. 5. Local governments, particularly in rural and isolated areas lack the human, technical, financial and institutional capacities to address disaster risk. 1. In Europe and many high-income countries, municipalities and local governments often have mandatory responsibilities for disaster risk reduction, as well as the necessary capacities and resources. 2. Large, relatively wealthy urban municipalities such as Bogot\u00e1, Medell\u00edn (Colombia) and La Paz (Bolivia), have well-functioning city disaster risk reduction systems and are now as effective and in some cases better resourced than those at the national level. 3. In Asia, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Nepal and the Philippines highlight budgets for risk reduction, but since these may often be centralized and/or prioritized for response and preparedness-related expenditures this can be an obstacle to strengthening local capacities for disaster risk reduction. 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 124 124 Indicators Challenges reported Progress reported: trends and examples Indicator 4 A national multisectoral platform for disaster risk reduction is functioning. 1. Challenges exist in the creation of an integrated multi- sector institutional system for disaster risk reduction that could bring greater cohesion and synergy to ongoing sector-based approaches. 2. Difficulties in gaining commitment to disaster risk reduction from development sectors and local governments, as well as other stakeholders such as the private sector or civil society, due to a lack of political authority and the necessary technical capacities. 1. Countries such as Egypt 6 have created national committees, while in other countries such as Colombia, Costa Rica, Panama and the United States of America, national platform mechanisms have been adopted. 2. Central African states have addressed disaster risk management in a common strategy undertaken by the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) 7, which adopted an environment and natural resources policy with a sub-regional plan of action in October 2007. The strategy aims to build the capacity of national and sub-regional authorities; review and enforce legal frameworks and disaster risk reduction strategies within ECCAS and member states; and to formulate and implement national strategies for disaster risk reduction. This includes the establishment and reinforcement of national platforms, inter-ministerial committees and an intergovernmental committee for the ECCAS region. 3.

Table 5.2 details the challenges and progress reported. 125 Chapter 5 Review of progress in the implementation of the Hyogo Framework for Action 125 Indicators Challenges reported Progress reported: trends and examples Indicator 1 National and local risk assessments based on hazard data and vulnerability information are available and include risk assessments for key sectors. 1. Most reports acknowledge that national and sector emergency plans are not based on risk assessments. Challenges include a generalized absence of sub- national or local data, particularly for new or less frequent hazards; weak or non-existent specialized institutions; financial constraints and a dependency on external partners that sometimes do not respond to national priorities. 2. While progress is being made in single hazard, sector and territory specific assessments, there is far less progress in achieving comprehensive national multi-risk assessments. 3. Experiences of institutionalization and application of such assessments in development and territorial planning, or for the design of building codes, is rarer still. 4. Responsibilities for both hazard monitoring and risk assessment are split between multiple institutions in most countries. Multi-risk assessment has no institutional \u2018home\u2019. 5. Lack of standardized data sources and methodologies is a challenge reported, for example, by Indonesia that makes it difficult for results to be applied systematically across sectors. 1. Australia and New Zealand report a comprehensive, integrated, multi-hazard approach to risk assessment. Other examples include the state Government of Gujarat in India and the Cayman Islands. 2. Switzerland aims to cover the entire country with hazard maps and assessments by 2011, for both geological and hydrological hazards, and have them applied in land-use planning and building regulation by municipalities. 3. In Bangladesh progress has been made in the agriculture sector, while hospitals, schools, water and sanitation have been identified as urgent priorities. 4. Progress in community-level risk assessment is also reported, for example in the Philippines through the Hazards Mapping and Assessment for Effective Community-based Disaster Risk Management project 8. 5. The IADB (Inter-American Development Bank) 9 is enabling the development of indicators for disaster risk management for 12 countries in the Americas. The Central American Probabilistic Risk Assessment 10 is another ongoing initiative which is a comprehensive disaster risk assessment for Central America. 6. In Africa, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles, South Africa and Tanzania, all report undertaking disaster risk assessments for specific sectors and hazards. Indicator 2 Systems are in place to monitor, archive and disseminate data on key hazards and vulnerabilities. 1. Difficulties occur in coordination, sharing information and adopting common data standards and methodologies, when hazard monitoring is spread across many specialized institutions. 2. Lack of resources to acquire and maintain equipment and the general lack of human technical capacities is reported as a constraint. 3. Governmental responsibilities for hazard monitoring often rest with a wide range of scientific and technical bodies responsible for meteorology, geology, seismology, oceanography etc. 1. Hazard monitoring is recognized as a key activity that underpins both risk assessment and early warning. 2. Development of a seismic monitoring network in Tajikistan 11 is illustrative of the progress being made by many countries in improving hazard monitoring. 3.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4c5b323c-641f-4a29-a591-dbfec6ceed5a": {"__data__": {"id_": "4c5b323c-641f-4a29-a591-dbfec6ceed5a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c4489cf6402ee08d654bbafcc8daad051829fe396cb95f982cf13997880f495d"}, "2": {"node_id": "bf481091-c338-4557-a50a-9776a874f326", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ec8404ce308cc1fd90fdfb95411f8cdf8ec665c1c2396b9b324829eb3e0df368"}}, "hash": "3ffba9ee245bf298dc6ed1f10c9bd9c5f894dd8ea89e89c85a8b0835bdc4f8ac", "text": "3.

Strengthening of local capacities and the linking of hazard monitoring to disaster preparedness systems is reported as a common challenge. 1. Institutional commitment to developing end-to-end early warning systems for major and frequent hazards has been secured in all reporting countries in Asia. 2. Good progress has been reported in the use of both technology and local capacity to develop effective early warning systems for frequent hazards, such as cyclones and floods, in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. 3. Italy reports that early warning has been improved since the National Warning System has been in place.

Transboundary initiatives are mainly dependent on member states\u2019 contributions, which implies that the signing of cooperation agreements is not necessarily reflected in implementation, or incorporated into national disaster risk reduction planning. 2. There is an absence of common databases and equipment to monitor and assess transboundary risks. Countries report unwillingness to share sensitive information with neighbours on particular hazards. 1. Germany is an active member of several transboundary international commissions for the protection of the Rhine, Danube, Elbe and Odra Rivers, which all carry out flood risk assessments. 2. In September 2007 government representatives of Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Moldova, Romania, Slovenia and Turkey took an important step forward in their efforts to improve the region\u2019s disaster preparedness, prevention and response capability and coordination by signing a Memorandum of Understanding on the Institutional Framework of the Disaster Preparedness and Prevention Initiative for South Eastern Europe 13. 3. Armenia has signed an intergovernmental agreement on seismic risk reduction with the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Tajikistan; an international Armenian\u2013Russian project on seismic hazard prediction in the Caucasus has been renewed between Armenia and the Russian Federation. 4. Angola, Burkina Faso, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Ghana, Mauritius and Togo report substantial progress in cooperation with neighbouring countries to reduce transboundary risks, including flooding in shared watersheds, tsunami early warning systems, locust infestations and health-related risks. 5. Collaboration on transboundary risk management is often institutionalized through Regional Economic Councils such as ECOWAS 14, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the African Union (AU), as well as through regional meteorological services such as the Comit\u00e9 permanent inter-\u00c9tats de lutte contre la s\u00e9cheresse dans le Sahel. However, it is recognized that a more prominent lead by the Regional Economic Councils would serve to enhance and regulate cooperation and information exchange amongst member countries. 6. Progress has been possible in the Americas due to the large number of sub-regional and regional initiatives aimed at improved coordination, information sharing and collaboration.

The report also examines the level of international and regional cooperation in support of strengthening national early warning systems. The report states that while there has been some progress in strengthening early warning systems, greater commitment to addressing the development of these capacities is needed. Key issues highlighted in the report include: 1. Existing national and local emergency prepared- ness and response plans need to be re-evaluated, based on hazard and vulnerability mapping, and must be supported by enforceable legislation. These plans need to clearly indicate the line of command, roles and responsibilities of different agencies engaged in different components of early warning systems. They must also be aligned across community, provincial, and national levels, ensuring that financial and operational resources are routed to communities for improving preparedness and response operations on the ground. 2. There is a need for further strengthening of the monitoring and forecasting infrastructure and staff skills of technical agencies (for example, national meteorological, hydrological, geological, and ocean services) that are responsible for monitoring and forecasting of hazards. This needs to be further complemented by strengthened cooperation, coordination and knowledge-sharing among the technical agencies and with their disaster risk management counterparts. 3. National technical agencies could benefit from strengthened regional cooperation on access to data and the latest tools and technologies for monitoring and forecasting of hazards. Such cooperation has been demonstrated by a number of existing regional cooperation mechanisms Box 5.2: Status of early warning systems15 such as the Pacific and the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System (coordinated by UNESCO Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission) and the WMO Global Tropical Cyclone Programme, which provides tropical cyclone and storm surge forecasts and bulletins through six regional specialized centres to all countries at risk. Furthermore, strengthened cooperation is needed among neighbouring countries to establish standards, procedures and protocols for warnings on transboundary issues. 4. Standardized hazard and impact databases need to be established, and technical capacity needs to be built at the national level in the use of hazard and risk mapping tools to support emergency response and preparedness planning and the integration of risk information in warning messages. 5. In most countries, dissemination channels that link national warning systems to communities need to be significantly strengthened, taking into consideration cultural norms and communities\u2019 requirements, and the resources available. Feedback mechanisms to verify that warnings have reached the appropriate authorities and at-risk communities must be established. Furthermore, there is a need for training programmes targeted at the authorities, emergency response staff and the public to assist them to understand the source and content of warning messages, and to link this information to concrete actions on the ground, based on risk level (for example, the establishment of risk readiness levels). 6. Emergency preparedness and response plans need to be developed utilizing hazard and vulnerability maps. More drills and public aware- ness programmes are needed at the community level, particularly when the community does not experience hazards frequently. 7. Concept of operations and standard operational procedures need to be developed for early warning systems for different hazards, enabling effective coordination and cooperation across various components of the systems from national to local levels. 8. Early warning system programmes should be complemented by an effective regional\u2013national\u2013 local, multi-agency operational evaluation and feedback mechanism to improve the systems over time. 9. Strengthened cooperation, coordination and strategic planning among international agencies could lead to a more effective approach for the development of national early warning system programmes. 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 128 128 Indicators Challenges reported Progress reported: trends and examples Indicator 1 Relevant information on disasters is available and accessible at all levels, to all stakeholders (through networks, development of information sharing systems, etc). 1. Challenges include the need to make information appropriate and specific to risk and cultural contexts. 2. Difficulties were reported in ensuring that databases are updated and maintained. 3. There is a need to move from disaster preparedness and response to a focus on new emerging themes such as adaptation to climate change, environmental degradation and urban risks. 4. Few countries can ensure that households have easy access to accurate information on the risks they face. Lack of progress in the development of comprehensive risk assessments and early warning systems undermines the value of information systems. 1. Ghana publishes \u2018handbills\u2019 for distribution to all stakeholders nationwide that show where disasters occur, the extent of the impact and recovery initiatives undertaken. 2.

The Swedish Emergency Management Agency 17 for example has developed a national, Internet-based information system, called WIS.

Challenges include the lack of capacity among educators and trainers. 2. Difficulties were noted in addressing needs in poor urban and rural areas. 3. There is a lack of validation of methodologies and tools and little exchange of experiences. 4. Some countries report the absence of policy and guidelines on how to integrate disaster risk reduction into curricula, education materials and training, despite there being systematic policy and institutional commitment. 5. Most of the countries that have not yet integrated disaster risk reduction into the school curriculum, cite the lack of educational materials, especially in vernacular languages, as a major obstacle. 1. The 2006\u20132007 international disaster risk reduction campaign Disaster Risk Reduction Begins at School 18 has furthered and raised awareness of the importance of the education agenda across some countries. 2. The Central American and Dominican Republic Framework for Education and Disaster Risk Reduction has been established as a Latin American regional thematic educational platform, with the support of UNISDR, a network of universities, and regional and international agencies. 3. Systematic policy or institutional commitment has been achieved in Australia, Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Nepal, New Zealand, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea and Syria. 4. Yemen reports difficulties with language barriers because much material has not been translated into Arabic. An active Knowledge and Education for Disaster Risk Reduction Platform is now functional in the region, which may contribute to increasing future capacities in this area. 5. In Angola and Burundi, UNICEF has collaborated with the Ministries of Education in arranging workshops and promoting the integration of disaster risk reduction into education. 6. In Madagascar, the Ministry of Education and the UN have jointly developed school materials on disaster risk reduction and manuals that are used in all schools throughout the country. 7. Mozambique has started pilot projects in primary schools, to train teachers and children how to live with disasters. 8. In Burkina Faso, environmental education has been adopted at primary school level and disaster risk reduction is partly integrated into higher education. Indicator 3 Research methods and tools for multi-risk assessments and cost\u2013benefit analysis are developed and strenghtened. 1. Constraints were reported in financial, technical and human capacities. 2. The strong dependency on external funds and partners, with a lack of transfer of skills and competency, is seen as an obstacle. 3. Progress in some regions like the Americas and Asia has mainly depended on a range of specific initiatives through universities and research institutions, insurance companies and development banks, rather than coherent national programmes. 4.

Bangladesh reports success in the development of community risk assessment methods and tools. Up-scaling is challenged by the absence of a centralized agency that could act as a repository of technical information and advice on the suitable application of tools across the territory. 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 130 130 Indicators Challenges reported Progress reported: trends and examples Indicator 4 A countrywide public awareness strategy exists to stimulate a culture of disaster resilience, with outreach to urban and rural communities. 1. Increased awareness does not necessarily lead to a reduction in disaster risks. For instance, poor rural and urban households are faced with severe livelihood and environmental constraints on their ability to reduce risk that cannot be addressed by awareness alone. 1. Tools and guidelines include RiskPlan 19 in Switzerland, to learn about and implement disaster risk reduction, and EconoMe 20, to justify investments in risk reduction. 2. In New Zealand, a long-term public education programme and social marketing campaign, \u2018Get Ready, get Thru\u2019, was launched in 2006, aimed at greater individual and community preparedness for disasters 21. 3. In Africa, almost all reporting countries state that they have public awareness campaigns in place which cover national, regional and community levels. Many of the countries with awareness campaigns utilize media such as radio, newspapers and television, with Mauritius, Mozambique and Madagascar reporting a high level of public awareness for the main risks. 4. Examples of effective impacts from international campaigns include the Safe Hospitals Campaign, launched by the WHO, ISDR and the World Bank, to raise awareness that disaster damage to health systems can have an enormous impact on economic and human development. At the same time, even small investments in making health facilities safer can considerably reduce the impact of disasters. The campaign provides a platform for strengthening hospitals, health facilities and systems in the context of risk reduction and emergency preparedness and response. 5.2.4 Hyogo Framework Priority for Action 4: Reduce the underlying risk factors Disaster risks related to changing social, economic and environmental conditions and land use, and the impact of hazards associated with geological events, weather, water, climate variability and climate change are addressed in sector development planning and programmes as well as in post-disaster situations. Figure 5.9 shows the average progress towards the four indicators for this priority for high-, medium- and low-income countries, and the average progress by region.

There is a general lack of application and enforcement of environmental standards, norms and regulations. 2. There is little synergy between land-use planning, strategies to adapt to climate change, environmental protection laws, other similar instruments, and policy and legislation addressing disaster risk. 3. Organizations responsible for disaster reduction often have neither the political authority nor the technical capacity to intervene in environmental planning and regulation. While disaster risk reduction and environmental policy and legislative frameworks may acknowledge each other, real integration in practical terms is lacking. 1. Many countries in the Americas and Asia have established environment and climate change as national priorities and have developed relevant legislation, policy and institutional frameworks. 2. Environmental protection and adaptation to climate change have been established as priorities in all regions, and most countries have legislation, policies and institutional frameworks to address a range of environmental and natural resource management concerns. 3. Most countries are signatories to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and to the Kyoto Protocol, and are developing strategies and plans to address climate change, an", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "547b7ff9-35ef-4091-ba5e-cb9218540db3": {"__data__": {"id_": "547b7ff9-35ef-4091-ba5e-cb9218540db3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "34c0fb0c31dd9b89a7782a55e9afe8e5509f929d60efbd5702d7ac86016d0271"}}, "hash": "34c0fb0c31dd9b89a7782a55e9afe8e5509f929d60efbd5702d7ac86016d0271", "text": "issue that will be revisited later in this chapter. 4. The Marshall Islands report that the implementation of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) regulations started only in 2005, with a constantly increasing number of large projects complying with the requirements (up from five in 2005 to 40 in 2007). A test case for the EIA process was a dry dock project which was denied on the basis of the inappropriate nature of the site. 5. Other countries have adopted a regional, transboundary approach. For example, disaster risk reduction in East Africa 22 presents a good example of how East African countries are working together to tackle concerns emanating from climate change processes. Indicator 2 Social development policies and plans are being implemented to reduce the vulnerability of populations most at risk. 1. While PRSPs and similar instruments mention disaster risk reduction, this may not reflect a real integration of poverty and disaster risk reduction policy frameworks and programme initiatives in practice. As with environment, the organizations responsible for disaster reduction may not have the political authority or the technical capacity to intervene in the design of social development and poverty reduction plans and programmes. It should be noted that very few countries report a substantial reliance on social equity considerations as a driver of progress. 1. A considerable number of countries report that social development plans to reduce the vulnerability of disaster risk prone communities are in place. 2. Many countries reporting from Africa have social development policies, plans or programmes that address vulnerability and poor living conditions through improving water supply, sanitation, food security, health and literacy. Some countries, such as Burkina Faso, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Guinea, Swaziland and Togo, report having integrated disaster risk concerns into their PRSPs. Mauritius and Tanzania have special emergency assistance funds in place, while Mozambique is working to create alternative income activities for vulnerable sectors and invest in drought resistant crops. 3. In the Americas, most countries report that commitments to the MDGs, poverty reduction and social inclusion are included in development plans and strategies as well as in institutional mechanisms. 4. Countries in Asia report the increasingly targeted action of national and local plans to reduce social and economic vulnerability. The Philippines reports the efforts of the National Poverty Commission, which has designed a poverty reduction strategy for people in hazard prone areas that incorporates interventions ranging from microfinance and insurance instruments to rice credits, cheap food and burial benefits. 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 132 132 Indicators Challenges reported Progress reported: trends and examples Indicator 2 continued 5. Australia and New Zealand report that an explicit \u2018social inclusion agenda\u2019 must be incorporated into all national and local development policies and plans. 6. Bangladesh reports growing diversification of social safety net programmes, with an active role for NGOs. Some reports cite the need for detailed evaluations to identify the exact benefits for communities and to better understand the interrelation between microfinance and risk reduction. Indicator 3 Economic and productive sectorial policies and plans have been implemented to reduce the vulnerability of economic activities. 1. The costs of disaster risk are not normally factored into public investment decisions. As a result, disaster risk reduction considerations become factored into economic and productive development on an ad hoc rather than a systematic basis. 2. Underlying problems include the difficulties surrounding economic development planning itself. African countries, for example, highlight political instability, poverty and weak governance as factors which endanger the implementation of economic development plans. 3. There is little systematic integration of economic development and disaster risk reduction policies and legislation. As in other sectors, it seems that in most countries disaster risk reduction organizations do no have the political authority or technical capacity to intervene in economic development planning. 1. In the Republic of Korea the Support for Enterprises Voluntary Disaster Mitigation Activities Act of 2007 provides small and medium businesses with guidelines and standards for disaster risk reduction. 2. Australia\u2019s Trusted Information Sharing Network provides a forum in which the owners and operators of critical infrastructure can work together by sharing information on security issues. 3. In Peru, the Ministry of Economy and Finance has fully incorporated disaster risk reduction into the National System for Public Investment 23, which requires a risk evaluation to improve all public investment across sectors and in both central and local government (see Box 5.3). 4. The Planning and Economic Policy Ministry in Costa Rica has recently added disaster risk evaluation to its requirements for approval of public investment projects.

Weak implementation and enforcement mechanisms are common to all countries where most urbanization is informal. The lack of coverage of this issue in reports suggests that there is less activity now in introducing hazard resistant building into risk prone, informal urban and rural housing (for example, through mason training and the introduction of appropriate technologies) than there was in the 1970s and 1980s, with some notable exceptions such as Pakistan. 1. Senegal and Cape Verde report the inclusion of disaster risk reduction into their building codes. 2. Angola, Congo, Mozambique, and Togo report that risk considerations are factored into land-use planning and settlement siting decisions. 3. Algeria is involved in efforts to improve building codes and planning laws to reduce future risk. 4. A large number of cities, including Amman, Aqaba, Bogota, Caracas, Istanbul, Kathmandu, Kerman, La Paz, Lima, Manila, Mumbai, Quito and Tehran have developed a comprehensive understanding of their exposure to hazards and are in the process of taking steps to improve their capabilities to respond and reduce disaster risks. Some have done so under their own initiative \u2013 others with support from national governments; international organizations, such as the World Bank and UNDP; or NGOs such as EMI and Geo-hazards International. 5. Progress is also being made in some countries to ensure that public facilities such as schools or hospitals are either retrofitted or built to hazard resistant standards. Significant investments by Colombia and Iran to retrofit schools to seismic resistant standards are excellent examples of this kind of initiative. In 2007, Iran also initiated retrofitting residential buildings in rural areas, aiming to retrofit around 300,000 houses annually. 133 Chapter 5 Review of progress in the implementation of the Hyogo Framework for Action 133 Indicators Challenges reported Progress reported: trends and examples Indicator 4 continued 6. Disaster resilient schools and health facilities are being built in cooperation with the World Bank in Madagascar, while in the Americas increasing concern for the safety of schools and hospitals and critical infrastructure is also reported. 7. The priority given to emergency preparedness and risk reduction by national governments and communities in Latin America and the Caribbean has reduced vulnerabilities and risks, and turned previously frequent hazardous impacts with disaster potential into more manageable events. This has been achieved with strong and sustained support by the WHO/Pan American Health Organization, multilateral and non-governmental organizations. Indicator 5 Disaster risk reduction measures are integrated into post-disaster recovery and rehabilitation processes. 1. Overall, most counties report that there has been much discussion around this issue in past years, in the aftermath of recent, large-scale disasters. However, thorough and consistent implementation of these recovery principles is yet to be seen. 2. Recovery and reconstruction projects and programmes are generally stand-alone initiatives with clearly bounded limits. Therefore, even when disaster risk is effectively incorporated, it does not necessarily lead to a more mainstream adoption of disaster risk considerations into ongoing planning and regulation systems. 3. Lack of political will and initiative to recognize disaster risk, the pressure to rebuild quickly and the absence of pre-existing mechanisms and capacities to support hazard resistant, owner-driven housing, are all obstacles that inhibit the use of reconstruction as a window of opportunity for disaster risk reduction. It is found that even if hazard resistant construction is promoted and achieved, this does not always address the needs of poor urban and rural households, nor of specific social groups such as women headed households. 1. The reconstruction of Bam, Iran, following the 2003 earthquake is a good example of how reconstruction processes have provided good entry points for the introduction of hazard resistant construction if the necessary political will and institutional commitment are present24. 2. The early recovery model in Mozambique25 shows that it is possible to integrate disaster risk reduction into post disaster recovery and reconstruction, provided that this is factored into the design of recovery plans and strategies from the beginning. 3. A number of initiatives are now beginning to address the issue, through mechanisms such as IRP and the Cluster Working Group on Early Recovery 26. For example, the IRP is promoting an Earthquake Risk Reduction Preparedness and Recovery Programme 27, through UNDP. This aims to promote regional partnerships and enable appropriate and fast implementation of recovery activities with SAARC, including Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

Procedures and regulations may be in place but insufficient technical and human resources exist to evaluate and approve projects or for enforcement. Only 35% of African countries state that they conduct impact assessments and, again, these mainly focus on environmental impact. 3. Awareness of the role that inappropriate development projects may have in increasing disaster risk is very low (except in the case of some infrastructure projects, such as dams) while the political and economic interests at stake may be very high. It is still rare for the opportunity costs and co-benefits of alternative ways of providing infrastructure to be identified in a way that reduces the disaster risk faced by poor urban and rural households. 1. In Peru, mandatory evaluations of disaster risk reduction have been incorporated into the National System for Public Investment. 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 134 134 Table 5.5 shows detailed estimates of the cost of factoring disaster risk reduction considerations into public sector investments in Peru (prepared by the Ministry of Economy and Finance)28 in comparison with the avoided losses and reconstruction costs over a period of ten years for different probabilities of disaster occurrence, ranging from a 25% to 100% probability of a disaster occurring in ten years. This indicates that at a 75% probability of disaster loss in 10 years, all the investments in disaster risk reduction were cost-effective. At a 25% probability four of the six investments were cost-effective. Furthermore at the 75% probability level, the ratio of benefits to costs ranged from 1 to 37.5. This indicates that the much quoted estimate that investments in disaster risk reduction produce benefits of seven times the cost needs to be nu- anced, according to the kind of investment and the probability of loss. The key point is that most disaster reduction investment should be viewed as a very effective way of reducing the real costs of addressing the underlying risk factors.

Countries report a lack of appropriate policies and legislation for disaster risk management with a decentralized allocation of capacities and resources. 2. While a disaster risk reduction perspective has been introduced into the language of many national disaster management institutions and into a range of activities, in practice it is usually consistent with a shift in emphasis from response to preparedness and from an ad hoc to a planned approach, complemented by specific investments in hazard mitigation, for example the construction of river defences. 3. Needs identified in this area include increased and permanent budgetary allocation and financial support, resources, and capacity development, particularly at the local level. Some countries still report a lack of political commitment to move the focus from emergency response towards disaster risk reduction. Germany and Norway explicitly note the integration of disaster risk reduction measures. 1.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f4ccfc02-42ac-4c02-9ec5-49d6a4a88a3f": {"__data__": {"id_": "f4ccfc02-42ac-4c02-9ec5-49d6a4a88a3f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6a0099b7bd62ecf9ece39e3880a20697eaf67ee5650ee78f88ceea847297e7f9"}, "2": {"node_id": "ad307510-c384-4b4c-b980-9603b424eba7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f3ad4da7ba0b490f2127f4ad18928946792abb132759d335b34711c271eb8daa"}}, "hash": "6ae2aff49fb4976284373c99eec0e855406e9bbc71cfd87ed7155c0af114859d", "text": "Germany and Norway explicitly note the integration of disaster risk reduction measures. 1.

UNOCHA30 has been promoting disaster preparedness and prevention at the national, regional and global levels through its initiatives with the Capacity for Disaster Risk Reduction Initiative and the Guidance and Indicator Package for Implementing Priority Five of the Hyogo Framework for Action with UNISDR, among other activities. 5.2.5 Hyogo Framework Priority for Action 5: Strengthen disaster preparedness for effective response at all levels At times of disaster, impacts and losses can be substantially reduced if authorities, individuals and communities in hazard prone areas are well prepared and are equipped with the knowledge Figure 5.10 : Average progress towards indicators for Priority for Action 5 by income class and region and capacities for effective disaster preparedness and response. Figure 5.10 shows the average progress towards the four indicators for this priority for high-, medium- and low-income countries, and the average progress by region.

Emergency plans exist in all countries but the extent to which they are implemented systematically at all levels varies widely. 2. Drills and simulations occur but not methodically nor necessarily in all areas. 3. There is a need to systematize experiences, coordinate efforts at the different levels to ensure consistency in carrying out simulations, as well as for developing and/or updating contingency plans. 4. Major weaknesses are identified in local capacities in many high risk areas, in the absence of methodical and regular drills and simulations, outdated contingency plans, and a lack of accountability. 1. Italy reports that a National Civil Protection Fund has been set up, with the allocation of regional funds and contingency mechanisms. 2. Syria reports that contingency plans are available for all administrative levels and field training is conducted by using crisis management techniques listed in contingency plans. The training is evaluated in order to identify strengths and weaknesses. 3. Progress reported from Mozambique shows that the implementation of plans has as much to do with political will and good organization as with the availability of financial resources. 4. Following a regional survey, the WHO Office for the Eastern Mediterranean Region has developed a model for planning emergency preparedness and risk reduction programmes, with community capacity enhancement as the ultimate goal. Broad goals and specific skills for local disaster planning programmes have been identified. Training tools on emergency preparedness, response and recovery for use in community-based intervention areas are being developed. An optimum package for risk reduction, emergency preparedness and response is in development. A multi-hazard and risk atlas is being developed. Indicator 3 Financial reserves and contingency mechanisms are in place to support effective response and recovery when required. 1. Experience with contingency funds is varied. Governments may use the funds to cover other contingencies or budget deficits, while they are often insufficient to cover the response and recovery costs of a large-scale disaster. 2. Emergency programmes are often dependent on external funds because those allocated at the national level are ad hoc or, in some countries, no core funding is allocated for such contingencies. 3. Often, government responsibility for household level disaster loss is not explicitly defined, which is a major obstacle to the development of insurance-based mechanisms. In particular, small scale recurrent losses associated with extensive risk may not be addressed at all. 4. Across much of Africa, Asia and the Americas, countries still have to rely on unpredictable international humanitarian assistance to address response and recovery needs. 1. Some countries report the establishment or existence of contingency funds. In Africa, for example, Kenya, Malawi,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "75e077d7-daac-425c-bef8-9791762859be": {"__data__": {"id_": "75e077d7-daac-425c-bef8-9791762859be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d5ba5cb6eb5c4cdf66000950b6003e52774851f73129d5515237f206494dc043"}}, "hash": "d5ba5cb6eb5c4cdf66000950b6003e52774851f73129d5515237f206494dc043", "text": "Mozambique, Seychelles, South Africa and Tanzania, report the existence of a fund, as do a number of countries in the Americas (Colombia, Costa Rica and El Salvador) and in Asia (Iran, the Philippines) and the Pacific (Australia, New Zealand). In Bolivia, 0.15% of the national budget is dedicated to a contingency fund. It is important to highlight that disaster risk reduction, however, requires sustainable ongoing investments not dependent on emergencies. 2. Insurance and new mechanisms such as catastrophe pools and bonds are now being increasingly adopted in upper middle-income countries in order to replace traditional relief and reconstruction funding from government and international sources. Mexico has issued a catastrophe bond to provide a funding mechanism for response and recovery in the case of a major earthquake. Such mechanisms are an emerging good practice that will be examined in greater detail in the next chapter. Indicator 4 Procedures are in place to exchange relevant information during hazard events and disasters, and to undertake post- event reviews. 1. Overall progress in this area is often a result of ad hoc initiatives rather than institutionalized practices or strategies per se. In the recent past, there has been increased recognition of the need for coordination on information management and dissemination functions in post-disaster scenarios. However, it has been challenging to coordinate information both within and between multilateral organizations such as the UN and the World Bank, and the national authorities responsible for disaster management, relief, recovery and rehabilitation. 1. Ghana has established a website and regions are linked by VHF radio. Kenya has put in place a National Disaster Operation Centre. The Mauritius Meteorological Centre has established an effective communication system for use during disasters. These achievements, however, may refer to emergency communication rather than information management in a broader sense. The Marshall Islands report that securing resources for continuous information exchange is a challenge. 137 Chapter 5 Review of progress in the implementation of the Hyogo Framework for Action 137 Indicators Challenges reported Progress reported: trends and examples Indicator 4 continued 2. Standardized information systems, protocols and procedures for information management need to be in place before disasters occur and must be able to manage damage and loss information, and recovery- need information, as they arise. 3. Evaluations, such as a recently completed study of the ten years following Mitch in Central America by the World Bank31, show how both affected countries and donors alike may quickly forget about commitments made in the aftermath of a regular disaster. Frequent post-disaster evaluations with broad stakeholder participation are therefore critical to promoting greater accountability. 2. Post-disaster evaluation is becoming more widespread, highlighted by the experience of the Tsunami Evaluation Coalition. 3. Countries such as Armenia and Turkey report taking into account the experiences of past disasters to prepare emergency response plans, development and research projects, purchase new equipment, and educate and train members of rescue and relief forces, as well as the public. 4. In Jamaica, information and lessons learnt are shared and communicated through reports from all sectors after a disaster event. Drivers of progress \u2018Drivers of progress\u2019 are the factors that catalyse the achievement of substantial progress in disaster risk reduction. These factors vary across national and local contexts, but typically emphasize the issues that countries consider important for integration into plans, policies and programmes as a means of achieving disaster risk reduction goals. Member states were requested to assess the extent to which disaster risk reduction efforts rely on drivers of progress such as multi-hazard integrated approaches; integrating gender perspectives into risk reduction and recovery; capacity development for disaster risk reduction; human security and social equity approaches; and engagement and partnerships for disaster risk reduction. The information reported is too generic to permit an in-depth analysis of these drivers, but does indicate some general tendencies. More than 45% of countries report substantial and ongoing reliance on engagement and partnerships as a driver of progress in reducing disaster risks. While major differences between countries and regions exist, there is increased participation by NGOs, the private sector, academic and scientific organizations and civil society in general. This may also be due to the large number of disaster risk reduction initiatives in low- and middle-income countries that rely heavily on international partnerships, technical assistance and resources from bilateral and multilateral organizations. The reliance on engagement and partnerships may also reflect the growing role of sub-regional and regional cooperation between countries in all regions. 35% of countries report substantial reliance on capacity development as a driver, a low figure, considering that many countries highlight capacity deficiencies as a reason for their lack of achievement.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0c39100-f1de-4056-9438-481bb0fc9124": {"__data__": {"id_": "b0c39100-f1de-4056-9438-481bb0fc9124", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "afcafac7daa7d22ad448d41e1d5505ea56ba314cd9840d91e04ecfc3994181b2"}}, "hash": "afcafac7daa7d22ad448d41e1d5505ea56ba314cd9840d91e04ecfc3994181b2", "text": "Few countries report dedicated budgets and systematic national and local initiatives to build capacity on an ongoing basis. Local-level efforts are usually dependent upon external funding and NGOs that work through civil society organizations. This dependency often leads to significant imbalances in coverage with funding and activities typically restricted to areas recently hit by major disasters, while highly vulnerable areas that may experience smaller-scale disasters on a much more frequent basis remain uncovered. It also undermines sustainability. Only 31% report substantial reliance on multi-hazard integrated approaches. This may reflect the difficulties of mainstreaming disaster risk considerations into development sectors, and of coordinating the efforts of a large number of specialized scientific and technical institutions. 5.3 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 138 138 Reliance on human security and social equity approaches for disaster risk reduction and recovery activities is low with 35% of the countries reporting substantial reliance on this driver. This indicates that there is probably not explicit recognition of the impacts of disaster risk on poverty, highlighted in Chapter 3, which translates into a lack of concern for social protection and longer-term impacts. While progress has been made in integrating gender into disaster risk reduction, it has been slow and inconsistent. Only 20% of the reporting countries mention substantial reliance on this driver. Lack of understanding of gender issues, an absence of political accountability and weak institutional capacities on gender and disaster risk reduction pose great challenges. The important role played by NGOs and the academic community in advocating gender sensitive disaster risk reduction and recovery practices has indeed had some positive impacts at the grassroots level and this influence is mentioned in some national reports. Box 5.4 takes stock of the progress being made at the regional and international levels in this area. Replicating such practices will be crucial to the fulfilment of this Hyogo Framework \u2018cross- cutting\u2019 issue. Disasters highlight gender imbalances in society, revealing vulnerabilities and capacities, along with other social and economic imbalances arising from class, caste, disability and minority status. Gender cuts across all segments of society and thus has implications for every aspect of disaster risk reduction. International efforts by the UNDP, UNISDR and UNDESA, together with experiences from disasters such as the Indian Ocean tsunami or Hurricane Katrina, have raised awareness of gender issues amongst the international and academic communities. However, progress at national and regional levels has not kept pace. Regional intergovernmental policies and strategies on disaster risk reduction rarely include an explicit commitment to gender. Any increase in recognition of gender issues in disaster risk reduction at the regional level is mostly due to the dedicated work of a handful of organizations and women\u2019s activist groups. The Delhi Declaration33 from the Second Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in 2007 was an exception to this, with the stated aim to \u201cencourage the national governments to make special efforts to mainstream gender issues in disaster risk reduction so as to reduce the vulnerability of women and to recognise the important role women can play in disaster risk reduction.\u201d Some progress has also been made at the regional level in producing information, guidelines and capacity building on the subject. For instance, Duryog Nivaran/Practical Action, the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development and the Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development produced guidelines for addressing gender issues in disaster management. UNDP has supported a number of regional initiatives. In Latin America, the Risk Management with Gender Equity Learning Community organized a first regional meeting in 2007 and has conducted a knowledge management project. The Community identifies, systematizes, disseminates and strengthens existing resources and services to integrate a gender focus within disaster risk management. A current UNDP Caribbean Risk Management Initiative project, Enhancing Gender Visibility in Caribbean Disaster Risk Management, uses research from five selected countries in the Caribbean, which is expected to shed light on the extent to which disaster risk reduction governance mechanisms incorporate gender considerations. UNDP has also supported capacity development in South Asia by making policy and practical guidelines on gender and disaster risk reduction available in local languages. In 2008, the United Nations Development Fund for Women initiated the Thematic Group on Gender in Asia that includes disaster risk reduction as a focus area.

PRSPs describe a country\u2019s macroeconomic, structural and social policies and programmes to promote growth and reduce poverty, as well as associated external financing needs. PRSPs are prepared by governments in low-income countries which receive either debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative 36 or concessional lending from the World Bank, through the International Development Association, or the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It is a participatory process involving civil society and external development partners, including the World Bank and the IMF37. By the end of 2008, 59 completed and 8 interim PRSPs were available on the World Bank\u2019s website 38. Of the completed PRSPs, 20 countries had submitted progress reports. It is beyond the scope of this Report to comprehensively survey whether the progress made in poverty reduction has contributed to addressing the underlying factors of disaster risk.

For this study, 59 completed and 8 interim PRSPs were reviewed, 35 from African countries, 19 from Asia, 6 from Europe and 7 from Latin America and the Caribbean. The findings show that approximately 20% of the PRSPs analysed devote a whole chapter or section to disaster risk; 55% of the reports mentioned the relationship between disaster risk and poverty, while 25% do not mention disaster risk at all. There is a notable difference in the extent to which disaster risk is reflected in the strategies: 29% of the PRSPs prepared in Latin America and the Caribbean countries dedicated a whole chapter to disaster risk, whereas no European PRSPs dedicated a chapter and 33% did not mention disaster risk reduction at all (Table 5.7). Countries that have integrated disaster risk reduction into their PRSPs include Bangladesh (2005), Malawi (2006), Mozambique (2006) and Viet Nam (2006). The review of 67 UNDAFs from Asian countries showed that 65% of the UNDAFs reviewed included disaster risk in one of their outputs or outcomes and 15% recognized the relationship between poverty reduction and disaster risk reduction. However, 20% did not mention risk reduction at all. See Appendix 6 for a complete list of UNDAFs and PRSPs studied for the desk review. In principle, the result is encouraging as it indicates that many PRSPs and UNDAFs at 5.4 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 140 140 least recognize some of the underlying factors of disaster risk, in particular the vulnerability of rural livelihoods and that the poor are most at risk. Areas prioritized include food security, agriculture, early warning systems, drought, climate change issues, rural (infrastructure) development and disaster preparedness and response. Such poverty reduction instruments, therefore, clearly have an enormous potential to address the underlying risk drivers described in Chapter 4. It is less clear, however, whether they explicitly target these drivers. In particular, urban poverty is given far less attention than rural poverty, a critical gap given its scale and the growth of urban disaster risk. It is also unclear whether PRSPs are linked to policies and institutional frameworks for disaster risk reduction. If not informed by disaster risk reduction information and expertise such as hazard assessments, they may not target the communities with the highest disaster risk. It is also possible that mainstream poverty reduction and social development investments may inadvertently increase rather than decrease risk, and may be ineffective in reducing the impact of disaster losses on the poor. A school built in a relatively poor settlement in an earthquake prone country offers to improve access to education and contribute to the fulfilment of MDG targets.

The short- and long-term effects of disasters on attainment of the MDGs have implications that cannot be ignored. In the same way, a lack of awareness of how development shapes disaster risk may mean that opportunities to use poverty reduction and social programmes to proactively reduce risks may be lost. Climate change adaptation Since countries signed the UNFCCC in 1992, multilateral negotiations have focused on the challenge of mitigating climate change by reducing GHG emissions, through instruments such as the Kyoto Protocol. Climate change mitigation is essential as all the evidence points to the probability that a \u2018business as usual\u2019 approach to development will lead to catastrophic global outcomes. Even if mitigation is successful, however, climate change impacts will continue to increase until stocks of GHGs in the atmosphere stabilize. As both governments and the international community recognize that some degree of climate change is inevitable, the need to assist countries to adapt to climate change has taken on a greater prominence. The term adaptation appeared in the First Assessment Report of the IPCC in 1990 and was captured in Article 4 of the UNFCCC, which calls upon states to \u201ccooperate in preparing for adaptation to the impacts of climate change, develop and elaborate appropriate and integrated plans for coastal zone management, water resources and agriculture, and for the protection and rehabilitation of areas, particularly in Africa, affected by drought and desertification, as well as floods\u201d. 39 Furthermore the Article recognizes the responsibility of the developed countries with the largest carbon footprints to assist those developing countries that suffer the consequences. It goes on to state: \u201cdeveloped country Parties . . . shall . . . assist developing country Parties that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change in meeting the costs of adaptation to those adverse effects. [. . .] The extent to which developing country Parties will effectively implement their commitments under the Convention . . . will fully take into account that economic and social development and poverty eradication are the first and overriding priorities of the developing country Parties\u201d. As described in Section 4.4, climate change magnifies the existing unevenness in the geographic and social distribution of disaster risk, meaning that its effects are disproportionately felt by the rural and urban poor in developing countries. Adaptation to climate change, 5.5 141 Chapter 5 Review of progress in the implementation of the Hyogo Framework for Action 141 however, is fundamentally similar to disaster risk reduction. Many countries face difficulties in addressing the underlying risk drivers, and they are also, therefore, badly adapted to existing climate patterns. If the underlying drivers can be addressed, then disaster risk will be reduced and at the same time the magnifying effect of climate change will be lessened. Similarly, strengthening capacities to address the underlying drivers of disaster risk will strengthen capacities to adapt to climate change. 5.5.1 Existing linkages in practice and policy The Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC lists a large number of possible adaptation measures, classified as anticipatory, autonomous and planned adaptation, that are fundamentally disaster risk reduction measures 40. Despite the existence of parallel policy and institutional frameworks at both the international and national levels, many adaptation initiatives developed under the UNFCCC in practice focus on disaster risk reduction. Of the 36 NAPAs submitted to the UNFCCC Secretariat by least developed country parties since 2004, most justify potential adaptation activities in terms of their effectiveness with respect to reducing vulnerability to disasters and alleviating poverty. In practice, some NAPAs have already led to a greater integration of disaster risk reduction and adaptation to climate change at the national level. Disaster risk reduction has also been recognized in the Bali Action Plan 41 and in the Adaptation Fund 42. The Maldives\u2019 Safe Islands Strategy is a good example of how adaptation and disaster risk reduction can be linked. It is an official government policy intended to address expected sea level rise over the course of this century which gained momentum after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami submerged the entire small island nation for several minutes. Residents of hard-to-reach outlying islands are being voluntarily relocated to Hulhumale, a man-made island near the country\u2019s capital that sits at a higher elevation than the rest of the Maldives\u2019 200 inhabited islands43. However, while disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation may be closely linked in practice, the functional linkages between the respective international frameworks (the HFA and the UNFCCC) are far weaker. The weak linkages between these frameworks inhibits the integration of climate change adaptation with disaster risk reduction, and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ebf6d13b-0b38-4fd1-a23e-0f1301af7058": {"__data__": {"id_": "ebf6d13b-0b38-4fd1-a23e-0f1301af7058", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "190f457653714dbbdf1b210de840c959ad7735fbf79035d2bfbe26aead280803"}, "3": {"node_id": "feb0fdd1-f3d3-41af-ba6f-e9fe0120bfbf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "02d3369845052f0ef260eeedc7d34776ca4442efcd0146e7905627037f1beb7b"}}, "hash": "4131c329c5f9fa806e7bfeff92b2f6bd15720bb0ecb512ffc5d0539c1a35d973", "text": "of both with poverty reduction and development. The existence of parallel frameworks involves different counterparts in developing countries in complex and overlapping international processes on policy formulation, negotiation, monitoring and reporting. This lack of integration is replicated at the national level, where responsibilities for climate change adaptation are usually vested in environment ministries. As in the case of disaster risk reduction, this does not facilitate its integration into mainstream national planning and budgeting. In turn, this can lead to the perception that adaptation is an environmental problem and result in the packaging of adaptation initiatives as a series of small stand- alone projects (for example, strengthening coastal defences or managing a particular watershed) that are disconnected from both disaster and poverty reduction planning and implementation. UNDP, for example, reports that in a review of 19 PRSPs, only four identified specific links between climate change and future vulnerability 44. 5.5.2 Resources and implementation mechanisms Several financial mechanisms exist under the UNFCCC, the Kyoto Protocol and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to support adaptation, particularly in least developed, low- and middle-income countries (see Figure 5.11). The UNFCCC mechanisms include the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF), which has supported the development of NAPAs and should assist countries in implementing activities identified in those plans. As of October 2008, cumulative net allocations approved by the Council of the LDCF amount to US$ 53.45 million. Of this, US$ 48.49 million is for projects and project preparation activities, including US$ 15.48 million that has been committed, and US$ 12.77 million already disbursed 45. While the fund was designed to \u201csupport projects addressing the urgent and immediate adaptation needs of the 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 142 142 least developed countries (LDCs) as identified by their NAPAs\u201d 46, 49 of the 50 activities funded to date have been for the preparation of NAPAs. As of September 2008, of the 38 NAPAs submitted, 21 contemplate disaster risk reduction 47. In Ethiopia\u2019s NAPA, for example, the three highest- ranking adaptation activities are: 1) promoting drought\u2013crop insurance; 2) strengthening the drought and flood early warning systems; and 3) developing small-scale irrigation and water- harvesting schemes in arid parts of the country 48. So far, in total only 2 out of 19 projects funded under the LCDF are at implementation stage: a project that reduces climate change-induced risks and vulnerabilities from glacial lake outbursts in Bhutan, and a community-based coastal afforestation project in Bangladesh. The Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) is available for all low- and middle- income countries, covering adaptation and other activities such as technology transfer, mitigation and economic diversification. So far, 15 SCCF Adaptation Program projects have been approved, but only one \u2013 a water- resource management initiative in Tanzania \u2013 is under implementation 49. As of October 2008, cumulative net allocations approved by the Council of the SCCF amount to US$ 68.58 million, of which US$ 26.53 million have been committed to projects and project preparation activities, and US$ 15.29 million have been disbursed 50. The Adaptation Fund, established under the Kyoto Protocol, is based on private-sector replenishment through a 2% levy on Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects plus voluntary contributions from high-income countries, currently amounting to US$ 5 million pledged by Canada. Potentially, it is considered that the levy could generate US$ 160\u2013950 million by 2012 51. While the Adaptation Fund board outlined a work plan at its second meeting, it has not finalized its \u2018specific operational guidelines\u2019 nor begun disbursing funds. It was agreed at the June 2008 session that the board would begin reviewing submitted projects in June 2009 52. The Strategic Priority on Adaptation contains about US$ 50 million 53 from GEF trust funds to support pilot adaptation projects of which, to date, some US$ 14.8 million have been disbursed. In contrast to the resources available through the above mechanisms, UNDP estimates the total resources required for climate change adaptation at US$ 86 billion per year by 2015, representing approximately 0.2% of GDP of developed countries54. This figure is consistent with estimates by Oxfam 55, which calculated an annual requirement of US$ 50\u201380 billion per year for adaptation in low- and middle-income countries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "feb0fdd1-f3d3-41af-ba6f-e9fe0120bfbf": {"__data__": {"id_": "feb0fdd1-f3d3-41af-ba6f-e9fe0120bfbf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "190f457653714dbbdf1b210de840c959ad7735fbf79035d2bfbe26aead280803"}, "2": {"node_id": "ebf6d13b-0b38-4fd1-a23e-0f1301af7058", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4131c329c5f9fa806e7bfeff92b2f6bd15720bb0ecb512ffc5d0539c1a35d973"}}, "hash": "02d3369845052f0ef260eeedc7d34776ca4442efcd0146e7905627037f1beb7b", "text": "More resources are flowing into adaptation from other bilateral and multilateral donors.

As of December 2008, the World Bank funds ten adaptation projects at a cost of approximately US$ 94 million 56. UNDP also reports a growing adaptation portfolio totalling approximately US$ 200 million. More resources are probably flowing directly to adaptation activities in developing countries through large international NGOs, and the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement. However, it seems unlikely that total international resource flows for adaptation in developing countries currently exceed US$ 50\u2013100 million per year, which represents less than 0.2% of that required. At the same time, a review of the portfolios of six major bilateral and multilateral donors 57 has illustrated that much development assistance is failing to take into account the potential losses from the magnified risks posed by climate change. According to UNDP 58, between US$ 16 and US$ 32 billion of existing development assistance is currently at risk from climate change. This implies that 1,000 times more development assistance is at risk from climate- related hazard than has been committed by donors to support climate change adaptation through the multilateral mechanisms described above. There is a mismatch, therefore, between the estimated costs of adaptation, the resources committed and the speed of implementation. Given the urgency posed by climate change, there is clearly an urgent need to increase the investment and the speed of implementation. 5.5.3 Adapting to climate change or adapting to poverty? In developed countries, it is difficult but not impossible to calculate the costs of adaptation. The cost of climate proofing buildings and infrastructure can be calculated, as can that of the investments in irrigation and water management necessary to enable agricultural production to adapt to longer periods of drought. The cost of maintaining flood defences in London over 100 years, taking into account climate change, has been calculated at US$ 3\u20136 billion 59, for example. When this approach is applied to developing countries, UNDP has estimated (building on earlier calculations by the World Bank) 60 that the cost of climate proofing development investments and infrastructure will be approximately US$ 44 billion annually by 2015. A recent UNFCCC paper 61 has also addressed this cost. An approach based purely on climate proofing infrastructure, however, does not address the underlying risk drivers in many developing countries, given that disaster risk for both the rural and the urban poor is characterized by a deficit of assets that could be adapted. As described in Chapter 4, the climate-related disaster risks faced by poor rural households are closely associated with their lack of access to productive assets to sustain their livelihoods. Poor urban households in most developing countries occupy unsafe makeshift homes on illegally sub-divided and occupied land and with deficient or non-existent infrastructure and public services. As the Archbishop Emeritus of Cape Town , Desmond Tutu, wrote for the 2007/2008 Human Development Report 62: \u201cAdaptation is becoming an euphemism for social injustice on a global scale. While the citizens of the rich world are protected from harm, the poor, the vulnerable and the hungry are exposed to the harsh reality of climate change in their everyday lives. Put bluntly, the world\u2019s poor are being harmed through a problem that is not of their making. The footprint of the Malawian farmer or the Haitian slum dweller barely registers in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\u201d Many NGO initiatives, and some bilateral efforts, in rural areas implicitly recognize this issue. At the local level, despite the disconnection between the scale of the need and the funds available for investment, much climate change adaptation is building on existing efforts to strengthen rural livelihoods and to protect and manage ecosystems. Less attention, however, is being given to the adaptation needs of the urban poor. The Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC notes that urban centres, the infrastructure that they concentrate, and the industries that form a key part of their economic base are often capable of considerable adaptation to reduce the risks from the direct and indirect impacts of 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 144 144 climate change 63. This is certainly true of many well-governed cities in high-income countries. However, its relevance to the several hundred million poor urban residents living in informal settlements in flood prone and exposed coastal locations in developing countries, for example, is highly questionable.

The implications of this analysis are threefold. First, the linkages between the frameworks for disaster risk reduction, poverty reduction and climate change adaptation need to be strengthened, at the international and national levels. Second, disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation should both give priority to addressing underlying risk factors such as vulnerable rural livelihoods, poor urban governance and ecosystem decline, if the magnifying effects of climate change on disaster risk are to be avoided. Third, there is a need for increased investment and more rapid implementation, given the urgency of the challenge. While the linkages between disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation need to be strengthened, both face common challenges. Many low and middle income countries still have weak capacities to address the underlying risk drivers and lack suitable governance arrangements for integrating risk reduction into development.

The chapter does not comprehensively review practices in other areas that address the underlying risk factors, for example in social protection. Nor does it comprehensively review practices in each of the areas above but rather describes salient trends, which are illustrated by examples from different countries. However, the chapter does underline key practices that would make a significant difference if they were incorporated into policy considerations. The chapter finds that it is possible to address the underlying risk factors that contribute to the translation of poverty into disaster risk and disaster impacts into poverty, and that many of the necessary tools and approaches are already being applied in practice across all regions, including in low-income countries. This has an important policy implication, since it is possible to reduce risks without waiting for high levels of economic development. It also means that there is much that can be done, even in low- income countries, to adapt to climate change. Summary of findings 1. Strengthening livelihoods increases resilience among rural communities. Strengthening livelihoods through natural resource management and the generation of microenterprises, infrastructure development and basic service provision can reduce risk and increase resilience, particularly in rural contexts. 2. Good urban and local governance: critical to reducing risk in urban settlements. Good urban and local governance is critical to the reduction of disaster risk in both cities and small urban centres. Competent and accountable local governance structures in partnership with an active civil society have developed innovative approaches to assure land supplies, provide basic infrastructure, secure land tenure and provide housing finance for poor households. Improvements in urban and local governance provide the foundation for incorporating disaster reduction considerations into urban development. 3. Adopting microfinance and microinsurance initiatives can increase resilience. Emerging practices based on microfinance, microinsurance and catastrophe financing do not necessarily lead to a reduction in disaster losses. However, they can increase resilience in both urban and rural areas and therefore can play a key role in avoiding the translation of disaster impacts into poverty outcomes. 4. Ecosystem services improve hazard regulation and provisioning services. Ecosystem services can be enhanced through a range of practices, including integrated planning, protected areas and payment for ecosystem services. This improves both hazard regulation and provisioning services for rural and urban communities. 5. Community- and local-level approaches increase sustainability of disaster risk reduction practices. Community- and local-level approaches, particularly when supported by effective decentralization processes and government\u2013civil society partnerships, can increase the relevance, effectiveness and sustainability of disaster risk reduction across all practice areas, reduce costs and build social capital. 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 150 Strengthening livelihoods that of social assistance and protection, which includes different approaches to welfare provision including livelihood guarantee schemes, cash transfers, subsidies for public services, such as education and health, and others \u2013 although it clearly could play a key role in increasing household and community resilience to disaster impacts in developing countries. 6.1.1 Natural resource management The rural poor are heavily dependent on natural resources and therefore most severely affected by deteriorating environmental conditions and by factors limiting resource access, including those associated with climate change. Resource access is often complicated through non- existent or ambiguous legal rights to the resources on which they are dependent, or because they have no feasible way to exercise their rights. Contradictions between traditional and contemporary systems of property rights are often at the root of livelihood and environmental insecurities, marginalizing the poorest communities. The regions affected by these conditions are also where environmental insecurity is most likely to lead to conflict4. Natural resource management can positively affect both sides of the disaster risk\u2013poverty nexus: reducing weather-related hazard and the vulnerability of agriculture, fisheries, forestry and livestock production while increasing resilience through strengthening incomes and the capacity to access assets. However, while success usually builds on strong community-level involvement, as in the case of urban governance, local and national government involvement is crucial to address issues concerning property rights and land and water management. An instance of combining community action with government responsiveness can be found in the Mashreq and Maghreb project,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "84bf1e11-0db6-496f-b229-7226a64973ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "84bf1e11-0db6-496f-b229-7226a64973ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8875d1a1f235c93f7856a640fa419514fd2324d375e8504858e260331cfae7e8"}, "3": {"node_id": "57ca223f-bcdc-4524-9efe-f93cf2f40201", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9efe2fd6398465f6696030e32c9f6e7ca662342902a5ffc471941cfbe3a9117a"}}, "hash": "ffae314f7623328e70865e5526e5ac0b3cb2ccda7eba1e3d1a6fad988e13eeab", "text": "which linked the Mashreq (Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria) and Maghreb (Algeria, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia) countries to combat desertification. The project catalysed the creation of community-based organizations to develop As highlighted in Chapter 4, the poor deal with risk and insecurity, in the context of a range of different hazards, as a central part of their livelihood strategies 1. Strengthening livelihoods and increasing their resilience is thus crucial to reducing both disaster risk and poverty, particularly in rural areas where livelihoods are sensitive and vulnerable to weather fluctuations and extremes. Over the past decade, rural livelihoods have become increasingly supported by non- farm income earning activities (for instance, agroprocessing, small-scale trade and services) 2. However, a significant proportion of the rural poor in Africa, Asia and Latin America still depend heavily on agriculture and farm-based activities 3. While the livelihood strategies of rural poor households may vary across contexts they generally involve three complementary components: intensification of agricultural inputs where possible; income diversification from non-farm sources; and seasonal or permanent migration to other rural or urban areas. While livelihood strengthening can have many dimensions, this section will review practices in two complementary areas that support and strengthen the livelihood strategies of the rural poor: Natural resource management \ufffd\ufffd and microenterprises implemented at the community level, particularly for the conservation and protection of \u2018common resources\u2019 (forest management, agroforestry, livestock rearing, beekeeping, water resource management, coastal protection and microcredit schemes). Infrastructure development programmes \ufffd \ufffd and basic services provision implemented at the local level with rural and peri- urban community involvement (watershed management, drought proofing, flood risk management, rainwater harvesting, cash for public works, construction of irrigation systems, canals, roads, disaster recovery and reconstruction, etc.). It has not been possible in this Report to comprehensively review practice in a third area, 6.1 151 Chapter 6 Addressing the underlying risk factors Box 6.1: Dryland agroforestry and livelihoods regeneration: towards more resilient communities7 Trees, shrubs and specialty crops have historically played a vital role in dryland agriculture in developing countries. Trees are preserved on farms because they are valued for fuelwood, construction material, fodder, medicines, cosmetics, enhancing soil fertility and shade. In the drylands of West Asia and North Africa trees have long been domesticated and orchards (e.g. olive, citrus, pistachio) are widespread. Contrary to expectations that urban expansion would result in deforestation, tree density increased in the surroundings of Kano, Nigeria from 1972 to 1985 as farmers protected and planted trees to meet the demands of the growing fuelwood market. Diversified crops, shrubs, trees, rangelands and other farm operations can also catalyse diversification in local agroenterprises. New ways to process and market foods create new opportunities for a wider variety of income-generating enterprises, creating a ripple effect that multiplies the benefits broadly through rural communities, making the environment and communities resilient to drought and desertification processes. Box 6.2: Good irrigation enhances climate change adaptation and boosts harvest in Peru8 The people of the village of Coyllur, in western Peru, are mostly farmers. Farming takes place on steep land, with few attempts to control erosion. Irrigation, where available, is by flooding with little terracing. Extensive clearance of indigenous vegetation has further destabilized the land. Intense rainfall in the wet season leads to extensive soil erosion and the destabilized slopes exacerbate landslide risk. The dry season is becoming lengthier, impacting on crop yields. Poor housing and a location in a high-risk area have led many people to migrate from the countryside to the city seeking employment. Those remaining have adopted increasingly unsustainable farming practices in a desperate bid to survive. There is little or no remaining local knowledge of how to best cultivate steep land or of appropriate irrigation technologies. A livelihood enhancement project by Practical Action demonstrated that low cost irrigation techniques make better use of water, increase production and generate higher returns. The techniques also help solve problems linked to slope cultivation, such as soil erosion, landslides and flooding. Demonstration plots showed that appropriate irrigation techniques promoted good water management, helped disease management, preserved soil nutrients and reduced risks of soil erosion that previously put their precarious infrastructure at risk. \u2018negotiated action plans\u2019 that set standards for land management in their domains.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "57ca223f-bcdc-4524-9efe-f93cf2f40201": {"__data__": {"id_": "57ca223f-bcdc-4524-9efe-f93cf2f40201", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8875d1a1f235c93f7856a640fa419514fd2324d375e8504858e260331cfae7e8"}, "2": {"node_id": "84bf1e11-0db6-496f-b229-7226a64973ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ffae314f7623328e70865e5526e5ac0b3cb2ccda7eba1e3d1a6fad988e13eeab"}}, "hash": "9efe2fd6398465f6696030e32c9f6e7ca662342902a5ffc471941cfbe3a9117a", "text": "\u2018negotiated action plans\u2019 that set standards for land management in their domains.

Safe infrastructure is critical to human, livelihood and asset security. At the same time, investment in infrastructure provision and rehabilitation is also an opportunity to generate additional employment and income in rural areas, which can increase household and community resilience. The rehabilitation of local infrastructure is frequently included in post-disaster recovery and rehabilitation programmes. Box 6.4 offers an example of integrated livelihood and 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 152 Box 6.4: Support through rehabilitation and reconstruc- tion activities for landslide- and flood-affected communites in Nepal10 The monsoon floods and landslides that started in late August 2006 left about 16,000 families in need of assistance. To respond to the emergency situation, Rural Reconstruction for Nepal mobilized volunteers and resources to help the victims of the devastating floods and landslides in different districts of Nepal and is currently implementing a rehabilitation project in three districts: Achham, Banke and Bardiya. The main purpose of the project is to support those affected by the floods and landslides through rehabilitation activities. Amongst other activities, the project supported repair and operation of community drinking water schemes, 40 hand pumps were installed in Banke district, 6 schools were repaired and two irrigation canals were rehabilitated. Special consideration was given while re-establishing and reconstructing community infrastructure, in particular drinking water pumps, canals and culvers, so that women and socially marginalized and poor community members would have equal access to these resources. Consultations with women and disadvantaged groups were conducted before re-establishing drinking water pumps and irrigation facilities in terms of location and accessibility. Box 6.3: Watershed restoration and development in Maharashtra State, India9 In the semi-arid region of Maharashtra State in India, the Watershed Organization Trust is assisting poor, rural communities to increase their livelihood security by supporting watershed restoration projects. With rain-dependent livelihood systems, these communities survive on limited water supplies to feed their crop and livestock production and cottage industries. The combination of recurring droughts and human pressures on the surrounding land has degraded watersheds. Barren and eroded lands are unable to absorb and retain water, thereby accelerating surface runoff and soil erosion and inhibiting ground water recharge. The resulting decrease in soil fertility and water availability has created drought-stressed communities vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Working on a microcatchment basis, rigorous watershed restoration measures designed to regenerate and conserve microcatchments have been undertaken, including: soil, land and water management, e.g. trench building to control erosion, improve soil fertility and enhance groundwater recharge; crop management; afforestation and rural energy management, e.g. ban on tree-felling \u2013 instead planting shrubs and grass to meet household fuel needs; livestock management and pasture/fodder development, e.g. grazing restrictions leading to the natural regeneration of grass and shrubs. These projects have been supported by other measures, including microlending, training in new techniques and the formation of self-help groups, to diversify livelihoods. Increased soil cover, improved soil moisture regimes, increased well water levels, biomass regeneration and dramatic increases in fodder availability, milk production and vegetable farming are some of the results reported by participating villages. Coupled with microenterprise development and an increase in savings groups, these results have translated into more secure livelihoods, diversified asset bases and reduced exposure to climate-related shocks. infrastructure rehabilitation within poor, flood- affected communities in Nepal. Infrastructure rehabilitation can also be used as an ex ante strategy to reduce risk and increase resilience and security as outlined in Box 6.5. The development and rehabilitation of local infrastructure is also supported through social funds. Social funds are community grant programmes that provide block grants for projects to build community assets such as community facilities, infrastructure or improved services, including microfinance and microinsurance, to increase livelihood security and resilience for poor and vulnerable households (see Box 6.6).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b24acada-1449-4a5f-8c9f-905ec46a612d": {"__data__": {"id_": "b24acada-1449-4a5f-8c9f-905ec46a612d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8d0208cec1b5637a8e37d37e119ffa97f3d305be175c5c05016e803e6c112760"}, "2": {"node_id": "32b24f01-0a31-4a5c-aebe-e98df377cb38", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "704746fa7c506e1b714ebd852fe2be18abbdc74fdf993ef870e2397d03ce4199"}}, "hash": "7de2cda41b896185faf122107c1c59d6bd2f82ca4074c56cc3483d0278bbfecd", "text": "Social funds provide a flexible mechanism that can be adapted to undertaking a variety of projects 14.

Food insecurity in this region is high, leaving 30% of children under the age of 10 malnourished. The project improves water security by rehabilitating and restoring the physical structures of traditional age-old small tank11 systems. Introducing crop diversification (to secure better incomes), home gardens (for better family food security and nutrition) and inland fisheries (for food and profit), the project positively affects the welfare and resilience of drought-affected families. The project engages government at district level through agencies related to agriculture, irrigation and district planning. Bangladesh Disaster Preparedness Centre manages a project that concretely links risk reduction Box 6.5: Strengthening livelihoods in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh with livelihood support at household level in very low- income, disaster prone neighbourhoods. The project makes sure that 50% of the beneficiaries are women. It funds skills development and provides investment in livelihoods activities on the condition that part of the income generated is used for household risk reduction measures such as raising the plinth of houses, strengthening structures, storing grain in attic rooms, etc. This programme is an interesting mix of government financial commitment (the Ministry of Food and Disaster Management directed their funds for rehabilitating flood victims to the project) and NGO implementation \u2013 a combination that has worked very well for the programme and beneficiary community. Box 6.6: Social funds for post-disaster recovery After Hurricane Mitch, the Honduras Social Investment Fund (HSIF) was used as the foundation for responding to requests from both local and central levels to help rebuild the country\u2019s critical local infrastructure. By simplifying the application procedure and increasing the use of standardized subprojects, HSIF was able to respond to the crisis very quickly. Similarly the Kecamatan Development Program (KDP) in Indonesia was adapted to support a variety of community infrastructure reconstruction and rehabilitation projects building on the established KDP network of 600 village facilitators and 35,000 village volunteers 12. The Tanzania Social Action Fund has even made this role permanent through the establishment of community foundations that are formally registered and function as partnerships with local civil society organizations, the business community and local governmental agencies. By engaging a range of constituencies within the community it is thought that the community foundations will also help to mobilize additional local resources 13. represent a portfolio of US$ 14 billion for the World Bank 15, and similar programmes have been implemented by a variety of other agencies (sometimes under the name of community grants or block grants). In conclusion, investment in rehabilitating or improving rural infrastructure has enormous potential to reduce disaster risk and increase household and community resilience, including but not exclusively in post-disaster contexts. However, significant challenges remain. As in the case of urban and local governance, disaster risk reduction considerations are not automatically factored into many initiatives due to a lack of awareness of hazard patterns and the cost of disaster impacts and the lack of formalized procedures to factor disaster risk reduction into investment decisions. Local governments and implementing authorities may not be accountable for ensuring the application of appropriate technologies for infrastructure development that make for safer environments and provide sustainable livelihood resources to the poor. At the same time, the maintenance of small-scale community infrastructure is often challenged unless full community ownership is ensured. 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 154 Partnerships for urban and local governance on hazard patterns and trends and the cost of disaster impacts are factored into land-use planning, building and infrastructure provision even the best and most innovative urban programme may fail to reduce disaster risk or even lead to its increase. However, urban governments that are unwilling or unable to address fundamental issues of access to services and infrastructure for the urban poor are usually unable to address disaster risk. Good urban and local governance therefore is an essential platform for disaster risk reduction. Table 6.1 shows how disaster risk reduction practices can be incorporated into good urban governance practices. It is estimated that the population of approximately 1 billion people who currently live in urban informal settlements in the developing world is growing by at least 2.5% per year. While not all residents of urban informal settlements are at risk from natural hazards, most risk from natural hazards in cities is concentrated in such areas.

If, as was examined in Chapter 4, urban disaster risk is configured in many developing countries in a context of unequal access to income earning opportunities, public services and basic infra- structure and poor urban and local governance, then two key underpinnings of reduced urban disaster risk would be more equitable access to employment opportunities and the presence of competent and accountable local governance structures to improve the provision of municipal services. By generating higher incomes from more diversified sources individuals and households have a better chance of reducing risks by gaining access to safer housing in safer locations and safer jobs, accumulating assets and reserves that can be \u2018bankable\u2019 in times of disasters, and protecting assets at risk through insurance 16. However, higher or more diversified sources of income can only reduce disaster risk when accompanied by a planning and regulatory framework that proactively facilitates access to safe land, housing, infrastructure and services for the urban poor and that provides the secure tenure required to access finance and insurance. Improvements in the provision of municipal services such as water, electricity, public health, drainage, sanitation and basic housing do not per se reduce disaster risk. Unless information 155 Chapter 6 Addressing the underlying risk factors Type of partnership Examples Participatory planning processes Porto Alegre, Brazil helped to pioneer participatory budgeting, through which residents in each district of the city had the right to influence public investment priorities \u2013 a development facilitated by the strength of grassroots organizations within the city22. Participatory budgeting has now come to be implemented in many other cities both within Brazil and in other countries23, and shows how local governments and businesses can respond to local needs identified in participatory consultations24. Planning urban expansion and service provision Ilo, Peru has around 70,000 inhabitants. Despite the fact that the city\u2019s population increased fivefold between 1960 and 2000, there are no informal settlements. This is due to a local government programme, in partnership with low-income households, in which all new settlements have been developed within municipal and housing association programmes through which housing plots are provided with infrastructure and services and land titles. Table 6.2: Innovative partnerships for urban governance 6.2.1 Good practice in urban and local governance The experiences of Curitiba and Porto Alegre in Brazil, and many other cities in Africa, Asia and Latin America, show that if a city is well governed, it can grow successfully without risk prone informal settlements, inadequate vulnerable housing, non-existent services and infrastructure, and poor health, even when a majority of the urban population is poor. The planning and regulatory frameworks put in place by city and municipal governments and their investments in infrastructure profoundly influence the scope and location of other investments, from large enterprises to small informal entrepreneurs, from large property developers to low-income households seeking land on which to build. In general, cities that have failed to put into place effective planning and regulatory frameworks are those with unrepresentative local governments lacking the resources to invest in essential infrastructure and services and where most local revenues go to recurrent expenditures or debt repayment. In contrast, cities and smaller urban centres that have successfully managed growth often have local governments that are more accountable to the citizens in their jurisdiction, within national government structures that have strengthened and supported local government capacities and infrastructure. 6.2.2 Decentralization, local democracy and civil society Competent and democratic local governments often arise where decentralization programmes have ensured more power and resources for the local level 17.

Brazil has probably gone further than any other nation in developing new national institutions to support more effective urban governance 19. There are also examples of national governments seeking to develop legal, institutional and financial frameworks to address urban poverty more effectively 20. Good urban governance is often underpinned by stronger local democracy. The introduction of elected mayors and councillors over the last 10\u201320 years has helped make many city governments more accountable and responsive to their citizens. However, it also usually reflects a dynamic and proactive civil society and the emergence of innovative partnerships between grassroots organizations, local NGOs and local government 21. Good urban governance, therefore, is not only the result of elected mayors and councillors or national decentralization processes but also of civil society having avenues to participate in urban governance. This combination of national policies and programmes that encourage decentralization, strengthened local democracy, and an active civil society has held the key to a wide range of innovative partnerships that have favoured the urban poor. Table 6.2 provides a summary of the results of examples of such partnerships from all regions. 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 156 Table 6.2: Innovative partnerships for urban governance (continued) Type of partnership Examples Planning urban expansion and service provision (continued) Most of the population now has domestic connections for drinking water and regular solid waste collection. Over 5,000 houses have been improved and there has been a large expansion in public space. Most of this has been financed and implemented through partnerships between the municipal government and community-level management committees. Relocating and upgrading informal settlements The Thai Government\u2019s Community Organizations Development Institute (CODI) channels government funds in the form of infrastructure subsidies and housing loans direct to community organizations formed by low-income inhabitants in informal settlements. Households in informal settlements can get legal land tenure by purchasing land with a government loan, negotiating a community lease or relocating to other land of the government agency or landowner on whose land they are squatting. CODI also provides loans to community organizations to loan on to their members to help build or improve their homes, and supports city governments to collaborate with urban poor organizations \u2013 for instance providing sites for those living in various \u2018mini\u2019 squatter settlements in their jurisdiction to relocate to, with the land provided on a 30-year lease. Overall, CODI has provided loans and grants to community organizations that reached 2.4 million households between 1992 and 2007. Appropriate land use and building standards Government-funded serviced-site programmes to official standards were too expensive for low-income groups in Namibia25. A new government policy, developed with the Shack Dwellers Federation of Namibia (a federation of savings groups formed mostly by low-income women) shows a willingness to overturn conventional approaches to standards and regulations, for instance in plot sizes and in infrastructure standards, to make their serviced sites more affordable to low-income households. Families are allowed to upgrade services as they can afford to make the investments, extending sewerage and water lines from mains provision into their homes. Groups that belong to the Shack Dwellers Federation have access to their own loan fund from which they can borrow for such service improvements. A similar partnership between government agencies and the Malawi Homeless People\u2019s Federation 26 also led to changes in official standards to reduce costs and make better use of land. The Federation is formed by savings groups; most savers are women who currently rent accommodation in existing slums. There are more than 100 savings groups with a membership of more than 30,000. The Federation\u2019s negotiation with the Department of Physical Planning in Lilongwe allowed agreement on plots of 150\u2013200 m2 (well below the official standard) and this meant that land originally allocated for 95 plots could produce 222 plots. This was also helped by reducing road width from the standard 12 m down to 9 m. Providing basic infrastructure In Pakistan the Orangi Pilot Project Research and Training Institute (OPP-RTI) supported the inhabitants of katchi abadis to plan, implement and finance the provision of basic sanitation \u2013 sanitary latrines in their houses, underground sewers in the lanes and neighbourhood collector sewers. The costs are reduced by about a fifth by eliminating contractors and modifying engineering, and can be covered by the inhabitants. OPP-RTI then supports local government to plan and finance the larger \u2018external\u2019 trunk sewers and treatment plants into which the neighbourhood sewers feed.

In around 300 locations in Pakistan, communities have financed, managed and built their own internal sanitation systems. Local governments can also afford to install the external systems as they no longer have to fund the internal components and as OPP-RTI has helped them develop much lower-cost methods for planning and building trunk sewers. OPP-RTI has also helped government agencies convert natural drains into sewers and develop drainage plans for most of Karachi. Thus, community organizations and local NGOs have been able to transform planning and investment in sewers and drains in Karachi in ways that have brought major benefits to large sections of the low-income population. This was also done without a need for large loans from international agencies, which inevitably increase debt burdens. Incorporating disaster risk reduction into good urban and local governance In a number of cities in Colombia disaster risk reduction has been incorporated as an integral part of improvements in urban and local governance. In Bogot\u00e0, for example, the city government has invested close to US$ 460 million to retrofit and rehabilitate risk prone schools as well as include disaster risk reduction in the educational curriculum. Hospitals, bridges, fire stations and key governmental buildings have also been reinforced. These outcomes were possible through a combination of competent city government, community awareness and participation, and an accurate assessment of disaster risks in the city, the results of which were used in land-use plans, building codes and investment decisions. In Manizales, an innovative cross-subsidized insurance scheme called Predio Seguro, supported by the city government, has enabled poor households to obtain catastrophe insurance cover. The city government, in partnership with women\u2019s groups in informal settlements also invests in stabilizing slopes in landslide prone informal settlements 27. 157 Chapter 6 Addressing the underlying risk factors Innovative financing for disaster risk management assets, delay of development opportunities or the adoption of low-risk, low-yield livelihood strategies, which generally do not stand up well against series of shocks 30. While, in the case of large disasters, informal coping may be supported by post-disaster assistance from governments or humanitarian agencies it has been consistently documented over decades that this is often ad hoc, poorly targeted and short-term. This section will review four kinds of risk financing tools that have strengthened resilience at different levels: microfinance, microinsurance, parametric crop insurance and catastrophe pools. 6.3.1 Microfinance Due to the efforts of microfinance institutions (MFIs) such as the Grameen Bank, Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC) and now thousands of others in countries of all levels of economic development, microfinance now reaches more than 93 million poor clients 31 and has helped households in risk prone communities around the world to strengthen their livelihoods and increase their resilience. This success has been helped by the development of innovative structures such as self-help groups \u2013 small groups of 5\u201310 members living in the same community agreeing to share liability for individual loans. This reduces the risk to the MFI that loans will not be repaid and reduces the need for collateral. Microfinance has been used to invest in livelihood activities and to improve or repair houses, actions that can reduce vulnerability and increase disaster resilience. It has also been integrated into post-disaster recovery contexts (see Box 6.7) where MFIs are often already active among affected households. Additionally, many microfinance programmes have specifically targeted women, who are often particularly vulnerable. While there are immediate needs for funds after a disaster, there are also needs for longer- term credit for economic and livelihood recovery. With their long-term relationship with clients, MFIs can provide ready access to regulated lending, increase resources for recovery and Emerging practices based on microfinance, including microinsurance and catastrophe financing, do not necessarily reduce disaster losses. However, they do increase resilience in both urban and rural areas and therefore can play a key role in avoiding the translation of disaster impacts into poverty outcomes. At the same time, there is evidence that if properly targeted they can be used to provide incentives for risk reduction measures. Risk financing and other financial tools to manage disaster risk have existed for decades but primarily benefit upper- and middle- income families, large businesses and wealthy governments. Poor households, particularly those working in the informal economy and with irregular cash flows, typically have little access to such tools. Poor households in most developing countries have a limited ability to pay for insurance even when it is available. Most income is used to cover basic needs such as food and housing,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b230c706-32ca-4324-a468-32f307033373": {"__data__": {"id_": "b230c706-32ca-4324-a468-32f307033373", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "426dc40c335b0eedd543811ce51376a191dbb6cbe6a7a4f31362e0764111eb09"}}, "hash": "426dc40c335b0eedd543811ce51376a191dbb6cbe6a7a4f31362e0764111eb09", "text": "and other kinds of insurance, such as health insurance, are usually given a higher priority by households than catastrophe insurance. As a consequence, more than 40% of direct disaster losses are insured in developed countries, usually through compulsory insurance, whereas it is estimated that less than 10% of these losses are covered by insurance in middle-income countries and less than 5% in low-income countries 28. The IADB, for example, estimates that only 10% of the population of South and Central America has access to credit and even fewer to insurance and other financial services 29, while insurance penetration, measured as a percentage of GDP, is 1.4% in Latin America, compared to 3% in Europe and 5% in North America. This lack of access to financial and risk transfer mechanisms compounds the risks faced by the poor and is a significant factor in the translation of disaster loss into increased poverty. As described in Chapter 3, households, communities and countries are left with limited sets of informal coping mechanisms. These often involve increases in high-interest debt, sales of 6.3 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 158 re-catalyse local economic enterprise. There are many instances, in Bangladesh, El Salvador, India and Nicaragua for example, where MFIs have integrated loans for housing repair or reconstruction into their portfolios. However, MFIs\u2019 effectiveness may be overestimated given a lack of understanding of the potential and limitations of microfinance among some international NGOs and humanitarian agencies that support post-disaster recovery. Efforts to expand MFI programmes too quickly create formidable challenges to operating efficiently and managing risks adequately, particularly as travel and staff compensation costs increase. Additionally, the failure to separate microfinance from relief activities may lead to confusion among clients between assistance provided as loans or grants and may undermine the viability of existing microcredit programmes 33. There are more fundamental questions regarding the success of microfinance in decreasing poverty, particularly extreme poverty 34. However, to the extent that MFIs specifically include lending to reduce disaster risk, through home improvement or livelihood strengthening, both before and after disasters, they can increase household resilience and reduce vulnerability to disaster loss, particularly amongst the moderately poor 35. 6.3.2 Microinsurance Microinsurance has emerged as a potential solution for extending insurance coverage to poor households, providing access to post-disaster finance in a relatively fast, reliable and predictable manner, allowing the poor to protect their assets and mitigate their financial losses in the face of disaster. By providing immediate liquidity, microinsurance is also seen as promoting dignity and self-reliance, which reliance on humanitarian assistance so often undermines. Microinsurance schemes have existed for a number of years, often building on informal cooperative or mutual models and insuring against funeral expenses, unemployment, accidents and loss of life. Existing schemes have also used a wide variety of distribution channels including community-based mutual savings, MFIs, credit unions, commercial insurance companies and government social protection services. In recent years, microinsurance schemes have also been developed or extended to cover disaster risks. Many MFIs have begun to offer insurance on microcredit loans so that borrowers (and the MFIs) will not be indebted if their livelihood is damaged by a disaster. There are also examples of bundling with savings programmes, such as the Self Employed Women\u2019s Association microinsurance programme in India, which Box 6.7: Microfinance in disaster recovery, Sri Lanka32 By 2005 MFIs in Sri Lanka had more than 15 million deposit accounts (more than one per household) and 2 million outstanding loans in a country with a population of a little over 20 million. The Indian Ocean Tsunami significantly impacted MFIs operating in the affected coastal areas as many lost staff and clients in addition to critical materials such as client records. Many clients had lost livelihood assets and income sources and most transactions involved withdrawals rather than deposits. However, despite the early setbacks, MFIs ultimately proved a valuable resource to bolster resilience and speed the recovery of both existing and new clients. One of the first priorities for MFIs was to understand how their clients had been impacted, looking at whether the borrower or primary income earner had died or was disabled, whether business assets were lost, whether the client\u2019s house was damaged, and whether the market for the business was significantly affected. The MFIs then restructured loans on a case-by-case basis for clients, generally only writing off loans when the borrower had been killed or permanently disabled. Since the tsunami a number of MFIs have instituted reforms to offer their clients more protection in future disasters, including revamping group-lending structures to reduce situations where", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f3a2b71d-db31-4be0-90ea-bf114feb0fe3": {"__data__": {"id_": "f3a2b71d-db31-4be0-90ea-bf114feb0fe3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "471a7d04fbb3e95886c6fb817d2ea8d54812f556e4fa81f649fa7da135cf9553"}}, "hash": "471a7d04fbb3e95886c6fb817d2ea8d54812f556e4fa81f649fa7da135cf9553", "text": "one person\u2019s default can pull the entire group into default, and developing new products such as emergency or reconstruction loans to help clients cope. 159 Chapter 6 Addressing the underlying risk factors allows its members to save for insurance through fixed deposits in savings accounts 36. Governments such as those of the Philippines and South Africa have initiated efforts to change regulations and policies to remove barriers to entry and facilitate broader participation of the private sector in providing microinsurance37. However, with the potential for large covariant losses, microinsurance for disaster risk often requires additional partnership with re-insurers to ensure adequate protection. Currently India hosts the greatest number of microinsurance schemes for disaster risk, in large part as a result of the adoption in 2002 of a new regulatory framework that requires insurance companies to increase their coverage in the \u201crural and social sectors\u201d38. Taking a pro-poor stance has helped to shape the market and encourage private sector interest. While the creation of cross-subsidies means that wealthier clients must now cover additional operating costs, it does provide a route through which governments can address market failures to serve the needs of poor clients. Nevertheless, experience in using microinsurance to protect against disaster risk has been limited and significant questions still remain about its long-term viability and ability to benefit wide segments of the poor. Even the low costs of existing microinsurance programmes can be too high to be affordable to very poor households, who must trade-off the costs of insurance against other needs from scarce incomes. Some organizations like the All India Disaster Mitigation Institute have tried to develop schemes that link microinsurance to other disaster risk reduction measures. However, so far efforts to establish discounts in insurance premiums as incentives for disaster risk reduction have not been viable in ways that preserve the base affordability of the microinsurance. 6.3.3 Weather index crop insurance While most microinsurance schemes use traditional indemnity insurance, which pays insurance claims in response to specific losses, new index-based schemes, also called parametric insurance, have emerged covering weather risks for crops. Parametric insurance products, which rely on the measurement of an objective and independent proxy, offer new opportunities to transfer the risks associated with crop or livestock loss, caused by droughts, extreme temperatures or extended floods. Most schemes use rainfall levels (as measured in rain gauges at local meteorological stations) as a physical trigger. Farmers collect an insurance payout if the index is triggered regardless of the actual losses, simplifying administration and reducing the need for costly claims and adjustment procedures. However, for index insurance to be successful the trigger must be transparent, easily understood and well correlated with the losses experienced. If the trigger is not well correlated, even if an individual farmer\u2019s losses are substantial, the index may not reach the trigger level and there is no payout. Weather derivative crop insurance schemes in various forms have now been used in approximately 15 countries, including Ethiopia, India, Malawi, Mexico, Nicaragua, Peru and Ukraine, to protect against both severe rainfall and lack of rainfall, while a livestock scheme has been developed in Mongolia. Generally the contracts are written by insurance companies and sold by rural development banks, farm cooperatives or MFIs. Index-based insurance can also provide greater incentives for risk reduction than indemnity insurance. Since payments are based on the index measure or trigger and not on actual losses to policyholders, the policyholders have an incentive to minimize their potential losses since they will still collect the payout 39. While crop insurance continues to spread in many locations around the world, the biggest constraint has been the availability of data from local or regional weather stations. As a result there have been recent efforts to develop new indexing methods that could potentially increase coverage. For example, the World Bank has worked with the Government of Mongolia to develop a scheme to track regional livestock death statistics as an index for insurance against the dzud winter freezes 40 and in Thailand it is testing the use of satellite data on flooding to develop an index-based flood insurance that would payout based on the percentage of land inundated and 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 160 the duration of the flooding in specific districts 41. Box 6.8 highlights an innovative programme in Bolivia that uses production on specified reference plots of farmland as the index measure.

International assistance often offsets less than 10% of countries\u2019 disaster losses, reconstruction funding may take up to 12 months or more to mobilize and may not be allocated effectively to address the most affected sectors and households. Resources are often diverted from development sectors to finance reconstruction, negatively impacting on development and poverty reduction. Without access to disaster insurance, homeowners run the risk of losing life-time or inter-generational savings tied up in the value of their homes while governments are typically exposed to tremendous budgetary uncertainty due to unpredictability of disaster relief and recovery expenditures. New financial instruments, which have showed success in providing resources after disasters both to households in upper- and middle-income countries as well as to governments, include catastrophe pools, catastrophe bonds and lines of contingent credit. Catastrophe pools provide a mechanism for catalysing the provision of insurance in markets where there have been impediments to private insurers offering disaster coverage, often due to ambiguity about the probabilities of loss, fear of large correlated losses, inadequate premiums and/ or lack of ready demand for existing insurance products. Catastrophe pools typically combine a range of governmental, private sector and donor support \u2013 often focused on addressing distinct layers of risk \u2013 to engage market interest and establish a viable insurance fund. Catastrophe insurance pools provide immediate post-disaster financing proportionate to incurred losses. The pooling can be either among citizens in a particular country or set of countries or among governments to limit their own exposure to their sovereign disaster risk. Experiences to date include the Turkey Catastrophe Insurance Pool (Box 6.9), the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (Box 6.10) and the Mexico Catastrophe Bond, which were stimulated by the experience of large-scale disasters such as the 1999 Marmara earthquake in Turkey or the 2004 hurricane season in the Caribbean. Other mechanisms include the provision of contingent credit lines to provide governments with immediate liquidity in the event of a major disaster. Colombia is the first country to secure such credit from the World Bank for a value of US$ 150 million. Box 6.8: Fund for the mitigation of agricultural risk (Fondo de Mitigacion del Riesgo Agrario), Bolivia42 Fundaci\u00f3n PROFIN has developed an innovative index-based insurance scheme that is being piloted in four provinces in the North and Central Altiplano regions of Bolivia. The scheme combines incentives for proactive risk reduction and a flexible, people-centered index mechanism. In this scheme the trigger is based on the \u201cproduction levels of reference plots of farmland in areas that are geographically similar in terms of temperature, precipitation, humidity and soil type. The reference plots belong to farmers identified as good practitioners by their peers. The yields on these plots serve to indicate whether production levels have been adversely affected by weather, thus triggering an insurance payout, or by other factors within a farmer\u2019s control. The reference farmers also serve as technical assistance agents to promote ideas for increasing yields and reducing disaster risks and impacts. The system encourages other farmers to match the reference farmers in implementing mitigation efforts to reduce the effects of drought, excess rains, hailstorms and frost because those farmers run the risk that their own plots will be significantly affected while the reference farmers\u2019 plots will be less affected. 161 Chapter 6 Addressing the underlying risk factors From this perspective, catastrophe pools would seem to provide an effective and transparent mechanism for offsetting losses, increasing resilience and for replacing, at least in part, traditional humanitarian and reconstruction assistance (although there is no guarantee that resources provided to governments that have insured their sovereign risk are used any more effectively than traditional recovery and reconstruction financing). They have the additional benefit of increasing awareness of risks, given the need to produce detailed risk estimates of the assets to be insured and given that purchasing insurance per se implies a level of risk awareness and acceptance. In the case of SIDS, where opportunities to reduce asset risks are more limited and where economic resilience is lowest, catastrophe pools may provide a fundamental building block in the disaster risk reduction architecture.

Catastrophe re-insurance capacity is certainly available for such countries, The TCIP is an insurance pool that seeks to provide affordable insurance to homeowners, especially those in urban residential areas, and to reduce the fiscal exposure of the Turkish Government by accumulating funds for future disasters, sharing portions of risk within the country and transferring other portions of the risk to international reinsurance and capital markets. Proof of participation in the scheme is compulsory for land registry transactions such as when houses are sold. The TCIP started offering policies in September 2000. At that time, the Turkish Government also changed sections of its disaster law to remove the Government\u2019s commitment to provide post-disaster reconstruction assistance for housing lost to natural disasters, thus putting much of the responsibility back on homeowners. The TCIP is managed as a private insurance company under the strategic guidance of the Box 6.9: The Turkey Catastrophe Insurance Pool (TCIP)45 Turkish Treasury. During the first 5 years of the pool\u2019s operations, the World Bank also provided a contingent credit layer that would have provided financial resources to the TCIP to meet claims if needed. Marketing and distribution of policies have been facilitated by a state-of-the-art Internet-based information system that has produced significant cost efficiencies in underwriting new policies. The policies are sold by private insurance companies who are paid a standard commission. As of July 2008, TCIP covered 2.8 million households, approximately 21% of the overall target market in Turkey and 31% in the Marmara region surrounding Istanbul. While efforts to keep costs low have made the insurance more affordable, uptake of policies in areas outside of Ankara, Istanbul and the western coast has been hampered by lower awareness of risk and lower levels of household income. Box 6.10: Addressing public/ sovereign risks \u2013 The Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF)46 The CCRIF is a regional insurance facility owned and operated by 16 Caribbean governments. The facility insures the governments against the impacts of catastrophic hurricanes and earthquakes and allows them to access liquidity at short notice using parametric triggers. For earthquakes the triggers are based on USGS data on the location, intensity and likelihood of damage to the member countries. For hurricanes the triggers are based on data from the US National Hurricane Center on hurricane paths and wind intensity. Start-up activities have been supported by the World Bank and the Caribbean Development Bank and the Governments of Canada, France and the UK. By pooling their risk the governments have man- aged to reduce their individual insurance premium by up to 40%. To date the CCRIF has made payouts in response to two events \u2013 US$ 418,976 to the St Lucian Government and US$ 528,021 to the Dominican Government as a result of the magnitude 7.4 earthquake close to Martinique in November 2007, and US$ 6.3 million to the Government of the Turks and Caicos Islands after Hurricane Ike in September 2008. 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 162 given the relatively low level of asset exposure. However, the requisite start up costs, such as catastrophe risk modelling and data collection, can be expensive relative to potential revenues, while awareness of and capacity to pay for insurance may be low. Even in Turkey insurance penetration tends to be highest in wealthier areas such as Istanbul. In low-income and least developed countries, and in many low\u2013middle-income countries, support from the public sector and the international community will be required to create the necessary information platforms and domestic and financial infrastructure. These will normally have to be accompanied by a clarification of legal responsibilities for post-disaster assistance. The responsibility of governments to finance post-disaster recovery and reconstruction is often implicit, as the law usually does not clearly define their financial responsibilities. The perception that governments are responsible for covering household disaster losses and that the international community is responsible for covering sovereign disaster losses is a major barrier to a wider application of catastrophe pools to disaster risk financing. At the same time, the provision of direct insurance premium subsidies by the public sector tends to provide the wrong economic incentives, benefiting high-risk policyholders to the detriment of low-risk policyholders 47. Given the parametric nature of most catastrophe pools, they typically address intensive risk manifestations and do not address the more frequently occurring but low-intensity losses associated with extensive risk. As highlighted in Chapter 3, the housing losses associated with extensive risk may be as high as 40% of total disaster losses in that sector.

Unfortunately, experience of disaster contingency funds is still mixed and has tended to show that the funds get diverted to other government priorities, in which case the losses associated with extensive risk manifestations are not covered at all and only increase the deficit of infrastructure and services faced by the urban and rural poor. 6.4 The management of ecosystem services 6.4.1 Approaches to ecosystem management Resilient ecosystems are not only important for reducing disaster risks. They are critical to providing for sustainable livelihoods, in securing a reliable flow of goods and services, and in reducing vulnerability to an increasingly unpredictable climate. Building ecosystem resilience requires actions at different scales, with a wide array of stakeholders, and an understanding that different bodies of knowledge, including scientific, technical and local and traditional, are needed to understand the effects of global environmental change on local ecosystems. The global decline in many regulating and provisioning ecosystem services contributes to increasing hazard for poor urban and rural households as well as declining livelihood resilience. From this perspective, ecosystem management is an emerging practice that can potentially contribute both to the regulation of weather-related hazards as well as to the strengthening of livelihoods. A schematic view of the costs and benefits of ecosystem management is given in Figure 6.1. 163 Chapter 6 Addressing the underlying risk factors Costs resulting from adopting an ecosystem approach \u2013 primarily economic benefits foregone due to alternate land use \ufffdLoss of benefits from using the ecosystem \ufffd that were contrary to management of the ecosystem for disaster risk regulation, e.g. loss of income from logging in watershed areas that are now being reforested for the purpose of regulating flood and sediment flow Opportunity costs (OC) 2nd order costs Benefits resulting from adoption of an ecosystem approach \ufffdIndirect benefits that result from using an \ufffd ecosystem approach, e.g. harvesting of products from trees planted and protected to prevent erosion and desertification Co-benefits (COB) 2nd order benefits Costs occurring from maintaining ecosystems, restoring damaged or lost ecosystems, and designing ecosystems in order that they deliver disaster regulating ecosystem services \ufffdCosts for developing ecosystem approaches \ufffd that often diverge from conventional approaches \ufffdCosts for developing basis, e.g. data necessary \ufffd for decision-makers to pursue new strategies \ufffdCosts for awareness-, knowledge- and \ufffd capacity-building among involved stakeholders and civil society to support the ecosystem approach \ufffdCosts for implementing approaches, and \ufffd for maintaining/monitoring implemented approaches Restoration costs (RC) 1st order costs Costs that would have occurred from (economic, social and environmental) damage caused by natural disasters that could be reduced or avoided by the use of an ecosystem approach \ufffdDirect benefits resulting from using an \ufffd ecosystem approach that reduce disaster risk, e.g. avoided loss of land through erosion through establishment of protective coastal vegetation Benefits or avoided costs (AC) 1st order benefits Figure 6.1: Costs and benefits of applying ecosystem management to disaster risk reduction48 In the case of ecosystem restoration, the avoided costs may significantly exceed the restoration costs. For example, planting and protecting 12,000 ha of mangroves by the IFRC in Viet Nam cost approximately US$ 1 million but reduced the costs of sea dyke maintenance by US$ 7.3 million per year. At the same time, the co-benefits may also greatly exceed the opportunity costs. For example, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment estimated that the value of healthy coastal mangroves as nurseries, pollution filters and coastal defences is US$ 1,000 to US$ 36,000 for mangrove value versus US$ 200 per hectare for shrimp farming 49. In Malaysia, the economic value of mangroves as coastal defences has been estimated at US$ 300,000 per kilometre, taking into account the costs of hard engineering work to achieve the same protective effect 50. In Switzerland, the economic value of forests in preventing avalanches is valued at US$ 100 per hectare per year in open areas but up to US$ 170,000 in areas with high-value assets 51. At the same time, ecosystems often provide important co-benefits if properly managed.

In these cases the co-benefits of protecting the ecosystem usually outweigh the opportunity costs. The best examples of ecosystem management are win\u2013win strategies that simultaneously reduce hazard and increase livelihood viability for poor households, while providing broader global co-benefits in areas such as water and energy supply, air quality and climate regulation. Managing the provision of ecosystem services is complicated for many reasons. While the benefits may appear obvious they are often shared by many people over the long term. Ensuring that private interests do not degrade these social benefits requires effective and long- term institutional, legal and administrative systems backed up with the resources and political support to be respected. There are many opportunities to engineer ecosystems to provide multiple ecosystem services. However, engineering ecosystems to ensure that they optimally produce services that are produced and consumed by different social groups and economic and political interests at different scales is usually a daunting governance challenge. Nevertheless, there are a number of different practices that applied appropriately or in combination can facilitate ecosystem management in a way that does reduce hazard and strengthen livelihoods. 6.4.2 Environmental governance The broad area of environmental governance involves creating policy and regulatory frameworks and institutional structures to promote environmental sustainability. Often these frameworks specify levels of environmental protection and call for means to monitor and enforce that protection. One of the best known and most widely applied tools is the use of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) in project and investment planning and approval. Disaster risk considerations are now increasingly factored into EIAs. For example, the Caribbean Development Bank has integrated disaster risk into its EIAs and several Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM) member countries, such as Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago, have already formalized these changes in the EIA process. 6.4.3 Integrated planning Integrated planning, in which both environmental and disaster risk considerations are factored into land-use and development planning, is another mechanism that can facilitate the management of ecosystems. This includes integrated coastal zone management, integrated water resource management, as well as specific initiatives such as the Mangroves for the Future initiative \u2013 a multi-country, multi-agency, multi-stakeholder initiative aimed at improving coastal zone management. The success of integrated planning is closely associated with the quality of governance and in most countries success has depended, as in other areas, on innovative partnerships between national agencies, local governments and civil society. 6.4.4 Protected areas Protected areas legislation, and other methods of natural resource management to conserve and restore ecosystems, is another relevant tool. The promotion of natural floodplains and wetlands as cost effective measures for flood hazard mitigation is becoming increasingly accepted in a number of countries as an alternative to expensive hard-engineering measures such as canalizing rivers and building flood defence walls. Protected forests regulate the water cycle, can mitigate flood and drought hazard and contribute to the sustainability of rural livelihoods both through the provision of forest products as well as eco- tourism (see Box 6.11). Coastal afforestation and the protection and restoration of mangroves can complement sea walls to protect erosion prone coastlines. 6.4.5 Environmental technology A range of new environmental technologies and innovations is being introduced by the private sector, NGOs and public sector initiatives that offer new soft or eco-engineering approaches to the management of ecosystems and hazards and of energy, as well as to the strengthening of rural and urban livelihoods. Examples include 165 Chapter 6 Addressing the underlying risk factors technologies for water harvesting in drought prone areas, for managing temperature extremes in housing, fuel efficient stoves aimed to limit deforestation, decentralized microhydro and solar energy, and countless others. While the potential of technological innovation is enormous, major cultural and economic barriers often exist to their adoption by risk-averse poor rural and urban communities. As a result, while pilot projects abound, cases of mainstreaming and up-scaling are still the exception. 6.4.6 Payment for ecosystem services Payment for ecosystem services (PES) is an environmental management tool that has been in existence since the 1990s. It involves placing a monetary value upon ecosystem services and then finding both \u2018buyers\u2019 and \u2018sellers\u2019. The costs and benefits of the different kinds of provisioning, Some previously degraded areas have been rescued and economic benefits have been quantified due to the consequent risk reduction.

Box 6.11: Madagascar\u2019s watershed protection 52 regulatory and cultural ecosystem services are valued and systems are designed so that users pay for the services provided. For example, a protected watershed provides water for domestic consumption and hydro-energy for a nearby city but if the watershed were deforested for logging this would provide benefits for those who sold the wood. If logged the costs in terms of reduced availability and more expensive water and electricity would be paid for by the residents of the city. Using a PES approach, the opportunity costs of protecting the watershed would be paid for by water and electricity consumers (predominantly from peri-urban and urban areas), who receive co-benefits in terms of a secure and cheap supply of water and energy. PES could therefore potentially play a major role in supporting efforts to reduce hazard both in urban and rural areas as well as to increase rural livelihood sustainability (see Box 6.12). However, the mainstreaming of PES is still in its infancy and many current PES programmes present serious obstacles to the inclusion of poor households 55, given that they were originally designed to meet conservation rather than poverty reduction goals. The policy attention in many countries is indeed now shifting to identifying reforms needed to increase the potential of PES for poverty reduction and even in their current imperfect form, PES programs have managed to deliver some important benefits to low-income households, including the penetration of new markets for sustainable In the Costa Rican programme of PES, forest landowners are paid a flat rate for protecting their forest. These payments are considered a compensation for the environmental services provided. The system acknowledges four types of services: protection of watersheds, biodiversity, carbon mitigation and scenic beauty/tourism. It does not value the actual services provided by a particular forest area, but rather pretends that all forests provide the same average of services and are thus eligible to the same payment. Also, it currently does not differentiate between areas of high vs. low risk of forest degradation or deforestation. The fact that the landowners\u2019 Box 6.12: PES in Costa Rica 53 demand for PES enrolment currently exceeds by far the availability of financial PES resources indicates that for some landowners the PES payments are much higher than actual conservation opportunity costs. It is likely that efficiency of the PES could be increased if payments were better aligned with opportunity costs and threats and if spatial priorities were established. A less standardized approach, however, would complicate the PES system and increase research and administration costs. In Central American countries other than Costa Rica, PES mechanisms have been difficult to establish due to enduring institutional deficiencies, lack of legal land tenure and poor governance 54. 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 166 timber, organic coffee and other agroforestry products.

Since the 1990s, C-DRM and L-DRM initiatives have been increasingly and enthusiastically promoted by bilateral and multilateral organizations and governments. In 1994, the Yokohama Declaration, from the first World Conference on Disaster Reduction, put an official seal of blessing on these approaches by stressing the importance of focusing disaster risk reduction efforts on poor communities 57. While in C-DRM the focus is on direct partnership with local community organizations, in L-DRM the focus is on working with and through local governments. As a practice C-DRM has taken root in all developing regions. L-DRM, in contrast, has evolved mainly in Latin America and to some extent in Asia. L-DRM and C-DRM approaches, however, are rarely mutually exclusive. Most L-DRM approaches rest on partnerships between local governments and community and civil society organizations. Similarly, the most successful C-DRM approaches are those that have managed to attract the support of local and national governments. Clearly the definition of what is or isn\u2019t local varies from context to context. As a mediator and arbitrator of different social interests and conflicts and as a key actor in environmental, territorial and sector planning and development, local governments can potentially play a huge role in disaster risk reduction. However, the strength or weakness of local governments varies enormously according to a country\u2019s territorial and political\u2013administrative structure, the level of decentralization of government responsibilities and the availability", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e98b8b38-6997-4c6b-b566-7f4f32bd6657": {"__data__": {"id_": "e98b8b38-6997-4c6b-b566-7f4f32bd6657", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1574799021a7f7302e93f69bd52faa4d56000b6b5a4f84d06e43ea8e980796be"}}, "hash": "1574799021a7f7302e93f69bd52faa4d56000b6b5a4f84d06e43ea8e980796be", "text": "of resources. Community- and local-level approaches to disaster risk reduction 6.5 become an important contributor to livelihood security due to the regularity of the payments and the incentive they provide to manage sustainable ecosystems. The analysis presented in Chapter 3 highlighted that local areas exposed to the same hazard manifest very different patterns of risk. This indicates that while disaster risk is influenced by broader national and global factors such as the quality of governance or climate change, it is shaped at the local level. The way communities, municipal governments, enterprises and other local actors use and transform territory, natural resources, the built environment and other assets has an enormous influence on how hazard, exposure, vulnerability and resilience are configured in each locality and together define the social territory of risk. Given that risk is configured locally and that disaster impacts are experienced locally, it is unsurprising that in all the different practice areas reviewed in this chapter, emphasis has been placed on the importance of engaging local stakeholders, civil society organizations and municipal governments in disaster risk reduction. This section will examine this engagement with community-based organizations and local government as a practice in its own right, one that cuts across all the other practice areas. 6.5.1 The emergence of community- and local-level approaches Since the 1980s, there has been a growing interest in the practice of community-based or local- level disaster risk reduction (referred to here as C-DRM and L-DRM 56). Interest in these approaches initially came from the pioneering work of NGOs in Asia and Latin America, which recognized that national disaster risk reduction policies, strategies and programmes frequently failed to address the risks faced by 167 Chapter 6 Addressing the underlying risk factors Most C-DRM and L-DRM initiatives are rarely explicit about how they would contribute to reducing poverty. But a common feature of almost all such initiatives is that they focus on poorer communities. In fact, the focus on addressing disaster risk in poor areas is so implicit that, in most cases, \u2018vulnerable community\u2019 is considered synonymous with rural or urban poverty. In practice, nevertheless, C-DRM and L-DRM initiatives often develop in areas with functioning and active community organizations or local governments, which are not necessarily the most poor or the most vulnerable. C-DRM and L-DRM consist of applying a community- or local-level approach to a wide range of practices. A wide range of participatory tools and techniques, such as vulnerability and capacity analysis, have been developed and applied in support of C-DRM and L-DRM initiatives 58. C-DRM and L-DRM approaches have been applied to: the mapping and monitoring of hazard \ufffd \ufffd levels, using local knowledge to develop early warning systems hazard mitigation activities, such as the \ufffd \ufffd strengthening or construction of dykes, slope stabilization, the recovery of mangroves and, in urban areas, improvement of drainage improved ecosystem management, under local \ufffd \ufffd responsibility, including in some cases the use of PES mechanisms development of participatory land-use and \ufffd \ufffd development plans that incorporate disaster risk considerations strengthening of livelihoods, through \ufffd \ufffd promotion of employment and measures to increase agricultural productivity, water and food security and marketing initiatives application of microfinance and \ufffd \ufffd microinsurance to increase social protection and resilience strengthening of local governance, including \ufffd \ufffd the disaster risk reduction capacities of local governments the adoption of gender-sensitive approaches \ufffd \ufffd into disaster risk reduction practices. A great number of community and local development initiatives also address many of the underlying risk factors highlighted in this Report but are not labelled C-DRM and L-DRM. 6.5.2 Why community and local involvement is important In principle at least, an engagement of civil society and local government in disaster risk reduction would seem essential for a number of reasons 59. If local stakeholders are not engaged in the design, implementation and management of disaster risk reduction, then the resulting policies, strategies and plans are less likely to respond appropriately to local conditions. For example, cases abound of projects to build hazard resistant but ecologically and culturally inappropriate housing, which ends up not being accepted by the local population 60. Similarly, if local organizations are not stakeholders in the management of facilities and infrastructure they are less likely to look after them. For example, investment in local infrastructure to reduce hazard, such as storm drainage or slope stabilization, without local involvement and ownership, often results quite quickly in a lack of maintenance and critical disrepair. The cost of disaster risk reduction can often be dramatically reduced due to the mobilization of local resources, capabilities and knowledge.

Local and community engagement contributes to building social capital, raises awareness of disaster risk and strengthens local capacities to address a wider range of development issues. 6.5.3 C-DRM and L-DRM in practice Documented C-DRM and L-DRM initiatives address both sides of the disaster risk\u2013poverty nexus. There are initiatives that focus on increasing resilience, avoiding the translation of disaster impacts into poverty outcomes; others that seek to reduce the translation of poverty into disaster risk; and yet others that seek to address both. 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 168 The vast majority of C-DRM and L-DRM initiatives currently concentrate on risk factors that can easily be addressed at the community- or local-level with small investments, for example, improvements in disaster preparedness and response, rather than those that require addressing more structural issues such as access to land or natural resource management (see Box 6.13). The Disaster Preparedness European Commission\u2019s Humanitarian Aid Office, for example, has promoted a large number of disaster-preparedness projects where preparedness and response planning and early warning systems have often been complemented with local hazard mitigation schemes, for example building and strengthening dykes and stabilizing slopes. Despite a relatively modest investment (approximately \u20ac 80 million worldwide over the last decade) these projects have probably contributed significantly to a reduction in mortality and greater livelihood security in the areas where they have been implemented. While it is difficult to prove whether poverty has been reduced, it is reasonable to assume that if they Heavy rains occur regularly in the West African state of Liberia, yet drainage systems have not been maintained for decades due to factors including lack of funds, years of neglect and misrule, and the civil war. As a result, flooding has triggered recurrent disasters in both rural and urban settings. Cleaning the drains was not a priority for government officials or citizens. Only after the international NGO Mercy Corps raised the possibility of cash-for-work options did government officials embrace the idea. In September 2006, a one-year project was launched in five counties to clear and rehabilitate drainage systems to significantly increase the flow of rainwater and reduce the risk of localized flooding and related health problems. The project met the double objective of creating income (it generated more than 17,800 days of employment) and achieving work that benefited the public, including providing clean water through water well rehabilitation and improving market access by clearing roads and constructing small bridges. Box 6.13: Reducing flood risk through a job creation scheme61 had not been implemented, poverty in the areas concerned might have been worse. A growing number of C-DRM and L-DRM initiatives, however, address the vulnerability of livelihoods, the decline of ecosystems, the lack of social protection, unsafe housing, the improvement of governance and other underlying risk factors (see Box 6.14). Others aim to factor disaster risk considerations into local land- use and development planning, for example initiatives supported by Swiss Development Cooperation and by the World Bank in Central America, by GTZ in Peru or by local governments in Colombia. 6.5.4 Limitations and potential of C-DRM and L-DRM Despite its apparent advantages, experience of C-DRM and L-DRM over the last quarter century illustrates that the approach has many limitations in practice. In principle both C-DRM and L-DRM are described as processes through which disaster risk reduction issues are addressed and local capacities strengthened. In other words, an underlying rationale of both approaches is that there is empowerment of and ownership by local stakeholders, either at the community or municipal level that should lead to a sustainable reduction in disaster risks over time 63. In practice, however, most initiatives are programmes and projects that are implemented at the community or local levels rather than with community or local ownership. Most initiatives have been promoted by NGOs and other supra-local organizations and have been delivered as relatively short-term projects or programmes, which while they are certainly disaster risk reduction activities, rarely generate the organizational and institutional underpinning that sustainable processes would require. Often, when the project or programme ends the process also ends, indicating that local ownership and involvement may be shallower than it appears. Those cases where sustainable local processes have emerged tend to be where national governments have decentralized both responsibilities and resources to the local level, as done in cities in Colombia such as Manizales or Bogota.

While C-DRM and L-DRM can be applied to all areas of disaster risk reduction, in practice most of the success reported is in the area of improved disaster preparedness and response. In La Masica, Honduras, an effective locally managed early-warning system resulted in no mortalities during Hurricane Mitch, while neighbouring areas where local capacities had not been strengthened suffered hundreds of deaths. It was a similar case when the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami struck the coast of Tamil Nadu. UNDP\u2019s strengthening of local capacities in the village of Samiyar Pettai led to a greatly reduced impact.

At the same time, local preparedness and response capacities can generally be strengthened without addressing underlying risk drivers such as land-tenure and access to resources, which generally lie outside community and local government control. Success in addressing these drivers through community- based and local-level approaches has been far more limited, precisely because so many of the factors that need to be addressed are beyond the capacities of local stakeholders to address. The most successful programmes \u2013 while community- or locally based \u2013 have developed broader partnerships with governments and other supra-local stakeholders (see Box 6.15).

To conclude, C-DRM and L-DRM are approaches that can and should be applied to ensure the effectiveness and viability of all the other practices reviewed here, from strengthening urban governance and rural livelihoods, through to developing microinsurance and payment systems for ecosystem management. Their full potential is only fulfilled when they grow into partnerships between government and civil society, which are based not only on local participation and ownership but on political and economic support from national institutions, as illustrated by the case of El Salvador (see Box 6.15). Such partnerships are fundamental for advancing the different practices for addressing disaster risk, poverty and climate change that have been presented in this chapter. The Lower Lempa Valley in El Salvador covers an area of some 880 square kilometres that is recurrently affected by flooding, minor landslides and drought. This area is characterized by poverty levels of over 70%, occupation by resettled ex- combatants from the civil war years, and agricultural production primarily for local consumption and, increasingly, for export. Seriously affected by flooding related to Hurricane Mitch in 1998, the area has regularly demanded disaster risk reduction attention from the national government. Until 2001, this had mainly consisted of dyke building, river dredging exercises and attempts to introduce an early warning system for flood-related risks. The area had been typified by a division between the west and east banks, where the dominant local organizations professed different, and at times, antagonistic philosophies on development. A new strategy for development in the area was inspired by a Salvadorian Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment project financed by the IADB. The project was informed by risk management goals and principles, and worked with the two major organizations and other smaller NGOs and municipal governments. The central notion was that transformation in employment and livelihood options was a crucial component of risk reduction, and thus the plan should emphasize ways that risk reduction and development promotion could be enhanced on a parallel front. Design of the strategy was achieved Box 6.15: Development promotion from a risk management perspective, El Salvador64 using participatory diagnostic techniques whereby the population participated actively in the diagnosis and identification of development-based risk reduction instruments and schemes. The final strategy document called for investment in such diverse aspects as: \ufffdwoodland recovery on the river banks as a \ufffd means for flood control and generation of new employment opportunities \ufffdroad construction linking reliable and efficient \ufffd land to routes out of the zone \ufffdstorage facilities for agricultural products so \ufffd as to be able to avoid forced sale of goods to unscrupulous commercial intermediaries \ufffdprovision of potable water supplies in order to \ufffd combat water-related disease during floods and offer a permanent measure of every-day security to the local population \ufffdearly warning systems and continuity of dyke \ufffd strengthening and river dredging. This combination of measures attempted to broach the risk reduction theme from the angle of livelihood strengthening and direct risk reduction measures. A very important aspect in the proposed scheme was the creation of a local, representative development support organization that could bring together the opposing factions in the area and negotiate new projects with a shared direction and purpose. The development of a second stage, an early warning system for flood-related risk financed through international funds demonstrates the ongoing effectiveness of this model. 171 Chapter 6 Addressing the underlying risk factors Endnotes 1 Christoplos, et al., 2001 2 De-agrarianization is a long-term process of occupational adjustment, income earning reorientation, social identification and spatial relocation of rural dwellers away from strictly agriculture-based rural livelihoods.

Given similar levels of hazard exposure, developing countries suffer far higher levels of mortality and relative economic loss than developed countries. In general, poorer countries and those with weak governance are more at risk than wealthier, better governed countries. Disaster impacts have more serious outcomes in countries with small and vulnerable economies, including many small island developing states (SIDS) and land-locked developing countries (LLDCs), than in larger countries with more diversified economies. Even assuming constant hazard levels, global disaster risk is growing; economic loss risk is growing faster than mortality risk. In general, economic development increases a country\u2019s exposure at the same time as it decreases its vulnerability. However, in low- and middle-income countries with rapidly growing economies, exposure increases at a far faster rate than vulnerability decreases, leading to increased risk overall. Within many developing countries, disaster risk is also spreading extensively, manifested as a very large number of low-intensity impacts, affecting significant areas of a country\u2019s territory. Almost all these impacts are associated with weather-related hazards. Such risk patterns are expanding rapidly, driven by factors such as fast \u2013 but poorly planned and managed \u2013 urban growth and territorial occupation, which increase both the number of people and assets exposed.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9df24b56-a015-4a2c-b8dc-78efdaa110ed": {"__data__": {"id_": "9df24b56-a015-4a2c-b8dc-78efdaa110ed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "67143036385e9ff821149f9e4d89edb80bd8093d52d0cfbf30b58a09a873ca9b"}, "2": {"node_id": "4187406e-3120-4c0b-9528-49f89527900e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a7e9c72b92a77f579372e5a6f3f382d5314d4de45cf4ea96b25dc37c994c1a91"}}, "hash": "a20e55e470a1cd20a0788eecbb94f9ba2cf6c85c3ddc0032a163381f82dcdc8e", "text": "Increased hazard exposure is aggravated by environmental mismanagement and the decline in the regulating services provided by ecosystems.

In principle, international frameworks such as the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA), the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) recognize the links between disaster risk, poverty and climate change. In practice, however, current progress under these frameworks is not leading to a sustainable reduction in disaster risk. Under the HFA many low- and middle- income countries have made major strides towards developing national policies, institutional systems and legislation for disaster risk reduction. However, far less progress has been made in reducing disaster risk in the principal development sectors. In many countries, this is a consequence of insufficient development per se. It is impossible to mainstream disaster risk reduction into development that is not there. However, progress is also challenged by weaknesses in risk reduction governance, including difficulties in compiling comprehensive information on disaster risks, insufficient engagement by the development sectors, and major difficulties in ensuring implementation, enforcement and accountability. Progress in implementing climate change adaptation is slow, and adaptation policy and 7.1 The imperative for urgent action 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 176 institutional frameworks are largely disconnected from those created to reduce disaster risk, at both the national and international levels. Adaptation faces similar challenges to disaster risk reduction, in particular a governance framework that can allow risk in the development sectors to be addressed. In principle, poverty reduction efforts in both rural and urban areas have considerable potential to address the underlying disaster risk drivers if they are clearly focused. In most countries, however, poverty reduction has only weak functional linkages to policy and institutional frameworks for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. At the same time, the inclusion of disaster risk reduction in instruments such as poverty reduction strategy papers (PRSPs) is often limited to disaster preparedness and response aspects, meaning that their potential to address the underlying risk drivers is often not fully exploited. The world will experience significant climate change, even if rapid progress is achieved in moving towards a low-carbon economy. Risk prone developing countries will only be able to avoid further increases in disaster impacts and poverty outcomes by taking decisive action to address the underlying drivers that are responsible for the concentration and expansion of risk. A failure to address these drivers will result in dramatic increases in disaster risk and the associated poverty outcomes. In contrast, if priority is given to addressing these drivers, disaster risk can be reduced and the HFA achieved. Given that disaster impacts and outcomes are so disproportionately concentrated in poorer countries and communities, this is also critical to the achievement of poverty reduction and sustainable development objectives, such as the MDGs, and also offers the best opportunity to adapt to climate change. Rather than a cost, this should be seen as an investment in building a more secure, stable and equitable future. Box 7.1 outlines the main recommendations for action highlighted in this Report. A 20-point plan to reduce risk Accelerate efforts to avoid dangerous climate change 1 Agree measures such as an effective multilateral framework to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and policies for sustainable carbon budgeting. These are essential if potentially catastrophic increases in disaster impacts and associated poverty outcomes are to be avoided in disaster prone developing countries. Increase the economic resilience of small and vulnerable economies 2 Coordinate policies on trade and productive sector development with policies in climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction in order to strengthen economic resilience, particularly in the case of SIDS and LLDCs. 3 Promote the development of catastrophe pools between such countries to allow the transfer of sovereign risk at an affordable cost and provide a more reliable mechanism for recovery and reconstruction. Adopt high-level development policy frameworks to reduce risk 4 Adopt overarching national development policy frameworks at the highest level, backed by the necessary political authority and resources, focusing on the underlying drivers of disaster risk.

Greater urgency is needed in efforts to reduce GHG emissions and energy consumption if a potentially catastrophic increase in disaster risk \u2013 the impacts of which will be largely concentrated in developing countries \u2013 is to be avoided. Mitigation must be a priority for high- income nations because they are responsible for most GHG emissions to date. For most low-income nations, there is not much scope for mitigation because current levels of GHG emissions are so low. In many low-income countries, carbon dioxide emissions per capita are less than 1/200th that of the United States of America and Canada. In 2004, annual per capita carbon dioxide emissions were around 20 tonnes in the United States of America and Canada, between six and ten tonnes in most European nations, and less than 0.25 tonnes for many nations in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia1. These nations\u2019 per capita figures are also far below the targets for the world average sought for 2030 or 2050 to slow and then stop the increase in carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere. However, achieving the necessary reductions in global emissions will also require \u2018low-carbon\u2019 development paths for all growing economies (including the successful low- and middle-income nations). 7.2.2 Trade policy and productive development The threat posed by disaster risk is highest in the case of SIDs, LLDCs and countries with small and vulnerable economies. Many of these countries are also highly susceptible to climate change. As climate change worsens, hazard levels and economic vulnerability will rise.

A key recommendation is to start coordinating policies on trade and productive sector development with those on climate change adaptation and strategies for disaster risk reduction. Strategies are needed to develop capacities and reduce dependence on a single economic sector. The resilience of these countries will increase if they can diversify their economies and improve their participation in world trade. Policy frameworks for risk reducing development 7.3.1 Addressing the underlying risk drivers is possible It is possible to address the underlying drivers of disaster risk. In all regions, innovative approaches are already being applied at the local level and in different sectors, which show that it is possible to address these underlying risk drivers. These include mechanisms for providing land, infrastructure and housing for the urban poor; strengthening the resilience of rural livelihoods; enhancing valuable regulatory and provisioning ecosystem services; using microfinance, microinsurance and index-based insurance to strengthen resilience. The most successful of these experiences have emerged in the context of innovative partnerships between national and local governments and civil society that increase the effectiveness and sustainability of investments, reduce costs, and build valuable social capital. These experiences demonstrate that the underlying risk drivers can be addressed, and that the tools, methods and approaches necessary to do so already exist. However, they must still be integrated into the policy mainstream. Most countries still lack a determined and focused 179 Chapter 7 Investing today for a safer tomorrow high-level development policy framework that addresses these drivers and is supportive of such innovative approaches. Without such central support, ongoing efforts in disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation cannot gain traction. The adoption of such an overarching policy framework would allow the different plans, programmes and projects in poverty reduction, climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction \u2013 as well as in sustainable development in general \u2013 to become better aligned in order to address the underlying drivers of disaster risk. These plans and programmes include PRSPs, National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs), United Nations Development Assistance Frameworks (UNDAFs) and nationally specific programming instruments. To be relevant and successful such a policy framework must be at the centre of the political agenda, backed by dedicated resources in the national budget, and should have leadership at the highest levels of government. 7.3.2 Seizing the opportunity to reduce risk The principal focus of risk-reducing development should be to avoid the rise of new disaster risk. While it is difficult to reduce existing major concentrations of accumulated risk, the avoidance of new risk will stabilize and eventually reduce the overall stock of disaster risk. From this perspective, the reduction of extensive risk is particularly important, given that it represents the initial stages of disaster risk accumulation. Extensive risk can normally be addressed with relatively small investments: for example, minor investments in storm drainage in informal settlements can greatly reduce flood risk. It is better to address extensive risk now, than to deal with major concentrations of intensive risk in the future. However, even intensive disaster risk can be addressed over time. All buildings and infrastructure, for instance, are periodically renewed, repaired, replaced or upgraded, all of which provide opportunities to avoid new disaster risk. Each of these moments of change is a point of bifurcation: if the opportunity is seized, new risk will not arise, but if it is missed, new risk begins to accumulate. Risk is periodically liberated in disaster events, reducing the stock of accumulated risk. The recovery and reconstruction period, after a disaster, therefore, is a particularly powerful moment of opportunity to stop new risk from arising. But it can only be seized if a clear policy framework for risk reducing development exists. A second aim should be to avoid the translation of disaster impacts from existing risks into poverty outcomes. Even if countries are successful in avoiding the creation of new risk, existing concentrations of unrealized risk may be so vast that further and increased disaster loss can be expected in the short- and medium-term. Ensuring that these impacts do not feed back into increased poverty is critical to defusing the disaster risk\u2013poverty nexus. 7.3.3 Urban and local governance Every year the population of urban, informal settlements increases by approximately 25 million people globally. If the expansion of unregulated, informal settlements continues to be the principal mechanism for absorbing urban growth, there will be a commensurate increase in both extensive and intensive disaster risk, as well as urban poverty. Both will be accentuated through climate change. Improving urban and local governance should therefore be a key policy priority in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8840527-1b81-45e4-83ed-778938ed1528": {"__data__": {"id_": "f8840527-1b81-45e4-83ed-778938ed1528", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eb82c754a949c746475ad9492ecb6e3fb7681588990ae736e43fa7c6db5bba14"}}, "hash": "eb82c754a949c746475ad9492ecb6e3fb7681588990ae736e43fa7c6db5bba14", "text": "most developing countries. As was highlighted in Chapter 6, good urban and local governance is usually built on a partnership between competent and accountable local government and an active civil society that can articulate needs and priorities, as well as the decentralization of authority and resources from a supportive central government. Improvements in urban and local governance can integrate disaster risk reduction considerations into a broader strategy that ensures the supply of safe land, secure tenure, infrastructure and services, and adequate, disaster resistant housing for the poor. Chapter 6 provided a non-exhaustive list of good practices, which have already been applied by cities around the world, and which show that it is possible to absorb urban growth in a way that does not increase risk. 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 180 7.4 7.3.4 Strengthening rural livelihoods As highlighted in Chapters 3 and 4, disaster impacts translate into particularly challenging poverty outcomes for the rural poor. Despite urbanization, disaster risk in poor rural areas will continue to be a major challenge and one that will be accentuated by climate change, since rural livelihoods still depend heavily on weather-sensitive activities. In those countries with large, poor rural populations, it will be essential to focus policy on strengthening rural livelihoods. As outlined in Chapter 6, a range of innovative approaches exist in areas including natural resource management, infrastructure development, livelihood generation and others. While strengthening rural livelihoods per se decreases vulnerability and increases resilience, it is essential that disaster risk reduction considerations are factored into the process, for example, to ensure that new schools in rural areas are built to hazard resistant standards. 7.3.5 Enhancing ecosystem services Any further decline in the regulatory services provided by ecosystems will increase weather- related hazard. A decline in provisioning services will further increase the vulnerability of rural livelihoods, as well as the availability of water and energy in urban centres. Protecting and enhancing such ecosystem services is therefore another key policy priority. It is cheaper and easier to manage and protect ecosystems than to restore damage. Chapter 6 highlighted a number of mechanisms that are already available and that could be mainstreamed including payments for ecosystem services and integrated planning. 7.3.6 Targeted social protection for the poorest and most vulnerable At present most countries rely on ex post mechanisms such as emergency assistance, cash transfers and food aid to assist those affected by disasters. Such mechanisms are short-term and often fail to target the most vulnerable groups, which according to the context may include female-headed households, the elderly and children. They also fail to address the longer-term increases in poverty and inequality caused by disaster loss, and negative effects on health, human development and productivity. Another key policy recommendation, therefore, is to shift the emphasis of social protection from ex post to include ex ante mechanisms, and to more effectively target the most vulnerable groups. This Report has not reviewed social protection practice and therefore does not provide detailed policy guidance. Improved social protection should be a key priority not only in those areas subject to concentrations of intensive risk, but in all communities affected by ongoing manifestations of extensive risk. An approach based on partnership Risk reducing development should be supportive of \u2013 and build upon \u2013 ongoing local and sectoral initiatives. It should explicitly adopt an approach built on partnerships between national and local government, civil society and the private sector. This Report has stressed the limitations of conventional approaches to planning and regulating development in low- and middle- income countries where a considerable proportion of both economic and urban development occurs outside the formal sector. While further improvements in building codes, land-use planning and environmental regulations can contribute to risk reduction in high- and upper-middle income countries, they produce diminishing returns in poorer countries and may even be counter-productive. This might occur, for example, if high building standards are used to exclude poor families from the formal housing market. 181 Chapter 7 Investing today for a safer tomorrow If a policy framework for risk-reducing development is to be actionable, a different culture of implementation will be required, one that builds on government\u2013civil society partnerships and cooperation. As highlighted in Chapter 6, such partnerships can dramatically reduce the costs of risk reduction, ensure local acceptance, and help to build social capital, which reduces long-term vulnerability. The importance of this approach cannot be overstressed. For example, investments in urban drainage to reduce extensive risk in informal settlements will be ineffective if the drains are not maintained, are obstructed with garbage, or are encroached", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4cbd0c71-74b9-47d0-a5c5-6a4dbdc4e02b": {"__data__": {"id_": "4cbd0c71-74b9-47d0-a5c5-6a4dbdc4e02b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca808cb22b28bb6433251c93cad90f8302b4ba0e67e91fac81f56143ce20b8c9"}}, "hash": "ca808cb22b28bb6433251c93cad90f8302b4ba0e67e91fac81f56143ce20b8c9", "text": "upon by buildings. If the drainage is planned and built in partnership with local government and the affected communities, there is a far better chance of it being maintained and protected in the long-term. This approach, however, needs a change in culture in public administration in many countries and therefore a corresponding investment in capacity development with support from the international community. Bilateral and multilateral donors have traditionally preferred large, top-down projects as an easy mechanism for disbursing and managing resources. They also, therefore, have a responsibility for supporting a more process-based approach built on local partnerships. There is now enough experience of working through consortiums of NGOs and mechanisms such as social funds to manage the interface between donors, governments and local communities. Effective risk reduction governance 7.5 In addition to a policy framework that prioritizes risk-reducing development, a set of governance arrangements is needed for disaster risk reduction, poverty reduction and climate change adaptation, which is capable of ensuring that risk considerations are factored into all development investments. Improvements to risk reduction governance are critical, in order to provide a vehicle for policy and a systematic approach to planning, financing and monitoring investment in all sectors. In particular, the existing institutional and governance arrangements for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation need to be harmonized, building on existing systems of public administration. Each country has a different political and legal system and arrangements for public administration: there is no one-size-fits-all framework for risk reduction governance. The development of a single governance framework for risk reduction would seem to offer opportunities for more effective policy implementation and for avoiding duplication and lack of coordination. The harmonization of international frameworks and requirements for planning and reporting would be supportive of better in
