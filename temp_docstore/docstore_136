In 2005 the area of occupancy was estimated to be around 130 km2 (divided between three known sites) and in 2012 it was suggested it could be as low as 10 km2. This species is considered to be one of the most common in trade. Forty online advertisements were recorded for this species during 2017\u20132018, while trade data record the import of 10 specimens into the USA between 2016\u20132017. - Ceratophora stoddartii is considered nationally to be endangered, with an estimated area of occupancy of 200 km2. In 2005 it was described as one of the more abundant species in the genus and is also considered to be one of the most common in trade. Fifty-seven online advertisements were recorded during 2017\u20132018, and 25 specimens imported into the USA between 2013 and 2017. All species are threatened by continued habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation, with tolerance to habitat disturbance varying between species. The distinctive appearance of these species makes them sought after by reptile collectors. Exports from Sri Lanka were banned in 1993. In recent years all species have been offered for sale, often at high prices outside of Sri Lanka, and are sometimes reported as being wild-caught. Due to differences in colouration and morphology, it is said to be possible to distinguish all five species in their adult form, but not as juveniles, and most observed trade appeared to involve adults. Analysis: All species have been globally or nationally assessed as endangered or critically endangered, except Ceratophora aspera, which was assessed as Vulnerable in 2009. Several of the species have a restricted distribution, which is likely to be fragmented, and are declining due to deforestation, and therefore appear to meet the biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I: Ceratophora erdeleni, C. karu, C. tennentii and C. stoddartii. In recent years, all species within the genus have been offered for sale within the hobbyist trade, some of which was reported as, or suspected to be, wild-sourced, and therefore illegal. The area of occupancy for Ceratophora aspera has most recently been estimated at less than 500 km2. In 2009 the habitat was declining in extent and quality and the species was categorised as Vulnerable. While the decline has likely continued, C. aspera is unlikely to meet the biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I. It is thought that adults of all species can be differentiated from each other, and although it is more difficult with juveniles it seems that currently it is mainly adults in trade. Therefore, if Parties decide IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 24 37 that not all species meet the Appendix I criteria, the other(s) should not necessarily be listed as look- alikes in Appendix II (for which there is no provision in Appendix I). Other Considerations: Sri Lanka could consider an Appendix-III listing for Ceratophora aspera; stipulating a zero export quota with the listing would reflect that export from Sri Lanka is illegal. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 25 38 Inclusion of Pygmy Lizards Cophotis ceylanica and Cophotis dumbara in Appendix I Proponent: Sri Lanka Summary: The Pygmy Lizards Cophotis ceylanica and C. dumbara are small lizards endemic to the high altitude regions of central Sri Lanka and the only members of their genus. Both species are threatened by a number of factors including habitat loss and fragmentation: timber extraction and clearing of forest for tea plantations have already destroyed large areas of habitat. Cophotis ceylanica was classified in 1998 as endangered nationally. This species has a restricted range with an area of occupancy estimated at less than 500 km2 and perhaps as low as 60 km2. The species was considered \u201crare\u201d in 2005. Cophotis ceylanica was estimated to have decreased by more than 50% in the decade prior to 1998, and was predicted to decline further, although the threats identified at the time did not include over-collection.

Both species have been offered for sale at high prices, particularly within the USA and Europe, but trade instances appear to be relatively low. Both species are protected under Sri Lankan law, and harvest and export have been prohibited since 1993. It seems unlikely that all individuals observed for sale are the offspring of animals exported pre-1993 (particularly C. dumbara, which was only described in 2006), therefore it seems probable that wild animals are illegally entering trade. It is considered that adults of the two species can be distinguished by finer taxonomic details, such as the number of spines and the appearance of scales in certain regions of the body, and although juveniles are very difficult to tell apart it appears that most current trade is in adults. Analysis: On the basis of a restricted area of distribution (10 km2) that is declining and fragmented, C. dumbara meets the biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I. For C. ceylanica, the area of distribution is larger (<500 km2 but perhaps as low as 60 km2), which is likely to be declining and fragmented. The species was said to be rare in 2005, apparently having undergone a marked decline in the 1990s, and is highly vulnerable to extrinsic factors such as drought. Therefore, it is possible that C. ceylanica also meets the biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I. In recent years, both species have been offered for sale (although numbers appear relatively low) within the hobbyist trade and illegal collection from the wild is suspected. Other Considerations: Res. Conf. 12.10 (Rev. CoP15) outlines that inclusion in Appendix I would mean commercial captive breeding operations would need to meet the provisions of Res. Conf. 10.16 (Rev.) to be registered with the CITES Secretariat, and that registered operations should ensure an appropriate and secure marking system to identify all breeding stock and specimens in trade. This enhanced oversight could help allay any concerns over fraudulent claims of captive breeding and wild offtake for breeding stock. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 26 39 Inclusion of the Hump-nosed Lizard Lyriocephalus scutatus in Appendix I Proponent: Sri Lanka Summary: The Hump-nosed Lizard Lyriocephalus scutatus is a medium-sized lizard with a striking appearance. It is the largest of Sri Lanka\u2019s endemic agamid lizards and is the only member of the genus. It occurs in the south-west of the country in an area of somewhat less than 17,000 km2. It is found in a variety of habitats, including forests, plantations and gardens from 25 m to 1600 m above sea level. Individuals reach sexual maturity within a year and a female may produce up to 30 eggs a year. Population size and trends are unknown. Loss and fragmentation of natural habitat has been severe within its range, one population was nearly extirpated due to intensive logging, although there is evidence that the species can adapt to modified habitats. The species was assessed on the IUCN Red List in 2009 as Near Threatened and considered \u201cnot rare\u201d within its range. Collection for the pet trade was said to be reducing population numbers. The distinctive appearance of the species makes it sought after by reptile collectors. According to one estimate, around 500 specimens were collected from the wild for export in the past 30 years. Export from Sri Lanka has been prohibited since 1993, although the species has been offered for sale at high prices outside of the range State. Given reported challenges in captive breeding it is thought unlikely these animals are the progeny of individuals imported pre-1993. Analysis: The species is in demand for the hobbyist trade within the EU, USA and Asia, with illegal collection from the wild suspected, although the overall volume of trade is not known. The population size of Lyriocephalus scutatus is unknown but unlikely to be small. It was not considered to be rare within its range ten years ago, and despite severe and ongoing deforestation within its range, it does not have a restricted distribution. While at least one population has reportedly been almost extirpated due to logging, and collection for the pet trade is said to be causing a decline, it is unclear if the species overall has undergone a marked decline.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f171c3e1-de3b-44c2-a868-adaeb77568b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "f171c3e1-de3b-44c2-a868-adaeb77568b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summaries-iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Summaries of the IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summaries-iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "309cbe81d2ac6737b20ff2bdec3d5e3b57d19c67db606e88f212f913da0d10db"}, "2": {"node_id": "4c0e6160-dec6-480c-8353-17e093dd90a9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summaries-iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7197959bb21dfb904b5c77e6617b560b1183d0c07e2aa6c7f2d85f16c98700ff"}}, "hash": "3280441db17cc9efc2ead0c61bfe355375be22218008f723672d94027d4309c1", "text": "Therefore, there is insufficient information to determine if the species meets the criteria for inclusion in Appendix I.

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 27 40 Inclusion of Leopard Geckos Goniurosaurus spp. (populations of China and Viet Nam) in Appendix II Proponent: China, European Union and Viet Nam Summary: Goniurosaurus is a genus of lizards comprising 19 species; 13 of which are native to China and/or Viet Nam (and are subject to this proposal) and six of which are endemic to Japan (not subject to this proposal). Eleven of the 13 species occurring in China and Viet Nam were described from 1999 onwards. Very little is known about the ecology of most of the species, although they appear to show a high degree of adaptation to specific microhabitats and most are considered to have limited ranges, with many only known from a single mountain range or island. In general, the species are nocturnal, associated with rock/karst-type topography, and are found near to streams and within primary rainforest. Reproductive capacity is likely to be low, males are thought to reach maturity at around one year of age and females lay clutches of two to three eggs annually. Population estimates are lacking for almost all species. Published IUCN Red List assessments are available for three of the species: one Critically Endangered (G. huuliensis), one Endangered (G. catbaensis) and one Vulnerable (G. lichtenfelderi). A further five species have assessments accepted for publication in March 2019: one Critically Endangered (G. yingdeensis), three Endangered (G. bawanglingensis, G. liboensis and G. zhelongi), and one Data Deficient (G. zhoui). Due to their attractive appearance and colour patterns, many species (ten out of 13) are known to be traded internationally as pets, with Europe, Japan and the USA identified as key markets. Comprehensive trade data are lacking, but imports reported by the USA from 1999-2018 totalled nearly 17,000 individuals with 70% of imports reported as wild sourced. Only three species were not reported in global trade and they are three of the most recently described species G. kwangsiensis, G. liboensis and G. zhoui. However, it is believed that recently discovered species may be particularly vulnerable to exploitation. Local extirpations have been recorded for three species to feed demand from the pet trade, and newly described species are often advertised at higher prices. The most highly traded species based on available data are G. lichtenfelderi, G. hainanensis and G. luii; trade in G. catbaensis may also be significant (see below). There also appears to be harvest for the domestic pet trade and medicinal purposes. Goniurosaurus catbaensis is endemic to Cat Ba Island, Viet Nam. Described in 2008, the species was assessed as globally Endangered in 2016 and has an estimated area of occupancy of 120 km2 (which is declining) and a severely fragmented population which may be less than 250 mature individuals. Habitat destruction is a major threat, and a flood in 2015 appears to have caused local extirpations. G. catbaensis was the species most commonly advertised of seven Vietnamese endemic reptiles observed for sale online in Europe and Japan, and is frequently observed in pet shops in southern Viet Nam where they are reported to have been collected from the wild. Goniurosaurus luii is native to northern Viet Nam and western Guangxi, China. No estimates of the total population size are available. The species was subject to over-exploitation for commercial sale before it was described in 1999, which has led to extirpation from its type locality. Some trade has been reported to the USA (from 1999-2018 ca. 600 were imported) and it has been observed in pet shops in southern Viet Nam (believed to be collected from the wild) and in Japan.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "617da597-0877-4ccd-862a-cde0f64170b0": {"__data__": {"id_": "617da597-0877-4ccd-862a-cde0f64170b0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summaries-iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Summaries of the IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summaries-iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4ec9aa2c199696b7159853acd456ecc28bd256425994946ebda308afefea7c99"}, "2": {"node_id": "9066658a-fcb5-4d7d-a03e-2b0a326674c2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summaries-iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fec9cf3b93293009192a936b35f9e37d7701a1a2b8a9525fc347d9517e2e22eb"}}, "hash": "1c17ad1e993d580a41f69feb0f97be7ed44e6ee7fa629b83f10a8b71596fce24", "text": "Occasionally G. luii is harvested from the wild in China for use in traditional medicine.

Some of the species have part of their range within protected areas. In terms of species identification, there are features that distinguish the six Goniurosaurus species from Japan from the Chinese and Vietnamese species, but this is reportedly difficult for non-experts. Similarly, the Vietnamese and Chinese species can be difficult to distinguish from each other without genetic analyses, particularly if the geographic origin is not accurately known.

Most species in the genus show a high degree of habitat specificity and have a very limited range, and the majority have been observed in international trade. Goniurosaurus catbaensis meets the criteria for inclusion in Appendix II in Annex 2aA of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17), and may already meet the criteria for inclusion in Appendix I, given its small (or very small) populations, restricted range with fragmented and decreasing habitat. Goniurosaurus lichtenfelderi and G. luii also meet the criteria on the basis of large trade volumes, local extirpations and/or small populations. Species of Goniurosaurus can be difficult to distinguish from each other without genetic analyses and therefore enforcement officers who encounter specimens of CITES-listed species are unlikely to be able to distinguish between them, therefore the populations other Goniurosaurus spp. of Viet Nam and China meet the criteria in Annex 2b on the basis of reported identification difficulties. Other Considerations: There may be implementation issues with the six Japanese Goniurosaurus species that are not included in the proposal as although there are features that distinguish them from the Chinese and Vietnamese species (the precloacal pores are absent, and claws are not sheathed by scales for the Japanese species) it is reportedly difficult for non-experts, particularly if the geographic origin is not accurately known. Where species are subject to national protection in China, China could consider publishing a zero- export quota for wild specimens on the CITES website to reflect national legislation. If the proposal is adopted, Japan may wish to list its six native Goniurosaurus species in Appendix III to monitor any potentially increased trade in this species as a result of the other species of the genus being listed. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 28 42 Inclusion of Tokay Gecko Gekko gecko in Appendix II Proponents: European Union, India, Philippines and United States of America Summary: The Tokay Gecko Gekko gecko is the second largest extant gecko species, with a striking bluish-grey body with red or orange spots. It has a widespread distribution throughout South- east Asia, China, Bangladesh and India. It has also been introduced to several countries including Brazil, Madagascar, the USA and areas of the West Indies. This species inhabits a broad range of habitats from forest to human-modified environments. Over a six-month breeding period Tokay Geckos produce clutches of one to two eggs laid at 30-day intervals, which are deposited in tree holes and guarded by both parents. The species has been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine for hundreds of years and is sold throughout South-east Asia in dried form or preserved in alcohol; to a lesser extent, it is also traded live for pets. Consumption of G. gecko for medicinal purposes does occur domestically in South-east Asian countries, but international trade is assumed to be on a much larger scale and consumption is centred around China and Viet Nam. Thailand and Indonesia (particularly Java) are the main exporters; G. gecko is not protected in these countries but subject to regulation by quota/permit: - Thailand \u2013 Exports of G. gecko from Thailand alone have been reported to be between two to five million geckos per year going to China, Taiwan Province of China (which reported imports of 11 million from Thailand between 2004 and 2013), Malaysia and the USA.

A novel trend in G. gecko demand emerged in 2009 after consumption of its parts was promoted as a cure for HIV/AIDS. Trade reportedly increased throughout South-east Asia, but it is thought that trade peaked in 2010/2011 and has since declined after improved enforcement and a realisation that the claims were unfounded. The international pet trade in live, wild-caught G. gecko is thought to be diminishing (from available data) with imports of wild-caught live G. gecko into the USA decreasing by more than 50% from 2007\u20132016. There are no empirical population estimates for G. gecko, and while the species is thought to be common in most of its range there is contradictory information on national declines. Populations in the main consuming countries have declined although it is not clear on what scale: in China the species was listed nationally as critically endangered (2016), although the Chinese Management Authority (MA) considered the national population to be \u201clarge and stable\u201d. In Viet Nam the MA reported localised declines due to small-scale harvesting, and the national Red Data Book (2015) estimated it was declining (by no more than 30%), but this was not based on empirical evidence. A recent IUCN Red List assessment classifies the species as Least Concern (accepted for publication in the March 2019 Red List update). There are anecdotal reports of national population declines in Bangladesh and Thailand, but the more recent global assessment suggests that the population trend overall is unknown. In Bangladesh, a regularly cited, recent, 50% decline in Gekko gecko populations has been contradicted by the Red List of Bangladesh, which states that although there is tremendous poaching pressure, the species is common, and the population trend is presumed to be stable. Thailand stated that G. gecko was considered abundant countrywide (least concern in 2005), although declines were noted in the north-east, and poaching was causing the population to \u201cdwindle\u201d. The Philippines reported declines. Population trends are not clear from other range States. Gekko gecko has some form of legal protection in Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Lao PDR, Peninsular Malaysia, the Philippines and Viet Nam; but it is not protected (outside of protected areas) in Indonesia, Myanmar or Thailand. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 28 43 Analysis: Gekko gecko has an extensive range across a large part of Asia and is known to be present in a broad range of habitats including human-modified environments. Population information is scarce and although some range States have anecdotal reports of population declines, others have reported stable populations and it is considered to be common in much of its range. The latest IUCN Red List assessment to be published in 2019 categorises the species as Least Concern. While population information is contradictory, there are concerns regarding the population in the main consuming countries of China (critically endangered, 2016) and Viet Nam (near threatened, 2015, localised declines noted). There are also concerns over certain populations in the main importing areas: Thailand (least concern, 2005, with declines in the north-east which borders Viet Nam) and Java, Indonesia (anecdotally reported to be extremely difficult to find, whereas in parts of Bali and Sulawesi it is still common). The species has been harvested for medicinal purposes for hundreds of years and there is a large body of evidence to show that the species is currently traded in the millions or tens of millions annually (most are presumed to be wild-caught), for use in traditional medicines. While G. gecko is still considered to be common throughout most of its range, in the main consuming countries the populations appear to be declining, as do other range States now exporting to these countries. Although there is a large degree of uncertainty regarding the impact of international trade, it may be precautionary to list the species in Appendix II in order to ensure that trade of specimens from the wild does not threaten the species.

A survey in 2017 found that densities have dropped by almost 80% since 2010 in some parts of the species range. It has a known extent of occurrence of 1 km2 and an area of occupancy of 0.5 km2. No export permits for commercial purposes have ever been issued. Illegal trade in this species was first reported soon after the species was described in 2005 and exploitation is thought to have accelerated in recent years for the international pet trade. Collection of individuals damages the environment and exposes the remaining geckos to increased risk of predation and desiccation. Little quantitative data are available on numbers traded, but on the basis of online adverts in 2016 and 2017 that identified more than a dozen dealers operating from USA, UK, the Netherlands and Germany and significant microhabitat destruction caused by local harvesters, the proponents conclude that a significant number of geckos are being taken illegally from the wild population. Some captive-breeding appears to be taking place in non-range States. In addition to threats from alien species and habitat destruction, a road constructed in 2005 has improved access to Chatham Bay. The proposed further development in this area would significantly impact the species\u2019 remaining habitat. The species is protected from harvest by existing legislation and is the subject of a Conservation Action Plan that seeks to protect the habitat of G. daudini, enhance population survival and incorporate local stakeholders. Analysis: Population estimates for Gonatodes daudini indicate a relatively small population of just under 10,000 individuals, including both mature adults and juveniles. The density of the gecko population has fallen by nearly 80% in some parts of its limited range since 2010. The recorded extent of occupancy (1 km2) and the area of occupancy (0.5 km2) are very restricted, and it is only found in one location that is highly vulnerable to both intrinsic and extrinsic factors and has undergone declines. Therefore, the species meets the Appendix I biological criteria. Although the numbers in trade are unclear, illegal harvesting of specimens for international trade is impacting the microhabitat and by inference, also affecting the species. The species therefore meets the criteria for listing in Appendix I in Annex 1 of Res. Conf 9.24 (Rev. CoP17). IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 30 45 Inclusion of Grandidier's Madagascar Ground Gecko Paroedura androyensis in Appendix II Proponents: Madagascar and the European Union Summary: Grandidier\u2019s Madagascar Ground Gecko Paroedura androyensis is one of 21 species of Malagasy ground geckos in the genus Paroedura. It is endemic to southern Madagascar and can be found at elevations of up 120 m within dry-deciduous, spiny and gallery forests, but is not found in disturbed forests. The IUCN Red List assessment of 2011 classified P. androyensis as Vulnerable with a declining population, but suggested that more research on the ecology and status of the species was needed. In 2011 the extent of occurrence was ca. 18,000 km2, but it was noted that there is a continuing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat. There are very little quantitative data on population size or trend, but some studies have reported the species to be rare or infrequent based on the observations of just a few individuals during transect and pit-fall trap surveys. Breeding behavior is unknown for this species, but another species within the genus (P. picta) has been observed to lay two eggs per clutch with short interclutch intervals. Deforestation caused by timber extraction for charcoal production and slash and burn agriculture are occurring throughout the species\u2019 range which is increasingly fragmenting its habitat. The species is sought after in the international pet trade. Madagascar reported exports of more than 6,000 individuals between 2013 and 2017 (ca. 1,200 per year) destined for North America, Europe and Asia. Paroedura androyensis is protected as a category III species under Madagascar Law 2006-400, which allows for hunting and capture with a license during the hunting season and subsequent export. Analysis: Paroedura androyensis does not have a restricted distribution but its habitat is fragmented and decreasing due to deforestation.

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 31 46 Inclusion of Spiny-tailed Iguanas Ctenosaura spp. in Appendix II Proponents: El Salvador and Mexico Summary: The genus Ctenosaura, known as Spiny-tailed Iguanas, are medium-sized omnivorous lizards that occur in lowland dry forests of Mexico and Central America. There are currently 18 recognised species, of which 11 are endemic to Mexico. Four species (C. bakeri, C. melanosterna, C. oedirhina and C. palearis) have been included in Appendix II since 2010; one additional species (C. quinquecarinata) has been included in Annex D of the EU Wildlife Trade Regulations since 2010. Of the 14 species not listed in the Appendices, one is assessed as Critically Endangered (C. oaxacana), two Endangered (C. flavidorsalis and C. quinquecarinata), three Vulnerable (C. clarki, C. defensor and C. nolascensis), one Near Threatened (C. alfredschmidti), one Least Concern (C. similis), one Data Deficient (C. praeocularis), and five have not been assessed (C. conspicuosa, C. macrolopha, C. hemilopha, C. pectinata and C. acanthura). Two species are island endemics with both islands being less than 40 km2 (C. conspicuosa and C. nolascensis), two have a range of less than 500 km2 (C. alfredschmidti and C. oaxacana), six have ranges less than 5,000 km2 (C. clarki, C. flavidorsalis, C. hemilopha, C. macrolopha, C. praeocularis and C. quinquecarinata), and four have ranges greater than 5,000 km2 (C. acanthura, C. defensor, C. pectinata and C. similis). Habitats are generally fragmented for all species and the actual area of occupancy is considerably smaller than the overall range. However, several species also occur in human-dominated landscapes, and C. similis and C. pectinata are recorded as invasive species in some areas where they have been introduced. There is very little population information for any of the proposed species, although IUCN Red List assessments for six species estimate populations to be likely less than 2,500 individuals (C. alfredschmidti, C. clarki, C. defensor, C. oaxacana, C. nolascensis and C. quinquecarinata). Ctenosaura species are in trade for the exotic pet market, with 15 species recorded in international trade. Information on the global trade for most species is limited to imports into the USA. The USA reported imports totalling 30,000 live individuals from 1999-2012, of which 95% comprised C. quinquecarinata (10,000) and C. similis (17,000) (see below). These data indicate a shift from wild to captive-bred trade. Since 2007, the USA reported the import of ca. 700 wild-caught and ca. 7,000 captive-bred individuals. Almost all the captive-bred individuals were imported from Nicaragua and El Salvador (98%), while nearly all wild-sourced individuals were imported from Honduras and Guatemala (97%).

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 31 47 In addition to collection for international trade, Ctenosaura species are impacted by habitat loss, predation by domestic cats and dogs, and local consumption by people. Ctenosaura are protected by national legislation to varying degrees in six of their range States (Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Mexico). Captive breeding is taking place in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and Nicaragua, including for conservation purposes. Differences between species in the genus were highlighted at CoP15 in relation to a proposal to list four Ctenosaura species, although more recent reports suggest that there are look-alike issues for all species in the genus, especially at the juvenile stage. High numbers have been exported as juveniles. An identification guide for the genus has been produced, but is intended to be a starting point rather than a conclusive document for identification. Analysis: There is very little information on the wild populations of almost all Ctenosaura species, but some have been estimated to have small populations and/or limited ranges. Based on this, some species may already meet the biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I (including but not limited to C. conspicuosa and C. nolascensis), although reported international trade in wild-caught animals of these species is very limited. The recorded international trade primarily comprises two species (C. quinquecarinata and C. similis) and trade in individuals reported as wild-caught appears to be decreasing. The only species not currently listed in Appendix II that appears to meet the criteria for inclusion under Annex 2a of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) is C. quinquecarinata. This species has a small population (2,500 mature individuals) and a relatively restricted and fragmented range. Although the majority of trade in this species appears to be in captive-bred individuals, given the possible small size of the population even low levels of trade may be of concern. It is reportedly difficult for non-experts to distinguish between species of Ctenosaura and virtually impossible for juveniles, of which there are large numbers in trade. As some species in the genus are already included in the Appendices, the non-listed species therefore meet the criteria for inclusion in Annex 2b of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17). IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 32 48 Inclusion of Spider-tailed Horned Viper Pseudocerastes urarachnoides in Appendix II Proponent: Islamic Republic of Iran Summary: The Spider-tailed Horned Viper Pseudocerastes urarachnoides is a recently described (2006) viper species, known only from a few locations in the Zagros Mountains of western Islamic Republic of Iran (Iran). The species may also be present in suitable habitat in adjacent areas of Iraq. Its unique tail resembles a spider and is used to lure insectivorous birds. Little information is available on its biology, but it is mainly found in hilly areas and is associated with deep cracks in limestone sediments. There are no population size estimates and population trends are lacking, although it is considered to be rare based on field observations. In Iran the hunting, killing or catching of all wild animals (including reptiles) is prohibited. Any export of live wild animals without a licence or approval from the Department of Environment is also prohibited. Despite this there is some evidence of international trade in Pseudocerastes urarachnoides, although it is limited to photographic evidence of the species in captivity on social media, a survey of German pet keepers for the German Government in 2018, and a single conversation on social media in 2017. Only described in 2006, the uniqueness of the species may create increasing demand in the future in the pet trade. Similar species do not appear to be traded in large volumes. The species is said to be impacted by illegal collection for the pet trade, habitat destruction and future climate change. It is reported that the species is sometimes killed when encountered by local communities.

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 33 49 Transfer of Bourret\u2019s Box Turtle Cuora bourreti from Appendix II to Appendix I Proponent: Viet Nam Summary: Bourret\u2019s Box Turtle Cuora bourreti is a medium-sized terrestrial forest turtle that can reach 18 cm shell length. Cuora bourreti has historically been consumed for food, however in the last decade large-scale consumption has largely ceased with most animals collected now sold into the pet trade or for traditional medicine. Based on observations in captivity, the species matures at 10\u201315 years and lays a single clutch of one to three eggs annually. Cuora bourreti has been listed in CITES Appendix II since 2000 under a genus-level listing. Cuora bourreti was previously considered a subspecies of C. galbinifrons, however it was recognised as a species in the standard nomenclature reference adopted at CoP17 in 2016. Before this split was recognised under CITES, C. galbinifrons was included in the Periodic Review after CoP16 and the Animals Committee recommended the transfer of C. galbinifrons (at that time including C. bouretti and C. picturata) to Appendix I. Cuora bourreti is known from central Viet Nam and the adjoining province of Savannakhet in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (PDR), although confusion with C. galbinifrons means its range could be smaller than currently believed. It inhabits upland, moist, closed-canopy evergreen forest, and habitat loss and degradation are considered a significant but predominantly localised threat to the species. Unsustainable collection is considered to be the main threat given that C. bourreti is a long- lived, late-maturing species with limited annual reproductive output and high juvenile mortality. The species was assessed as Critically Endangered in 2015 on the basis that documented market volumes in China and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) indicated a collapse of populations of over 90% over the past 60 years (three generations) and decline was predicted to continue for the next 20 years. This was inferred from market observations reported as predominantly C. galbinifrons, which at the time was also considered to include what are now accepted as C. bourreti and C. picturata. The population of C. bourreti is estimated to be between 10,000\u201320,000 individuals in the wild and the species is considered rare. In 2013 a zero export quota for wild specimens for commercial purposes was adopted for the listing of C. galbinifrons (including C. bourreti) and there has been no legal trade in C. bourreti reported in the CITES Trade Database since then. Live specimens are observed for sale online, often stating that they are from captive-bred populations. However, it continues to be regarded as a difficult, sensitive species to breed successfully in captivity, reproducing slowly with small clutch sizes. Low numbers have been observed in farms in China, and juvenile animals are said to be raised in villages in range States for sale into trade, although they suffer high mortality rates. The species is legally protected from exploitation in both range States. Illegal trade is considered to continue to the main destination markets of China and Hong Kong SAR. A small number of captive- bred specimens were observed in Hong Kong SAR markets between 2014 and 2018. Analysis: No legal trade in Cuora bourreti has been reported since a zero export quota was put in place in 2013. Illegal trade is thought to occur, but it is not clear on what scale. The population size was estimated to be between 10,000 and 20,000 individuals, which could be considered small for a low productivity species such as this. It does not appear to have a restricted range, although issues with misidentification with C. galbinifrons could mean that the distribution is smaller than previously thought.

Before this split was recognised under CITES, C. galbinifrons was included in the Periodic Review after CoP16 and the Animals Committee recommended the transfer of C. galbinifrons (at that time including C. picturata and C. bourreti) to Appendix I. The species is endemic to Viet Nam and thought to be limited to the eastern slopes of the Langbian Plateau. Only one of the three localities where it is confirmed to occur is currently protected. Large areas of the plateau are being rapidly converted to coffee plantations and other agricultural lands and the remaining area of suitable habitat is estimated to be around 3,000 km\u00b2 in extent. Unsustainable collection is considered to be the main threat given that Cuora picturata is a long- lived, late maturing species with limited annual reproductive output and high juvenile mortality. The species was assessed as Critically Endangered in 2015 on the basis that documented market volumes in China and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) indicated a collapse of populations of over 90% in the past 60 years (three generations), and that collection pressure for the last remaining individuals was likely to continue if not increase in the next 20 years. This was inferred from market observations reported as predominantly C. galbinifrons, which at the time was also considered to include what are now accepted as C. picturata and C. bourreti. The global wild population of C. picturata is estimated at below 25,000 individuals, and likely no more than 3,000\u2013 10,000. Many hunters state that while C. bourreti was common 7\u201315 years ago, it is now increasingly difficult to find. In 2013 a zero export quota for wild specimens for commercial purposes was adopted for the listing of C. galbinifrons (including C. picturata) and there has been no legal trade in C. picturata reported in the CITES Trade Database since then.

Cuora picturata is protected from commercial exploitation in Viet Nam. Illegal trade is considered to continue to the main destination markets in China and Hong Kong SAR. However, no observations of the species were reported in Hong Kong SAR markets between 2014 and 2018. Analysis: No legal trade has been reported since a zero export quota was put in place in 2013. Illegal international trade is thought to occur, but it is not clear on what scale. The population size is estimated at fewer than 25,000 (more likely between 3,000 and 10,000) which could be considered small for a low productivity species such as this. Due to habitat loss only a small part of its range is now believed to be suitable (3,000 km2). The species was categorised as Critically Endangered in 2015 based on a decline of 90% in the past three generations, and this decline was predicted to continue. It would therefore appear to meet the criteria for inclusion in Appendix I.

Within this area, the species is now limited to scattered occurrence within isolated wetlands. Conversion of wetlands to agriculture, such as rice paddies and irrigation canals has led to extensive collection of a M. annamensis through incidental encounters. The current or historic population size of M. annamensis is unknown. In the late 1930s the species was considered to be abundant, and this remained the case in the 1980s and early 1990s according to anecdotal accounts. Mauremys annamensis was assessed as Critically Endangered in 2000 based on a known or inferred population reduction of at least 80% over the past three generations due to actual or potential levels of trade, and a similar projected future decline over the same time period. The main threats were/are over-collection and habitat loss. In recent years, field surveys have found very small numbers of animals in the wild, despite targeted surveys, and the species is rarely observed in market surveys or seizures, indicating it is now extremely rare. Some experts consider that this species is now functionally extinct in the wild. Mauremys annamensis is legally protected from exploitation in Viet Nam, although enforcement is considered to be weak. The species was included in CITES Appendix II in 2003, and since 2013 there has been a zero-export quota for wild specimens for commercial purposes. Captive breeding is known to occur in Viet Nam and non-range States (including China, the USA and Europe) and it is now thought most specimens in trade are captive-bred, although wild individuals may be being used as parental stock. Animals take about seven years to mature, and recruitment is slow. Prior to 2013, live exports were approximately five individuals per year, whereas from 2013 this increased to ca. 300 per year totaling ca. 2,000 (predominantly reported as captive-bred/born exported from the USA for commercial purposes to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) (1,100). Extreme price fluctuations have been observed in trade in China and Viet Nam, and the current price of around USD 30 per juvenile has been inferred to suggest that the demand for this species is decreasing or that there was now an abundance of captive-bred hatchlings available which reduced the market value. Analysis: The ongoing international trade in Mauremys annamensis consists mainly of individuals reported as captive-bred and captive-born. Its range is limited to scattered isolated occurrences in five provinces (possibly seven) in central Viet Nam. In 2000 the species was assessed as Critically Endangered. Reports from local people and market observations indicate that the species was considerably more abundant in the 1980s and 1990s, suggesting a marked population decline. It is very rare and could be functionally extinct in the wild. All indications suggest that this species\u2019 life history traits make it intrinsically vulnerable to over-exploitation. Following a Periodic Review after CoP16 the Animals Committee recommended the inclusion of M. annamensis in Appendix I. It would appear M. annamensis meets the criteria for inclusion in Appendix I. Other Considerations: At CoP16 a zero-export quota in wild-sourced specimens for commercial purposes was adopted with the listing for this species and therefore all trade in wild specimens is already illegal. Any additional benefits of an Appendix I listing are not clear.

However, as G. elegans was assessed as Vulnerable and not Endangered, declines of greater than 50% were not indicated. Estimated densities of 4.0\u20132.5 animals/ha were recorded in 1991. Geochelone elegans has been listed in CITES Appendix II since 1975; and is fully protected by law from commercial exploitation, trade or possession in each of its three range States. However, it is the single most confiscated species of tortoise or freshwater turtle worldwide. Seizures of large numbers of G. elegans are well documented. At least 34,000 live individuals were seized between 2000 and 2015, with a further ca. 14,400 individuals seized between 2016 and 2018. Observations of 55,000 individuals being removed from the wild from one location over one year (2015), in India, suggest illegal harvest and trade levels could be considerably higher than the observed seizures. The CITES Trade Database shows high numbers of Geochelone elegans in trade; almost 63,000 live specimens were reported between 2000 and 2015, over half of which were reported as captive-born or bred individuals (ca. 37,000). Over a third had no source code reported (ca. 24,000) and were exported from Jordan, a non-range State, and the largest global exporter of G. elegans. Jordan also reported exporting almost 31,000 captive-bred individuals, as well as re-exporting just over 1,900 wild-sourced with no origin specified. Afghanistan was also a significant exporter of wild-caught individuals (5,000). Uncertainty over the size of captive breeding populations and numbers exported from non-range States suggest a large portion of the legally permitted trade is likely to include illegally harvested and misreported wild specimens from range States. Trade from Jordan of G. elegans has been subject to the \u201cReview of trade in animal specimens reported as produced in captivity\u201d, with recommendations for Jordan including a zero-export quota. Analysis: Geochelone elegans does not have a restricted range, nor does it appear to have a small population. The G. elegans population has been reported to be declining, there is strong evidence of large-scale illegal international trade, which along with other factors is believed to be driving this decline. Scant quantitative population trend data are available, but it has been estimated that if threats continue, declines of greater than 30% (but less than 50%) are likely to occur during the three generation period from 1995\u20132025. This is less than the guideline figure given in Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) for a marked recent rate of decline. However, illegal trade appears to present a constant pressure on the population and given concerns raised through the \u201cReview of trade in animal specimens reported as produced in captivity\u201d, it may be precautionary to list the species in Appendix I. Res. Conf. 12.10 (Rev. CoP15) outlines that inclusion in Appendix I would mean commercial captive breeding operations would need to meet the provisions of Res. Conf. 10.16 (Rev.) to be registered with the CITES Secretariat, and that registered operations shall ensure an appropriate and secure marking system to identify all breeding stock and specimens in trade. This enhanced oversight could IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 37 53 help allay concerns over fraudulent claims of captive breeding and continued wild offtake for breeding stock.

The species inhabits rocky outcrops in Kenya, United Republic of Tanzania (Tanzania) and northern Zambia, and due to its very specific microhabitat requirements it is discontinuously distributed across its range. While its calculated area of occupancy has been estimated at 72,000 km2, due to the species\u2019 specific requirements the actual area of suitable habitat is thought to be less than 5% of this (and even less to have suitable crevices in terms of dimensions and orientation).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "95ceddf9-d0bd-44b6-808c-932322e4901d": {"__data__": {"id_": "95ceddf9-d0bd-44b6-808c-932322e4901d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summaries-iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Summaries of the IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summaries-iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5eef5fec65beda460800b847375b1a005be4245c51a5f408042f1edee1159f22"}, "2": {"node_id": "adb50015-d2eb-4f2a-9429-4d99f3d3f8d1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summaries-iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d7c83d8f19cdf21e9472d53e03327d31aa5b9b205099ed5ec8cb1f2c790a8c70"}}, "hash": "741afc5ed0c61ef24848111b426b79634e16b7b65325695c15b9e5662934ab8d", "text": "The species has low productivity in the wild: maturing at over five years and laying one (sometimes two) eggs per year.

A recent assessment accepted for publication in the March 2019 Red List update categorises the species as Critically Endangered due to observed, estimated and projected population reductions of about 80% over three generations (45 years in total) that will be reached in the next 15 years. The population is believed to be declining: the international pet trade has been identified as the main factor but habitat degradation and loss, particularly from rock destruction and farming, are also significant threats to the species. Low population densities have been observed in otherwise seemingly suitable habitat: surveys in Kenya found the location Voo to have the highest density in 2001/2002 (9/km2) but no tortoises were observed in 2014 during a repeat survey, and this was attributed to the establishment of a commercial farming operation nearby using wild specimens for breeding stock. Other areas in Kenya surveyed in 2001/2002 that had good Pancake Tortoise populations at that time were also noted to be depleted in 2014. In Tanzania, in the early 1990s the average number of tortoises encountered per hour was approximately 90% lower in areas where they have been exploited. The Pancake Tortoise was listed in Appendix II in 1975. Kenya does not permit wild exports, and following inclusion in the Review of Significant Trade in the late 1980s, the Standing Committee recommended a trade suspension for Tanzania for wild specimens which remained in place between 1993 and 2018: this has now been lifted on the condition that Tanzania implements a zero export quota for wild specimens. It is not clear what the legal provisions there are for the species in Zambia. All three countries have licensed captive breeding facilities. Concerns have been raised about the ability of these farms to produce the fluctuating numbers reported in trade, particularly for Zambia, which started exporting captive-bred tortoises in 2006 (the year the wild population was confirmed in Zambia, although some wild/ranched specimens had been exported before that time). Fluctuations could indicate ongoing capture from the wild (within Zambia or neighbouring Tanzania) for export and/or parental stock. Zambia\u2019s exports totalled around 23,000 between 2006 and 2016. Significant exports reported as wild have taken place from non-range States, and illegal trade is highlighted as an issue. Analysis: The population size in 2001/2002 was estimated at between 4,000\u201332,000, but on the basis of results from more recent surveys, the slow breeding potential of the species and inferred ongoing wild collection, it seems possible that the current population now meets the definition of being a small wild population that is declining. An IUCN Red List assessment due for publication in March 2019 has categorised the species as Critically Endangered as it is estimated that the population will have declined by 80% over three generations (two past, one future\u2014through to 2033). If the rate of decline is equal across all three generations this will have meant the species has suffered a marked recent decline of over 50% in the last two generations with the decline predicted to continue. The IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 37 55 species is affected by trade, although most exported specimens are reported to be captive-bred, results from surveys indicate wild harvest has continued, which may be being used as parental stock in farms or being exported. Therefore, it seems that the Pancake Tortoise meets the criteria for inclusion in Appendix I. Other Considerations: Wild exports are not permitted from Kenya, and Tanzania has stated that it does not intend to permit export of wild specimens. Res. Conf. 12.10 (Rev. CoP15) outlines that inclusion in Appendix I would mean commercial captive breeding operations would need to meet the provisions of Res.

Information on the population sizes and trends of many species is scarce, although 30 are considered to be declining and 17 stable. Among the 104 species listed by the proponents, four are assessed on the IUCN Red List as Critically Endangered, 11 Endangered, 13 Vulnerable, four Near Threatened, 27 Least Concern and 23 Data Deficient. The main threats appear to be habitat loss and fragmentation, along with pollution, disease and climate change. It was estimated that the habitat for only seven of the species that have been assessed was stable or undisturbed. Global trade data are not available for any glass frog species. Based on available data on imports into the USA from 2004-2017, international trade appears to mainly be in: - live animals for commercial purposes (1,147 (260 wild)) - bodies for scientific or educational purposes (389 (all wild)) - specimens for scientific or educational purposes (1,408 (all wild); not possible to equate to number of frogs so not detailed further). Live glass frogs have also been observed for sale online in Europe, and some illegal trade has been reported. The following species have been identified as being traded: - Hyalinobatrachium fleischmanni was assessed as Least Concern in 2010. The primary threats were identified as deforestation and agricultural pollution. Reported imports to the USA from 2004- 2017 included 842 live (203 wild) and six bodies (all wild). - Espadarana prosoblepon (reported as Centrolene prosoblepon) and Teratohyla spinosa (reported as Cochranella spinosa) were both reported in trade, however, following the taxonomy of Guayasamin et al. (2009) (reflected in the current version of the CITES Standard Reference for amphibians (Frost, 2015)), both species would fall outside the scope of this proposal. They were both assessed as Least Concern in 2008. The major threats were identified as deforestation and agricultural pollution. Small quantities of both species were reportedly imported to the USA from 2004-2017: 57 live and 304 bodies (all wild) of E. prosoblepon, and six live and six bodies (all wild) of T. spinosa. A number of species were assessed on the IUCN Red List as Least Concern between 2008 and 2010 (the main threats identified at the time were habitat loss and degradation), and only relatively small amounts of trade in live individuals and bodies into the USA between 2004 and 2017 were reported. This includes: - Cochranella granulosa (12 live and 11 bodies, all wild); - Hyalinobatrachium valerioi (50 live, all captive-bred); - Sachatamia ilex (reported as Centrolene ilex) (20 bodies, all wild). No trade into the USA was reported for most other species, although for a total of 201 live individuals (198 captive-bred and 3 wild-sourced) the specific species was not reported. In most range States, harvest of these genera from the wild is prohibited or requires a permit. The distinction of the species within these four genera is said to be difficult for non-experts, however some identification guides have been developed in recent years. Glass frogs have conserved morphology, and preserved specimens can lose color and distinctive features which poses challenges for identification. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 39 57 Analysis: There is little information on the historical and current size of wild populations for most species of glass frogs. Some species within these four genera appear to have limited ranges while others are considered common. The main threats have been identified to be habitat loss and fragmentation, along with pollution and disease. Some species are known to be in international trade, with demand mainly for live individuals, bodies and scientific specimens. Although few trade data are available, reported levels of international trade are relatively low and there is no evidence that trade presents a threat to any of the species concerned.

Echinotriton chinhaiensis Adult E. chinhaiensis are terrestrial and inhabit forests in low hills. The adult population was estimated to be around 300 mature individuals in 2004, and one of the three known subpopulations (the type locality) may have been extirpated. The habitat of E. chinhaiensis was estimated to total around 50 km2 in 1999 and 30 km2 in 2004 and is greatly fragmented. While part of the species\u2019 range is within protected areas, some of its range is being degraded by human activities (agriculture, pollution, tourism). Echinotriton chinhaiensis was assessed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List in 2004 due to its limited distribution, all individuals being in a single location, the low number of subpopulations, and the continuing decline in the extent and quality of habitat. The number of breeding females reduced from 107 in 1999 to 82 in 2000 and 47 in 2008. The species is vulnerable to weather events such as typhoons and floods, which have caused a decline in the population. A number of attempts at ex-situ conservation have been made; individuals were collected from the wild and more than 800 larvae were released in 1998. The species is protected in the wild, meaning the hunting, catching or killing, as well as the sale and purchase or utilisation of the species and their products, is strictly prohibited within China. Records of the species in trade appear to be limited to low numbers observed for sale (two in a pet store in Japan, and a trader in Hong Kong SAR posting a picture on social media of at least five) and some discussion on online forums which could indicate demand. Echinotriton maxiquadratus This species was only described in 2014 and has not yet been assessed by IUCN. Like E. chinhaiensis, the species is considered to have a very small wild population with a restricted distribution; one expert stated it was known from two restricted areas of approximately 10 to 20 km\u00b2 with populations each estimated to be less than 100 - 150 individuals. It faces many of the same threats as E. chinhaiensis, but due to its recent discovery little is known on population trends. The species is not protected under State law, although at least part of its range is within protected areas where harvest is prohibited. Little is known about the trade of this species, but due to the species\u2019 rarity it is highly likely to be in demand. One expert is aware of several specimens apparently being kept outside of China. Echinotrition maxiquadratus is morphologically very similar to E. chinhaiensis. Analysis: The endemic spiny newt E. chinhaiensis has a very restricted, fragmented range in China (around 30 km2) and is estimated to have a very small wild population (less than 400 adults) which is decreasing. It is known to be in demand for the hobbyist trade, although the species is protected in the wild. The species may already meet the biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I and therefore would appear likely to meet the criteria for inclusion in Appendix II under criterion 2aA of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev.CoP17). Less is known about the recently described E. maxiquadratus, but it appears to face a similar challenge of a very small wild population and very restricted range and is not yet protected (though part of its range is within protected areas). The possibility of trade seems high due to its recent discovery and rarity, and therefore also meets criterion 2aA for inclusion in Appendix II. Other Considerations: Echinotriton chinhaiensis is protected in its only range State and any trade is already illegal, so if this proposal is accepted China could publish a zero-export wild quota on the CITES website to reflect national legislation. An Appendix II listing may help close the apparent loophole of specimens being illegally exported via Hong Kong SAR where they are not protected.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "026b8e4d-678b-456f-878c-a8eba6785c7a": {"__data__": {"id_": "026b8e4d-678b-456f-878c-a8eba6785c7a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summaries-iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Summaries of the IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summaries-iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "820b64df612b77c396a362c0f286e31fe5cff08fd060c7df04c0a47d94802121"}, "2": {"node_id": "1f7090f6-736e-4fbd-9ad3-ce7fb467433d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summaries-iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2fffaca4b4fbed37be690bf04463dac3bd6c887b65d366bad647ce1afb73bcf0"}}, "hash": "9dd8d795cbade92e2de8f98d03989572530c6b15ad644c632a0dabfc4c0a44fe", "text": "Japan may wish to list the third species in the genus, E. andersoni, in Appendix III to monitor any potentially increased trade in this species as a result of the other two species being listed.

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 40 60 Inclusion of Asian Warty Newts Paramesotriton spp. endemic to China and Viet Nam in Appendix II Proponents: China and European Union Summary: This proposal is for the inclusion of all species of the genus Paramesotriton endemic to Viet Nam and China in Appendix II, with the exception of P. hongkongensis, which is already included in Appendix II. All currently described species in the genus are endemic to southern China and northern Viet Nam. In the past 15 years the number of described species in the genus has doubled and the updated version of the CITES Standard Nomenclature Reference for newts recognises 14 species. Each species is thought to have a restricted distribution and to only occur in a few, small known populations. Sexual maturity is normally reached at between three and seven years (sometimes up to 10 years). They are found in or close to forest streams; the adults of some species can be found in water all year round while others become particularly aquatic during the breeding season. Information on the population size and status of many of the species is lacking. Six of the 14 currently described species have been assessed on the IUCN Red List (one as Endangered, one Vulnerable, two Near Threatened and two Least Concern). Most of these assessments were conducted in 2004 and require updating. Based on China\u2019s Red Data List (2016), of the ten species that were assessed, four were endangered and three vulnerable. Wild populations are threatened by habitat loss (deforestation and infrastructure development) and some species are exploited for the Traditional Asian Medicine, food and pet trades. Paramesotriton hongkongensis was listed in Appendix II at CoP17, although no trade has been reported for this species in the CITES Trade Database to date. All species in the genus have been listed in Annex D of the EU Wildlife Trade Regulations since 2009. Some of the species are protected within range States, and commercial imports of all Paramesotriton species into the EU and the USA (two of the major markets for the pet trade) have been prohibited since 2018 and 2016 respectively due to concerns over the spread of disease. Illegal collection and trade have been reported. Captive breeding is possible for some species, but the extent to which this is happening appears to be limited to date. Trade is reported to be mainly in live or whole dried or preserved animals. However, available trade data is restricted predominantly to live animals exported to Europe and the USA for pets and does not capture the volume of harvest and trade for traditional medicine in Asia, or the domestic food or pet market. Imports of live Paramesotriton into the EU between 2009-2017 totaled over 1,600 live animals. Imports into the USA involved more than 38,000 individuals between 2000-2016 (species- specific data were only available for the period 2007-2013). The main species reported in trade (aside from P. hongkongensis) were: - Paramesotriton labiatus: Endemic to China, this species was previously recognised as Pachytriton labiatus including in the latest IUCN assessment (Least Concern, 2004). In 2016 the species was nationally assessed as vulnerable. Paramesotriton labiatus (reported as Pachytriton labiatus) was the species of this genus imported into the USA in the highest number between 2007 and 2013 (8,400 live, all wild).

At the time of the Red List assessment it was considered rare and the population to be declining. Habitat loss and over- harvesting for the pet trade were identified as major threats). However, the current status is unknown. Nationally it was considered vulnerable in 2016. Many specimens reported as P. chinensis in trade were believed to be mis-identified P. fuzhongensis. Although no trade data are available, the species has been observed for sale in Europe. - Paramesotriton guangxiensis: Endemic to China and Viet Nam, P. guangxiensis was assessed in 2004 as Endangered since the area of occupancy was less than 500 km2, none of which was within protected areas. The Chinese population was assessed as endangered in 2016. Wild specimens have been observed for sale in pet shops in Viet Nam (including animals originating from China). Paramesotriton guangxiensis was formerly treated as a synonym of the morphologically similar P. deloustali. - Paramesotriton zhijinensis: Endemic to China, P. zhijinensis is considered to have a restricted range. While it has not yet been assessed by IUCN (it was described in 2008), it was nationally assessed as endangered in 2016. No information on trade could be found, although the species resembles P. chinensis so may be traded under that name. Species identification is difficult - especially if animals are traded in a dried state for traditional medicine. Imports into the EU and USA are reported to be frequently labelled incorrectly (as P. hongkongensis or P. chinensis). Whilst it does appear possible to distinguish P. hongkongensis from other similar species based on morphological characteristics, identification by non-experts may be difficult. The genus is relatively understudied and future taxonomic work is likely to lead to more species being described. Species of the genus Pachytriton (not currently listed in the Appendices) are also reportedly difficult for non-experts to distinguish from Paramesotriton. Analysis: There is little information available on the wild populations of most Paramesotriton species, although many are believed to have small ranges and probably low population sizes. Habitat loss and degradation is a significant threat. Species are used for traditional medicine in Asia, for some species it is thought this could be in significant volumes, although no quantitative information is available. Some species are also traded domestically and internationally as pets. The only data available on legal international trade relate to imports reported by the EU and USA, which have both recently prohibited commercial imports due to concerns over disease. Trade has also been reported between China and Viet Nam. For most species there is not enough information to determine whether current levels of international trade are having an impact on wild populations, particularly with restrictions on trade to EU and USA markets. A number of species are globally Endangered (P. guangxiensis) and/or nationally endangered (e.g. P. guangxiensis, P. longliensis P. yunwuensis, P. zhijinensi), and it seems possible that certain species meet the Appendix I biological criteria (e.g. P. maolanensis which is known only from one 60 m2 pool, although no information was found on international trade).

Due to the evolving taxonomy of Paramesotriton, there is potential for the current CITES Standard Nomenclature Reference to become out of date. The CITES Standard Nomenclature Reference used for the newt species currently listed in CITES is Frost (2015). CoP18 Doc. 99 recommends a change to a 2017 version of Frost which recognises all 14 species of Paramesotriton currently described. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 41 63 Inclusion of Crocodile Newts Tylototriton spp. in Appendix II Proponents: China and European Union Summary: The species in the genus Tylototriton, known as Crocodile Newts, are distributed within montane forests from the eastern Himalaya, through Indochina, to southern and central China. Their taxonomy is rapidly evolving, and the number of described species has increased threefold to 24 since 2010. Twenty species are thought to be endemic to one country and are mainly considered to be of restricted range and consist of few, small known populations, although it is likely that due to their cryptic nature the range of certain species is larger than currently known. Several currently recognised species are considered morphological complexes that may contain multiple species with smaller ranges. Sexual maturation is reached at between three and five years, and clutches usually consist of less than 100 eggs. Seasonally they accumulate in breeding pools which leaves them susceptible to capture for the domestic and international pet and traditional medicine trades. Outside of the breeding season, adults and juveniles are mostly terrestrial and fossorial. Thirteen of the species have been assessed on the IUCN Red List (two as Endangered, five as Vulnerable, three as Near Threatened). Of the 14 species assessed on China\u2019s Red List (2016), six are threatened and seven near threatened. There is little population information for many species, although most are considered to be declining as a result of habitat loss and degradation (especially around breeding sites), unsustainable harvest and other factors. It appears that at least some of the species are being impacted by international trade. The genus has been listed in Annex D of the EU Wildlife Trade Regulations since 2009. Available international trade data are restricted predominantly to live animals exported to Europe and the USA for pets, and do not capture the volume of harvest and trade for traditional medicine in Asia, or the domestic food or pet market, which appears to be significant for some species. Some of the species are protected within range States, and commercial imports into the EU and the USA (two of the major markets for the pet trade) have been prohibited since 2018 and 2016 respectively due to concerns over the spread of disease. Illegal harvest and trade have been reported. Captive breeding is possible for some species, but the extent to which this is happening appears to be limited to date. Key species reported in trade (mainly as live) to the major markets of Europe and the USA include T. kweichowensis and T. verrucosus (considered a morphological complex), which are discussed below: - Tylototriton kweichowensis is endemic to China and was assessed as Vulnerable in 2004 due to a restricted area of occupancy (<2,000 km2) which was fragmented and declining. The number of mature individuals was also said to be declining. T. kweichowensis were imported in large numbers into Europe in the 1990s, and although captive breeding has occurred it is not clear on what scale. T. kweichowensis was the species of this genus reportedly imported into the EU in the greatest quantity (850 individuals) since the genus was listed in the EU Wildlife Trade Regulations in 2009. A further 1,130 wild and 350 captive-bred T. kweichowensis were imported into the USA between 2007 and 2013. Habitat destruction and degradation are major threats to this species, and it is also collected for use in traditional Chinese medicine. - Tylototriton verrucosus was previously considered to be widely distributed but is now believed to comprise other related species with significantly smaller ranges and fewer populations. T. verrucosus was assessed as Least Concern in 2004, but this could change if future taxonomic revisions split the species.

A number of other (often newly described) species with limited ranges and/or smaller populations have also been observed in trade. While there is little or no data on imports of these species into the EU or USA (suggesting the scale is less than T. kweichowensis and T. verrucosus, trade but potentially could have a greater impact if they are range-restricted/smaller populations) some specimens may have been traded under incorrect names. Examples of these include: - Tylototriton lizhenchangi is an endemic with a restricted distribution described in 2012, and although not yet assessed on the IUCN Red List, it was nationally assessed as vulnerable (2016). One expert stated that intensive collection following its formal description had reduced the wild populations close to extinction (large adult individuals were already difficult to find in 2014 and 2015). No legal imports were reported into the EU (although it was offered for sale in Germany) or the USA (although it may have been imported under \u201cTylototriton spp.\u201d). - Tylototriton vietnamensis, assessed as Endangered in 2016, has an estimated extent of occurrence of 1,345 km2 and appears to be an uncommon species with small and fragmented populations. Tay Yen Tu Nature Reserve and Yen Tu Landscape Protection Area were reported to harbour the largest population of this species, and a survey of all known breeding sites in the Reserve in 2010 found 216 individuals. Unsustainable harvest is reported to be a threat to this species, in addition to intensive deforestation, climate change, and erratic rainfall. Local people are reported to collect newts for private medicinal use, or to sell to local tourists or at Chinese markets for the international pet trade. Limited legal imports into the EU and USA are reported but given historic confusion with T. asperrimus and others in the genus it is likely that some specimens have been traded under incorrect names. - Tylototriton wenxianensis, endemic to China, was assessed as Vulnerable in 2004 due to its limited area of occupancy (<2,000 km2) that was declining in extent and quality, as well as limited localities. It was nationally assessed as vulnerable in 2016. The global population was estimated at 30,000 in 2008 but was reported to have more than halved by 2015; threats included habitat loss and degradation. There are reportedly undescribed taxa within T. wenxianensis, meaning the population may be smaller should the species be split. No legal imports were reported into the EU (although it was offered for sale in Portugal and Spain) or the USA (although it may have been imported under \u201cTylototriton spp.\u201d). - Tylototriton yangi is endemic to China and reported to be highly threatened by overharvest for the terrarium trade; a year after its discovery in 2012, specimens were reported to be exported to Europe and the USA in significant numbers, which was greatly reducing wild populations. One expert has observed considerable population declines since 2014, and thousands are reported to be exported illegally. The species has not yet been assessed by IUCN, but is nationally assessed as near threatened (2016). Many Tylototriton species are considered morphological complexes (e.g. T. verrucosus, T. shanjing and T. asperrimus) and morphological identification is considered difficult or even impossible by a non-specialist. In addition, there is great morphological variation between individuals of the same species. Species are frequently traded using an incorrect name, either erroneously or deliberately. It is also said to be difficult for non-specialists to differentiate between Tylototriton and Echinotriton (two species in the latter genus are also proposed for inclusion in Appendix II; see CoP18 Prop. 39). The genus is relatively understudied and future taxonomic work is likely to lead to more species being described. Analysis: There is little information available on the wild populations of many species of Tylototriton, although they are generally believed to have small and probably declining ranges, and small population sizes.

There appears to be a pattern of new species being described and then impacted by international trade, although some have likely been in trade previously but under a different name. Certain species already appear to meet the biological criteria for Appendix I (including but not limited to T. lizhenchangi, T. vietnamensis, T. wenxianensis and T. yangi) based on apparent marked declines, restricted ranges and/or small wild populations that are declining, and therefore meet the Appendix II 2a criterion. For other species, there is insufficient information to determine whether the criteria are met. However, since morphological identification in this group is considered to be difficult or even impossible by a non-specialist, and the taxonomy is evolving, for ease of implementation a genus listing seems appropriate. Other Considerations: As some species are nationally protected and thus trade is illegal, the range States concerned could put in place a voluntary zero-export quota for wild specimens which would be listed on the CITES website and empower re-exporting and importing Parties to assist with enforcing the law. Due to the evolving taxonomy of Tylototriton, there is potential for the current CITES Standard Nomenclature Reference to become out of date. The CITES Standard Nomenclature Reference used for the newt species currently listed in CITES is Frost (2015). CoP18 Doc. 99 recommends a change to a 2017 version of Frost, but this will already be out of date (T. ngarsuensis was described in 2018). There is some debate regarding whether Tylototriton should be split into multiple genera (Tylototriton, Liangshantriton and Yaotriton), so further taxonomic revisions are potentially significant. It is said to be difficult to differentiate Tylototriton and Echinotriton. Two species in the latter genus are also subject to a listing proposal (Prop. 39). If one proposal is accepted, then it seems appropriate for the other to also be accepted on the basis of 2bA (look-alike). IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 42 66 Inclusion of Mako Sharks Isurus oxyrinchus and Isurus paucus in Appendix II Proponents: Bangladesh, Benin, Bhutan, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Chad, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Dominican Republic, Egypt, European Union, Gabon, Gambia, Jordan, Lebanon, Liberia, Maldives, Mali, Mexico, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, Palau, Samoa, Senegal, Sri Lanka, Sudan and Togo Summary: Shortfin Mako Shark Isurus oxyrinchus is a fast, large (4 m), widely distributed, migratory shark with low biological productivity. It can be found in all temperate and tropical ocean waters from 50\u00b0N (60\u00b0N in the North Atlantic) to 50\u00b0S. It is distributed across the following oceans: North Atlantic (14.5% of distribution), South Atlantic (12%), North Pacific (32.5%), South Pacific (22%), Indian Ocean (17.9%) and Mediterranean (1.1%). Longfin Mako Shark I. paucus appears in similar waters, although its complete distribution remains unclear. Very little is known about its biology. The primary threats to Isurus oxyrinchus and presumably I. paucus are directed and incidental catch in multi-specific fisheries found throughout its range. Isurus oxyrinchus is generally retained for its high-valued meat for both national and international markets, whilst its fins are mostly destined for the international market. Its meat is consumed all over the world and is considered a premium product. Fins from I. oxyrinchus have been observed in markets in Hong Kong SAR\u2019s main commercial centre, where this was reported as the fourth and fifth most abundant species in 1999- 2000 and 2014-2015 respectively. Isurus paucus fins have also been observed in this market. Other products from this trade include liver oil, skin and teeth.

Conf. 9.24 (Rev CoP17) for commercially exploited aquatic species. We take these guidelines to refer to the criterion 2aA. Information has also been examined for evidence of decreasing populations considered in relation to criterion 2aB. The FAO Expert Advisory Panel examined available datasets for robust information on the extent of marked declines for I. oxyrinchus (for which more data are available) to determine if there have been historical and recent declines near to the guideline figures in the footnote to Annex 5 of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev.CoP17). The Panel concluded that in none of the species\u2019 areas of distribution were there historical declines near to the guideline figures, however they did note that there was reliable evidence of historical population decreases in the North Atlantic, Mediterranean and North Pacific (combined distribution of 48.1%). They considered there was not enough reliable evidence for the South Atlantic and Indian Ocean to calculate the extent of decline. The Panel considered that the population of the South Pacific has historically been stable and possibly increasing in recent years. The Panel determined that recent decreases in the North Atlantic were of between 23-32%. Although they acknowledged decreases in the Mediterranean, they found that the extent of decline was not well determined. They found data to determine recent declines for the South Atlantic and Indian Ocean IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 42 67 were not robust enough to calculate the extent of decline, but noted there were marginal increases (by 0.16% per year) in the North Pacific. While there appear to be no historic or recent marked declines near to the guideline figures in the footnote to Annex 5, taking into consideration available datasets there is evidence that populations of I. oxyrinchus in the North Atlantic, South Atlantic, Mediterranean, Indian Ocean and North Pacific (making up 78% of the distribution) have all undergone historical decreases in population. In recent years the North Atlantic, Mediterranean and Indian Ocean (33.5% of distribution) populations have been decreasing. In the South Pacific there is general agreement that the population is likely increasing marginally, however in the North Pacific there is a lack of consensus over the trend, with some considering a possible continuing decline whereas others consider there to have been a marginal increase. There is a lack of data for the South Atlantic, but in the most recent IUCN Red List assessment it is accepted that the situation in the North Atlantic (decreasing population) is representative of the South Atlantic. Less information is known on the population size of Isurus paucus, although it is considered the rarer of the two species; expert judgement suggests global declines would be similar to I. oxyrinchus as it is caught as target and incidental catch alongside I. oxyrinchus in offshore and high seas waters. Recent global IUCN Red List assessments due to be published in March 2019 have categorised both species as Endangered. Some range States have adopted a variety of legislative measures including quotas, finning bans, fishing gear restrictions, and area and season bans. Within the distribution of I. oxyrinchus, at least some areas are known to have stricter legislation in place, often in the form of recommendations or resolutions established by Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs), including the banning of shark finning or the requirement for live I. oxyrinchus to be released. Analysis: Isurus oxyrinchus and I. paucus are both widely distributed, occurring in temperate and tropical ocean waters. Isurus oxyrinchus meat is utilized both locally and internationally and considered to be high value. Its fins have been observed in some of the largest fin markets. The species\u2019 low productivity place them at risk of overexploitation if stocks are overfished and unable to recover. There is no robust evidence of historic or recent marked declines for I. oxyrinchus that would meet the guidelines for listing under Annex 2aA. However, historical population decreases have been reported for I. oxyrinchus across large parts of its range (78%). Recent data suggest populations are continuing to decrease in 33.5% of its distribution (North Atlantic, Indian Ocean and Mediterranean), and if the condition of the North Atlantic is representative of the South Atlantic, this would add a further 12% of the species\u2019 distribution.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8d502c94-8ac1-4fb1-bbb5-3c5714d6b5f4": {"__data__": {"id_": "8d502c94-8ac1-4fb1-bbb5-3c5714d6b5f4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summaries-iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Summaries of the IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summaries-iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5704a4381038b003e7e88e103144baabc0f9b6d0ab4b79b3891adee4544088d3"}, "2": {"node_id": "302b7ec4-c58a-45a8-9c7b-92773c81edb1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summaries-iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4a710bb992a4a4a79b2e249eb353bbf09307fc968e79cc4dbc9dd25dfe2f283f"}}, "hash": "2217093c7f44758b4b97662585f363683394c19b0487a24a8b451a52989ff363", "text": "The populations in the South Pacific appear to be stable or marginally increasing and there are differing opinions on the trend in the North Pacific.

Population trend data for I. paucus are limited but it is likely to be undergoing similar decreases to I. oxyrinchus, thus potentially also meeting the criteria in Annex 2aB of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17). Some legislation and regulations are in place in some of the regions where population declines are occurring. The extent to which these are being implemented is unclear. Any CITES listing would reinforce the implementation of any existing legislation and management measures. Fins of both species are sometimes mixed in the same market category and although it is possible to differentiate the fins due to differences in dermal denticles, I. paucus is commonly misidentified as I. oxyrinchus. Meat would be less readily identifiable to the species level and therefore enforcement officers who encounter specimens of CITES-listed species are unlikely to be able to distinguish between species.

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 43 68 Inclusion of Guitarfish Glaucostegus spp. in Appendix II Proponents: Bangladesh, Benin, Bhutan, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Chad, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Egypt, European Union, Gabon, Gambia, Maldives, Mali, Mauritania, Monaco, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, Palau, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, Syrian Arab Republic, Togo and Ukraine Summary: Giant Guitarfish species in the family Glaucostegidae are shark-like batoid species occurring in the coastal waters of the Mediterranean and Black Sea, Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. There are six species in the family, all in the genus Glaucostegus. The majority of the species are strongly associated with soft bottom habitats in shallow (<50 m) warm-temperate to tropical coastal waters. Species in the Glaucostegidae family grow slowly, mature late, have a generation length of 10\u201315 years, and exhibit low to medium productivity with many growing larger than 2 m in total length. The global population sizes are unknown for all of the species of Glaucostegidae. There are no known stock assessments for any of the species and all information on population trends is based upon fisheries landings and inferred from fishing effort. All six species in the family have recently been assessed by IUCN as Critically Endangered with estimated declines of greater than 80% over the last three generations having occurred (accepted for publication in the July 2019 Red List update). These estimates have been based on new datasets documenting global population reductions. The primary threats to Glaucostegidae are considered to be unmanaged and unregulated fisheries. Some of the catch is targeted and incidental catch is often retained. Fishing techniques used in these coastal regions mean that species of Glaucostegidae are exposed to intensive fishing. Coastal development is also a threat to these species with human populations increasing, leading to increased fishing pressure, but also habitat degradation, threatening key habitats in the species\u2019 life cycle.

The species\u2019 status in the Mediterranean is unclear; while local extirpation is reported in the northern Mediterranean it is still present in the south, but it is expected that there will be declines. The species is reported to be taken in Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania and Sierra Leone. Glaucostegus granulatus and G. cemiculus occur in are some of the most heavily fished coastal regions in the world. While it appears the meat from glaucostegid species is primarily used locally, the fins of these IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 43 69 species are reported to be exported. Fins from Glaucostegus cemiculus have been identified in shops in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), included in the highest valued categories of fins, \u201cQun chi\u201d. They have been observed for auction/sale in Bangladesh, Oman and United Arab Emirates. The form that species are traded in (fins, meat) makes it hard to differentiate between species within the Glaucostegidae family, often requiring genetic analyses. There is conflicting information on whether Glaucostegidae fins are morphologically similar to those from the family Rhinidae (subject to a separate listing proposal, Prop. 44) and Pristidae (listed in Appendix I in 2007except Pristis microdon which was transferred from Appendix II to I in 2013), once removed from the whole animals, particularly in the processed form. Legislation and regulation for Glaucostegidae vary by location and country; where they exist, they primarily cover a range of measures involving either the banning of commercial fishing of sharks in certain zones, size limits or banning the practice of finning. Fishing restrictions in Mauritania have apparently resulted in increases in relative abundance of Glaucostegus cemiculus. Analysis: Species of Glaucostegidae are found in coastal waters in the Mediterranean and Black Sea, Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. While their meat appears to be utilised locally, fins from these species have been observed in international trade, which is presumed to drive the retention of the species as incidental catch. In the most recent IUCN Red List assessments (to be published July 2019), all six of the species were said to have undergone declines of greater than 80% over the past three generations and therefore already meet the biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I owing to a marked recent rate of decline. Over-harvest is identified as the main factor driving these declines. Therefore, it is likely that for all of the species in this family, regulation of trade is required to ensure that harvest from the wild is not reducing populations to levels where survival might be threatened by continued harvest or other influences. Management measures have shown to be successful in restoring populations where they are implemented. Due to the difficulties in differentiating the species in the form that they are traded in, if any of the species are considered to meet the criteria then all should be listed. Other Considerations: Species of Rhinidae (subject to a separate listing proposal, Prop, 44) and Glaucostegidae are often landed and traded together. Therefore, if one of the proposals is accepted then the species in the other family should be included in Appendix II to ease implementation.

Declines in this species have been inferred from landing data in the Islamic Republic of Iran, Oman and United Arab Emirates, and fishing pressure is thought to be particularly high in east Africa where it is targeted alongside hammerhead sharks.

Therefore, if one of the proposals is accepted then the other family would meet the criteria in Annex 2bA of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev CoP17). It is unclear for species in the Rhinidae family what proportion of animals survive if released after capture. It appears from limited information that initial survival after capture is high. In some instances, incidental catch levels are as high as target catches and therefore survival after potential release could be crucial in determining whether regulation is likely to have conservation benefits. In northern Australia, catches of large elasmobranchs have been reduced after the introduction of turtle exclusion devises (TEDs); Rhynchobatus australiae were caught in significantly lower numbers in nets with TEDs. The species in the family Rhinidae are subject to little or no management across their range; an Appendix-II listing could help support the improved management of these species in their range States.

The genus Holothuria contains more than 20 subgenera, of which the subgenus Holothuria (Microthele) contains four species. Three species within the subgenus are commonly referred to as teatfish due to their lateral protrusions, whilst the fourth species Holothuria fuscopunctata is known as a trunkfish and lacks teats. The presence of teats (in the three species which display them) differentiate this group from other sea cucumbers, even in dried form, and it is only these three species subject to this listing proposal: Holothuria fuscogilva: Varies in colour from a dark colour with light spots to a light colour with dark spots, with large lateral protrusions (teats) along its flanks. Length and weight vary from 28\u201357 cm and 2.4\u20133 kg based on location. This species can be found on reef slopes, sandy areas and seagrass beds between 0\u201350 m in depth. This species occurs throughout the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Holothuria nobilis: Black in colour with white blotches on the sides of the animal and 6\u201310 large lateral protrusions (teats) along its flanks. Length varies from 14\u201360 cm and weight from 0.23\u20133 kg based on location. This species can be found on shallow coral reef habitats, seagrass beds and sandy substrates between 0\u201340 m in depth. This species only occurs in the African and Indian Ocean region. Holothuria nobilis also includes a yet undescribed species which is likely to be separated from H. nobilis named Holothuria (Microthele) sp. \u201cpentard\u201d. This yet undescribed species has an average length of 30 cm and weight of 1.7 kg and has been found to prefer sandy substrates at a depth between 10\u201350 m. Holothuria whitmaei: Uniformly black ventrally and grey ventrally with 5\u201310 large lateral protrusions (teats) along its flanks.

Sea cucumbers from the family Holothuridae have been harvested in the Indo-Pacific region for over 1,000 years. In the 1980s harvesting of sea cucumbers increased to feed the demand for beche-de- mer in Asian markets. Trade data for individual species are rarely available as trade is often reported using a generic \u201csea cucumber\u201d name. Annual global capture of sea cucumbers showed a six-fold increase in the 1980s and from 1990 onwards has been steadily increasing to a weight of 31,000 t in 2016. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 45 73 One species-specific example of trade comes from the Seychelles, where capture data between 2001 and 2016 totalled 1,700 t of Holothuria fuscogilva and 180 t of H. nobilis. Complimentary density data showed a 54% decline in H. fuscogilva density and a 73% decline in H. nobilis density between the two survey periods in 2003\u20132004 and 2011\u20132013. Holothuria fuscogilva was assessed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List in 2010; the population is estimated to have declined by 30\u201350% since the 1960s. Both H. nobilis and H. whitmaei were assessed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List (2010) with declines since the 1960s estimated at 60\u201370% in at least 80% of its range for H. nobilis and 60\u201390% in most of its range for H. whitmaei. Sea cucumber fisheries are not regulated in several countries, although some have employed various measures. Australia and Egypt both employed closed fishing areas and India employed a total ban on sea cucumber fishing, but these are not widely adopted strategies and there have been issues with implementation. Limited-access fisheries have also restricted the number of vessels/harvesters in a given area. Total Allowable Catches (TACs) or quotas have also been established in Australia and Papua New Guinea. Minimum catch sizes are implemented in Australia, Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Tonga. However, large areas of these species\u2019 ranges are not protected or regulated. Analysis: Holothuria fuscogilva, H. nobilis and H. whitmaei are the target of fisheries driven by the international trade of beche-de-mer mainly to Asian markets. Information on the productivity and recruitment of all three species is relatively unknown, but threshold densities are thought to be required to ensure successful reproduction. Although very little information on species-specific trade is available, all three species have been observed in markets. The only specific data on the impact of fishing, over a period of 11 years in the Seychelles, showed declines in density of 54% for Holothuria fuscogilva and 73% for H. nobilis. The FAO Expert Advisory Panel Report noted that both historic and recent declines have been observed in the densities of all three species which are consistent with the indicative guidelines for inclusion in Appendix II of commercially exploited aquatic species suggested in the footnote to Annex 5 of Resolution 9.24 (Rev. CoP17). These declines are from studies in limited areas of the ranges of these three species, however fishing pressure is likely over much of their range. The IUCN Red List assessments have estimated the overall declines as: H. fuscogilva 30\u201350% since the 1960s, H. nobilis 60\u201370% in at least 80% of its range, and H. whitmaei 60\u201390% in the majority of its range. Many of the densities considered in the FAO Panel\u2019s report were below the \u201crule of thumb\u201d threshold for healthy breeding populations. As international trade is likely to be driving the majority of fishing for these species, it would appear that regulation of trade is required to ensure that harvest from the wild is not reducing population to a level where survival might be threatened by continued harvest or other influences.

Due to the cryptic nature of Poecilotheria, their nocturnal habits and sensitivity to vibrations by human surveyors they are difficult to study. Therefore, current and historical population estimates and status for these species are lacking and population trends are unknown. Although many of these species\u2019 habitats are known to be declining, knowledge on the distribution of some species continues to increase as new localities are recorded extending their known range. Poecilotheria are currently protected from wild harvest in Sri Lanka, however they can be legally collected in India except within protected areas. This genus of tarantulas is popular in the pet trade due to their coloration and size, with the USA and Europe the main destinations. US import data revealed 20,000 live specimens imported between 2008 and 2017, the majority (97%) were reported as captive-bred mostly coming from European countries. According to some experts, most species are considered easy to breed and the number of individuals bred in captivity is likely enough to sustain the overall demand of those species. However, morphological and genetic diversity is said to be highly sought after in the hobby and there are some concerns over ongoing offtake from the wild. Imports into the USA of wild-caught Poecilotheria totalled 643 over the same time period and included at least 10 species: P. metallica (253), Poecilotheria spp. (124), P. rufilata (69), P. tigrinawesseli (42), P. regalis (38), P. formosa (30), P. fasciata (26), P. ornata (26), P. striata (16), P. miranda (14) and P. subfusca (5). Few wild sourced specimens where reported as originating in a range State and most were imported from Europe. Poecilotheria metallica (Indian endemic) was the most commonly imported species into the USA (7,900 live, of which 253 were wild) and was assessed in 2008 by IUCN as Critically Endangered because its range was limited to <100 km2 which was declining and severely fragmented. Poecilotheria regalis (Indian endemic) was one of the species most commonly imported into the USA (1,700 live, of which 38 were wild) and was assessed in 2008 by IUCN as Least Concern as it was widely distributed in India and although its available habitat was known to be shrinking and faced several threats, it was considered one of the most abundant of all Poecilotheria species. Poecilotheria hanumavilasumica (first described in 2004) was assessed as Critically Endangered in 2008 due to a limited distribution (<6 km2) and continuing decline in area, quality, populations and number of mature individuals. In 2015, this species was discovered in Sri Lanka, extending its known range. A total of 114 live specimens (all reported as captive-bred) were imported into the USA between 2008 and 2017. Smuggling of adults and juveniles from India has been reported. Several other threatened species were reported in trade, most of which was reportedly captive-bred, although some limited wild trade was reported and for some species international trade was said at the time to be a threat although it is not known if this is still the case. Some species of Poecilotheria appear to be morphologically distinct, such as P. metallica and could be easily identified by enforcement authorities. However, other species such as P. hanumavilasumica closely resemble other species and could pose challenges in enforcement. The ventral leg markings of the species are the primary identifiers of most species, leg-banding IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 46 75 patterns appear to be relatively conserved with little intra-specific variation between individuals and the taxonomy of the group is unresolved.

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 47 76 Inclusion of Mindoro Peacock Swallowtail Achillides chikae hermeli in Appendix I Proponent: European Union and Philippines Summary: This proposal recommends the inclusion of Mindoro Peacock Swallowtail Achillides chikae hermeli in Appendix I, and the adoption of a new standard taxonomic reference for Papilionidae (swallowtail butterflies) in the Philippines. This Mindoro Peacock Swallowtail was discovered in 1992 on Mindoro Island in the Philippines and upon its discovery it was named as Papilio hermeli. A very similar butterfly the Luzon Peacock Butterfly was already known from Luzon Island, adjacent to Mindoro. The Luzon Peacock Butterfly currently designated Papilio chikae was included in Appendix I in 1987. It is one of three species in the genus Papilio currently listed in the Appendices. Some taxonomists consider these two populations to be subspecies of the same species. Some also consider these and other species of East Asian swallowtails to belong to a separate genus Achillides, which otherwise is considered a subgenus of Papilio. The Proponents recommend the adoption Page and Treadway (2004) as a standard taxonomic reference for Papilionidae in the Philippines, a source that recognises Achillides as a separate genus, and that considers the two populations to be subspecies of the same species (Achillides chikae chikae and Achillides chikae hermeli). Having consulted the Animals Committee Nomenclature Specialist, the Proponents state that the adoption of Page and Treadwell (2004) would have the effect of changing the current listing of Papilio chikae in Appendix I to Achillides chikae chikae. They also propose including the Mindoro population, considered as Achillides chikae hermeli by Page and Treadway (2004), in the Appendices on the basis that it closely resembles Papilo chikae. Although the lookalike criteria in Annex 2bA of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) allow for listing in Appendix II on that basis, the proponents seek to list this taxon in Appendix I, citing as justification Res. Conf. 12.11 (Rev. CoP17), which recommends that in the case of subspecies: b) where there are identification difficulties, the problem be approached by either including the entire species in Appendix I or Appendix II or by circumscribing the range of the subspecies warranting protection and listing the populations within this area on a country basis. Achillides chikae hermeli is found in two separate mountain masses (Mt. Halcon and Mt. Baco) on the island of Mindoro in the Philippines.

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 47 77 The Proponents have recommended the adoption of Page and Treadaway (2004) as the CITES standard reference for Papilionidae in the Phillippines as recommended in paragraph 2 d of Res. Conf. 12.11 (Rev. CoP17) Standard nomenclature. If this is adopted, the taxon currently listed in Appendix I as P. chikae would become A. c. chikae. Under Res. Conf. 12.11 (Rev. CoP17). It is recommended in the case of subspecies where there are identification difficulties that the problem be approached by either including the entire species in Appendix I or Appendix II or by circumscribing the range of the subspecies warranting protection and listing the populations within this area on a country basis. Given that A. c. hermeli is considered to meet the criteria in Annex 2b as a lookalike, listing both the subspecies in Appendix I, and thus resulting in the full species Achilides chikae would appear to be in line with the recommendations in Res. Conf. 12.11 (Rev. CoP17). Achillides chikae hermeli is endemic to the Philippines with a restricted distribution on Mindoro Island and decreasing habitat and remaining natural forest reported to be fragmented and largely confined to higher altitudes. There is little population information and it was considered rare although with a population that was \u2018probably stable\u2019 soon after it was described. It may be that the species also meets the biological criteria for listing in Appendix I in its own right. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 48 78 Inclusion of Riverside Swallowtail Parides burchellanus in Appendix I Proponent: Brazil Summary: The Riverside Swallowtail Parides burchellanus is endemic to Brazil. It is found along river margins and in riparian gallery forests within the Cerrado region, a relatively scarce habitat that is influenced heavily by anthropogenic factors. The species was assessed in 2018 as Endangered, considering the discovery of a subpopulation around the Serra da Canastra National Park, and is considered critically endangered in the Brazilian List of Threatened Species. The species occurs in three districts of eastern Brazil; Distrito Federal, Minas Gerais and Goi\u00e1s, and is known from no more than four distinct areas or subpopulations. These subpopulations are spatially restricted, and the population overall is severely fragmented and in decline. Individuals have a limited ability to disperse and move only a few hundred metres along rivers, there is no natural connection between the four known subpopulations. The overall population size is unknown, but known subpopulations are very small, with numbers reaching up to 50 individuals, but more commonly around 30 individuals. The species\u2019 area of occupancy is currently estimated to be 120 km\u00b2 based on known localities and is unlikely to extend beyond 500 km2. The Cerrado habitat, which P. burchellanus relies on exclusively, is under threat from ongoing habitat loss and degradation: Cerrado habitat is estimated to have lost more than half of its original vegetation for farming for crops, cattle-raising activities, energy generation and urbanisation. The only known larval host plant, Aristolochia chamissonis is sparsely distributed in small sections along streams associated with fragile and vulnerable environments, which are under threat. The life history traits of P. burchellanus, including high habitat specificity and low resilience, make it highly vulnerable to extrinsic factors. Local extinctions have been observed, caused by habitat degradation. Specimens of P. burchellanus appear within international trade with specimens offered for sale online at high prices. Parides burchellanus is protected under Brazilian legislation and the capture of specimens is prohibited, therefore trade observed for this species is assumed to be illegal.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8c42a41-dcd2-4ea7-a2aa-0992c0bd74b5": {"__data__": {"id_": "f8c42a41-dcd2-4ea7-a2aa-0992c0bd74b5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summaries-iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Summaries of the IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summaries-iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "57699e675c5f815f3f60fceefc91fb40fdc63bffc48253e2bece5b2b921635b4"}, "2": {"node_id": "fcdf7ac4-2d51-4e59-bcd0-0aa4fd6c13b1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summaries-iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8117d9eedb8f7a0d0d15726133669c62a5c54f86894efbad476add85f47c90c7"}}, "hash": "8ee2f916e499701ca7c6cdf814208c2993f8b3cb312ed0950de6b055b63442fb", "text": "Analysis: The total population is unknown for Parides burchellanus, although subpopulations are estimated to be very small and persist in only four localities that are spatially restricted, severely fragmented and in decline.

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 49 79 Inclusion of Trumpet Trees Handroanthus spp., Tabebuia spp. and Roseodendron spp. in Appendix II with annotation #6 Proponent: Brazil Summary: Handroanthus, Tabebuia and Roseodendron are genera of Bignoniaceae distributed from southern USA to Argentina and Chile, including the Caribbean. There are currently 106 recognised species across the three genera (30 in Handroanthus, 73 in Tabebuia and 3 in Roseodendron). The three genera were previously recognised as belonging to a single genus (Tabebuia) but were split in 2007 based on genetic studies, and new species continue to be described. There is considerable confusion in the taxonomy and nomenclature of the three genera with differing names used in the literature and in reported trade. Species within these genera produce a very hard, heavy and durable wood that is used locally in the construction of houses and bridges, flooring, decking and handicrafts. Internationally it is one of the preferred timbers for decking. The wood is marketed with the same common name (ip\u00ea); distinguishing between species and between genera is reportedly difficult even at the microscopic level, and there are no identification guides covering all species. Handroanthus timbers are some of the most valuable in the market, with prices in Brazil reported to be as high as those achieved historically by Big-leaf Mahogany Swietenia macrophylla before commercial exploitation of the latter species was prohibited in the country. Due to their natural low densities, growth rates and shade-intolerant seedlings, Ip\u00ea species appear to be particularly vulnerable to logging, even at substantially reduced intensities. Various species have been widely planted throughout the Americas for commercial plantations, reforestation and urban landscaping. Although no estimates for the global trade in ip\u00ea exist, ITTO members reported exports totaling approximately 271,000 m3 sawn wood (96% from Brazil) and 5,000 m3 logs (all from Suriname) from 2011-2015. Brazil reportedly exports ip\u00ea to 60 countries, the principal importers being the USA and European countries. Trade from Brazil accounted for 93% of ip\u00ea sawn wood and ca. 87% of ip\u00ea flooring imports by the USA from 2008-2017. All ip\u00ea timber production in Brazil derives from natural populations. Potentially high levels of illegal harvest have been reported in the country, and there are concerns over inappropriate management measures including overestimation of sustainable offtakes, although it is unclear what proportion of illegally harvested timber enters international trade. Handroanthus serratifolius Of ip\u00ea exports reported by Brazil from 2010-2016, 70% (ca. 180,000 m3) were of H. serratifolius. Of the exports of this species, 75% were reported as decking, 16% as sawn wood and the remainder as flooring, clapboards and \u201cother\u201d. The USA and European countries were the major importers. Although annual production of H. serratifolius in Brazil increased by 150% from 2012-2017, reaching 220,000 m3 in 2017, exports of this species decreased from 36,000 m3 in 2012 to 16,000 m3 in 2016. In the years for which both production and export figures are available for H. serratifolius in Brazil (2012-2016), export volumes were ~16% of production volumes. While this may indicate that domestic use exceeds international trade, a 2008 study reported a relatively low processing efficiency for ip\u00ea (42%) suggesting potentially high levels of wastage during processing of exported products. The average yield of this species is estimated at 2.4 m3/ha. Exploitation in some regions of Brazil has reportedly resulted in significant declines of H. serratifolius, with no evidence of long-term population recovery. The species is considered threatened in both Peru and Venezuela; relatively low levels of legal and illegal international trade in the species are reported by Peru, but it is unclear whether this trade has contributed to the reported declines.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "129ff891-b518-475a-830e-f51cddff0ef1": {"__data__": {"id_": "129ff891-b518-475a-830e-f51cddff0ef1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summaries-iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Summaries of the IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summaries-iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "96d7dcb014bbb263b7c42828f7ae5f7026d58a5b07eed837f27c422ad2cc9051"}, "2": {"node_id": "74985826-a0a7-48ea-98ba-bc52fafb5aed", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summaries-iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "828db6bc2cdb17bf1ecb56d83d0c9b2629d3f62a881535fa900c6e52e57606d0"}}, "hash": "8350ea42c12a198e73e7369bf24e9920a7d78a72b2d639a98a113f8d9d4f6f2b", "text": "Handroanthus impetiginosus Like H. serratifolius, populations of H. impetiginosus in parts of Brazil have reportedly suffered significant declines through overexploitation, although reported exports of the species from Brazil were relatively low (1,665 m3 from 2010-2016). Exports of H. impetiginosus are also reported by Venezuela (20,491 m\u00b3 from 2007-2017).

It is not clear whether international trade presents a threat to these species. Deforestation for land clearance is reportedly a threat to certain species in parts of their ranges, such as H. chrysanthus in Colombia and T. rosea in Mexico, while in other areas reforestation programs are underway. The proponents seek to include the genera Handroanthus, Tabebuia and Roseodendron in Appendix II with annotation #6 (logs, sawn wood, veneer sheets and plywood). Analysis: Handroanthus, Tabebuia and Roseodendron are genera of New World trees comprising over a hundred species, with new species still being described. The timbers of certain species are in high demand both domestically and internationally, and are reportedly some of the most valuable on the market. Woods of the three genera are marketed with the same common name (Ip\u00ea); distinguishing between the species and genera is reportedly difficult even at the microscopic level. The most highly traded species based on reported data are H. serratifolius and H impetiginosus, which occur in a number of countries from Mexico to Argentina. While global data on trade are not available, Brazil appears to be the main exporter of ip\u00ea, the majority of which is of H. serratifolius with 15 other species also exported. There are also reports of illegal ip\u00ea harvest and trade taking place in the country. Overexploitation in some areas has reportedly resulted in significant population declines of H. serratifolius and H. impetiginosus which, like other species in these genera, appear to be particularly vulnerable to logging since they do not regenerate easily. On this basis, H. serratifolius and H. impetiginosus may meet the criteria for inclusion in Appendix II in Annex 2a of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP 17). The remaining species in all three genera would therefore meet the criteria for inclusion in Annex 2b, based on the reported identification difficulties as well as taxonomic and nomenclatural uncertainties. If this proposal is adopted, it is not clear whether the proposed annotation #6 (logs, sawn wood, veneer sheets and plywood) would cover the main commodities that first appear in trade and drive the demand. Decking and flooring accounted for more than three-quarters of Brazil\u2019s reported exports of H. serratifolius from 2010-2016, and Brazilian legislation currently prohibits the export of unfinished wood of native species (although large quantities of sawn wood are also reportedly imported into the USA from Brazil). None of the parts and derivatives defined in Res. Conf. 10.13 (Rev. CoP15) Implementation of the Convention for timber species currently explicitly covers flooring or decking, or refers to the HS code that seems most relevant (HS44.09). It may therefore be necessary to create a new annotation to include \u201cWood\u201d as defined in HS44.09 and amend Res. Conf. 10.13 accordingly. Proposal 53 seeks to amend the annotation for Pericopsis elata to read \u201cLogs, sawn wood, veneer sheets, plywood, and transformed wood\u201d, with transformed wood defined as HS code 44.09, and if that proposal is adopted the same annotation could be applied in this case. This may be considered to be expanding the scope of the proposal, but would be in line with the guidance in Res. Conf. 11.21 (Rev. CoP17) Use of annotations in Appendices I and II.

There are no reproductively mature trees on the Mulanje Mountain. The remaining population is thought to comprise of seedlings that have been planted since 2017 as part of a major restoration project. Due to low regeneration and recruitment, the success of the project will not be known for years to come. Plantation forestry has been conducted in other areas of Malawi with limited success. The export of native hardwood logs has been banned since 2008 and W. whytei is listed as a protected species in Malawi. Licences were only meant to be issued for salvage logging of dead trees, but illegal logging that targeted the remaining large, living trees escalated throughout the period 2007\u20132018. While W. whytei has been commercially exploited for over a century, it is unclear whether international trade or national utilisation has driven the recent decline. The proposal is to list the species W. whytei in Appendix II without annotation. Analysis: There are no mature Widdringtonia whytei trees remaining in its natural habitat, the last remaining seven having been felled by 2018. The species can be considered to be commercially extinct in the wild and therefore meets the biological criteria for listing in Appendix I already. Seedlings planted since 2017 are unlikely to mature for tens of years and therefore any trade in this species from the wild is not likely in the near future. Appendix II listing is therefore unlikely to have any significant conservation impact. It is possible that trade in W. whytei from plantations may occur as plantation forestry has been attempted for over a century with limited success. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 51 82 Deletion of North Indian Rosewood Dalbergia sissoo from Appendix II Proponents: Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal Summary: North Indian Rosewood Dalbergia sissoo is a fast-growing perennial tree, native to Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Myanmar, Nepal and Pakistan, and is also widely introduced, especially in Africa and Asia. In some regions it is considered invasive. The population size is not known, and although disease has impacted both wild and cultivated populations in a number of range States, the species\u2019 high regeneration and growth rate provides resilience to this threat. In Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan the species is widely cultivated, and has also successfully naturalised within some new areas, following afforestation programmes. Dalbergia sissoo is primarily harvested for its timber, which is used for a wide range of products including handicrafts and furniture. It has become one of the most widely utilised plantation tree species in the Indian subcontinent where it is economically important for its value in forestry, agroforestry and horticulture. The genus Dalbergia was listed in Appendix II at CoP17 (2016) with annotation #15, except for the species already listed in Appendix I. It was argued at the time of the proposed listing that only some Dalbergia species met the criteria in Annex 2a, but enforcement and customs officers who encountered specimens of Dalbergia products would be unlikely to be able to distinguish between the various species of Dalbergia reliably so the whole genus should be listed. In 2017 the predominant commodities of D. sissoo reported in international trade were carvings (~5.8 million kg) and wood products (735,000 items plus ~80,000 kg), and most were reported as pre-Convention (although there was some trade reported as from artificially propagated and wild sources). The majority of trade was from India, and European countries (particularly Germany) and the USA were the major importers. Many experts acknowledge that, without the use of technology, it is difficult for non-experts readily to identify Dalbergia sissoo once made into finished products, and these appear to be the predominant form in which D. sissoo is traded. While technological methods to identify D. sissoo exist, they require expertise and/or equipment not currently available on a global scale. A proposal to amend annotation #15 has also been submitted (CoP18 Prop. 52).

While the species does not meet the Appendix II listing criteria in Annex 2a of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17), differentiating this species in trade from all other Dalbergia species does, at present, remain a major implementation challenge. While methods exist to differentiate D. sissoo from other members of the genus in trade, these require expertise and technology not currently widely available globally. The species therefore still meets the criteria in Annex 2bA in that \u201cthe specimens of the species in the form in which they are traded resemble specimens of a species included in Appendix II under the provisions of Article II, paragraph 2 (a), or in Appendix I, so that enforcement officers who encounter specimens of CITES-listed species are unlikely to be able to distinguish between them.\u201d If the species is not removed from the Appendices, it may be that any impact on the handicraft industry might be mitigated by the proposed change to annotation #15. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 52 83 Amendment of Annotation #15 Proponents: Canada and the European Union Summary: The scope of the listing for species of Dalbergia included in Appendix II as well as Guibourtia demeusei, G. pellegriniana and G. tessmannii is defined by annotation #15 to the listing, which currently reads: All parts and derivatives are included, except: a) Leaves, flowers, pollen, fruits, and seeds; b) Non-commercial exports of a maximum total weight of 10 kg per shipment; c) Parts and derivatives of Dalbergia cochinchinensis, which are covered by Annotation # 4; d) Parts and derivatives of Dalbergia spp. originating and exported from Mexico, which are covered by Annotation # 6. The changes proposed to this annotation are: \u2022 to remove the current part b) and add a new b) \u201cFinished products to a maximum weight of wood of the listed species of 500g per item\u201d \u2022 add a new c) \u201cFinished musical instruments, finished musical instrument parts and finished musical instrument accessories\u201d \u2022 relabel the current c) and d) as d) and e) respectively. There have been challenges in interpretation and implementation of this annotation. These include concerns that some of the commodities currently covered by the listing (including finished products such as musical instruments and furniture) are not those that first appear in international trade as exports from range States and therefore their inclusion under the annotation was inconsistent with the guidance on annotations provided in Res. Conf. 11.21 (Rev. CoP17). These issues have led to considerations on this matter by the Standing Committee and its Working Group on Annotations. Analysis: The proposed amendment to annotation #15 is the result of the extensive discussions and consensus reached by the Standing Committee Working Group on Annotations (see SC70 Com.17). The Standing Committee has supported the proposed amendment, which is intended to reduce the challenges with interpretation and implementation of the current annotation #15 experienced by Parties and ensure the annotation is in line with guidance on use of annotations in Res. Conf. 11.21 (Rev. CoP17). Given the extensive debate on these changes and the consensus reached by the Standing Committee, the proposed changes should address the issues raised by (the majority of) stakeholders. Finished pieces of furniture made from the species to which the annotation applies are unlikely to contain wood of those species weighing less than 500g, so if the proposal is accepted these would continue to be covered by the listing, regardless of whether they were being exported by a range State or a processing country.

Although the full extent of trade in this transformed wood is unknown, it is likely to be only superficially different to sawn wood, which currently dominates the reported international trade. The proposed amendment would expand the current annotation for P. elata to include plywood and transformed wood to read: \"Logs, sawn wood, veneer sheets, plywood, and transformed wood1.\" In addition, a footnote is included to \u201ctransformed wood\u201d that would read: \u201c1 Whereby transformed wood is defined by HS code 44.09: Wood (including strips, friezes for parquet flooring, not assembled), continuously shaped (tongued, grooved, v-jointed, beaded or the like) along any edges, ends or faces, whether or not planed, sanded or end-jointed.\u201d The proposed amendment is intended to expand the scope of the listing of P. elata to close the observed loophole and include commodities that first appear in international trade as exports from range States, and commodities that dominate the trade and demand for the wild resource, as advised in Res. Conf. 11.21 (Rev. CoP17) Use of Annotations in Appendices I and II. A similar proposal was submitted for Dalbergia cochinchinensis at CoP17 (2016) where the same loophole under annotation #5 was identified as being exploited. That proposal was accepted and the species is now listed with annotation #4. Other species are currently listed in Appendix II and III with annotation #5, including some species of Cedrela. A separate proposal has been submitted to list the Cedrela genus in Appendix II with no annotation (CoP18 Prop. 57). It does not appear that the present proposal (CoP18 Prop. 53) is intended to apply to all taxa listed with annotation #5. Therefore, amending the annotation for P. elata only would require a new annotation solely for P. elata. Analysis: International trade in Pericopis elata appears to involve products not included in the current listing under annotation #5, based on the observation of shipments into the EU of superficially transformed sawn wood. The intention to include transformed wood (and plywood) to close the observed loophole seems an appropriate amendment and has been supported by the Standing Committee Working Group on Annotations. As other species are also listed with annotation #5, if the proposed amendment is accepted a new annotation would be required specifically to cover P. elata. The proposed amended annotation includes the term plywood, which is already defined in Res. Conf. 10.13 (Rev. CoP15) Implementation of the Convention for Timber Species. No other existing annotations include the term \u201ctransformed wood\u201d. The proposed footnote to the annotation provides a definition of \u201ctransformed wood\u201d (as HS44.09) in line with guidance in Res. Conf. 10.13 (Rev. CoP15). IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 53 85 However, it may be more appropriate to include the proposed definition in Res. Conf 10.13 (Rev. CoP15) rather than to have this as a footnote to the annotation. Thus, any changes to the definition could be amended through an amendment to the Resolution rather than through another proposal to amend the Appendices. Other Considerations: There is a proposal (CoP18 Prop. 49) to include the genera Handroanthus, Tabebuia and Roseodendron in Appendix II with annotation #6 to cover \u201clogs, sawn wood, veneer sheets and plywood\u201d, however transformed wood also appears to be one of products in trade and if the amended annotation for Pericopsis elata is accepted then the same annotation may also be appropriate for those genera. The trade term \u201ctransformed wood\u201d is not included in the Annex to the Guidelines for the preparation and submission of CITES annual reports (Notification No. 2017/006), which may need addressing.

The assessment recommended the species\u2019 harvest and trade be monitored to identify any major increase in its use, particularly as other Pterocarpus species in trade become rare or protected. The main international market is considered to be China, and to a lesser extent Viet Nam. Although Pterocarpus tinctorius is not officially recognised as a \u201chongmu\u201d species (other species of Pterocarpus are) or included on China\u2019s list of precious furniture woods, reports suggest that the species has seen an increase in exploitation due to a growth in consumption of \u201chongmu\u201d and other \u201crosewoods\u201d in China since 2010. As multiple species are commonly traded under the same names, it is difficult to determine specific trade levels of P. tinctorius. There is some confusion surrounding legislation in certain range States, so it is not clear how much of the trade is illegal, although a number of seizures have taken place. Examples of trade volumes include from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) where it was estimated in 2015 that almost 45,000 m3 of \u201cmukula\u201d was transported across the border annually to Zambia, and onwards to China. Trade data from Tanzania show that exports of P. tinctorius increased seven-fold between 2012 and 2014 from around 800 m3 to 5,600 m3. Pterocarpus erinaceus, listed in Appendix II in 2017, is a \u201chongmu\u201d species native to west and central Africa, including in countries that border range States of P. tinctorius. There is conflicting information regarding the ease of identification of this species and others in the genus. Some consider P. erinaceus wood to be distinguishable from other Pterocarpus species due to the light base colour of the heartwood, although others say that identification is only reliable at the genus level. The proposal is to list P. tinctorius in Appendix II without annotation, in order to include all readily recognisable parts and derivatives. Analysis: Pterocarpus tinctorius is harvested for timber and has a number of other local uses. There is evidence of a recent increase in export of timber from some range States, largely to meet demand in China for furniture-making. A proportion of this export appears to be unauthorised or illegal. The species is widespread and locally common, and although it is thought to be declining it was assessed by IUCN as Least Concern in 2017. It is a slow-growing, late-maturing species. The current level of harvest for timber is likely to be unsustainable, in that it almost certainly exceeds the rate at which harvestable-sized trees are being replenished in the population. However, very little species-specific trade data are available, and it is unknown how much harvest is for domestic versus international markets. While there is insufficient evidence to determine clearly whether the species meets the criteria in Annex 2a of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17), given the uncertainty and the apparent serial exploitation of similar precious wood-producing trees, it may be precautionary to list the species in Appendix II. There seem to be some difficulties in distinguishing between P. tinctorius and P. erinaceus (already listed in Appendix II), and therefore it seems likely that P. tinctorius meets the look-alike criteria for listing in Appendix II provided in Annex 2b of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17). IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 54 87 The proposal without annotation is intended to avoid the potential for regulations to be circumvented as has been seen with other rosewood listings and seems a sensible approach. Other Considerations: Some trade is likely to be illegal as certain range States have export bans in place. Any additional benefits of an Appendix II listing are not clear unless enforcement efforts are increased. If this proposal is accepted, those range States with export bans could request that the CITES Secretariat posts zero quotas on the CITES website if they wished to reflect national legislation.

The Proponents seek to amend the annotation so that part f) reads: finished products1 of Aloe ferox and Euphorbia antisyphilitica packaged and ready for retail trade. The proposed amendment provides a footnote defining \u201cfinished product\u201d as follows: 1This term, as used in the CITES Appendices refers to products, shipped singly or in bulk, requiring no further processing, packaged, labelled for final use or the retail trade in a state fit for being sold to or used by the general public. Almost all trade in wild Aloe ferox originates from South Africa. Bitter sap (\u201cbitters\u201d) is extracted from harvested leaves, crystalised and sometimes ground to powder then exported. Recently, further processing of secondary extracts has been taking place including the inner leaf jelly as a juice, gel or powder, and these products too have been increasingly going into international trade. End uses of Aloe ferox products include health drinks, medicines and a range of healthcare and cosmetics products. South Africa\u2019s exports have been dominated by extracts (bitters) however, there has been increasing trade reported as derivatives and in the years 2013-2015 exports of derivatives exceeded those of extract by gross weight. South Africa states that its exports of derivatives refer to finished products and the quantities of Aloe ferox in these are minimal. However, studies provided on concentrations of Aloe ferox extracts contained in finished products do not help to clarify the significance of export quantities reported as derivatives. Other species in the Appendices are also annotated with #4 but would not be affected by this amendment. Analysis: According to Res. Conf. 11.21 (Rev. CoP17) annotations should concentrate on those commodities that first appear in international trade as exports from the range State and include only those commodities that dominate the trade and the demand for the wild resource. South Africa exports large quantities of wild sourced Aloe ferox extract and derivatives, the latter having increased proportionately in recent years apparently due to increased processing of finished products in South Africa. South Africa has said that most of the derivatives they have reported are finished products packaged and ready for retail trade and propose that they be excluded from CITES controls by the proposed amendment to the annotation. Exports of derivatives have been increasing over the last 10 years and in some years the total weight reported (which might include significant amounts of other ingredients) has exceeded the export by weight of the primary extract. These derivatives, or finished products are commodities that first appear in international trade. If they are becoming dominant in the volumes of exports their exemption would not be in line with the guidance in IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 55 89 Res. Conf 11.21 (Rev. CoP17). However, this is not possible to ascertain without more detailed insight into the concentration of primary and secondary Aloe ferox extracts in the products exported. If the amendment to exclude finished products of Aloe ferox is adopted, it would not be necessary to include a footnote defining \u201cfinished products\u201d as this definition is the same as that provided in the Interpretation text of the Appendices and therefore does not require a footnote defining it specifically in this annotation. Aloe ferox would only be differentiated from other Aloe species on the basis of ingredient lists.

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 57 91 Inclusion of all species of the genus Cedrela in Appendix II Proponent: Ecuador Summary: Cedrela is a genus of tree with 17 species occurring in Mexico and the Caribbean islands south to Argentina. Cedrela odorata is the most widespread species and appears to be the most highly traded species internationally, although other species are also used for their valuable timber. Cedrela odorata has been listed in Appendix III by Colombia and Peru since 2001, by Guatemala since 2008, by Bolivia since 2010, and by Brazil since 2011. Two other species in the genus, C. fissilis and C. lilloi, have been listed in Appendix III by Bolivia and Brazil since 2010 and 2016 respectively. All listed populations are covered by annotation #5 (logs, sawn wood and veneer sheets). Cedrela odorata was assessed as globally Vulnerable with a decreasing population trend on the IUCN Red List in 2017, with the unsustainable harvest of timber cited as the main threat. Many populations appear to have been severely depleted by targeted over-exploitation, are categorised as nationally endangered or vulnerable, and are subject to laws and other measures to regulate harvest. Illegal trade has been reported. Extensive loss of habitat also threatens the species; deforestation data indicate that the range has decreased by 29% in the last 100 years, and is estimated to decline by 40% in the next 100 years. The wood of C. odorata is used extensively for furniture making and other purposes. According to the CITES Trade Database, large quantities of sawn wood have been exported by Peru, Bolivia and Brazil (noting that data reported to CITES primarily reflect exports from range States with Appendix III-listed populations), as well as non-range States where plantations have been established. The principal importers were the USA and Mexico (43% and 33% of total reported imports from 2007- 2016, respectively). Available data for the principal range State exporters indicate that domestic trade exceeds international trade (annual average of 72,000 m3 relative to 46,000 m3 for Bolivia, Brazil and Peru combined over the period 2004-2008). There was a substantial increase in exports and prices of C. odorata timber following the 2003 listing of Big-leaf Mahogany Swietenia macrophylla in Appendix II. Reported exports of C. odorata timber peaked at over 60,000 m3 in 2007 but subsequently declined to under 10,000 m3 in 2010. Exports then increased slightly with the listing of the Bolivian and Brazilian populations in 2010/2011, and remained relatively stable at around 14,000 m3 per year from 2014 to 2016. Cedrela odorata has been planted widely in parts of the region and introduced to many countries elsewhere. Although monospecific plantations have not generally been successful in the tropical Americas due to vulnerability to the Shoot Borer Hypsipyla grandella, in other regions monospecific plantations are well established. The vast majority of reported exports from plantations (\u201cartificially propagated\u201d) were from non-range States (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Ghana).

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 57 92 No exports of C. lilloi have been reported. Many of the remaining species in the genus are reported to be threatened in all or part of their range due to a combination of deforestation and targeted over- exploitation, although demand for timber of these species appears to be primarily domestic. The USA, which appears to be one of the principal importers of Cedrela, reported imports of sawn/chipped wood (HS code 4407) of unspecified Cedrela species totaling 144,663 m3 from 2007- 2018. The principal exporters were Peru (21%), C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire (18%), Ghana (15%), Bolivia (15%) and China (10%). It is not clear if exports from non-range States are re-exports or originate from plantations in those countries. Although identification manuals have been developed to differentiate the woods of certain Cedrela species, several range States have reported identification difficulties and according to one expert it is not possible to distinguish between species in the genus based on either macroscopic or microscopic characters of the wood. Analysis: Cedrela is a genus of New World trees of which C. odorata is the most widespread species. Cedrela odorata has been intensively exploited for its timber, for both domestic and international trade. Based on available data, the principal exporters of C. odorata appear to be Bolivia, Brazil, Peru, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Ghana. Although the timber of certain other species is also reported to be valuable and can be marketed interchangeably with C. odorata, it is not clear whether there is significant international demand for other species. Some populations of C. odorata and several other species are known to have been substantially reduced by the combined effects of deforestation and targeted over-exploitation. Given the estimated historic and future declines for C. odorata, and significant historic impact of international trade, the species may meet the criteria for inclusion in Appendix II set out in Annex 2a of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP 17). Given the reported identification difficulties, the remaining species in the genus would appear to meet the criteria for inclusion in Annex 2b. Other Considerations: The proposal does not include an annotation. However, the scope could be restricted using an annotation that covers the main products in trade (all populations currently included in Appendix III are covered by annotation #5). Sawn wood has been the most common product in reported international trade. Front cover photo: Rhino-horned Lizard Ceratophora stoddartii endemic to Sri Lanka by Shanaka Aravinda.

It originated from a resolution adopted at the 1963 IUCN Members\u2019 Assembly and entered into force on 1 July 1975. To ensure that CITES is effective in achieving this aim, decisions taken by the Parties to CITES need to be based on the best available scientific and technical information. This is particularly the case when deciding whether or not to include species in the CITES Appendices, transfer species between Appendix I and II, or remove them from the Appendices altogether. To assist Parties in ensuring that such decisions are evidence-based, IUCN and TRAFFIC undertake technical reviews of the proposals to amend the CITES Appendices for each of the Conference of the Parties (CoPs).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "31a72fe8-3dc9-4942-865b-b75d1d12bee3": {"__data__": {"id_": "31a72fe8-3dc9-4942-865b-b75d1d12bee3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cb99ff0443a95e0c107460d7f36535aa5d03ecd9ec853460635a91cb6c159359"}, "2": {"node_id": "169a82b9-016b-4c70-95f2-b06ba6bba93a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0220b4964d83d8be5a1dad3d7a71a0af37209237bbda805864327ab7df80ff1b"}}, "hash": "13e378f49aae50739a1f95a17ee5ce8a9976da9632f443bd579a7796d1d0b4ff", "text": "It is with great pleasure that we now produce the Analyses of the Proposals for CITES CoP18, which will take place in Colombo, Sri Lanka, in 2019.

TRAFFIC has drawn on its own expert networks and information sources on trade. The resulting document brings together a broad range of expertise, which we are confident will be of assistance to the Parties in their consideration of the proposals. For the first time, the Analyses for CoP18 not only provide an assessment of whether or not each proposal meets the criteria specified by CITES, but also summarises any additional considerations that may be relevant to the decision on whether or not to adopt the proposal. These include, for example, any potential implementation challenges, benefits or risks that may be associated with the adoption of the proposal. With unsustainable and illegal trade driving declines in many wild species (biological resource use generally is a threat to 10,647 species assessed as threatened on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species), and the collective under-performance of governments, business and civil society to halt the global decline in biodiversity, CITES has a key role to play in the next decade. Wise, evidence-based decisions that are true to the Convention\u2019s aim of ensuring that international trade is not a threat to wild species, will be needed alongside the contributions of other sectors to deliver a post-2020 decade that halts species extinctions, slows declines and promotes recovery. Dr. Jon Paul Rodr\u00edguez Chair, IUCN Species Survival Commission Dr. Thomas Brooks Chief Scientist, IUCN iii INTRODUCTION CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) was opened for signature in Washington DC on 3rd March 1973, and to date has 183 Parties from across the world. If CITES is to remain a credible instrument for conserving species affected by trade, the decisions of the Parties must be based on the best available scientific and technical information. Recognizing this, IUCN and TRAFFIC have undertaken technical reviews of the proposals to amend the CITES Appendices submitted to the Eighteenth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to CITES (CoP18). The Analyses - as these technical reviews are known - aim to provide as objective an assessment as possible of each amendment proposal against the requirements of the Convention, as agreed by Parties and laid out in the listing criteria elaborated in Resolution Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) and other relevant Resolutions and Decisions. To ensure the Analyses are as accessible as possible to all Parties, we have created a bespoke webpage where the Analyses can be downloaded individually by proposal or in full (see https://citesanalyses.iucn.org/). For each of The Analyses, a \u201cSummary\u201d section presents a synthesis of available information taken from each proposal\u2019s Supporting Statement and other sources, and a separate \u201cAnalysis\u201d paragraph provides an assessment of whether or not the proposal is considered to meet the pertinent criteria in Resolution Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) or other relevant CITES Resolutions and Decisions. In response to feedback from Parties, for the first time, an additional paragraph is included for certain proposals to summarise any \u201cAdditional considerations\u201d that may be relevant to the decision on whether or not to adopt the proposal (for example, implementation challenges and potential risks/benefits for the conservation of the species concerned). Information used to compile the \u201cSummary\u201d, \u201cAnalysis\u201d and \u201cAdditional considerations\u201d is provided in the \u201cSummary of available information\u201d section. Only information from sources other than the Supporting Statement is referenced in this section, and for brevity, these references are not repeated in the \u201cSummary\u201d, \u201cAnalysis\u201d or \u201cAdditional considerations\u201d sections. To evaluate the proposals against the CITES listing criteria, information on the status and biology of species has been collected from IUCN\u2019s Species Survival Commission Specialist Group network and the broader scientific community, and TRAFFIC has drawn on its own expert network and information sources to determine the nature and scale of any trade. Although draft versions of the \u201cSummary\u201d, \u201cAnalysis\u201d and \u201cAdditional considerations\u201d sections were shared with relevant experts for review, the conclusions drawn do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the reviewers.

Many individuals and institutions contributed to the compilation of the Analyses. Those to whom we would first like to extend our thanks are the reviewers (listed below), many of them members of the IUCN Species Survival Commission, TRAFFIC staff as well as the many other scientists and experts who have volunteered their time, data, contact list and expertise to this process. For this, we are immensely grateful. We would also like to thank Daniele and Richard Devitre for French translation, and Wendy Byrnes for Spanish translation. The Analyses team was made up of: Thomasina Oldfield, Willow Outhwaite, Lauren Brown and Simon Furnell (TRAFFIC), Patricia Cremona (IUCN), and a number of consultants including Martin Jenkins, James Stevens and David Whitehead. Alison Rosser, Steven Broad, Sabri Zain and Sara Oldfield also provided vital input when we unexpectedly needed additional capacity. Steven Broad, Richard Jenkins and Richard Thomas are thanked for their valuable input in reviewing The Analyses. Marcus Cornthwaite designed the cover. Nothando Gazi is thanked for her patience and administrative assistance. Yifu Wang provided assistance with research. Patricia Cremona led the fundraising for this project, without which it would not have been possible to undertake. All other colleagues within TRAFFIC and IUCN are thanked for their support and good humour, sugar and caffeine. Thomasina Oldfield, Willow Outhwaite and Martin Jenkins were responsible for overseeing the project. Reviewers We are very grateful to the reviewers who contributed their valuable time to this project. Reviewers were not asked to comment on IUCN/TRAFFIC\u2019s conclusion of whether each proposal met the relevant criteria (in the \u201cAnalysis\u201d paragraph), for which IUCN and TRAFFIC take sole responsibility.

large species of wild goat famed for its impressive corkscrew horns, which are sought after by trophy hunters. Capra falconeri was included in Appendix II in 1975 then transferred to Appendix I in 1992, and was classified on the IUCN Red List as Near Threatened in 2014. There are three subspecies currently recognised.

Other subspecies do not occur in Tajikistan although C. f. heptneri also occurs in the mountainous terrain of Afghanistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Regarding split-listings, Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) advises these should be avoided or, if they do occur, be on the basis of national or regional populations rather than subspecies. This Analysis assesses only the Tajik population against the criteria but takes into account information from other range States where appropriate. The largest national population of Capra falconeri heptneri is in Tajikistan: nearly 2,000 were observed in 2017 in an intensive survey which covered most of the prime habitat for C. f. heptneri in the country (Dashtijum Strictly Protected Area and a small area of the range close to the border with Afghanistan could not be surveyed for security reasons and heavy snowfall). The distribution in Tajikistan totals 1,200 km2. The two subpopulations in southern Tajikistan (likely not isolated from each other) are transboundary with Afghanistan in at least two areas (the Afghan population is low, sourced by the Tajik population), while a third isolated subpopulation is thought to consist of only a few dozen animals. Another subpopulation on the border with Uzbekistan is most likely extinct. Annual surveys indicate that the population appears to have steadily increased from 1,000 in 2012, although the figure reported in 2018 (2,650) is considered likely to be an over-estimate and the population may have reached carrying capacity in some areas. The population status varies by area: three out of seven surveyed areas reportedly had growing populations in 2017. Threats include overgrazing and disease transmission from livestock as well as poaching for meat or trophies. The management of Capra falconeri heptneri in Tajikistan is considered by some to be a good example of sustainable use leading to improved conservation outcomes. From around 2004, several traditional local hunters established small enterprises dedicated to Markhor conservation and future sustainable use. \u201cThe Mountain Ungulate Project\u201d led to the establishment of several community- based conservancies. In the 2013\u20132014 season, the government issued the first hunting quota of C. f. heptneri in Tajikistan of six permits, which increased to 12 by 2018\u20132019. Most, but not all, concessions in the subspecies\u2019 range are managed by local families. The revenue from permits, plus additional expenditure by hunters totals tens of thousands of dollars, and has the potential to generate significant revenue and benefit communities. Capra falconeri heptneri populations are said to be increasing in at least three conservancies, but concerns have been raised that in some areas unsustainable hunting is occurring and that any benefits to local people have been very limited. The subspecies is protected within Tajikistan (hunting is only allowed by special decree by the national government) and part of its range is within protected areas. Tajikistan currently has a methodology in place for calculating quotas based on minimum numbers of Capra falconeri heptneri within a conservancy (including trophy-aged males) and limits on the percentage of the population that can be hunted. Surveys are conducted every one to two years. Quotas are allocated per season and Tajikistan states that it implements an adaptive management approach. If the Tajik population is transferred to Appendix II, the proponent indicates that it will continue to set a quota, but it is not clear if the current system to calculate future offtake will continue to be employed. Problems with enforcement of the current system have been identified, including the hunting of young males below the legal trophy age. The number of trophies reported as imports from Tajikistan is lower than the number of hunting permits used. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 1 2 Analysis: The species is affected by trade: trophy hunting is permitted (based on a quota system) and successful community-based management has aided population recovery and benefited local communities.

Given concerns expressed over the sustainability and legality of some hunts under the existing quota allocation system, it is not clear that the precautionary measures for down-listing Capra falconeri heptneri to Appendix II are met. Furthermore, as two of the subpopulations are contiguous with those in Afghanistan where poaching occurs, a split listing by country may be difficult to implement. Other considerations: Successful community-based management has aided population recovery and benefited local communities. The majority of concessions have publicly stated they do not support a transfer to Appendix II (including those that have growing populations). Difficulties in obtaining import permits for trophies have been reported by some hunters, and an Appendix II listing may facilitate imports. However, legal trade in Appendix I trophies is occurring as evidenced by imports reported in the CITES Trade Database to a number of countries (including the USA and European countries) so it is not clear whether this is a significant issue, or whether the problematic imports are due to the trophies being hunted in contravention of quotas or other requirements. This issue could be addressed directly between Tajikistan and the importing countries. There may also be potential to amend Res. Conf. 10.15 (Rev. CoP14) Establishment of Quotas for Markhor Hunting Trophies (to include Tajikistan), as it currently includes quotas for Pakistan and will be discussed at CoP18 since Pakistan seeks to increase their quota. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 2 3 Transfer of Saiga Antelope Saiga tatarica from Appendix II to Appendix I Proponent: Mongolia and the USA Summary: Note: this proposal is to transfer Saiga tatarica from Appendix II to Appendix I. From the Supporting Statement it is evident that the Proponents consider this to refer to all living saiga. However, CITES adopted nomenclature recognises two separate species of saiga: Saiga borealis, endemic to Mongolia and elsewhere considered to be Saiga tatarica mongolica, and Saiga tatarica, elsewhere considered to be S. tatarica tatarica, comprising all other populations. Because proposals for species already included in the Appendices should follow CITES taxonomy, this proposal excludes Saiga borealis and only applies to the non-Mongolian populations of saiga, recognised under CITES as S. tatarica and elsewhere as S. t. tatarica. Saiga borealis was included in CITES Appendix I in 1975 as Saiga borealis mongolica, but removed from the Appendices in 1979. In 1995 Saiga tatarica was listed in Appendix II, at that time the Mongolian population was considered a subspecies of Saiga tatarica and included in that listing, but subsequent adoption of Wilson and Reeder (2005) as the CITES Standard Taxonomic Reference for mammals, including saiga, resulted in the splitting of this taxon into S. borealis and S. tatarica, a division now widely recognised to have been in error but enshrined in CITES taxonomy until a new reference is adopted. Currently, both Saiga tatarica and Saiga borealis are listed in CITES Appendix II. In this analysis information is provided on all saiga, divided where possible into the two CITES- recognised species: information from the Supporting Statement and IUCN Red List that refers to S. t. mongolica is considered as referring to S. borealis and all other populations as applying to S. tatarica. Saiga tatarica (sensu CITES) Saiga tatarica, is a nomadic herding antelope that inhabits open dry steppe grasslands and semi-arid deserts across Central Asia. There are four distinct populations: one in the Russian Federation (the Kalmykia population), and three within Kazakhstan (the Betpak-dala, Ustyurt and Ural populations). Of these, the Ural population is somewhat transboundary with Russia, while the Ustyurt population makes seasonal migrations into Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. Historically, populations of S. tatarica numbered in the millions, until excessive hunting reduced them to low thousands of individuals at the beginning of the 20th Century.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "03cc49be-c410-418a-9f61-7b0fa3b0d8af": {"__data__": {"id_": "03cc49be-c410-418a-9f61-7b0fa3b0d8af", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3ed123873402bd9cd02ffb6fddf7ddcc61eba0a9b7085d99e43d8894509b001a"}, "2": {"node_id": "be71c7fb-be8f-472e-a207-4c2c4d8097f3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9ee4e55a75ea5c6c74931ff886421eed85019dc72966fbf63eb5feec13113c41"}}, "hash": "afae309f74e07c58f087b39d42955f48d6111398fabcd2ab5051a3f262d29f40", "text": "Since then, the population has undergone large fluctuations in size.

In 2015, a bacterial infection killed more than 200,000 saiga in Kazakhstan (more than 80% of the affected population and more than 60% of the global population), within a three-week period. However, due to their high fecundity, (females mature at around eight months and usually produce twins), populations can rapidly rebound, with annual population growth in excess of 40% reported. Since the 2015 mass-die off, populations within Kazakhstan have undergone a strong recovery, increasing from 153,000 in 2017, to 215,000 in 2018. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 2 4 Saiga are traded primarily for their horn, which is used widely in Traditional Asian Medicines. Reported trade in recent years has largely been between non-range States in Asia, including China, Japan, Hong Kong SAR and Singapore, much of it declared as originating in pre-Convention stockpiles. While the range States currently prohibit all trade, horns from poached saiga also enter the market, particularly through trafficking routes to China. As only the males have horns, the selective poaching of males can skew the sex ratio, which in the early 2000s led to the reproductive collapse of the Russian population. All range States are actively engaged with saiga conservation initiatives, which are coordinated through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), in partnership with CITES. Restoring saiga populations to a point where sustainable use is possible is the long-term goal of this MoU. Saiga borealis Mongolian saiga, Saiga borealis, are endemic to Mongolia, and isolated from populations of Saiga tatarica by the Gobi Altai Mountains. This species is nationally protected, with hunting and export of all saiga strictly prohibited. It faces a range of threats including harsh climatic conditions, competition for forage with livestock, and outbreaks of disease. Longer-term population trends are hard to assess due to changes in survey methods, but in the 2000s the population recovered from very low numbers to a high of around 15,000 individuals in 2014, due to conservation efforts. Since then, an outbreak of Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) disease in 2016\u20132017 killed 54% of the population, reducing it to fewer than 5,000 individuals. A harsh winter also contributed to further declines, and by 2018 the population was an estimated 3,000 individuals. Saiga borealis is also subject to the conservation measures of the CMS MoU, which was amended to cover Saiga spp. in 2010. Analysis Saiga tatarica Saiga tatarica has a large area of distribution, its population exceeds 220,000 individuals and is currently increasing. Historical decline has been significant. In the past decade, outbreaks of disease have caused large and sudden reductions in the size of the population. Global threat assessments made only a few years ago rightly reflected negative trends observable at that time. However, the ability of populations to quickly rebound at rates exceeding 40% per year, gives the species significant resilience to such mass-mortality events. In considering trends now, despite recent fluctuations, when measured over the last three generations (around 11 years) S. tatarica has not undergone a recent marked decline and is increasing overall. National protection measures, export bans from range States and collaborative conservation actions under the CMS MoU provide a significant degree of security at present. The vast majority trade in saiga horn is believed to be derived from S. tatarica, with legal trade occurring outside the range States based on stockpiles of pre-Convention horns. Illegally sourced horns from poached animals are laundered into this market, although current levels of poaching are not considered to represent a threat to the survival of the species. Saiga borealis Saiga borealis is endemic to Mongolia. It has a small population of less than 5,000 individual that has decreased from over 14,500 since 2013/2014 due to an outbreak of disease and harsh winter conditions, although the population is subject to significant fluctuations. This decline would fall within the guidelines for marked recent declines for small populations given in Annex 5 of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev.

Summary of Available Information Text in non-italics is based on information in the Proposal and Supporting Statement (SS); text in italics is based on additional information and/or assessment of information in the SS. Taxonomy Wilson and Reeder (2005), the current CITES Standard Reference for saiga recognises two species \u2013 Saiga tatarica and Saiga borealis \u2013 and both are included in the CITES Appendices. Range Saiga tatarica: Extant (resident): Kazakhstan; Russian Federation; Uzbekistan Extant (non-breeding): Turkmenistan Extinct: China; Ukraine Saiga borealis: Mongolia IUCN Global Category Taxonomy used for the IUCN Red List treats saiga as one species: Saiga tatarica with two subspecies (see below for details). Assessments have been made for the species and both of the subspecies: Saiga tatarica tatarica (considered under CITES taxonomy as Saiga tatarica): Endangered A4abde. Assessed February 2018 (The IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group 2018b). Saiga tatarica mongolica (considered under CITES taxonomy as Saiga borealis): Endangered A4abde. Assessed February 2018 (The IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group 2018c). Saiga tatarica: (covering both species considered under CITES taxonomy): Critically Endangered A2acd* (date of assessment, February 2018). However, the IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group (2018a) add that Saiga tatarica currently does not meet the Red List Criteria for Critically Endangered and is considered to have crossed the thresholds between Critically Endangered and Endangered in 2015. However, this reassessment falls under the IUCN\u2019s five-year rule. This rule applies to taxa that appear to be genuinely improving in status, and states that \u201ca taxon may be moved from a category of higher threat to a category of lower threat if and when none of the criteria of the higher category has been met for five years or more\u201d. Saiga is considered to have crossed the thresholds between CR and EN around 2015, therefore its status will be re-evaluated again in 2020. Biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I A) Small wild population Saiga population numbers undergo fluctuations and are capable of increasing and decreasing rapidly: Saiga tatarica Data from the last three years indicates that the current population of Saiga tatarica doubled between 2016 and 2018, and now exceeds 220,000 (SCA Data, 2019). Saiga borealis In 2018, there were an estimated 3000 Saiga borealis in Mongolia (B. Chimeddorj, in litt., 2019; SCA Data, 2019). B) Restricted area of distribution Saiga tatarica IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 2 6 Saiga tatarica occurs in four populations, throughout south-eastern Europe and Central Asia.

Declines are driven by natural factors such as disease epidemics and severe weather, and by excessive hunting, while population rebounds are due to the saiga\u2019s high fecundity. Males become sexually mature at about 19 months, while females reach sexual maturity at around 8 months. Saiga are polygamous, and females exhibit a high level of fertility with two-thirds of females frequently producing twins. It is estimated that 95% of adult and 80% of young females conceive in an average year. In favourable climatic conditions, a population can increase by up to 60% in a single year (Chan et al., 1995). Very few animals in a population are more than 3.5 years old, indicating that the population is almost completely renewed after four years (Bekenov et al. 1998). Saiga tatarica Historically, herds of Saiga tatarica numbered in the millions (IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group 2018a). By the early 20th century, excessive hunting reduced them to an estimated total of low thousands (Heptner et al. 1961; Milner-Gulland, in litt., 2019). The regulation of hunting then saw their numbers recover to over 1 million by the 1980s (Data supplied by the Saiga Conservation Alliance (SCA Data) 2019). From around 1995, their populations underwent rapid declines, primarily driven by excessive poaching for both meat and horns following the collapse of the Soviet Union (IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group 2018a; SCA Data, 2019). Since then, a wide range of conservation measures have seen saiga populations first stabilise, then increase (Milner-Gulland, 2010), although regional trends differ. By January 2018 the global population of Saiga tatarica was estimated to be between 159,000 and 160,600, with the number of mature individuals estimated at 119,700 to 120,450 (IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group, 2018b). More recent estimates (based on aerial surveys in Kazhakstan and vehicle surveys in Russia), indicates that the global population further increased in 2018, to around 220,000 (SCA Data, 2019). Figure 1 shows the population data for the four subpopulations of Saiga tatarica, from 2000 to 2018. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 2 7 Fig. 1. Estimated population sizes for Saiga tatarica, 2006-2018. Data supplied by Saiga Conservation Alliance, (2019). Although trends for the different subpopulations have varied over the last three generations (with the IUCN Red List recognising 3 generations as 11 years whereas Milner-Gulland suggesting a range between 9-12 years) an overall increase in population has been observed over that time period. Between 2003 and 2015, the largest population at Betpak-dala, (Kazakhstan) grew steadily from 1,800 individuals to 242,500 (SCA Data, 2019). In 2015, an outbreak of disease caused by the bacterium Pasteurella multocida, resulted in a mass-die off in the Betpak-dala population (Kazakhstan), with >200,000 (>80% of this subpopulation, and more than half of the global population) dying within a three-week period (IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group, 2018a; E.J. Milner-Gulland, in litt., 2019). The population at Betpak-dala has, however, rebounded, increasing from around 31,300 following the die off to an estimated 76,361 in 2018, representing an annual population growth of >40% between 2016-2018 (SCA Data, 2019). The Ural population the majority of which occurs in Kazakhstan (with a proportion of the population seasonally migrating into the Russian Federation (Singh, et al., 2010)), also suffered a mass-die off due to disease in 2010, with the loss of around 12,000 animals (one-third of this subpopulation) (Dieterich & Sarsenova, 2012)This was followed a year later by a smaller die off of several hundred animals in the same location ((IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group, 2018c).

Milner-Gulland, in litt., 2019), suggest that the population at its current level may have stabilised. Saiga borealis In 1977 Saiga borealis had reportedly been reduced to the low hundreds by uncontrolled poaching (IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group, 2018c). Since then, favourable climatic conditions and active conservation measures saw its numbers increase to a peak of nearly 15,000 in 2014 (SAC Data, 2019). In 2016, the population was around 11,000 (Chimeddorj & Buuveibaatar, 2017), before an outbreak of Peste de Petits ruminants (PPR) killed 54% of the population in 2016-2017, reducing it to around 3,000 individuals in 2018, in combination with a harsh winter and poor grazing (B. Chimeddorj, in litt., 2019; 2019; SCA Data, 2019). Population estimates for Saiga borealis from two sources are shown in Figure 2. As survey effort and methods vary (for example, surveys may be conducted from ground vehicles or aircraft), figures between the two are not directly comparable. Best available estimates from official Saiga Conservation Alliance data are indicated by solid bars, with other estimates compiled by Chimeddorj and Buuveibaatar (2017) indicated by hatched bars. Fig. 2. Population estimates for Saiga borealis, 2006-2018. As indicated by figure 2, despite a variety of methods having been used to generate the population estimates, it is apparent that Saiga borealis currently has a small population of <5,000 individuals. The population has also undergone a recent marked decline of well over 20% over the last 2 generations (6-8 years), to an estimated 3,000 individuals in 2018. Annex 5 of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) gives a general guideline for marked recent decline where the population is small as a percentage decline of 20% or more in the last 5 years or 2 generations (whichever is the longer). However, as seen from recoveries from similarly small populations in 2008, Saiga numbers can recover swiftly. Trade criteria for inclusion in Appendix I The species is or may be affected by trade Legal trade can occur through the use of stockpiles of horn legally acquired before range State export bans came into force (UNEP, 2015), and which are predominantly comprised of S. tatarica (E.J.

The main trading countries/territories are China, Hong Kong SAR, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and Viet Nam (CITES, 2018b), where the most commonly used saiga horn products include bottled \u2018fresh\u2019 saiga water, shavings, bottled \u2018supermarket\u2019 saiga water, and tablets. In 2006, Singapore reported a horn stockpile of around 33,000 tonnes, which had fallen to an estimated \u201cless than 20,000 tonnes\u2019\u2019 by 2015 (Theng & Krishnasamy, 2017).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6057ae9a-893f-40f6-8188-913c7f80c0c1": {"__data__": {"id_": "6057ae9a-893f-40f6-8188-913c7f80c0c1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c09a19a1ea81c3444f03d78ac5c52fef5733b7d5ce149f32ed787fb0c99db459"}, "2": {"node_id": "6691e468-9a63-4086-bc13-0640b3ee18de", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "60737433854368648820542c718f994e2f8ae09a52808081e3ac23be40a2c5b6"}}, "hash": "04e26daab29ff1618730edd78e0958696724ad27b46aa347169dba586fb18d35", "text": "According to an analysis conducted by UNEP-WCMC of reported trade in specimens of saiga for 2007-2016, legal international trade in horns and derivatives appears to have declined over the last decade, while trade in 2,860 3,240 3,169 8,016 6,846 10,230 14,600 13,824 9,929 4,961 4,938 7,221 3,240 14,869 5,000 3000 0 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 10,000 12,000 14,000 16,000 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Estimates from Data supplied by the Saiga Conservation Alliance (SCA, 2019).

Additional Information Threats The range of both species places them at risk of climatic extremes, including summer droughts and severe winters (IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group, 2018a). A severe winter in 2018 negatively impacted the population of S. borealis, and another harsh winter is expected in 2019, exacerbated by the poor condition of grazing pastures following a dry summer (Webwire, 2019). The development of infrastructure including fences, roads and railways can also negatively impact saiga movement and migrations. Saiga rarely cross railway tracks, and the projected expansion of road and train networks in Kazakhstan and Mongolia may therefore pose a serious threat to some populations in future. The greatest cause of mortality over the last 3-5 years, however, has been from outbreaks of disease, which cause mass mortality events (MME) (E.J. Milner-Gulland, in litt., 2019), the impacts of which are described above. The 2015 MME that affected the Bepak-Dala population, was caused by the bacterium Pasteurella multocida type B, which is also carried by livestock and causes hemorrhagic septicaemia (Kock et al., 2018). The pre-conditions that lead to outbreaks of P. multocida are not yet understood, but climatic factors may play a role, which may be exacerbated in future by changing environmental conditions, with projected increases in temperature, precipitation and humidity in Kazakhstan potentially increasing the prevalence of such pathogens (Kock et al., 2018). The saiga\u2019s unusually high birth rate, however, means that populations can recover rapidly from these events (see discussion of recent population trends above). The geographic isolation of different populations of Saiga tatarica makes it highly unlikely that they could all be affected be disease at the same time, but the potentially severe impacts upon individual populations underlines the importance of improving the viability of each, to act as an insurance policy against this threat (Milner-Gulland, 2015). The 2016-17 MME that killed 54% of the population of S. borealis was caused by the virus peste des petits ruminants (known as PPR, or \u201cgoat plague\u201d), which was transmitted by livestock (E.J. Milner-Gulland, in litt., 2019). Both species also face anthropogenic pressures and are threatened by habitat loss and degradation through conversion of land for agricultural use and livestock grazing. Loss of habitat to grazing livestock land is also problematic because livestock can transmit diseases and parasites to saiga.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "316afd3c-700f-41b7-9283-f151c0aacd4d": {"__data__": {"id_": "316afd3c-700f-41b7-9283-f151c0aacd4d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e05cafbdc65006a4054b241e92ad5d3e53722bfdb2eb6644ff1227dca5f1d974"}, "2": {"node_id": "5a815c99-c815-4407-b341-2fd5f1d8d479", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b33ae78b450a02741aa539d7b62bc5c7ee5099d047ae2350f01bd1ada51ee75c"}}, "hash": "e73d87d2d26bd0ec4e8a12d08818049461b2c9ee02e4837f745768bef879b75b", "text": "The habitat of Saiga borealis in Mongolia is described as severely fragmented (National Report for Mongolia, 2015), but recent range expansion occurred prior to the PPR outbreak in 2016 (D.

Zuther, in litt., 2019). Saiga are also illegally hunted for their meat (for local consumption (CITES, 2016)), and horns, which are perceived to cure many diseases within Traditional Asian Medicine. In a study of Russian and Kazakhstan communities, K\u00fchl et al. (2009) found that this illegal exploitation was closely linked to levels of poverty and unemployment. Saiga are protected in all range States but the level of enforcement varies. Anti-poaching efforts in Kazakhstan and other countries have been intensified over the last 10 years (IUCN Antelope Specialist Group, 2018a). All populations of Saiga tatarica have been heavily impacted by poaching, the incidence of which dramatically increased during the 1990s following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the opening of the Chinese-Soviet border (Milner-Gulland, 2003). Poaching continues and authorities make regular seizures of horn (see trade section above). Despite the regularity of poaching incidents, however, the available evidence does not suggest that the current levels of illegal exploitation are a significant threat to the future of the Saiga tatarica as a species (D. Mallon, in litt., 2019; E.J. Milner-Gulland, in litt., 2019). Saiga borealis is also targeted by poachers (IUCN Antelope Specialist Group, 2018c). According to national police and ranger patrol data in Mongolia, a total of 27 cases involving the poaching of 231 saiga were recorded during 2005-2017, with the number of poached saiga peaking in 2013 (Chimeddorj & Buuveibaatar, 2019). Two poaching cases (involving 16 saiga) in the period 2010-15 were reported by the National Report for Mongolia (2015). As poachers often target males for their horns, this selective offtake can also skew the sex ratios of both species. As saiga are harem breeders, this can have a significant impact upon the reproductive success of populations (Milner-Gulland, 2003). In the late 1990s, heavy poaching of male saiga within the Russian Pre-Caspian population resulted in a lowering of female fecundity, leading to reproductive collapse (Milner-Gulland, et al., 2003). In recent years, however, while the proportion of males in many populations remains low, it is currently thought to be sufficient to maintain a normal level of reproduction (S. Zuther, in litt., 2019). Conservation, management and legislation The saiga is legally protected in all countries of its breeding range, and hunting is not permitted in all five range States, at least until 2020. The export of all saiga products from range States is also prohibited (CITES, 2016). The range of both species partially falls within a number of protected areas, but for most populations, protected areas do not cover the entire year-round range of this highly migratory species (S. Michel, in litt., 2019). Population monitoring has involved the joint initiatives of a range of conservation organisations, and includes aerial surveys of Saiga tatarica in Kazakhstan, and ground surveys and satellite collaring of Saiga borealis in Mongolia. In Russia, since 2006, surveys have been undertaken by ground-based vehicles, although these are not performed annually (E.J. Milner-Gulland, in litt., 2019; SCA Data, 2019). Saiga range States have implemented several conservation measures, including investment in new protected areas, ranger teams, training and anti-poaching initiatives, to improve population status (D. Mallon, in litt., 2019). The Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), in collaboration with CITES, developed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), with an associated Medium-Term International Work Programme (MTIWP) updated on a five-yearly basis (Milner-Gulland, in litt., 2019), that provided a non-legally binding instrument for the conservation of saiga, which has been signed by all saiga range States.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cfe3b9b2-659f-452a-b20b-2eced0452235": {"__data__": {"id_": "cfe3b9b2-659f-452a-b20b-2eced0452235", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "238bdce6abb0c636f3b335750de15c82f2156cf0a18e2ccb579d95a78f41c69b"}, "2": {"node_id": "61892577-72be-4a60-93f4-99516116d9f5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4a10c7469ff53549b682c8d3db673710fe19e1cf6a8a03a5cd8f67e190312991"}}, "hash": "23645295d1a958b2b2ed0590db1358f8b9aebf5d9b90dd98d9129396eabdc4bb", "text": "Ten international conservation organisations have signed on as cooperating organisations, committing to working towards implementing the MTIWP (Milner-Gulland, in litt., 2019), which includes improving and increasing population monitoring; improving protected area networks; reducing poaching; creating alternative livelihoods; captive breeding; and raising awareness at all levels. Furthermore, in 2014, 14 Asian countries agreed to the development of the Central Asian Mammals Initiative (CAMI) under the CMS. In 2017, CMS, under the MOU, created the first database of Central Asian migration routes, along with planned and constructed infrastructure.

Potential risk(s) of a transfer from Appendix II to I The long-term goal of the CMS Saiga MoU is to restore Saiga spp. populations to a point where sustainable use is again possible (MTIWP, 2015; CITES, 2018b), and listing Saiga tatarica in Appendix I would impede some aspects of this goal (D.

Cambridge, UK IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 3 13 Transfer of the Vicu\u00f1a Vicugna vicugna population of the Province of Salta (Argentina) from Appendix I to Appendix II with annotation 1 Proponent: Argentina Summary: The Vicu\u00f1a is a South American member of the camelid family that produces high- quality wool. Populations were heavily depleted by hunting in the mid-20th century to supply wool fibre for export, the species was consequently listed in Appendix I in 1975. Following a rapid recovery of the species, some populations in Peru and far northern Chile were transferred to Appendix II to allow the export of appropriately labelled fabric woven from wool fibre sheared from live animals. Other populations have followed suit, including ones in Argentina and Bolivia and a small introduced population in Ecuador. The current conditions for export, which regulate how the fibre should be harvested and labelled for export, are set out in annotation 1. In 2018 the global Vicu\u00f1a population was estimated at approximately half a million animals. The species is currently classified by IUCN as Least Concern. The Argentinian Vicu\u00f1a population was estimated at between 73,000 and 127,000 individuals in 2006 (dependent on the census method). Wild populations occur in five provinces: Catamarca, Jujuy, La Rioja, Salta and San Juan. Populations in Jujuy and Catamarca were transferred to Appendix II in 1987 and 2003 respectively. Semi-captive populations in all provinces, including that in Salta Province, are all also currently included in Appendix II. The current proposal is to transfer the wild population of Salta to Appendix II. In Argentina, this would leave only the small wild populations of La Rioja and San Juan listed in Appendix I. The wild population in Salta Province in 2018 was estimated at just under 60,000, compared with around 30,000 in 2013. Suitable habitat within the extent of occurrence in Salta is calculated to be around 26,000 km2, population densities vary considerably within this area. The species is covered by a range of national and provincial laws and regulations and is present in protected areas, including the \u201cLos Andes\u201d faunal reserve in the south-west of Salta, which protects around 40% of Vicu\u00f1a habitat in the province. Analysis: The Vicu\u00f1a population of Salta Province, Argentina, does not meet the biological criteria for retention in Appendix I \u2013 its population is large, increasing and distributed over a large area. The species is in trade and in this regard is intended to be managed in the same way as the adjacent and contiguous populations of Jujuy and Catamarca Provinces, also in Argentina.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f456ad4-3926-42aa-ac7a-5ca8389e1cef": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f456ad4-3926-42aa-ac7a-5ca8389e1cef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4637b0dcaffa510411c9cfcb6fdb0a53162de7600d703cbb117ef8640dac6c38"}, "2": {"node_id": "f90e0066-98e7-441a-9c7c-984b3de746c1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f7766999b283818761ce247c436309e30bd33958e9426cb6dc5a3f5da9fddc63"}}, "hash": "c8048455f5ea55b66c23e259ffc079057f4f5901946b11345c16488a60f102ec", "text": "These have been included in Appendix II for over 20 and over 15 years respectively with no evident problems.

Wild populations occur in five provinces: Catamarca, Jujuy, La Rioja, Salta and San Juan. C) Decline in number of wild individuals According to a 2018 survey, the population Vicu\u00f1a in Salta Province doubled between 2013 and 2018 (see small wild population above). Trade criteria for inclusion in Appendix I The species is or may be affected by trade There is international demand for Vicu\u00f1a. In the period 2000 to 2017 according to the CITES Trade Database (2019), Argentina reported the direct export of ca. five tonnes (5,100 kg) of hair, fibre, skins and cloth: around 80% sourced from the wild. In Argentina, 245 kg of fibre were harvested from live animals by local communities in 2016 while a private international company obtained 980 kg, from a total of 2,754 Vicu\u00f1as; 143 kg of fibre were obtained from captive Vicu\u00f1as and 1,762 kg of fibre exported (Acebes et al., 2018) (it is assumed that these refer to semi-captive populations). Precautionary Measures Species likely to be in demand for trade, but its management is such that the CoP will be satisfied with: A) Implementation by the range States of the requirements of the Convention, in particular Article IV; and B) appropriate enforcement controls and compliance with the requirements of the Convention Export quota or other special measure The population is intended to be covered by existing annotation number 1 which applies to all other Appendix-II Vicu\u00f1a populations: 1 For the exclusive purpose of allowing international trade in fibre from vicu\u00f1as (Vicugna vicugna) and their derivative products, only if the fibre comes from the shearing of live vicu\u00f1as. Trade in products derived from the fibre may only take place in accordance with the following provisions: a) Any person or entity processing vicu\u00f1a fibre to manufacture cloth and garments must request authorization from the relevant authorities of the country of origin (Countries of origin: The countries where the species occurs, that is, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador and Peru) to use the \"vicu\u00f1a country of origin\" wording, mark or logo adopted by the range States of the species that are signatories to the Convention for the Conservation and Management of the Vicu\u00f1a. b) Marketed cloth or garments must be marked or identified in accordance with the following provisions: i) For international trade in cloth made from live-sheared vicu\u00f1a fibre, whether the cloth was produced within or outside of the range States of the species, the wording, mark or logo must be used so that the country of origin can be identified. The VICU\u00d1A [COUNTRY OF ORIGIN] wording, mark or logo has the format as detailed below: This wording, mark or logo must appear on the reverse side of the cloth. In addition, the selvages of the cloth must bear the words VICU\u00d1A [COUNTRY OF ORIGIN]. ii) For international trade in garments made from live-sheared vicu\u00f1a fibre, whether the garments were produced within or outside of the range States of the species, the wording, mark or logo indicated in paragraph b) i) must be used. This wording, mark or logo must appear on a label on the garment itself. If the garments are produced outside of the country of origin, the name of the country where the garment was produced should also be indicated, in addition to the wording, mark or logo referred to in paragraph b) i). c) For international trade in handicraft products made from live-sheared vicu\u00f1a fibre produced within the range States of the species, the VICU\u00d1A [COUNTRY OF ORIGIN] - ARTESAN\u00cdA wording, mark or logo must be used as detailed below: d) If live-sheared vicu\u00f1a fibre from various countries of origin is used for the production of cloth and garments, the wording, mark or logo of each of the countries of origin of the fibre must be indicated, as detailed in paragraphs b) i) and ii). e) All other specimens shall be deemed to be specimens of species listed in Appendix I and the trade in them shall be regulated accordingly IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "653ffb49-2764-4f1d-9aaf-da9d5e5e4d66": {"__data__": {"id_": "653ffb49-2764-4f1d-9aaf-da9d5e5e4d66", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9543d7b3ea020037673d1b1f98218571727731090524d27cbc9fa1802a9c780d"}, "2": {"node_id": "cae55e43-300b-4878-8ec6-248c5a3c208c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a8f9012e080a62c3c7d884296034cb3b304cd798fa06c2d3da02b9080dd8c021"}}, "hash": "84189c216d9438a404d5471752f4687e85262b0b60c5de090aca804ed75930cb", "text": "3 15 In the CITES Trade Database there is generally very good agreement between quantities reported by Argentina and those reported by importing countries, indicating a well-functioning control system.

The species is affected by competition for grazing by domestic livestock and by some human-wildlife conflict from pastoralists who regard the species as a competitor. There is also some illegal killing for fibre for domestic markets. However, it is not regarded as threatened in Salta Province or in Argentina or in its wider range as a whole (Acebes et al., 2018). Conservation, management and legislation There are several conventions and laws, international, national and provincial that protect the Vicu\u00f1a and regulate the trade in live animals, as well as the products and by-products obtained from this species. Due to the adoption of the federal government system, Argentina has regulated wildlife resource use at two levels, a provincial level and a national level. Resource use and trade of Vicu\u00f1a is protected nationally under Article 124 of the National Constitution (modified in 1994), the National Law of the Conservation of Wild Fauna No. 22.421 its regulatory Decree 666/97 and under Article 1947 of the Civil and Commercial Code of the Nation Law 26.994. Provincially, the Vicu\u00f1a is protected under the Law of the Province of Salta No 6.709/93, a Cooperation Agreement between the former General Directorate of Renewable Natural Resources, the current Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development and the VII \u201cSalta\u201d Group of the National Gendarmerie and the Law of the Province of Salta 7.070/99 of Environment and 5.513/79 of the Protection of Fauna. Internationally, the Vicu\u00f1a is protected under the Agreement for the Conservation and Management of the Vicu\u00f1a, which Argentina became a signatory of in 1971, other member states include Bolivia, Peru, Chile and Ecuador. Conservation measures include the creation of numerous protected areas in all countries that cover the distribution of the Vicu\u00f1a, the development of joint strategies among signatory countries to control poaching and prohibit the export of fertile animals or other reproductive material and avoid breeding this species for commercial purposes outside of its range. The wild population of Jujuy was transferred to Appendix II of CITES in 1997 and that of Catamarca in 2003 and semi-captive populations of all provinces, including the semi-captive population of the Salta Province, are also currently included in Appendix II. Other comments The proposal notes that Vicu\u00f1a management will be performed by local indigenous communities from Andes, La Poma, Rosario de Lerma, Santa Victoria and Iruya departments who initiated an organizational process for the development of local conservation plans (PCL), in territories where land tenure is communal. The technical accompaniment in this process is in charge of an interdisciplinary and inter-institutional team of national and provincial organisms: Undersecretary of Family Agriculture, Secretariat of Environment and Sustainable Development of Salta and the National Institute of Agricultural Technology. The involvement of local communities for Vicu\u00f1a conservation and management is key in such a vast area as the Puna (G. Lichtenstein, in litt., 2019).

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 5 17 Inclusion of Giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis in Appendix II Proponents: Central African Republic, Chad, Kenya, Mali, Niger and Senegal Summary: The Giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis is the world's tallest land mammal. It remains widespread across Southern and Eastern Africa, with smaller isolated populations in West and Central Africa. Nine subspecies are currently recognised, with each subspecies associated with particular sub-regions and/or range States. In 2016, based on evidence of declines of 36\u201340% over three generations (30 years, 1985\u20132015), the IUCN Red List assessment was revised from Least Concern to Vulnerable. The best available estimates indicate a total population in 1985 of around 152,000\u2013163,000 Giraffes (106,000\u2013114,000 mature individuals), and in 2015 a total population of 98,000 Giraffes (68,000 mature individuals). The main factors responsible for this decline are recognised as habitat loss, illegal hunting (poaching), civil unrest and ecological changes. The presence and severity of these threats, and the conservation strategies used to manage Giraffe populations, show large regional variations. In Central and Eastern Africa, Giraffes have suffered the greatest declines. Despite national protection, threats including habitat loss and illegal hunting\u2014particularly for meat and some traditional uses\u2014have severely reduced some populations over the last 30\u201340 years. These include declines of Reticulated Giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis reticulata native to Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia) of between 56% and 67%, Kordofan Giraffe (G. c. antiquorum native to Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), South Sudan) of 85% and Nubian Giraffe (G. c. camelopardalis native to Ethiopia, South Sudan) of 97%. In other regions, however, particularly in Southern Africa, Giraffe populations have undergone large increases in size. These include the Angolan Giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis angolensis native to Botswana and Namibia) of 195%, and the South African Giraffe (G. c. giraffa native to Botswana, Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe) of 167%. Available international trade data are restricted to USA import data, which along with Europe is considered a major market for trophies. Between 2006 and 2015, around 3,500 Giraffe trophies were imported to the USA, among around 40,000 total Giraffe specimens (largely bone products). Ninety- four percent of these products (and 98% of trophies) were exported by South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe, where trophy hunting is legal. There is no evidence to suggest exports from these countries were sourced from Giraffes illegally killed elsewhere. Non-trophy products are generally sourced from the trophy hunting industry, from natural deaths, or from animals culled or hunted for meat. Conservation measures in both Namibia and South Africa have been associated with an increase in Giraffe populations over the last 30 years.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "44a6c66b-9484-4913-903a-4a08a29e7afe": {"__data__": {"id_": "44a6c66b-9484-4913-903a-4a08a29e7afe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "909f02e87859edfec0825f5352b8d595d775dac3e7043c29609b7b6fba230758"}, "2": {"node_id": "7b2f0bf6-33dd-434c-9912-fdbcf1e0b1de", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a96dac24163e742d6370e3f76d86bedab15eaf90480d5927781a1369b1e6743b"}}, "hash": "935caedc5aea1c9f812be995dc56b4bb423028b909b9effa2025b22940d25e3e", "text": "While concerns have been raised over the management of Giraffe populations in Zimbabwe, which declined by 70% from around 26,000 in 1998 to 8,000 in 2016, this appears largely attributable to land reform programmes which have seen the conversion of land to agriculture, and an increase in poaching for local consumption. As the annual offtake for trophy hunting is less than 150 Giraffes (<2% of the population), this is considered unlikely to be negatively affecting Giraffe populations within Zimbabwe. In some regions of Central and Eastern Africa, the illegal trade in Giraffe meat is known to cross porous borders, particularly where militia are in operation, while a transboundary trade in tail hairs may also occur, following centuries-long traditions. In some regions of Africa, Giraffe products, including Giraffe hair bracelets, have been recorded within tourist markets and may therefore be exported.

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 5 18 The poaching that has contributed to the decline of many Giraffe populations does therefore not appear to be driven by trophy hunting. The current levels of utilisation for trophy hunting in Southern Africa do not appear to be negatively impacting its regional populations of Giraffe, which overall are increasing. Analysis: Although the Giraffe has experienced population declines of 36\u201340% over the last three generations, with illegal hunting having contributed to these declines, there is little evidence to suggest that the poaching of Giraffe is driven by international trade, rather it is for local/domestic use. The main populations that are subject to legal offtake for international trade are in Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, where the hunting of Giraffe, mainly for trophies, and export is permitted, and populations are generally increasing, except in Zimbabwe where declines have not been attributed to international trade. On this basis, it is not clear that regulation of trade is necessary a) to avoid the species becoming eligible for inclusion in Appendix I in the near future or b) to ensure that the harvest of specimens from the wild is not reducing the wild population to a level at which its survival might be threatened by continued harvesting or other influences. Regulation of international trade would also not address the principal threats affecting this species, with habitat loss, illegal hunting for either domestic use or to supply markets across porous borders within Africa, civil unrest and ecological changes, being the main causes of the observed decline in Giraffe.

Taxonomy Wilson and Reeder (2005) (the current CITES Standard Taxonomic Reference for mammals) and the IUCN Red List currently recognise a single species, Giraffa camelopardalis. Nine subspecies are also currently recognised, based on morphology (see Table 1). Recently, several authors have proposed more than one species be recognised. For example, based on genetic analysis, Fennessy et al., (2016a) and Winter et al., (2018) proposed four species, indicating that the taxonomic status of Giraffes may change in the near future. Range Native: Angola; Botswana; Cameroon; Central African Republic; Chad; Congo; Democratic Republic of the Congo; Ethiopia; Kenya; Mozambique; Namibia; Niger; Somalia; South Africa; South Sudan; Tanzania, United Republic of; Uganda; Zambia; Zimbabwe. Regionally extinct: Eritrea; Guinea; Mali; Mauritania; Nigeria; Senegal. Introduced: Eswatini; Rwanda (Muller et al., 2018; J.

CoP17) Annex 2a) A) Trade regulation needed to prevent future inclusion in Appendix I B) Regulation of trade required to ensure that harvest from the wild is not reducing population to level where survival might be threatened by continued harvest or other influence Giraffa camelopardalis was assessed in 2016 as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List due to an observed, past (and ongoing) population decline of 36\u201340% over three generations (30 years, 1985\u20132015). The best available estimates indicate a total population in 1985 of 151,702\u2013163,452 Giraffes (106,191\u2013114,416 mature individuals), and in 2015 a total population of 97,562 Giraffes (68,293 mature individuals) (Muller et al., 2018). In 2010, Giraffa camelopardalis was Least Concern. The pattern of population trends across Africa is not uniform, with some Giraffe populations stable or increasing, while others are in decline (Muller et al., 2018). Each of these populations is subject to threats, conservation management strategies and levels of utilisation that are specific to their range State or region.

As Giraffa camelopardalis is not listed within CITES, the only available data detailing imports of Giraffe products originates from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Law Enforcement Management Information System trade database (LEMIS). The following section draws on the information in the SS as well as our own rapid assessment of LEMIS data from 2006\u20132014. Note the time period differs by a year. The USA is probably one of the major destinations for trophies but Europe is also likely to be a key destination.

Of these, 99.7% were classified as wild sourced (39,397 of 39,516). The proposal states that of these USA imports, around 95% were for hunting trophy purposes.

However, no import or export data are available for the levels of trade into Europe. Between 2016 and 2018, volunteers conducted research into online markets in Europe with the following results. Within European Union (EU) countries, the most numerous Giraffe products available for sale online were: bone scales (170), knives with bone handles (82), bone carvings (10), skins (10), taxidermy busts (9), skulls (6), chef\u2019s knives with bone handles (6), and skin pieces (4). As import data are lacking however, the provenance and age of these items remains unknown: - Belgium (search conducted 30th July 2018): 10 products including full body taxidermy, taxidermy busts, bone knife handles. - France (13th and 14th June 2018): 58 Giraffe products, including 48 bone knife handles, one bone, one pen with a bone part, one set of four Giraffe feet taxidermy, one table featuring four Giraffe legs, two skulls, two revolvers with bone grips, one skin and one pair of bone scales. - Germany (7th July 2018): 51 Giraffe products, including seven raw bones, seven full skins, four skin pieces, two taxidermy busts, one tail, one hoof, two taxidermy heads, four skulls, three pairs of bone scales, six knives with bone handles, one table featuring four Giraffe legs, 10 bone carvings, and one pen with a Giraffe bone part. - Greece (30th July 2018): One Giraffe product\u2014a knife with a bone handle. - Italy (30th July 2018): 18 Giraffe products, including seven knives with bone handles, one taxidermy bust (trophies), two sets of bone scales, two chef\u2019s knives with bone handles, and one large hunting knife with a bone handle. - Spain (11th July 2018): 171 Giraffe products being sold by sellers based in Spain, including seven knives with bone handles, 163 sets of bone scales, and one full skin. - United Kingdom (23rd July 2018): 21 Giraffe products being sold by sellers based in the United Kingdom, including 11 knives with bone handles, four chef\u2019s knives with bone handles, three taxidermy busts (trophies), one pair of bone scales, one full hide, and one hair bracelet.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f2b099d3-f5dc-4eb6-9f4a-35c02265bf94": {"__data__": {"id_": "f2b099d3-f5dc-4eb6-9f4a-35c02265bf94", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2fd5fbc60ce90e30b04c01571b75b18631f5e5d62721f8a67cc0fe64d4e96e79"}, "2": {"node_id": "8289a566-8420-4314-bd7f-03e60a9737d7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a3aee70c69f9488d8b85a296322165b4a3a30caa0319c1c02d7fb5a3f964d4b7"}}, "hash": "4d2f07aab55c1bb22566db3a7610ff1928bf01528604d8c373ae7d631acfd24e", "text": "Transboundary trade within Africa: Some transboundary trade in Giraffe products, particularly meat, has been recorded in Central Africa, which is likely to have had a significant negative impact on some populations of Giraffe, including the Critically Endangered Kordofan Giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis antiquorum (Fennessy & Marais, 2018; Ondoua et al., 2017). This cross-border trade in wild meat is thought frequently to result from civil unrest and the action of militias and highly-militarised poachers (see Nouredine, 2012, in Marais et al., 2013; Ondoua et al., 2017), although a small trade in Giraffe tail hairs may also occur, following centuries long traditions (J. Fennessy, in litt., 2019). Okello et al., (2015), also states that poaching of Maasi Giraffe G. c. tippelskirchi occurs within borderland regions of Kenya and Tanzania, with Giraffe meat transported on donkeys across borders to market places and other demand areas for sale. Other examples include trade between Central African Republic and South Sudan/Chad (Bouche et al., 2009); between Cameroon and Chad/Nigeria (see IUCN PACO 2011, as cited in Marias et al., 2013); and within the Garamba-Bili-Chinko landscape of the Demographic Republic of the Congo and Central African", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a6691ada-5f74-406b-ba6f-bbd2dd03caec": {"__data__": {"id_": "a6691ada-5f74-406b-ba6f-bbd2dd03caec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "602b8ad5173652a780fcb5e1b24022277eafdfb2c3d59998d43d943b6b377b52"}, "3": {"node_id": "9d0af333-441c-4edc-9f3c-b4ad9002a9cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c735a4d84e3436eb6565f2eb4e2a517e5f1b6880aa76083d07fbea1582577523"}}, "hash": "1900e821f05b76bd60a204449f0ff5386e9b187a68e62726747adbc306228cca", "text": "Republic (Ondoua et al., 2017). However, as this trade in meat operates across highly porous borders, it seems extremely unlikely that a CITES listing would result in any additional enforcement effort being directed at controlling this illegal activity. Crosmary (in litt., 2019) also notes that in countries where trophy hunting is legal, \u201cmeat and other body parts may be distributed or sold to villagers after the trophy hunts. It is possible that some of these body parts are also sold into neighbouring countries, as happens with other trophy hunted species such as lions\u201d. Provenance of Giraffes in international trade: The SS suggests that the possibility exists for parts and derivatives from illegally hunted Giraffe to enter established legal trading routes. However, research into the trade in Giraffe products has been limited (J. Fennessy in litt., 2019). Many parts and derivatives entering the legal trade are thought to be sourced from the trophy hunting industry itself. Wolfson (2018), found evidence of trophy hunting by-products being sold on to taxidermists and outfitters, and describes how virtually every part of the animal is utilised to make products for sale, which are marketed to sellers in the USA. The Management Authority of Zimbabwe (in litt., 2019), also confirms that \u201cmost parts and derivatives in international sale are sourced from the trophy hunting industry.\u2019\u2019 Giraffe parts and derivatives entering legal trade are also from animals acquired via other sources, including natural deaths, and Giraffes killed by collisions with low power lines (Management Authority Zimbabwe, in litt., IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 5 22 2019). It is also likely that Giraffe parts identified for sale may come from Giraffes that have been culled or killed for meat (J. Fennessy in litt., 2019). This does not however, imply that illegally killed giraffe are entering trade. As Fennessy (in litt., 2019), notes, \u201cthe misinterpretation that it is all about trophy hunting is inaccurate\u2019\u2019, but \u201cwithout any additional information, it is assumed that all products come originally (and legally) from Southern Africa.\u201d A small number of products may enter international trade through tourist markets, with, for example, Giraffe hair bracelets found for sale in Maputo, Mozambique (TRAFFIC, 2002), and bone products sold at tourist markets in Namibia (Du Raan et al., 2016). However, Crosmary (in litt., 2019), reports that \u201cin East Africa, at least in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, there is no evidence of any significant international trade, and for the other regions, there is no information.\u2019\u2019 Trade in live Giraffes: A trade in live specimens also exists, between game ranches in Southern Africa, and also between Africa and Asia (J. Fennessy in litt., 2019), and which may be greater than previously assumed (J. Fennessy in litt., 2019). Deacon and Parker (2016), note that South African Giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis giraffa) have been moved from South Africa to Zambia and Senegal, while Angolan Giraffes (G. c. angolensis) have been transferred from Namibia and Botswana to South Africa. Without accurate data, however, the impact of live trade on Giraffe populations cannot accurately be assessed. Fennessy (in litt., 2019) notes that live Giraffes are not imported from East, Central or West Africa into Southern Africa, and as such the possibility that these populations are entering the trophy hunting industry is not a concern. Impacts of Trade Trophy prices range from USD 2,500\u20138000 in South Africa, USD 1,800\u20133,100 in Namibia, and USD 3,200 in Zimbabwe. The overall cost of a hunt is, however, much higher, and Giraffes are not usually the primary target, and instead are an additionally hunted species (J. Fennessy in litt., 2019).

Data from a sample of 13 formally protected areas with long-term data over at least two generations show an estimated increase for those sampled populations of 54% (Deacon & Parker, 2016). Zimbabwe: In Zimbabwe, Giraffes are found in State-owned protected areas, private and communal land (ZPWMA, 2019). Giraffe populations in Zimbabwe declined by 70% from around 26,000 in 1998, to 8,000 in 2016 (Fennessy et al., 2016b), but this appears largely attributable to Land Reform programmes which have seen the conversion of wildlife producing land to agriculture, and an increase in poaching for local consumption (Bond et al., 2004; Degeorges & Reilly, 2007; Williams et al., 2016). The population is reported to be increasing in parts of southern and western Zimbabwe (ZPWMA, 2019) although no recent assessments have been undertaken (Deacon & Parker, 2016; J. Fennessy, in litt., 2019). The Zimbabwe Management Authority states that the current annual trophy quota within Zimbabwe is for 800 Giraffes (10% of the population). These are, however, optional rather than fixed quotas, and around 150 (<2% of the population) permits per year are actually utilised. The <2% offtake is unlikely to be a significant factor affecting the population, and there is no evidence to suggest that the reduction in Zimbabwe\u2019s Giraffe population over the last two decades is attributable to international trade (J. Fennessy, in litt., 2019). Trophy imports to the USA in Table 2 above showed an average of 92 over the years 2006\u20132014. For all hunted species in Zimbabwe, the hunting of mature old males is recommended, and if young males are harvested, the operators are penalised (Zimbabwe Scientific Authority, in litt., 2019). In a 2019 Giraffe status report, the Zimbabwe Parks and Management Authority also states that Giraffe are valued as \u201can attractive IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 5 23 species in photographic safaris\u2019\u2019 and that efforts are being made to research the conservation status of the species and to ensure long-term monitoring of population trends. Namibia: In Namibia, Giraffes mainly exist in protected areas, which may be public, private or communal (Du Raan et al., 2016), and are valued as a popular species on private game farms because of their high tourism value (MET, 2019). While a lack of standardised methods has created challenges in calculating population estimates, Fennessy (2004) estimated the population of Giraffes in Namibia to be around 5,000 individuals (although a national wildlife inventory completed in 2004 estimated it at 10,415 individuals (Barnes et al., 2009)). The current population of Giraffes in Namibia is estimated to be around 12,000 animals of which 6,500 occur on privately owned land, 2,000 on communal land, and 3,500 within national parks (Du Raan et al., 2016). The population is thought to be increasing on all land types (J. Fennessy, in litt., 2019), with above average rainfall and increased conservation awareness and monitoring thought to have contributed to this observed increase in numbers (MET, 2019). With regard to trophy hunting, the Namibian Ministry of Environment and Tourism reports that the country has a well-established and strictly controlled wildlife utilisation system, i.e. no person may hunt any species without a permit (MET, 2019). They also report that between 2010 and 2017, a total of 1,115 Giraffes have been trophy hunted in Namibia, at an average of 139 Giraffe per year. Of these 1,115 animals, 96% (n = 1,068) were reportedly hunted on private land, and 4% (n = 47) on State land. (table 4). Some hunting on communal land by conservancies is also known to occur for both trophies and meat for local consumption (J. Fennessy, in litt., 2019).

The country\u2019s population of Thornicroft\u2019s Giraffe (G. c. thornicrofti) is stable, while its other resident subspecies (G. c. giraffa, in the south west of the country), is not threatened by illegal hunting in Zambia (J. Fennessy, in litt., 2019) and is generally increasing within Southern Africa. Botswana: In the 1990s, Botswana adopted a Community Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) programme, which initially focused on safari hunting as the main tourism activity (Mbaiwa, 2018). In 2014, however, Botswana banned safari hunting, which was no longer deemed part of the \u201cnational commitment to conserve and preserve local fauna or the long-term growth of the local tourism industry\u201d (Scott, 2013; Mbaiwa, 2018). However, Scott (2013), states that Giraffes acted as a secondary species on Okavango hunts, and that offtake had been minimal, which appears to be corroborated by the low number of Giraffe trophies exported from Botswana to the USA between 2006\u20132014. Arntzen et al., (2003), reported that the population of Giraffes in one CBNRM case study region increased from an estimated 4,248 in 1989, to 7,217 individuals in 2001. Summary: The general increase in Giraffe populations within Southern Africa, in range States where trophy hunting is permitted, suggests that this legal offtake of Giraffe is not adversely affecting these populations or contributing to the overall decline of the species. Equally, there is no evidence to suggest that the legal trade in Giraffe trophies has played a significant role in the population declines in Zimbabwe from 1998 to 2016. These observed increases are due to a range of factors including climatic conditions and increased conservation awareness, although in part, are also likely related to changes in policy regarding the legislation and ownership of wildlife, and subsequent benefit of their use (J. Fennessy in litt., 2019). In areas of Africa where legal hunting is not permitted, however, Giraffe populations have generally declined, due to a range of factors. While illegal hunting (poaching) remains a serious ongoing threat to Giraffes, no evidence currently exists of a connection between this and any significant form of international trade, other than the suspected transfer of illegally killed animals across porous borders within some parts of Africa (see Threats for more detail). Finally, while trophy hunting is predominantly focused on adult male specimens, there does not IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 5 24 appear to be any evidence to suggest that this selective hunting is negatively impacting the genetic integrity of Giraffe populations. Fennessy (in litt., 2019), did not consider this to be a research priority, as \u201ctrophy hunting is minimal, and most trophy hunts are on small private land which have a limited genetic diversity anyway.\u201d Inclusion in Appendix II to improve control of other listed species A) Specimens in trade resemble those of species listed in Appendix II under Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) Annex 2 a or listed in Appendix I Products that make use of the hide could potentially be distinguished due to the Giraffe\u2019s distinctive pelage, although there is currently no method of easily identifying Giraffe bone to species level, in some of the forms in which it is traded (J. Fennessy, in litt., 2019). Additional Information Threats Four main threats have been identified as being responsible for the decline of some Giraffe populations: habitat loss, civil unrest, illegal hunting and ecological changes. These threats have not ceased and may not be reversible throughout the species\u2019 range. Their presence and severity, however, varies by region (Muller et al., 2018). In West Africa, the main threats are habitat loss due to increasing human populations and human\u2013wildlife conflict. In East and Central Africa, the main threats are habitat loss through rapid conversion of land for farming and increasing human populations, drought, illegal hunting for meat and hide, and armed conflict throughout unstable regions. In Southern Africa, the main perceived threats are illegal hunting and habitat loss caused by conversion of land for agriculture, human development, and cutting of trees for firewood and construction. The poaching of Giraffes is, however, considered less of a threat in Southern Africa than in Eastern and Central regions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2b6b8554-4c45-4ccc-85bc-846a8c3cb1be": {"__data__": {"id_": "2b6b8554-4c45-4ccc-85bc-846a8c3cb1be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e1c51f0ac87a52f304e6342c135b163c5bfec0f55e92dffd61d072f846e097f3"}, "2": {"node_id": "ba86f495-8068-47fe-893f-bef6b181c3a3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "69aa88f19803395ddbe9c97bf27987ea9c2b20b32775fefa0615a8a6446de604"}}, "hash": "18a8b914a614b8ef5e0eac80472f6f9ac8bac11c2c116ed17b7d109ab636aa40", "text": "Two of the most chronic threats\u2014habitat loss and illegal hunting\u2014are considered in more detail below.

As a result, the Giraffe\u2019s range has contracted significantly over the past century. This has resulted in geographical isolation of local populations and some herds surviving at the edge of the species\u2019 preferred range. In addition, habitat loss due to aridity may be compounded by climate change in the future. Lado (2019) reports that in South Sudan, political instability and armed conflict have forced many people to seek refuge and grazing areas within in the preferred habitat of this species. In Ethiopia, the cutting of Acacia trees (an important food source for G. camelopardalis) for charcoal is thought to be a major factor contributing to declines, along with habitat degradation due to expansion of agriculture (Abate & Abate, 2017). Illegal Hunting: Giraffa camelopardalis is targeted by illegal hunters particularly in Central and Eastern regions (Muller et al., 2018). In some areas, such as South Sudan, this is the main threat to Giraffe populations (Lado, 2019). In addition to the actions of militias noted in the trade section of this report, other examples include the poaching of Giraffe in Botswana\u2019s Okavango Delta, where an estimated 99 animals are killed each year, representing 12% of illegal meat harvest (by weight), sourced from the region (Rogan et al., 2017). Poaching of Masai Giraffe (G. c. tippelskirchi) is also common in protected areas in Tanzania and poaching may have caused certain populations in the country to be designated as \u201cpopulation sinks\u201d. In Botswana, meat hunting for local use may be increasing, a trend that many suggest is potentially correlated with the socioeconomic impacts of hunting bans for other animals within the country (J. Fennessy, in litt., 2019). In Zambia, Giraffes are not thought to be threatened by direct illegal hunting (J. Fennessy, in litt., 2019), although Thornicroft\u2019s Giraffe (G. c. thornicrofti) have occasionally been caught in snares that are probably aimed at other animal species (Du Raan et al., 2015). Giraffes targeted by illegal hunters are valued for medicinal, magical and practical purposes. For example, Giraffe products may be used as aphrodisiacs or headache cures, to treat nose bleeds (Abate & Abate, 2017), and, in Tanzania, as a supposed cure for HIV/AIDS. Giraffe hair and tails are also valued for use as flyswatters, bracelets, necklaces and thread, while their skin is used for shields, sandals and drums (Abate and Abate, 2017). In Ethiopia, Giraffes have been hunted with automatic rifles by local people for their tails (and meat), which are used to make traditional for wedding dowries (Wube, 2013). IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 5 25 Giraffes are also hunted for meat for human consumption (Muller et al., 2018). As noted above, some transboundary movement of meat may occur, while in some areas (including within Kenya), local markets have been identified as places of trade for poached Giraffes (Muneza & Fennessy, 2017). In some areas of East Africa, however, illegal hunting appears to be less prevalent. For example, the Management Authority of Uganda (in litt., 2019) reports that there is no evidence of targeted Giraffe poaching within Uganda, although Giraffa camelopardalis are occasionally caught in snares and traps targeting other herbivorous species. Conservation, management and legislation Conservation management strategies for Giraffe and the extent of State protection varies across Africa. Populations may be privately owned and managed or may inhabit protected areas where they are owned by the State (J. Fennessy in litt., 2019). Many range States have laws prohibiting the hunting of Giraffes, including Angola, Botswana, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, DRC, Kenya, Mozambique, Niger, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda. Despite these protections, however, the success of Giraffe conservation across Africa is highly variable and declines in Giraffe populations have occurred in many of the countries noted above (Muller, et al., 2018).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "caf765a3-3608-4e66-9ccd-30bc61153c85": {"__data__": {"id_": "caf765a3-3608-4e66-9ccd-30bc61153c85", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0bd0c9465a3724d489f43950a1882a81507c80ce745b106d220587a331a3e95b"}, "2": {"node_id": "2d8f02dc-73b6-45ff-83e1-c689951e0246", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "38ca133a05e054610f5c3baee73ffdf8e8e82cd33e0d680ad4d3a9cdc431370a"}}, "hash": "e8bea3f9a9405cfd8ebf4c60617c8229bcaf202d609afd71e972c03a85971f73", "text": "As noted in the trade section above, Giraffes occur in a number of other range States where hunting is permitted.

Fennessy, in litt., 2019). In Namibia, Giraffes are listed under National Legislation as \u201cSpecially Protected Game\u201d, which prevents the hunting of Giraffes or the trading of Giraffe products, unless a permit is issued (MET, 2019).

In Zimbabwe, there is also currently no management plan in place for Giraffes (Zimbabwe Scientific Authority, in litt., 2019). The Management Authority also states that efforts are being made to consolidate available information, and to research the conservation status of the species to ensure long-term monitoring of population trends. International agreements: The Giraffe was recently listed on Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS). While 31 countries have ratified the Convention, many with Giraffe populations have not, including Angola, Chad, Ethiopia, Namibia, Somalia, South Africa, South Sudan, and Zimbabwe. Artificial propagation/captive breeding Giraffes have been bred in zoos, but there is no evidence of commercial breeding operations, and captive breeding is not considered to have any relevance to the conservation of this species (J. Fennessy, in litt., 2019). Implementation challenges (including similar species) While whole Giraffe trophies are readily identifiable, smaller parts and derivatives may be more cryptic. There is currently no method of easily identifying Giraffe bone to species level in some of the forms in which it is traded (J. Fennessy, in litt., 2019). Potential risk(s) of a listing A listing could conceivably result in a fall in demand for Giraffe trophies, due to potential difficulties in obtaining a CITES permit, or the additional stigma that this may attach to the sport (J. Fennessy in litt., 2019). Given that Giraffe numbers have generally increased in several Southern Africa range States in the last 30 years where hunting is permitted, it could be argued that the value attached to Giraffes through trophy hunting has contributed to this increase in population numbers. A fall in demand and consequent decrease in the value of Giraffes to landowners might conceivably contribute to a decrease in Giraffe ownership, and a subsequent decrease in the populations of Giraffe within these countries. Potential benefit(s) of listing for trade regulation An Appendix II listing would produce data that would provide a clearer picture of a). the full extent of international trade, and b). the provenance of some Giraffe products in trade. It would also provide a more detailed picture of the extent of trade in live specimens. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 5 26 However, as there is currently no scientific basis to suggest that the current levels of international trade pose a threat to Giraffe populations, this may not ultimately prove useful to the future conservation of the species.

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 6 28 Transfer of the Small-clawed Otter Aonyx cinereus from Appendix II to Appendix I Proponents: India, Nepal and the Philippines Summary: The Small-clawed Otter Aonyx cinereus is the smallest of the otter species. The species has a broad range extending from India eastwards through South-east Asia to southern China. It is dependent on aquatic habitats for foraging and sheltered terrestrial areas for resting and denning. It occurs in a range of aquatic habitats from coastal wetlands to mountain streams, and in at least some human-modified habitats such as rice fields and coffee/tea plantations wherever there is prey and adequate shelter. This species was assessed as Vulnerable in 2014 on the IUCN Red List. The assessment states that although quantitative data on population sizes or trends are lacking, it is inferred that the global population of Aonyx cinereus has declined by greater than 30% over the past 30 years (three generations). However, as A. cinereus was assessed as Vulnerable and not Endangered, declines of greater than 50% were not indicated. There are no current population estimates available for A. cinereus. Although populations and habitat are believed to be stable in parts of the range, its distribution in the west is believed to be contracting, and it is now considered to be very rare in southern China and Myanmar. Its population status is reportedly unknown in a number of countries (Bhutan, Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (PDR), Thailand and Viet Nam). Where national Red List assessments have been undertaken, the status varies from data deficient in Nepal to near threatened in Malaysia to endangered in Bangladesh. However, in other parts of its range there are healthy populations and habitat. The subfamily Lutrinae, which includes Aonyx cinereus, has been included in Appendix II since 1977. Poaching is considered a significant threat; A. cinereus has a history of exploitation for its fur and for body parts used in Traditional Asian Medicine, which has been identified as one of the main causes of historical population declines.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c40b45a8-4a1d-49c0-b147-7b8d86c638e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "c40b45a8-4a1d-49c0-b147-7b8d86c638e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2ddec4d2482beb8e43472f9704e5f7cfa4b2d242a94e00272519d95683cad2a2"}, "2": {"node_id": "e4eba709-1c85-44fe-ae49-371b9f75082a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "55d65fd8b4c2ff6f16088e74c75113e03f62064b213b2c8e0825243216e8135f"}}, "hash": "5eccaf496ae77a7682b86ea9b7a8d9c59441827ff8d75f93730beade853e88c3", "text": "Live trade for the pet trade and otter-petting cafes is said to be an emerging use with Japan and Thailand identified as destinations. CITES records of legal international trade show relatively low volumes, mostly of live animals (ca. 600 between 1980\u20132017) reported mainly as from captive sources. Many reported consumer countries are also range States so some trade is likely domestic. While online advertisements of live A. cinereus often describe the otters as captive-bred, it is believed that that many animals in trade are wild-caught. There are concerns that illegal pet trade in otters in general is a growing threat and there is evidence to suggest that this species is the most in demand. Live A. cinereus have been offered for sale online in Indonesia, Thailand and elsewhere. The total level of trade in this species for pelts, pets and medicine is unclear as much of the trade is apparently illegal and unreported. The species is protected in all range States except Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia and Nepal, although protection may vary in form and enforcement. For example, in Thailand whilst the possession of otters is prohibited, and all native otters are protected, online advertisements for A. cinereus and other otter species can still be found.

There are reportedly otter farms in China, Pakistan and Indonesia, and although species can be bred in captivity, it is not clear how much of the trade is being met from these sources. In addition to harvest, Aonyx cinereus are believed to be affected to some extent by widespread human development and activities such as habitat loss and degradation, pollution, and reduced prey base, in addition to climate change. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 6 29 Analysis: Information on the status of Aonyx cinereus is scarce although the population is considered unlikely to be small or to have a restricted range. There is anecdotal information that the species is scarcer than it was, and it has been extirpated in parts of its range, but in other areas populations are reported to be stable. There are no baseline population data on which to measure trends, but a recent (over three generations) decline of greater than 30%, but less than 50%, has been inferred from rates of habitat loss and exploitation resulting in an IUCN Red List assessment of Vulnerable (2014). Legal international trade in the species has been low, but there are concerns over the impacts of illegal harvest for pelts and more recently in an apparently growing demand for the pet market. It is not clear what proportion of harvest is for domestic versus international trade. While there is some evidence that A. cinereus can be successfully bred in captivity, it is unclear if any of the international or domestic trade, including the pet trade, is being met from captive sources. Given the available information, it is not possible to determine the overall level of harvest from the wild or its impact on the species. On the basis of a population decline greater than 30% but less than 50%, inferred from a decline in habitat and exploitation in the Red List assessment, it seems uncertain that this species meets the guideline for a marked recent population decline as described in Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) for inclusion in Appendix I at the present time. However, here are significant levels of uncertainty regarding status in some parts of the species\u2019 range and levels of trade, and if further information were to become available it may help to determine if the species is closer to the 50% decline guideline for inclusion in Appendix I. Other Considerations: Levels of legal international trade appear low, and therefore it is assumed that most harvest is for domestic and/or illegal trade. Any additional benefits of an Appendix I listing are not clear unless enforcement efforts are increased. Res. Conf. 12.10 (Rev. CoP15) outlines that inclusion in Appendix I would mean commercial captive breeding operations would need to meet the provisions of Res. Conf. 10.16 (Rev.) to be registered with the CITES Secretariat, and that registered operations should ensure an appropriate and secure marking system to identify all breeding stock and specimens in trade. This enhanced oversight could help allay concerns over fraudulent claims of captive breeding and wild offtake for breeding stock.

IUCN Global Category Vulnerable A2cde (assessed 2014) ver 3.1. Biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I A) Small wild population The current population of Aonyx cinereus is unknown but is likely not to be considered small given the species\u2019 wide range. In the Sundarbans, Aziz (2018) estimated approximately 1 otter per 30 km of river surveyed which, the author suggests, should be considered preliminary and an underestimate of the actual otter population in the area. Although this survey was preliminary initial findings it could indicate the presence of a healthy population of Aonyx cinereus in the Sundarbans and that this mangrove forest could signify a stronghold for this population (Aziz, 2018).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a65c32c-3dd7-4e28-b0e6-55df14e15bbf": {"__data__": {"id_": "7a65c32c-3dd7-4e28-b0e6-55df14e15bbf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "123680514cba7f181d4acf7e97a8dd2c33c93247be6ed5adccf596f909277fe1"}, "2": {"node_id": "e433cdb3-971d-441d-bf5c-284b3f4f1dd8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0173903409d1942357bc551d8e0caac6f92ea384df2fb18f9e386d68ca01c12f"}}, "hash": "1462de0bb5b8a3d09c1909de9d2edf3ba5926db8bfa3c489c74b5d53d3b0217a", "text": "It is estimated that there are other areas within its range that can also support healthy populations of Aonyx cinereus, including Nakai-Nam Theun National Protected Area in Lao PDR and Puerto Princesa City in Palawan, Philippines.

According to Wright et al., (2015) the species is native to 16 countries/territories. However, they have disappeared or declined in many parts of their range. C) Decline in number of wild individuals This species is classified as Vulnerable due to an inferred past population decline because of habitat loss and exploitation. Although quantitative data on population sizes or trends are lacking, it is inferred that the global population of the Small-clawed Otter has declined by >30% over the past 30 years (three generations) (Wright et al., 2015). There is no generally accepted/agreed scientific method for most population counts and/or estimates in the wild for most species (although there are exceptions e.g. Lutra lutra see Reuther et al., 2000), therefore population changes of most Asian otter species are inferred from habitat trends or presence/absence surveys. Wright et al., (2015) note range constrictions in the western part of the range (India) and the eastern part (Indochina). Country specific accounts are provided below: Bangladesh: Aziz (2018) suggests that a large population of Aonyx cinereus is probably present in the Sundarbans, Bangladesh, and that the mangrove forests probably provide a stronghold for the species\u2019 long-term survival. In the National Red List assessment (2015), Aonyx cinereus is categorised as endangered and the range for this species in the wild has decreased, particularly in the western portion of its range and its Area of Occurrence is estimated to be 4,114 km2 (Begum, 2015). Bhutan: A survey conducted along one of the major rivers in central Bhutan also confirmed the presence of otters and that it is likely Aonyx cinereus, Lutrogale perspicillata and Lutra lutra are all present in this country. Only Lutrogale perspicillata was directly observed during this study. A total of six 5.5 km transects were sampled and five of them were positive for otter signs and one site had the highest rate (95%) of positive plots. Over 40% of land in Bhutan has been designated as a natural protected area and hunting is considered a serious offence and is prohibited (Chettri & Savage, 2014). This study represented the first survey of otters in Bhutan and further research is required to assess their status in this country. Cambodia: Aonyx cinereus has been reported in Virachey National Park in north-eastern Cambodia (McCann & Pawlowski, 2017). The species has also been confirmed at Chhlong, Kratie Province (Gray et al., 2012); Seima Protected Forest, Mondulkiri Province (WCS Cambodia unpublished, 2015) and along the Prek Kasap in Stung Treng and Ratanakiri Provinces (Hon et al., 2010). A rapid camera-trap survey conducted in Prek Toal Core Area, Tonle Sap Lake, Cambodia found presence of only Smooth-coated Otter Lutrogale perspicillata and the Endangered Hairy-nosed Otter Lutra sumatrana. Fishermen around Tonle Sap area often keep otter cubs as pets, however according to interviews in the early 2000s they often die after a short time in captivity (Poole, 2003), or they are eventually killed and skinned (Wilcox et al., 2016). In north-eastern Cambodia interviews with local people state that local wildlife traders buy otters skins for prices varying between USD 2 for a small skin and over USD 35 for a large skin, and otters have been used in traditional medicine for pregnant women (Hon et al., 2010, Ashwell & Watson, 2008). China: Believed to be extirpated or extremely rare throughout much of their range in southern China (according to Wright et al., (2015) its range does not reach other parts of China), this is due to large scale commercial hunting of all otter species prior to the 1980s.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3646b8d0-8e78-4cdc-b56b-3fd29267246a": {"__data__": {"id_": "3646b8d0-8e78-4cdc-b56b-3fd29267246a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "37bd7a1c3d5a6208f67cec2107979bf5aedcd9222269196c30637be84cd9f790"}, "2": {"node_id": "37cc3dd7-b660-4722-9f04-40f31b726461", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4f921b88b76bbd7840cd8faed6c58753529b7c53503f049c31c0f4d99147af73"}}, "hash": "8996d778d8985d996bf6ad81f3fb28b837e11279d7c7af4d671a3203062ca415", "text": "Historical records of otter presence in China indicate that Aonyx cinereus was previously limited to the tropical and subtropical regions of the country, with records of their presence in Brahmaputra, the Irrawaddy, the Mekong, Red River and the Pearl River Basins as well as Hainan Island (Li & Chan, 2017). Based on pelt trade statistics it seems that before the 1980s, otters were abundant in many provinces, particularly the Yangtze and Pearl River Basins (more than 10,000 were killed annually, in 1957 alone more than 40,000 pelts were officially traded in China (species not specified)). By 1980\u20131985 the annual harvest had decreased dramatically and recent surveys (field surveys, camera trapping, interviews with locals and otter experts) found A. cinereus at only two sites in China, these authors suggest that all three-otter species (Aonyx cinereus, Lutra lutra and Lutrogale perspicillata) found in China are on the verge of extinction (Li & Chan, 2017).

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 6 31 A study (Prakash et al., 2012) of Aonyx cinereus presence in human modified environments in the Western Ghats attempted to identify key habitat features that influenced otter occupancy in the Anamalai Tiger Reserve (958 km2) and adjoining tea and coffee plantations (220 km2). Otter occupancy was recorded in all three habitat types indicating widespread use of riparian vegetation in human modified habitat. However, intensity of habitat use was much lower in tea plantations and coffee plantations than in protected areas, and potential refuge was considered a factor influencing habitat use (Prakash et al., 2012). It is also reported to occur in Odisha, Eastern Ghats and direct observations of Aonyx cinereus during 2005\u20132012 were recorded in six different locations including protected and non-protected areas (Mohapatra et al., 2014). Otters are hunted in India for their pelts. According to researchers, Chinese and Western tourists in Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) buy skins for home decor and possibly good luck but Tibetans are a large consumer base for pelts from otters poached in India and Nepal. At least 50% of the otter skins in China originate in India, with Lhasa, TAR, identified as a hub for trade in pelts (species not specific). Indonesia: In West Java, Indonesia, Aonyx cinereus have been recorded in anthropogenic habitats such as rice paddy fields as well as fish and crab pond aquaculture areas. Wetland conversion as well as pollution were seen as the main threats towards the species. They are often perceived as pests and seen as competitors in fish pond and crab pond aquaculture areas leading to human\u2013otter conflicts and possible retaliatory killings (Melisch et al., 1996). Aonyx cinereus have been recorded to utilise rice paddy fields along the Batang Anai River, West Sumatra and these were found to serve as important potential habitats for long-term survival of otter species in human altered environments (Aadrean & Usio, 2017). Massive destruction of wetland forests in Indonesia has reduced the species habitat, as has habitat conversion to oil palm plantations in Sabah. In the early 19th and 20th centuries Aonyx cinereus was relatively common in agricultural and urban or semi-urban environments on the island of Java and was considered to be a pest by local residents. It is still found to persist in heavily polluted waterways of Jakarta (Meijaard, 2014) and known to utilise rice paddies in Padang Pariaman, West Sumatra where pesticides in agriculture are heavily used (Aadrean et al., 2011). Between 2000 and 2012 over 6.02 million ha of primary forest was lost in Indonesia and by 2012 proportional loss of primary forest in wetland areas increased (Margono et al., 2014). Rudyanto and Melisch (1994) confirm very low-scale incidental hunting and trade from Sumatra from the early 1990s. Lao PDR: A healthy population was reported in Nakai-Nam Thuen National Protected Area in Lao PDR in 2016. Camera trap surveys were conducted along one of the main rivers in Nakai-Nam Thuen National Protected Area, the Nam River, where locals reported they regularly observe otters. Between November to December 2015, 11 camera traps were placed and four recorded the presence of otters, all of which were Aonyx cinereus (Coudrat, 2016). The Beung Kiat Ngong Ramsar Site in Champasak Province of Lao PDR represents suitable habitat for otter populations and otters were recorded in this area in the early 1990s (Duckworth & Timmins, 2015). Further surveys in this area between 2007\u20132008 (Duckworth, 2008) and a short survey conducted in 2013 and in 2014 (Duckworth & Timmins, 2015) found no evidence of otters in the area.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "240439cf-f7a6-4901-8aeb-930bcb2776fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "240439cf-f7a6-4901-8aeb-930bcb2776fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "960dfd9eb123053acea6d375db670961ba85bc08eb9b5112228569d47a950a6e"}, "2": {"node_id": "ff6bcfe3-4268-4904-beb7-3c73bf3d68be", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fd4275fd536d434c5b3361614e3203f8f61d215071829f1a362a891b6652ae78"}}, "hash": "e7db7a71aaa87c63c8c8abebb9708076b9a4832091001101ee154030696b546f", "text": "A study of small carnivore status in Nam Et Phou Louey National Protected Area on the Lao PDR\u2013Viet Nam border reported the presence of Aonyx cinereus (Johnson, et al., 2009).

Aonyx cinereus was found to utilise four different habitat types with the highest occurrence recorded in paddy fields and casuarina forest. The species has also been reported to occur in the mangrove forests of Sarawak, Borneo (Mohd-Azlan et al., 2016). The National Red List of Mammals for Peninsular Malaysia (2017) assessed Aonyx cinereus as near threatened with an estimated area of occupancy of over 3.3 million ha (Perhilitan, 2017). IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 6 32 Myanmar: In Myanmar, Aonyx cinereus was historically considered to occur throughout the country but is now considered to be extremely rare across Myanmar\u2019s lowlands (Zaw et al., 2008), however, there is little available information on the current distribution and status of A. cinereus in Myanmar. Multiple surveys conducted at the Mong La wildlife market have found specimens of otters; in 2006 an otter tail was observed for sale (species not specific) (Shepherd & Nijman, 2006) and in 2014, two carcasses of A. cinereus were observed, which had been sourced by local hunters (Shepherd & Nijman, 2014). Otters were poached in Myanmar for their fur and body parts and were listed among the highest value wildlife commodities for sale in Putao in the late 1990s (Zaw et al., 2008). Nepal: In the Nepal National Red List assessment (2011), Aonyx cinereus has been categorised as data deficient. The species is found in Makalu Barun National Park and the districts of Kailali and Kapilbastu and documented to be found up to an elevation of 1,300 m (Jnawali et al., 2011). Otters are hunted in Nepal for their pelts. As noted above, otter pelts from Nepal are said to be sold in Tibet Autonomous Region. In Nepal, a total of 756 otter pelts were seized between 1989 and 2017, either in Kathmandu or near an international border (species not specific). Philippines: In the Philippines Aonyx cinereus is only known to occur in Palawan. In 2010 a study focused on the distribution and trade dynamics of A. cinereus confirmed that the species was widely distributed in Palawan with its presence confirmed in all 12 municipalities of the mainland (Gonzalez, 2010). Singapore: Aonyx cinereus populations in Singapore are highly localised in comparison to the wider distribution of Lutrogale perspicillata (W. Duckworth, in litt., 2019). Aonyx cinereus was present in Singapore up until the 1960s and by the 1970s they were considered a rare species and threatened by habitat loss due to reclamation of rivers and pollution; they are now localised to offshore islands of Pulau Tekong (Lim et al., 2016) and Ubin (K. Krishnasamy, in litt., 2019). Thailand: Aonyx cinereus has been reported to occur in Pru Toa Daeng Peat Swamp Forest in the Narathiwat Province of southern Thailand, otter signs were also found in rice paddies and secondary forest outside of the protected area (Kanchanasaka & Duplaix, 2011). A camera trap survey of small carnivores which was conducted in Thailand between 1996\u20132013 surveyed 21 sites; 19 based in protected areas and resulted in no camera-trap records for A. cinereus and there were few substantiated records in the 2000s for this species (Chutipong et al., 2014). Bangkhuntien fishermen reported that otters threaten their fish farms, so they are persecuted but not typically for trade purposes (Chutipong et al., 2014).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cbf64abe-1c54-4404-ae75-7d40572e64ce": {"__data__": {"id_": "cbf64abe-1c54-4404-ae75-7d40572e64ce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2b3b9e15669faffe969772abdaa6f2c0681c151551883bb7045e75d399596fd6"}, "2": {"node_id": "b2e42ed4-b527-4a2d-b422-2307f25a5b86", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9a63018a2a7742bfc31a46c2ea662fa10a468665ea56e6a456243497e1d00002"}}, "hash": "904b6830eb072bed8cdba910f1e93e53c40e20126154d75ab921653d33db99d3", "text": "Viet Nam: The population of Aonyx cinereus in Viet Nam has been reported to have a relatively wide distribution and is reported to occur from the northern highland\u2019s limestone, Hoang Lien mountain range, northern and central Annamites, central Indochina limestone, Ke Go/Khe New lowlands, the eastern plains dry forest, lowland Dong Nai watershed and the Mekong delta (Hussain et al., 2011).

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 6 33 Figure 1: CITES Trade Data between 1980\u20132017 of live specimens of Aonyx cinereus (exporter-reported figures). Live: Most seizures of live otters have occurred in Thailand, followed by Indonesia, Viet Nam and Malaysia and claims have been made that otters are being bred in captivity for the pet trade in Indonesia and Thailand. Analysis of CITES Trade Data reported involving those countries showed under 30 reported in trade, the majority reported as captive-bred and the majority for the purposes of education, circus or travelling exhibition and zoo. However, all these countries are range States and therefore any seizures may not have been of specimens destined for international trade. Authorities in Malaysia have confirmed that captive breeding of otters occurs in Malaysia (K. Krishnasamy in litt., 2019). In Indonesia and Thailand claims have been made that otters are being bred in captivity. These reports that claim to be of captive-bred specimens need to be corroborated by both importing and exporting countries (K. Krishnasamy in litt., 2019). Japan has been suggested as a key destination market for Aonyx cinereus in the international pet trade (Kitade & Naruse, 2018). A total of 99 live individuals were reportedly exported to Japan between 1977 and 2017 (CITES Trade Database). The recent emergence of otter cafes in Japan has the potential to motivate the otter pet trade (McMillan, 2018). Otters have been observed for sale online in a number of countries including China, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia and in Thailand, where the possession of otters is prohibited, and all native otter species are protected (Siriwat & Nijman, 2018). Newborn pups and juvenile otters are in most demand within the pet trade and often offered for sale as an entire litter rather than individuals (Phassaraudomsak & Krishnasamy, 2018; Siriwat & Nijman, 2018). They appear to have high mortality rates when they are extracted from their natural habitats (Gonzalez, 2010) but are preferred when they are younger as they are easier to tame (Feeroz et al., 2011) and more suitable for pets. Similarly, there is also a demand for otters as pets in China, and it appears that keeping otters as pets is reported to occur in some south China provinces such as Yunnan (Y. Wang in litt., 2019). Interest from people wanting to buy otters in Sichuan, Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and Yunnan can be found online (L. Hsun-Yen in litt., 2019). There is evidence for demand in Europe and between 2010 and 2014 20 live specimens of Aonyx cinereus were observed for sale online (USD 600\u20131,600 per individual) (Fischer et al., 2015). Skins: Most of the demand for skins appears to be in China, where populations have declined and are now likely only found in protected areas. Seizures of otter skins have declined since 2005; however, the reason for this decline is not clear. In China it appears that otters are in demand for both their fur, body parts for Traditional Chinese Medicine and for the pet trade. Evidence can be found online of advertisements for otter fur on various platforms, although information on the species, source or authenticity of these furs is often lacking (L. Hsun-Yen in litt., 2019 & Y. Wang in litt., 2019). Some posts, in particular for hats, claim that furs are imported from Canada or USA (Y.

In Cambodia, otters were reportedly used as medicine for pregnant women (Hon et al., 2010).

Additional Information Threats In northern South-east Asia, international trade has probably been a substantial part of the problem causing declines, but cannot be considered the only, nor even the main driver of illegal offtake (W. Duckworth, in litt., 2019). In addition to international and domestic trade, throughout its range Aonyx cinereus faces threats including human development and natural wetland conversion for agriculture including aquaculture, plantations (e.g. coffee, oil palm, tree plantations and rice fields), wetland reclamation; siltation due to deforestation; pollution by pesticides; mining; quarrying; slash-and-burn agriculture. South-east Asia has the highest rate of forest loss in the tropics. The global extent of wetlands is now estimated to have declined between 64\u201371% since 1900 and habitat loss and degradation continues worldwide (Ramsar, 2015). Evidence suggests that although available otter habitat is decreasing and wetlands continued to be converted into agriculture throughout much of A. cinereus range, otters are adapted to survive in moderately disturbed habitats where there is some level of human presence (Mohapatra et al., 2014,). A further threat to otters is a reduced prey base from overfishing and the species preference for crabs and other invertebrates makes water contamination from inappropriate or illegal pesticide use in wetlands, as well as organochlorides, heavy metals and other pollutants an important concern. The common practice of dumping garbage in wetlands is also a threat to otters, whose scat has been observed to contain plastics. Fishermen are known to kill otters as a competitor for fish. Destructive fish-kill practices are common in the Western Ghats where dynamite fishing, bleach fishing and electric-rod based fishing and the use of pesticides in banana plantations and rice fields. Recent modelling research suggests that climate change will significantly impact the Aonyx cinereus habitat, forecasting up to 40% loss of suitable areas by 2070. This scenario is made worse for A. cinereus by the marginality of its climatic niche. Conservation, management and legislation Aonyx cinereus is generally protected in its range States (although some needs reviewing (Duplaix & Savage, 2018)) except in Cambodia, which removed protections for A. cinereus and Lutrogale perspicillata in 2007; Indonesia where A. cinereus is not protected by domestic legislation and Nepal and Brunei Darussalam. No management plans or species-specific conservation measures are in place for A. cinereus in range States. A. cinereus was listed in Appendix II of CITES (1977) and is not protected by any other international agreement.

Melisch, in litt., 2019). Implementation challenges (including similar species) Unprocessed fur of otters allows for distinction of specimens at the species-level (Kuhn, 2009). Although, mammalian hair microscopy for species identification is widely used for ecological, forensic and/or economic purposes, few such guidelines are publicly available and cover only some otter species. There is very little published material that would allow the simple distinguishing of processed pelts, therefore, it would be challenging for untrained officials to distinguish between processed pelts (Gomez et al., 2016). In some consumer countries such as Japan (where trade in otters is evident), there are apparent loopholes that allow Appendix II (and III) species to be traded once smuggled into the country and therefore CITES-listing does not fully protect the animal from illegal trade (Duplaix & Savage, 2018).

It forages in a wide variety of habitats including large rivers and lakes, peat swamp forests, mangroves and estuaries, as well as rice-fields. It has a broad distribution range, from Java, Sumatra and Borneo, northward to south-western China, west through Nepal, Bhutan and India to Pakistan, with an outlying, and taxonomically distinct population in Iraq. There are some indications that L. perspicillata can adapt to live in human-modified environments. Lutrogale perspicillata was assessed in the IUCN Red List as Vulnerable in 2014 on the basis that the population was inferred to have declined by more than 30% in the last 30 years (three generations) due to habitat loss and exploitation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ac2cd46a-dac6-4acc-ac9a-81f3061cd52b": {"__data__": {"id_": "ac2cd46a-dac6-4acc-ac9a-81f3061cd52b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2a0e2790e8397cda87173e74cd1655fc2af9eebd171e19510c032fca4afdd38b"}, "2": {"node_id": "a0543bf2-6286-4bfd-b229-a2a50e216abf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fac92940deefd0aae186186a7b780d90e9ae004b4a1b4e21fdfaab659b55645e"}}, "hash": "68819217430d1565f98ceb351b23d059af1187b5201d336ca3a8056e067afb37", "text": "However, as L. perspicillata was assessed as Vulnerable and not Endangered, declines of greater than 50% were not indicated. There is evidence that there have been declines in a number of national populations: in China, Viet Nam and parts of Bangladesh it appears to have been extirpated, and declines are noted elsewhere (e.g. Pakistan). While some national populations appear healthy (Singapore, Iraq) there is uncertainty for other countries (e.g. India, Indonesia). Its status in National Red Lists varies from least concern in Malaysia (2017) to vulnerable in Thailand (2005), to endangered in Nepal (2011) and critically endangered in Bangladesh (2014). The subfamily Lutrinae was listed in CITES Appendix II in 1977. Historically exploited for the fur trade and for use in Traditional Asian Medicine this exploitation was considered one of the main causes for past population declines. The pet trade and otter-petting cafes have been identified as emerging uses for otters, with Japan and Thailand identified as destinations. Lutrogale perspicillata does not appear to be one of the favored species for this trade, perhaps due to its larger size, although a limited number of online advertisements were found in Thailand and elsewhere. According to the CITES Trade Database, international legal trade has been limited to small quantities in recent years: there have been no reported direct exports of skins since 1983 and only 41 live individuals were reported to have been exported between 1977 and 2016 (most live individuals were reported to be captive-bred). Some countries from where otters have been observed as offered for sale are also range States for the species, which suggests a degree of domestic trade. The total current level of demand for this species for pelts, pets and medicine is unclear as much of the trade is apparently illegal and unreported. The species is protected in all range States except for Cambodia and Brunei Darussalam and the status in Bangladesh is unclear.

Lutrogale perspicillata was historically in high demand for its pelts and a trade in pelts continues illegally. A number of otter seizures have been reported in range States, with some apparently destined for export; enforcement staff are reported to have difficulty in identifying pelts and products in trade to the species level, therefore seizures are often not reported to the species level. Whilst consumers and tourists in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR), China, are thought to provide the largest consumer base for otter pelts (particularly sourced from India and Nepal) the impact on L. perspicillata is unclear as very little species-specific information is available. There are reportedly otter farms in China, Pakistan and Indonesia, and although species can be bred in captivity, it is not clear how much of the trade is being met from these sources. In addition to harvest, Lutrogale perspicillata is believed to be affected by habitat loss and IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 7 42 degradation, as well as pollution, decline in prey biomass, persecution and climate change. Analysis: Information on the status of L. perspicillata in large parts of its range (e.g. India, Lao PDR, Thailand, Myanmar etc.) is scarce although the population is unlikely to be considered small globally. The species does not have a restricted range, occurring from Iraq in the west to Indonesia in the east. There are no quantitative baseline data on which to base population trends, although there is some information that the species has decreased or been extirpated in some parts of its range. The IUCN Red List assessment notes a decline of more than 30% over three generations. While habitat loss is a serious threat, the species is known to occur in human-modified environments. There has been limited reported legal trade in L. perspicillata since 1977. The current level of demand for this species is unclear, as is the amount of international or domestic trade met by captive-bred sources. The size of the illegal and/or domestic trade is also largely unknown. On the basis of a greater than 30% (but less than 50%) population decline over three generations inferred from a decline in habitat and exploitation in the Red List assessment, it seems uncertain that this species meets the guidelines for a marked recent population decline as described in Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) for inclusion in Appendix I at the present time. There are significant levels of uncertainty regarding status in some parts of the species\u2019 range and levels of trade, and if further information were to become available on this it may help determine of the species lies closer to the 50% decline guideline for inclusion in Appendix I. Other Considerations: Levels of legal international trade appear low, and therefore it is assumed that most harvest is for domestic and/or illegal trade. Any additional benefits of an Appendix I listing are not clear unless enforcement efforts are increased. Res. Conf. 12.10 (Rev. CoP15) outlines that inclusion in Appendix I would mean commercial captive breeding operations would need to meet the provisions of Res. Conf. 10.16 (Rev.) to be registered with the CITES Secretariat, and that registered operations shall ensure an appropriate and secure marking system to identify all breeding stock and specimens in trade. This enhanced oversight could help allay concerns over fraudulent claims of captive breeding and wild offtake for breeding stock.

Lutrogale perspicillata remains distributed throughout much of south Asia and southern South-east Asia, though now in northern South-east Asia it is restricted and occurs mainly in protected areas, Lutrogale perspicillata populations in South-east Asia are present in human-modified environments, most notably Thailand and Singapore (Theng & Sivasothi, 2016 & Kamjing et al., 2017). Habitat loss and landscape modification for agriculture and urbanisation is threatening L. perspicillata habitat, although in Asia it is largely unknown to the extent this impact is having on IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 7 43 wild populations (Kamjing et al., 2017). Otter presence in human-modified environments in some parts of its range suggests that wider use of anthropogenic habitat is prevented by offtake (W. Duckworth, in litt., 2019). C) Decline in number of wild individuals The population of L. perspicillata is inferred to have declined by >30% in the last 30 years. Although there is evidence that some L. perspicillata populations have experienced decline (see country profiles below), the lack of baseline data on the distribution and ecology of L. perspicillata makes it difficult to determine the overall current rate of decline. There is no generally accepted/agreed scientific method for most population counts and/or estimates in the wild for most species (although there are exceptions e.g. Lutra lutra see Reuther et al., 2000), therefore population changes of most Asian otter species are inferred from habitat trends or presence/absence surveys. Multiple studies have reported minimal or no sightings of this species or its signs in locations it has been historically recorded (Hussain & Choudhary, 1997, Li & Chan, 2017, Acharya & Rajbhandari, 2012). Bangladesh: Lutrogale perspicillata were formerly widely distributed and found in all major wetlands in Bangladesh, they are now locally extinct from much natural habitat in the country due to rapid habitat degradation and food scarcity. A study by Aziz (2018) investigated the distribution and status of the Asian Small-clawed Otter A. cinereus in the Sundarbans mangrove forest recorded a total of 53 individuals of A. cinereus but no wild encounter was recorded for L. perspicillata. Fishermen in the Sundarbans still maintain a semi-captive population of L. perspicillata. Lutrogale perspicillata are said to be hunted in Bangladesh for their pelts. The National Red List Assessment (2014) for Bangladesh has classified Lutrogale perspicillata as critically endangered and its area of occurrence is estimated to be 48,147 km2 (Feeroz, 2015). The species is restricted to hilly areas in the north-east and south-east and that the largest population possibly still thrives in the Sundarbans mangrove forest, however the population is said to have declined by 90% due to hunting, poaching, loss of habitat and human-wildlife conflict as a result of commercial fish farming (Feeroz, 2015). There is a small semi- captive population in Norail District used for traditional fishing which has also declined by 80% in the last two decades. Bhutan: A survey of otter distribution in Central Bhutan also stated that it is likely that Lutrogale perspicillata, Lutra lutra and Aonyx cinereus all inhabit the rivers of Bhutan and only Lutrogale perspicillata was directly sighted during the study. A total of five of the six 5.5 km transects were positive for otter signs and one site had the highest rate (95%) of otter plots that were positive for otter signs. Over 40% of land in Bhutan has been designated as a natural protected area and hunting is considered a serious offence and is prohibited (Chettri & Savage, 2014).

Based on pelt trade statistics it seems that before the 1980s, otters were abundant in many provinces, particularly the Yangtze and Pearl River Basins (more than 10,000 were killed annually, in 1957 alone more than 40,000 pelts were officially traded in China (species not specified)). By 1980\u20131985 the annual harvest had decreased dramatically, and no evidence of presence of L. perspicillata in China based on surveys, expert consultation and literature review was found between 2006-2016, indicating that the species had been extirpated (Li & Chan, 2017). India: In the Indian subcontinent the species is adapted to live in the semi-arid region of northwestern India and the Deccan Plateau, as well as more mesic areas such as the southern plains. In the Punjab plains of India, it occurs along some stretches of the Beas, Sutlej and Ravi Rivers and the Harike wetlands. L. perspicillata occurrence has been recorded in a number of protected areas, including but not limited to National Chambal Wildlife Sanctuary (Hussain, 1993), Corbett Tiger Reserve (Nawab, 2007), Dudhwa Tiger Reserve and Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary (Hussain, 2002), Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary (Khan et al., 2014), Periyar Tiger IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 7 44 Reserve (Anoop & Hussain, 2004), Similipal Tiger Reserve (Mishra, et al., 2018), Sundarbans Tiger Reserve (Manjrekar & Prabu, 2014) and the Tungabhadra Otter Reserve Sanctuary created in 2016 (Duplaix & Savage, 2018).A study in the National Chambal Sanctuary found that in 1988, 36% of sites were found with L. perspicillata signs compared to 24% in 1992 (in total 21 fewer sites showed signs of otters in 1992) (Hussain & Choudhury, 1997). Lutrogale perspicillata occupancy in Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary was much lower (7%) compared to 29% at the Alaknanda-Ganga Basin site, which may be because Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary is one of the most human populated and disturbed protected areas in Uttar Pradesh and very accessible to humans. In the Alaknanda- Ganga Basin otters were recorded in less disturbed habitats which were inaccessible to humans. Populations at both sites were fragmented with areas of available habitat restricted, although showed some adaptability (Khan et al., 2014). Otters are hunted in India for their pelts. According to researchers, Chinese and Western tourists in Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) buy skins for home decor and possibly good luck but Tibetans are a large consumer base for pelts from otters poached in India and Nepal. At least 50% of the otter skins in China originate in India (Ghosh 2005; Duckworth 2013) with Lhasa, TAR, identified as a hub for trade in pelts (species not specific). Indonesia: Lutrogale perspicillata has been historically reported to occur in Sumatra (Aadrean, et al., 2011), however there is little available information on the current distribution and status of L. perspicillata in Indonesia. Between 2000 and 2012 over 6.02 Mha of primary forest was lost in Indonesia and by 2012 and proportional loss of primary forest in wetland areas increased (Margono et al., 2014). Rudyanto and Melisch (1994) confirm very low-scale incidental hunting and trade from Sumatra from the early 1990s. Iraq: There is an isolated population in the marshes of Iraq (L. p. maxwelli), indicating that the range of L. perspicillata must have once been wider. The Iraq subspecies has recently (surveys during 2005 to 2012) been found to be thriving in the southern marshes of Iraq. A study confirmed the persistence of L. p. maxwelli in Iraq and in Arbil Province in Kurdistan, extending the known range of this species within the Middle East (Omer et al., 2012).

Malaysia: L. perspicillata is present throughout the Malay Peninsula. In 1994 the species was considered common and widely distributed (Sivasothi & Nor, 1994). A recent study of otters conducted by Abdul-Patah et al., (2014) in various sites in Peninsular Malaysia between April 2010 and March 2011 identified 126 spraints as from otter species; 83% of otter samples were identified to be L. perspicillata and 17% were A. cinereus. A total of eight different habitats were utilised by L. perspicillata and its highest occurrence was recorded in paddy fields. The National Red List Assessment of Peninsular Malaysia (2017) has categorized Lutrogale perspicillata as least concern with an estimated area of occupancy of 3.2 million ha (Perhilitan, 2017). Myanmar: In Myanmar L. perspicillata has been recorded to occur at 1000 m above sea level (U Tun Yin, 1967). Previously the species occurred throughout Myanmar, and was considered common in the Chindwin, it is now considered to be rare in the lowlands (Zaw et al., 2008), however there is little available information on the current distribution and status of L. perspicillata in Myanmar. Multiple surveys conducted at the Mong La wildlife market have found specimens of otters, in 2006 an otter tail was observed for sale (species not specific) (Shepherd & Nijman, 2006). IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 7 45 Otters have been poached in Myanmar for their fur and body parts and were listed among the highest value wildlife commodities for sale in Putao in the late 1990\u2019s (Zaw et al., 2008). Nepal: In Nepal, L. perspicillata is found along the braided channels of Narayani River, with its slow current and shallow depth. A study in Narayani River conducted during the months of June 2011 and January 2012 did not record any occurrence of Lutrogale perspicillata, although some of the areas surveyed had recorded signs in 2009 and had been identified as key priority sites for otter conservation (Acharya & Rajbhandari, 2012). In the National Red List for Nepal, Lutrogale perspicillata has been categorised as endangered and its population is estimated to be <1,000, direct observations are said to be rare and only from Bardia National Park, Chitwan National Park and Shukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve and absent from other previous localities (Jnawali et al. 2011). Otters are hunted in Nepal for their pelts. As noted above, otter pelts from Nepal are said to be sold in Tibet Autonomous Region. In Nepal, a total of 756 otter pelts were seized between 1989 and 2017, either in Kathmandu or near an international border (species not specific)). Lutrogale perspicillata is said to occur at two Ramsar sites in Nepal; Beeshazar and Associated Lakes and Ghodaghodi Lake Area Ramsar Site, however no population studies appear to have been conducted in these areas. Both these sites are under threat from construction, over grazing, illegal logging and eutrophication accelerated by agricultural activities in addition to invasive species (Kafle & Savillo, 2009).

They are often encountered along the northern coastline of Singapore Island and Pulau Ubin (Lim et al., 2016) and found in urban areas such as the tourist hotspot Gardens by the Bay (a 101 hectares nature park adjacent to the Marina Reservoir) (Khoo & Sivasothi, 2018). Between August 2016 and January 2017 field surveys were conducted at 15 sites (selected based on site availability) in Singapore, and reported 11 distinct groups of L. perspicillata, with an estimated total of at least 79 individuals (Khoo & Sivasothi, 2018) Thailand: L. perspicillata has been classified as vulnerable (2005) in the National Red List assessment (Nabhitabhata & Chan-ard, 2005). Remaining natural patches seem to be critical refuges for otter, allowing them to persist in an otherwise heavily transformed landscape. Recent studies in Thailand suggest that L. perspicillata can persist in highly modified fragmented if patches of natural habitats (e.g. mangroves) are still available. A camera trap study between 1996-2013 surveyed 21 sites (19 based in protected areas) recorded L. perspicillata presence in four surveys areas (19%) (Chutipong et al., 2014). In the inner Gulf of Thailand, otters use cover in traditional aquaculture ponds, but not agriculture and urban cover. In Thailand, rapid economic development and expansion of Bangkok has caused extensive destruction and fragmentation of mangrove forests along the coast: between 1961 and 2009 the coverage of mangrove forest decreased by half. Pet otters are popular in Thailand, most of the seizures of live otters reported occurred in Thailand (some at international airports (species not specific)). Pelts from Thailand are said to end up in China. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 7 46 Viet Nam: L. perspicillata presence in Viet Nam has been reported from Dak Lak and Kon Tum provinces (Duckworth & Canh, 1998). It has been suggested that L. perspicillata could possibly be extinct in Viet Nam (Willcox et al., 2016). A survey conducted in the U Minh Ha National Park in the Mekong Delta identified a seized otter skin in 2007 as L. perspicillata and it was noted that the skin had unlikely been sourced from outside of U Minh district (Willcox et al., 2017). The population of L. perspicillata is inferred to have declined by more than 30% in the last 30 years. A reduction in the population size of L. perspicillata has been observed in many parts of its range due to intense poaching and the extent of loss of habitat in south and southeast Asia. Trade criteria for inclusion in Appendix I The species is or may be affected by trade Poaching and illegal trade for use as pets, for the fur trade and for the trade in parts for traditional medicine is said to pose a significant and growing threat to all four tropical Asian otter species. Commercial exploitation of otters is taking place both domestically, and internationally in violation of CITES. Information on the overall scale of illegal trade in tropical Asian otter species is scarce, due in part at least to relatively little attention paid to the enforcement of this species. The CITES Trade Database includes very little legal trade since 1983. Exports since 2000 have been limited to live specimens for scientific or zoological purposes. Analysis of CITES Trade Data between 1977 and 2016 shows relatively small levels of trade since L. perspicillata was included on Appendix II in 1977. According to importers: - No reported direct imports of skins for the purpose of commercial trade since 1983, Germany did report a re-export of 3,058 skins in 1993 from China back to China (pre-convention specimens). - A total of 41 live animals were imported during this period, of these 13 were exported for the purpose of commercial trade and 17 for zoos.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "94d2bd66-620f-4fc9-b1dd-5f8012b02357": {"__data__": {"id_": "94d2bd66-620f-4fc9-b1dd-5f8012b02357", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "58e77e801a6cb2f8e0a39a3ef4224233b9712e26c5a8de77655b8cd56ba23ec4"}, "2": {"node_id": "c3653516-ba92-4c18-9308-0c001cdf5856", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1996779ff68d449ddb63c52cfe266bb3b6a1203586df29d51f721c0da6ca71dc"}}, "hash": "4a8e534b407d9364fcbae6b998784b85d582a34dbf1c83a2e93756f84a8809e6", "text": "- Japan imported 13 live specimens (from China and Thailand) and a further two live animals were imported into Malaysia (from Indonesia) - Two live specimens were reported to have been wild-sourced (\u201cW\u201d) and imported for the purpose of commercial trade (a further seven had no source code), all other exports were from captive-bred or captive-born sources exported from China.

They appear to have high mortality rates when they are extracted from their natural habitats (Gonzalez, 2010) but are preferred when they are younger as they are easier to tame (Feeroz et al., 2011a) and more suitable for pets. Otters have been observed for sale online in a number of countries including China, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia and in Thailand, where the possession of otters is prohibited and all native otter species are protected (Siriwat & Nijman, 2018, Gomez & Bouhuys, Aadrean, 2013). Although there is evidence that L. perspicillata is also targeted for the international pet trade, evidence suggests that they are less in demand than the smaller Asian Small-clawed Otter Aonyx cinereus (Gomez & Bouhuys, 2018). Skins: Seizures of otter skins have declined since 2005; however, the reason for this decline is not clear. Between 1980 and 2015; 2,949 otter pelts were seized in India, although few can be identified down to the species-level, given that L. perspicillata pelts are desirable, a significant number are likely L. perspicillata. Of these 787 were seized in Delhi, a northern Indian city that serves as a hub for wildlife traders moving goods into Nepal, some pelts had been marked with Tibetan script, suggesting they were likely destined for the Tibetan Autonomous Region. In Cambodia and Lao PDR, all of the specimens seized (species not specific) between 1980 and 2015 were dead specimens, mostly skins, suggesting that poaching is largely motivated by the demand for pelts. Analysis of CITES trade data show that there have been no reported exports of L. perspicillata skins since 1983.All exports of skins prior to 1983 were from unreported sources, except for 3,058 skins exported from Germany from pre-convention specimens. Observations of skin trade online in China found posts advertising otter fur, especially for hats but advertisements were not down to the species-level, some advertisements stated that the furs were imported from Canada or United States (Y. Wang, in litt., 2019). As there have been no legal exports of skins since 1983 as evident from CITES trade data, the origin of these skins is questionable. The main market for the trade in otter fur is China and more specifically in the Tibetan Autonomous Region (Yoxon & Yoxon, 2015). In the Tibetan Autonomous Region, otter pelts are used to decorate chupas, a traditional garment and according to one garment-maker, it takes three otters to decorate one chupa. In China otters were widely harvested between the 1950s and 1980s, in 1955 a total of 25,733 otter pelts were harvested from Hubei Province alone, however due to over-exploitation the production of otter pelts declined by over 90% in provinces such as Julin, Anhui, Fujian, Guangdong and Guangxi from the 1950s to 1980s (Zhang et al., 2018). In 2008 it was reported that one otter fur would sell for USD200 and therefore a high economic incentive to fuel this illegal trade (Yoxon & Yoxon, 2015), although this information is not provided at the species-level. A study by Gomez et al. (2016) analysed 161 otter seizures across 15 countries in Asia between 1980 and 2015 and estimated to have involved 5,881 individuals. Of these seizures the majority (99%) consisted of otter skins in China, India and Nepal. A large number of skins (82%) were unable to be identified down to the species-level which makes it difficult to determine the level of trade for Asian otter species (Gomez et al, 2016).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cd054f06-d0e2-450a-877a-05fa9bfefe39": {"__data__": {"id_": "cd054f06-d0e2-450a-877a-05fa9bfefe39", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "62b486dc965c6550f7268f07a643bdb02684f0c7e1256c5338908f84acf54414"}, "2": {"node_id": "dd458263-ef76-4321-bd22-5708bc92641c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6cabf1b5f745d0569b895f5b1d81663f0ff2852f52c1f9c666a2f5031900d3db"}}, "hash": "ea8f63920a700ef0cfe977d06533c35015af461d540c937ca13ab4d52f0de6a7", "text": "Medicine: A search conducted on Chinese markets online for medicinal products derived from otters found products from otter liver advertised on Alibaba and Jingdong, however these advertisements were not at the species-level (Y.

Additional Information Threats In northern South-east Asia, international trade has probably been a substantial part of the problem causing declines, but cannot be considered the only, nor even the main driver of illegal offtake (W. Duckworth, in litt., 2019). In addition to international and domestic trade, throughout its range L. perspicillata faces threats including human development and natural wetland conversion for agriculture including aquaculture, plantations (e.g. coffee, palm oil, tree plantations and rice fields), wetland reclamation; siltation due to deforestation; pollution by pesticides; mining; quarrying; slash-and-burn agriculture. The global extent of wetlands is now estimated to have declined between 64-71% since 1900 and habitat loss and degradation continues worldwide (Ramsar, 2015). Evidence suggests that although available otter habitat is decreasing and wetlands continued to be converted into agriculture throughout much of L. perspicillata range, otters are adapted to survive in moderately disturbed habitats where there is some level of human presence (Mohapatra et al., 2014,). A further threat to otters is a reduced prey base from overfishing and the species\u2019 preference for crabs and other invertebrates makes water contamination from inappropriate or illegal pesticide use in wetlands, as well as organochlorides, heavy metals", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "24400f60-6082-4a41-97eb-17e420c28124": {"__data__": {"id_": "24400f60-6082-4a41-97eb-17e420c28124", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c156e1a5d5c76a52f5d21e716e9efd5b45f36109e103ae32d1e84023ecc998d5"}, "3": {"node_id": "81f7d7e9-61cb-4818-9a56-2cbc4598ba11", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0ed779acb30bec375fa08e7957829988844e0ad03a3c0d4d93055885a6297f24"}}, "hash": "d4868b6db4291d7465f9cd74e8c5753c73561a53480463048f57aaa72ffb8f31", "text": "and other pollutants an important concern. The common practice of dumping garbage in the wetlands is also a threat to otters, whose scat has been observed to contain plastics. Fishermen are known to kill otters as a competitor for fish. Destructive fish killing practices are common in the Western Ghats where dynamite fishing, bleach fishing and electric-rod based fishing and the use of pesticides in banana plantations and rice fields. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 7 51 Climate change is predicted to seriously impact otter populations worldwide. L. perspicillata, like all otter, depend on rivers, lakes and streams, which face dramatic alteration under a warming scenario, reducing water levels in long-term droughts and affecting prey densities. Conservation, management and legislation Lutrogale perspicillata has legal protection in range States except Cambodia, Brunei Darussalam (status in Bangladesh unclear). No management plants or species-specific conservation measure are known to be in place for L. perspicillata in range States, although development of a management plan is suggested under the Pakistan 2018 National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan. Lutrogale perspicillata has been included in CITES Appendix II since the subfamily Lutrinae was listed in 1977. Lutrogale perspicillata inhabits protected areas in numerous countries and some, including India and Nepal, provide enhanced protection for otters. In Karnataka, India, the first-ever dedicated otter conservation reserve has been developed in 2016 and reserved a 34km stretch along the Tungabhadra river (Duplaix & Savage, 2018). Artificial propagation/captive breeding There have been reports of otter farms, in China (Y. Wang, in litt., 2019), and Pakistan (IOSF, 2014). In both Indonesia and Thailand there have been unconfirmed/unverified reports of otters being bred for the purpose of trade (Gomez & Bouhuys, 2018). It is possible that juveniles and newborn pups which are extracted from the wild are then sold as captive-bred or used as breeding stock. In the wild it has been observed that the average litter size is 1-5 pups (Hwang & Larivi\u00e8re, 2005) and in captivity L. perspicillata was observed to produce litter sizes between 2-5 (mean =3.25) (Desai, 1974). Lutrogale perspicillata are bred in many zoos across South and South-east Asia (including in Thailand, Cambodia, Viet Nam, Malaysia and Singapore). Few European or American Zoos hold or breed L. perspicillata. The Twycross Zoo in the United Kingdom was the first in the Western Hemisphere to breed L. perspicillata in 1972. Breeding for reintroduction purposes has not been attempted. In Bangladesh, fishing with otters has been practiced for the last two hundred years (Feeroz et al., 2011b). A small semi-captive population exists in Noraile district which is used for traditional fishing, however this population has also been found to have declined by more than 80% in the last two decades (Feeroz, 2014). A study on the breeding activities of L. perspicillata in Bangladesh (Feeroz et al., 2011b) in different captive conditions. The study found that 90% of adult females gave birth at 3-4 years of age in semi-captive conditions and overall breeding success recorded for the study was 90%. This study proposed the development of an ex- situ management plan for L. perspicillata in Bangladesh. The generation length is said to be 10 years (de Silva et al., 2015). Implementation challenges (including similar species) Unprocessed fur of otters allows for distinction of specimens at the species-level (Kuhn, 2009). Although, mammalian hair microscopy for species identification is widely used for ecological, forensic and/or economic purposes, few such guidelines are publicly availably and cover only some otter species. There is very little published material that would allow the simple distinguishing of processed pelts, therefore, it would be challenging for untrained officials to distinguish between processed pelts (Gomez et al., 2016). Analysis of CITES Trade Data indicates that legal trade in this species appears to be relatively small.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "81f7d7e9-61cb-4818-9a56-2cbc4598ba11": {"__data__": {"id_": "81f7d7e9-61cb-4818-9a56-2cbc4598ba11", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c156e1a5d5c76a52f5d21e716e9efd5b45f36109e103ae32d1e84023ecc998d5"}, "2": {"node_id": "24400f60-6082-4a41-97eb-17e420c28124", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d4868b6db4291d7465f9cd74e8c5753c73561a53480463048f57aaa72ffb8f31"}}, "hash": "0ed779acb30bec375fa08e7957829988844e0ad03a3c0d4d93055885a6297f24", "text": "Much of the trade of L. perspicillata is illegal (and some domestic) and therefore inclusion in Appendix I may not have any significant impact on the threat from international trade of this species.

From 2015-2018, the number of rhinos known to have been poached in Africa is estimated to have declined by a third. Although poaching remains at a high level particularly in Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe, provisional data for 2018 indicate that the numbers of rhino killed by poachers per day (2.6) declined to its lowest level since 2012. Ceratotherium simum simum was assessed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List in 2011. Around 86% of the population is in South Africa. The Rhinocerotidae family was included in Appendix I in 1977. The South African population of C. s. simum was transferred to Appendix II in 1994 with the following annotation: \u201cFor the exclusive purpose of allowing international trade in live animals to appropriate and acceptable destinations and hunting trophies. All other specimens shall be deemed to be specimens of species included in Appendix I and the trade in them shall be regulated accordingly\u201d. In 2004 a proposal was accepted to transfer Eswatini's population to Appendix II using the same annotation. Having become extinct in Eswatini in the mid-20th century, C. s. simum was reintroduced to the country from South Africa in 1965. The population reached a peak of around 120 in the late 1980s but was reduced to around 20-30 animals in the early 1990s by poaching. The population is confined to secure sites in two protected areas. Improved protection, including through a change to national legislation, led to an increase in the population to 60 individuals in 2004. In 2015 the population numbered 90 individuals, which then reduced to 66 in 2017 due to drought, and is currently estimated at 79.

According to the proponent, no trophy hunting of C. s. simum has taken place because all rhinos occur in reserves where sport and trophy hunting are not permitted. All reported trade from Eswatini has been to South Africa; since 2004 Eswatini exported 19 live individuals to South Africa (and imported 28 animals). On a continental scale, the cost and risk of keeping rhinos has risen and many private owners are now reported to be leaving the market. In Eswatini, the recent drought meant the rhinos were fed fodder at great cost. This proposal is to delete the existing annotation as it applies to Eswatini's population, with the intention of allowing limited and regulated trade in stockpiles of C. s. simum horn which has been legally collected in the past or recovered from poached Eswatini rhino (totalling 330 kg), as well as horn to be harvested annually in a non-lethal way in the future (amounting to up to 20 kg per year). The proponent notes that it would reserve the right to adjust prices and amounts adaptively once sales commence. The Supporting Statement provides the following details on implementation: the CITES Management Authority of Eswatini will be the sole seller, and will sell to a small number of licensed retailers (likely including Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) hospitals in the Far East). Horn will be \u201cproperly documented, certificated and recorded on a DNA database, a national register and with the CITES IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 8 56 Secretariat to safeguard its integrity\u201d. The CITES Secretariat will be requested to closely monitor consignments, and trade will be open to inspection and verification by the CITES Secretariat. If legal trade is ultimately proven to pose a renewed threat to the subspecies, then further trade would be prohibited by Eswatini. The Proponent states that its intention is to use proceeds from the horn sales to fund conservation, including security and improved park employee pay. Analysis: Removal of the annotation would mean that all specimens of C. s. simum exported from Eswatini would be subject to Appendix II regulation. There are no specific guidelines for assessing proposals to change annotations of this nature, but it seems appropriate to ensure that satisfactory precautionary measures, as detailed in Annex 4 of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17), remain in place: Annex 4 2 a) i): the subspecies is in demand, and the proposed amendment has the potential to stimulate trade (it is unlikely that 20 kg per year will meet global demand). It is not possible to predict if legalising trade in rhino horn from one population will stimulate trade in other populations. While legal trade could replace some of the demand currently being met by illegally obtained horn, raise funds for conservation and/or reduce the \u201cexclusive\u201d status of horn to certain consumers, legalisation could also lead to new consumers entering the market who had previously been put off by its illegality. The proponent states that if the trade were judged to be having a negative impact on the subspecies it would be stopped, although no clear mechanism is proposed for how such an assessment would be undertaken. Annex 4 2 a) ii): management measures in place since 2004 have seen the Eswatini population increase, despite a recent drought-induced decline. Few details are provided as to how the proposed legal trade will be carried out and controlled; for example it is not specified which importing countries would permit a legal trade (China recently reaffirmed its 25-year ban on the use of rhino horn for TCM), how retailers (including international) would be selected, how and by whom these would be licensed, or how trade would be monitored throughout the trade chain (including in end-user markets) to avoid laundering, and who would fund this. While the CITES Secretariat is identified as playing a significant role, it is not clear how it would undertake this work, similarly it is not clear if authorities in importing countries have been consulted. Eswatini has provided some detail on precautionary measured that they would implement, but it is not clear what safeguards would be implemented by any anticipated trade partners or even which countries would be able legally to import the horn. In summary, this proposal does not provide sufficient information to address the precautionary measures in Annex 4 to Res.

IUCN Global Category Globally assessed as Near Threatened (assessed 2011, ver. 3.1). Summary of Population, Distribution and Rhino Horn in Eswatini Eswatini\u2019s rhino population occurs in two parks, Hlane Royal National Park (est. 1967) (217 km2 (Protected Planet, 2019)) and Mkhaya Game Reserve (est. 1980) (100 km2 (Protected Planet, 2019)). White rhino are also likely to be placed in the Mlilwane Wildlife Sanctuary (est. 1961) (46 km2 (Protected Planet, 2019) in the future. Ceratotherium simum simum became extinct in Eswatini due to hunting under colonial rule, but was re-introduced to Mlilwane Wildlife Sanctuary in 1965 using animals from South Africa. More animals were sent to Hlane Royal National Park in the late 1960s and to Mkhaya Game Reserve when secure habitat became available in the 1980s. The population increased in Hlane and Mkhaya Parks to approximately 120 animals by 1988, but poaching during the \u201crhino war\u201d of 1988-1992 reduced the number to 24 (33 in 1993 - with rhino poaching in the country peaking in 1991 (R. Emslie, in litt., 2019)). Three rhino have been poached in Eswatini since (two in 2011 and one in 2014), and the population in Eswatini as of the end of 2017 was 66 after recent drought mortalities. The population has since increased to 79 following good calving rates in response to better rains, emergency supplementary feeding and lower post-drought densities of competing grazers (R. Emslie, in litt., 2019). Legal rhino horn is kept in stockpiles in various places within Eswatini. This horn has been legally collected from natural deaths, horn knock-offs and legitimate management actions (including dehorning and horn-tipping for translocation) over many years, or has been recovered from illegally hunted Eswatini rhino. The mean weight of adult horns is 5.16 + 2.0kg for the front horn, and 1.86 + 1.0kg for the posterior horn. Their horns grow continuously throughout their life at approximately one kg per year. Since 2004 Eswatini has sold or exchanged, and exported white rhino bulls to South Africa, and imported white rhino cows and bulls for genetic and sex ratio purposes. Eswatini reported exporting 19 live C. s. simum between 2004 and 2016 (all of which went to South Africa), and importing 28 live animals from South Africa during the same period (CITES Trade Database, 2019).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a020e296-ef72-4375-8c0d-724e82face6a": {"__data__": {"id_": "a020e296-ef72-4375-8c0d-724e82face6a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d0a624cc6a7ce72acec917eef1d553a64aa515c53a33bbf1f4c1ebcb7af2eb79"}, "2": {"node_id": "ba75408c-60af-4538-a0cc-3a1f375dc562", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "df3511300eef3fcf76ef635fc14927b0088a5cb04d927e8e9520d214b1f38c85"}}, "hash": "89a319ae9f5853efe2c83363fcd60904db3c92a116814b5f8129238c17a2d7d1", "text": "Precautionary Measures Species likely to be in demand for trade, but its management is such that the CoP will be satisfied with: A) Implementation by the range States of the requirements of the Convention, in particular Article IV; and B) appropriate enforcement controls and compliance with the requirements of the Convention Export quota or other special measure This proposal is for Eswatini to sell from existing stock 330 kg of rhino horn and also up to 20 kg per year, including harvested horn.

Other than indicating that it will be non-lethal, the Supporting Statement (SS) does not provide details as to how horn would be collected from living individuals. Routine temporary immobilisation for dehorning is a standardised procedure in some South African white rhino populations with no clear adverse effects on the population or its breeding performance (Emslie, R. in litt., 2016). The SS provides the following detail on how the horn trade will be controlled: Big Game Parks, the CITES Management Authority of Eswatini, will be the sole seller and horn will be sold directly to a small number of licenced retailers, which is likely to include Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) hospitals in the Far East. All horn offered for sale will be properly documented, certificated and recorded on a DNA database, a national register and with the CITES Secretariat to safeguard its integrity (the DNA database will be RhoDIS (Rhino DNA Index System) (R. Emslie, in litt.. 2019). All traded specimens will carry DNA certificates and the Secretariat will be requested to closely monitor consignments. The retailers will be licensed and will qualify by undertaking not to trade horn from illegal sources. The breach of such will disqualify such traders. The trading operation will be open to inspection and verification by the CITES Secretariat. If, for some unexpected reason, a legal trade is ultimately proven to pose a renewed threat to the species, then the trade will be closed down by Eswatini. The proceeds from the sale of stocks should raise approximately USD 9.9 million, and will be placed in a conservation endowment fund. The proceeds of the annual sale of up to 20 kg of horn will raise a further USD 600,000 per annum bringing total recurrent annual income from horn to USD 1.2 million. Eswatini would reserve the right to adjust prices and amounts adaptively once sales commence. The SS states that the proceeds from the sale of horn are needed by Eswatini\u2019s rhino parks to cover security costs, improved pay of park employees, additional infrastructure and equipment, range expansion and supplementary food during periods of drought, and that proceeds will also be used to provide for sustainable long-term developments, all of which will strengthen species protection and other nature conservation initiatives, while also benefitting neighbouring rural communities and the country as a whole. Additional Information Threats Despite losing only one Southern White Rhinoceros to poaching in the period 2012-2017, Eswatini\u2019s population declined by 21% over the same period due to severe drought (Emslie et al., 2019), which affected southeast Africa between 2015 and 2017 and reduced the white rhino population to 66 animals. It was necessary to provide supplementary fodder, which was said to be difficult to find and very expensive to buy and store. Some rhino were lost as not all animals adapted readily to being artificially fed. In addition to the loss of adult stock, calves either perished or were orphaned, and some were hand-reared at a cost of at least USD 12,000 per calf to raise. Conservation, management and legislation The entire rhinoceros family, the Rhinocerotidae, was included in Appendix I of CITES in 1977. The South African population of C. s. simum was transferred to Appendix II in 1994 under the following annotation: \u201cFor the exclusive purpose of allowing international trade in live animals to appropriate and acceptable destinations and hunting trophies. All other specimens shall be deemed to be specimens of species included in Appendix I and the trade in them shall be regulated accordingly.\u201d In 2004, a proposal to transfer the population of Eswatini (then Swaziland) to Appendix II using the same annotation was accepted. In agreeing to this transfer, the CoP agreed that the precautionary measures in Annex 4 of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) were met based on management measures described in the Supporting Statement. Rhino poaching and trafficking offences are punishable in Eswatini by mandatory custodial sentences of 5 \u2013 15 years without the option of a fine, plus replacement of the poached rhino.

However, on 12th November 2018, a statement by State Council Executive Deputy Secretary-General Ding Xuedong announced that the detailed regulations for implementation of the October Notice had been \"postponed after study\", and that the strict bans on domestic rhino horn use and trade would continue to be enforced (China.org, 2018).

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 9 60 Transfer of the population of Namibia of Southern White Rhinoceros Ceratotherium simum simum from Appendix I to Appendix II with an annotation Proponent: Namibia Summary: The Southern White Rhinoceros Ceratotherium simum simum is one of two subspecies of White Rhinoceros (the other being the Northern White Rhinoceros C. s. cottoni, now believed extinct in the wild). In 2012 the global wild population was estimated at around 21,300, having increased from a few hundred at most in the 1920s. Owing to a combination of increased poaching since 2008 (particularly in Kruger National Park, South Africa), and drought in southern Africa (which has now eased in parts), numbers declined to around 18,000 in 2017. From 2015-2018, the number of rhinos known to have been poached in Africa is estimated to have declined by a third. Although poaching remains at a high level particularly in Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe, provisional data for 2018 indicate that the numbers of rhino killed by poachers per day (2.6) declined to its lowest level since 2012. Ceratotherium simum simum was categorised on the IUCN Red List as Near Threatened in 2011. Around 86% of the population is in South Africa. The Rhinocerotidae family was included in Appendix I in 1977.

Having become extinct in Namibia before the end of the 19th century, C. s. simum was first reintroduced to Namibia in 1975 when 16 animals were imported from South Africa. The population was estimated at 293 in 2005, and the most recent population estimate (2017-2018) is nearly 1,100, almost 800 of which are reported to be in private ownership across 70 populations, with the remainder in national protected areas. This increase is due to both an intrinsic population increase and imports of live animals from South Africa: between 2002 and 2017 South Africa recorded the export of nearly 400 C. s. simum to Namibia, 80% of these from 2012 onwards.

Virtually all resulting trophies appear to have been exported. Reported poaching in Namibia has until recently been at a very low level (three animals poached in total for the years 2008-2013). Poaching has increased but is still at a relatively low level (average of nine animals per year for 2015-2018) and is lower than the intrinsic population growth rate. However, poaching of Black Rhinoceros Diceros bicornis in Namibia has been much higher: averaging approximately 50 animals per year for the period 2014-2018 (2.4% of the current population per year), although for both taxa not all poached carcasses will have been discovered so this may be an underestimate. Due to increasing security costs which are reported not to be offset by available means of utilisation, a future reduction in private ownership is considered a significant threat. Ceratotherium simum simum is classified as a \u201cSpecially Protected\u201d species under Namibian legislation. Permits are needed for possession of live animals or their parts, and for utilisation, movement, imports and exports. Transport or hunting permits are only issued if the rhino in question has been microchipped and DNA profiled with samples sent to the RhODIS database. Only Namibia- registered game dealers are allowed to capture and trade wild animals and only Namibia-registered professional hunters and operators are allowed to conduct hunting. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 9 61 Analysis: The Namibian population of Ceratotherium simum simum does not have a restricted distribution. Its population is relatively small, but is increasing owing to a combination of intrinsic population growth and imports. Nearly 80% of the population is in around 70 privately-owned subpopulations. Although the poaching rate has increased, it is currently less than 1% of the population annually, which is lower than the intrinsic population growth rate. Overall, the Namibian population does not meet the biological criteria for retention in Appendix I. The species is in demand for international trade. The proposed annotation, which restricts the kinds of specimens and type of export trade to be permitted, can be considered a special measure under the terms of the precautionary measures in Annex 4 of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17). Namibia already undertakes such trade under the Appendix I listing and has a system in place to licence and track specimens in trade. The annotation in question has been used for export of this subspecies from South Africa and Eswatini for several years with no apparent problems.

Both live animals and trophies are currently in trade from Namibia under the Appendix I-listing. The proponent states that transferring the population to Appendix II will enable Namibia to export live animals and hunting trophies to more countries and will increase revenue through sustainable use. From 2008 to 2018 a total of 57 white rhino were legally hunted in Namibia, indicating an average annual offtake of 0.4-0.5% of the population, considerably below the rate of recruitment. Between 2008 and 2017, Namibia reported exporting 47 trophies (reported as Ceratotherium simum and Ceratotherium simum simum), in addition to a number of other commodities exported for hunting trophy purposes including 10 horns (CITES Trade Database, 2019). Between 2008 and 2018, under the current Appendix-I listing, Namibia exported 27 live white rhinos to Angola, Cuba, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Africa. According to the CITES Trade Database, importers reported importing 46 live white rhino from Namibia: the Democratic Republic of the Congo (32), China (eight), Cuba (five) and South Africa (one). In the same time period, Namibia only reported exports of seven live white rhino (CITES Trade Database, 2019). Between 2002 and 2016 South Africa reported the export of 371 live white rhino to Namibia, 80% of these from 2012 onwards (CITES Trade Database, 2019). Reported incidents of illegal killing of C. s. simum in Namibia have until recently been at a very low level (three animals poached in total for the years 2008-2013) (Figure 1). Poaching has increased since then to an average of nine animals per year for 2015-2018 (see graph). Emslie et. al. (2019) report total poaching of 291 Black and Southern White Rhinoceros in Namibia in the period 2011 to 21 November 2018. Poaching of Black Rhinoceros in Namibia has been much higher than Southern White Rhinoceros, averaging approximately 50 animals per year for the years 2014-2018 which represents around 2.4% of the current Black Rhinoceros population per year (based on information in the SS and Emslie, et al. 2019).

Namibia provided an update on its implementation of Res. Conf. 9.14 (Rev. CoP17) Conservation of and trade in African and Asian rhinoceroses to SC70 (SC70 Doc. 56 A9).

This means that permits are required for possession of white rhinos or their parts, and for utilisation, movement, imports and exports. The Ministry of Environment and Tourism permit office at Windhoek issues all permits relating to white rhinoceros and their parts or derivatives. Private owners only receive transport or hunting permits if the relevant individuals have been microchipped and DNA profiled with samples send to the RhODIS database housed at Onderstepoort, South Africa. Private owners have their own monitoring systems and stud books. Only Namibian registered game dealers are allowed to capture and trade wild animals. In the case of hunting, only Namibian registered professional hunters and operators/outfitters are allowed to conduct hunting. Domestic consumptive use of white rhinoceros and trade in rhinoceros horn and other products is currently not permitted in Namibia. Export quota or other special measure The proposal is for trade in live animals to appropriate and acceptable destinations and hunting trophies only. Additional Information Threats As noted above, ongoing poaching of C. s. simum for international trade is of concern. The proponents state that another serious threat is that private owners will dispose of their rhinos, which constitute the largest part of the Namibian population, if the costs of rhino protection cannot be offset by the available means of utilisation of and trade in this species. The costs of protection have been and can be expected to continue escalating, increasingly making rhino \u201ca liability to conservation authorities, private and communal landowners\u201d. Existing benefit streams from tourism, limited trophy hunting and live sales of rhinoceros are reported not to be sufficient to offset these security costs. Conservation, management and legislation See \u201cprecautionary measures\u201d above. Almost 17% of the land surface of Namibia has been designated as protected areas, including approximately 30% of the potential habitat for C. s. simum. Implementation challenges (including similar species) The only similar species is the Black Rhinoceros Diceros bicornis of which there are approximately 5,500, including 1,857 in Namibia. This proposal is restricted to trade in C. s. simum only. References Emslie, R. Milliken, T., Talukdar, B., Burgess, G., Adcock, K., Balfour, D.& Knight, M. H. (compilers) (2019).

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Elephant Overview 64 Background to the African Elephant proposals The African Elephant Loxodonta africana occurs in 38 range States in Africa. It was included in Appendix II in 1977 and transferred to Appendix I in 1989. The populations of Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe were transferred to Appendix II in 1997, and the population of South Africa in 2000. These transfers were subject to detailed conditions that were further modified during subsequent meetings of the Conference of the Parties, including an annotation agreed at CoP14. The annotation allowed for trade in various non-ivory African Elephant specimens and products under a range of conditions, somewhat different for each of the four range States in question. With regard to trade in ivory, it allowed for trade in individually marked and certified ekipas incorporated in finished jewellery for non- commercial purposes for Namibia and ivory carvings for non-commercial purposes for Zimbabwe.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4b1607b8-3095-494a-a51c-17c8afb8862d": {"__data__": {"id_": "4b1607b8-3095-494a-a51c-17c8afb8862d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9d7181fb7bbd9e1fc9ec0bcae49188a3e0626922fbb1cc3104e917eeca25254e"}, "2": {"node_id": "ce29fcaf-f2e5-4380-ab47-678fcffab19e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "31faa0ba2fb88952844e315c0f4b7face3dabd52091daa03bf8e3471a4937668"}}, "hash": "755b7a081dd8ef55e2a73c86671fe2827bf71c2fe23b8e025548fb152a620f23", "text": "It also allowed for these four range States to dispose of agreed quantities of stockpiled raw ivory in a one-off sale, under a series of restrictions.

This Decision was deleted at CoP16 and the CoP agreed Decision 16.55 which again directed the Standing Committee, with the assistance of the Secretariat, to propose for approval at the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (CoP17) a decision-making mechanism for a process of trade in ivory under the auspices of the Conference of the Parties. This Decision was also not implemented as no such decision-making mechanism was submitted to CoP17. Parties at CoP17 did not agree to any extension of the work on the development of the decision-making mechanism. The original Decision 14.78 instructed the Standing Committee to conduct ongoing comprehensive reviews of the status of the elephant, trade in its specimens and the impact of the legal trade, based on data from Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE), the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) and the implementation of the Action plan for the control of trade in elephant ivory and the African Elephant action plan, developed as directed in Decision 14.75 and adopted by the African Elephant range States in 2010. Decision 14.78 was substantively revised at CoP15 and CoP16, the revisions shifting responsibility for action from the Standing Committee to other actors, principally the Secretariat.

CoP16), in preparation for the 65th and 66th meetings of the Standing Committee the Secretariat was instructed, to: \u2022 produce an updated analysis of MIKE data, pending the availability of adequate new MIKE data; \u2022 invite TRAFFIC to submit an updated analysis of ETIS data and UNEP-WCMC to provide an overview of the latest elephant trade data; \u2022 invite the IUCN/SSC African and Asian Elephant Specialist Groups to submit any new and relevant information on the conservation status of elephants, and on pertinent conservation actions and management strategies; \u2022 invite the African elephant range States to provide information on progress made in the implementation of the African elephant action plan; \u2022 on the basis of the information specified above, recommend actions for consideration by the Standing Committee. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Elephant Overview 65 At CoP17, Parties agreed to incorporate the provisions of the Decision into Res. Conf. 10.10 (Rev. CoP17) Trade in elephant specimens and these are now paragraph 11 of that Resolution. A further issue of note in recent years has been the issue of domestic ivory markets, with many countries significantly increasing level of restrictions imposed on the sale of ivory nationally, such as China\u2019s landmark closure of its domestic ivory market. Amendments to Res. Conf. 10.10 were adopted at CoP17, recommending that Parties in whose jurisdiction there is a legal domestic market for ivory that is contributing to poaching or illegal trade take all necessary legislative, regulatory and enforcement measures to close their domestic markets for commercial trade in raw and worked ivory. In response to growing concerns over levels of illegal ivory trade, a process to address this through development of National Ivory Action Plan\u2019s (NIAPs) was initiated within CITES. This involves key Parties implicated in the global illicit ivory trade developing country-specific action plans that outline urgent actions or activities that need to be implemented against specified time frames and milestones for implementation. Various amendments made to Res. Conf. 10.10 at CoP17 further streamlined NIAP processes, enhancing the level of consultation with the Parties involved in the making of decisions, as well as providing them with guidelines in implementing their NIAPs. The process has resulted in many very positive actions taken by a wide range of players, with the 70th meeting CITES Standing Committee agreeing to China, Kenya, Philippines, Tanzania and Thailand and Uganda exiting the oversight process due to progress made.

Zambia submitted proposals to transfer its population of Loxodonta africana to Appendix II at CoP12 in 2002 and at CoP15 in 2010, both of which were rejected. For the most recent proposal submitted at CoP15 a panel of experts was convened in conformity with Res. Conf. 10.9 Consideration of proposals for the transfer of African elephant populations from Appendix I to Appendix II. The Panel of Experts made a generally favourable response having visited Zambia and reviewed the status and management of its elephant populations and Zambia\u2019s ability to control trade in ivory. No Panel of Experts has been convened to assess these factors in detail this time and we have been constrained to the assessment of the information contained within the proposal and its Supporting Statement (SS). We present here an assessment of this information against Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17). However, the proponent may be able to provide further detail on factors relating to control of ivory not included within the SS, which would help Parties in their consideration of this proposal. The SS states that the number of Loxodonta africana in Zambia declined significantly due to poaching in the 1970s and 1980s with estimated populations declining from 200,000 in 1972 to ca. 18,000 by 1989. The most comprehensive and reliable information on distribution and population of the species is contained in the African Elephant Database (AED), maintained by the IUCN SSC African Elephant Specialist Group, and presented in the African Elephant Status Reports (AESR), the latest of which was published in 2016. The 2016 report estimates a range of approximately 170,000 km2 for Zambia and a total population estimate of ca. 22,000. Data for Zambia\u2019s population of elephants from the African Elephant Database are: 2002 \u2013 12,457 definite, 6,961 probable, 7,631 possible and 235 speculative; 2006 \u2013 16,562 definite, 5,948 probable, 5,908 possible and 813 speculative; 2015 \u2013 21,967 \u00b1 4,703 (based on systematic survey data). There may be an additional 214 to 314 in areas not systematically surveyed. CoP18 Doc. 69.2 (Report on Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE)) contains the most up- to-date synthesised information on illegal killing of elephants, based on information from 2003 until the end of 2017. It reports on the proportion of illegally killed elephants (PIKE) at more than 60 sites in 30 countries in Africa and 28 sites in 13 countries in Asia. A PIKE level of 0.5 has been used as a threshold above which elephant populations are very likely to be in net decline, although the report suggests that the use of the 0.5 PIKE \u201cthreshold\u201d should be treated with some caution. The southern African subregion (Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe) was assessed as having a PIKE level of 0.48 in the most recent assessment, having increased from 0.41 in 2016.

The proponent argues that the proposed annotation is in conformity with the precautionary measures as defined in Annex 4 of the above- mentioned Resolution. However, the SS gives little information, nor does it detail any regulatory or enforcement controls as appropriate measures to ensure it complies with the requirements of the Convention, although the proponents do state that in general \u201cZambia has demonstrated its capacity to comply with the requirements of CITES both by the implementation of the Convention and by further enacting legislation to domesticate the Convention\u201d and that \u201cControlled legal trade shall provide the required funding for enforcement and management\u201d. Population monitoring measures are described. No details are given for measures on controlling trade in ivory, such as stockpile management and law enforcement measures. A quota system has been in place for trophy hunting, which would presumably continue to be employed. Analysis: The Loxodonta africana population of Zambia is not small, nor does it have a restricted distribution. Although it underwent a marked decline since the 1970s, the population size appears to have been relatively stable in the last decade. This population appears therefore not to meet the biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I. There is a lack of clarity over the intention of the proposal with regard to trade in ivory. Little detail is given on proposed management to ensure that Article IV requirements would be met or of any appropriate enforcement controls in place. On the basis of the information provided it is not possible to determine that the precautionary safeguards are met. Summary of Available Information Text in non-italics is based on information in the Proposal and Supporting Statement (SS); text in italics is based on additional information and/or assessment of information in the SS. Range This proposal relates to the population of Zambia. IUCN Global Category Vulnerable A2a (2008) ver 3.1 Biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I A) Small wild population The African Elephant Status Report 2016 concluded the estimated population in Zambia is 21,967 \u00b1 4,703 in 2015 (Thouless et al., 2016), noting that there may be an additional 214 to 314 elephants in areas not systematically surveyed. These guesses likely represented a minimum number, and actual numbers could have been higher than those reported. Together, this estimate and guess applied to 105,461 km2, which was 62% of the estimated known range and possible elephant range. There remains an additional 38% of the estimated range for which no elephant population estimates were available. According to the SS, 13,898 Loxodonta africana were estimated in the Luangwa Valley, followed by 6,688 individuals in the Kafue, 1,125 in the Lower Zambezi and 48 estimated in the Sioma-Ngwezi system. B) Restricted area of distribution The SS states that Loxodonta africana is distributed in seven subregions in Zambia which exceeds 170,000 km2 in total; this includes Luangwa valley, Mid Zambezi Valley, Kafue areas, Sioma Ngwezi and West Zambezi, and Bangweulu and Nsumbu. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 10 68 C) Decline in number of wild individuals In Zambia, Loxodonta africana numbers, range and connectivity have been much reduced over the past 40 years (CITES, 2010). The number of L. africana populations declined significantly due to poaching in the 1970s and 1980s, with Zambia\u2019s estimated population declining from 200,000 in 1972 to ca. 18,000 by 1989 (Chomba et al., 2012; Ministry of Tourism, 2003). In recent years, its elephant population appears to have been relatively stable. The main changes have been a reduction in \u201cguesses\u201d from isolated small populations such as West Lunga and Bangweulu. There has been a substantial reduction in numbers in Sioma Ngwezi National Park but this makes up a small proportion (2%) of the national population (Thouless et al., 2016). The carcass ratio for Kafue National Park was only 1% in 2008 and increased to 7% by 2015 (DNPW, 2016) giving some cause for concern, despite the apparent stability of the population.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9b389b3d-ed2d-44f4-bd35-472e20b7a0ae": {"__data__": {"id_": "9b389b3d-ed2d-44f4-bd35-472e20b7a0ae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1b5c8bb9db68cf60d9f04e1a33db93cc830ffa8365c22950d5decc50e37a2b2a"}, "2": {"node_id": "b3a581eb-10eb-4e9a-baf3-c6977316a613", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8625f5c4f8f4b0c1dfbb7e645c2d94878bd820ff53e6083dd88141b08d9293ea"}}, "hash": "986afe5d1ca5a0f3e6c3d3be8663235cc3337d9a79486f4f62e9e42d51927db4", "text": "In Sioma Ngwezi National Park the carcass ratio increased dramatically from 3% to 85% between 2008 and 2015 (DNPW, 2016) indicating either high levels of poaching and/or a seasonally varying population.

Zambia increased its annual export quota of hunting trophies from 40 (tusks and other hunting trophies from 20 animals) to 160 (tusks and other trophies from 80 animals) in 2011 (CITES, 2019) after the USA allowed imports of tusks and other trophies for non-commercial purposes from Zambia in 2010. Zambia declared a temporary suspension of elephant hunting in 2013 (Thouless et al., 2016), and the quota for tusks and other trophies was not reported to CITES in 2013 and 2014. The annual export quota was 160 (tusks and other trophies from 80 animals) from 2015 to 2017 but those for 2018 and 2019 are not available on the CITES website (accessed on 9th January 2019). The SS suggests the quota level is still conservative and below the standing population guideline; it is also within the limit of hunting for trophies suggested by the Panel of Experts in 2010 (120 animals with close monitoring of trophy quality) (CITES, 2010). According to the CITES Trade Database, Zambia exported 31 trophies and 166 tusks for non-commercial purposes between 2005 and 2016 (Zambia had not submitted annual reports for 2013, 2017 and 2018 as of 10th January 2019). Based on importers\u2019 reports, these countries imported 72 trophies and 135 tusks between 2005 and 2017. These data suggest that the EU and the USA are the main importers of tusks and trophies from Zambia. According to exporter\u2019s reports, these were exported mainly to Denmark, Spain, France especially during 2006\u20132012 whereas importers\u2019 reports also show Cyprus to be a key importer in the EU. The EU\u2019s Scientific Review Group formed a positive opinion on hunting trophies of Loxodonta africana from Zambia at its 73rd meeting in September 2015 after Zambia provided necessary information (SRG, 2015). According to the SS, Zambia reported 157 seizures to the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) between June 2015 and July 2018; there were 37 seizures of raw ivory weighing a total of ca. 730 kg in 2017. ETIS data report there being 161 seizures reported by Zambia between 2014\u20132018, totalling ca. 3,773 kg (T. Milliken, in litt., 2019). Precautionary Measures Species likely to be in demand for trade, but its management is such that the CoP will be satisfied with: A) Implementation by the range States of the requirements of the Convention, in particular Article IV; and B) appropriate enforcement controls and compliance with the requirements of the Convention The transfer of Zambia\u2019s population to Appendix II would be subject to: \u2022 Trade in registered raw ivory (tusks and pieces) for commercial purposes only to CITES approved trading partners who will not re-export; \u2022 Trade in hunting trophies for non-commercial purposes; \u2022 Trade in hides and leather goods; \u2022 All other specimens shall be deemed to be specimens of species in Appendix I and the trade in them shall be regulated accordingly. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 10 69 The SS provides information on Zambia\u2019s general implementation of CITES, however it does not offer details on how international trade of Loxodonta africana specimens would be monitored and controlled, and therefore it is uncertain that this can be interpreted as a special measure. The proposal and SS are not consistent: while the proposed annotation includes trade in raw ivory (tusks and pieces) for commercial purposes, the SS noted that Zambia proposes to down-list its population of Loxodonta africana to allow for sustainable use of the species through trophy hunting for non-commercial purposes, commercial trade in hides and leather goods, with no mention of ivory. It is therefore unclear from the SS whether Zambia intends to resume ivory trade for commercial purposes, let alone how any such trade will be carried out and controlled. The SS reports that there are estimated to be ca. 55,000 kg of ivory held in the strong room as of 31st December 2017. However, the SS makes no reference to the volume of ivory it plans to trade.

Additional Information Threats According to the SS, the major threats are human\u2013elephant conflicts and poaching. When Zambia\u2019s proposal to CoP15 was evaluated by the Panel of Experts convened under Res. Conf. 10.9 (see CoP15, Doc. 68, Annex 6 b), it was concluded that both legal and illegal offtake appeared sustainable except for in the Lower Zambezi. Additionally, the MIKE programme data for South Luangwa National Park in Zambia show the proportion of illegally killed elephants (PIKE) estimate, which is calculated as the number of illegally killed elephants found divided by the total number of elephant carcasses encountered by patrols and other means, increased from 0.59 in 2016 to 0.66 in 2017 (CITES, 2018), suggesting the ratio of the elephant deaths attributed to illegal killing was higher than those attributed to natural causes. However, it must be noted that this level is not representative of the country, only the site (ca. 15% of total national population). Conservation, management and legislation The Zambia Wildlife Act No. 14 of 2015 places responsibility for wildlife management under the National Parks and Wildlife Department. Penalties include 5\u201320 years of imprisonment for illegal hunting of elephants (first offender) and 7\u201320 years of imprisonment for illegal hunting and trade or trafficking (first offender). The act also stipulates that the hunting revenues (concession and hunting fees) should be divided equally between the Zambia Wildlife Authority (ZAWA) and the community concerned. Fees for elephant hunts are subject to a separate Statutory Instrument which stipulates payment of USD 10,000 per elephant (CITES, 2010). International trade in wildlife is regulated by the Statutory Instrument for International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora No. 61 of 2007. Zambia also published a national policy and action plan for Elephant management in 2003. According to the supporting statement, the Zambia National Strategy for Elephant Management and Conservation is currently under review.

The annotation allows for trade in various non-ivory specimens and products of L. africana under a range of conditions, somewhat different for each of the four range States in question. Regarding trade in ivory, it allows for trade in individually marked and certified ekipas incorporated in finished jewellery for non-commercial purposes for Namibia and ivory carvings for non-commercial purposes for Zimbabwe. It also allowed for these four range States to dispose of agreed quantities of stockpiled raw ivory in a one-off sale, under a series of conditions. One of these conditions was that no further proposals to allow trade in elephant ivory from populations already in Appendix II should be submitted until at least nine years after the date of the single sale of ivory which occurred in 2008, during which time a decision-making mechanism for a process of trade in ivory would be developed. There is currently no agreed decision-making mechanism for allowing trade in ivory under the auspices of the Conference of the Parties. The proposal is to amend the existing annotation for the Appendix II populations of Loxodonta africana in Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, on the grounds that the proponents believe some elements of the current annotation \u201care no longer relevant or not appropriate.\u201d The amendments proposed are as follows: \u201cFor the exclusive purpose of allowing: a. trade in hunting trophies for non-commercial purposes b. trade in live animals to appropriate and acceptable destinations, as defined in Resolution Conf. 11.20 (Rev.

CoP17) concerning domestic manufacturing and trade; iii. not before the Secretariat has verified the prospective importing countries and the registered government-owned stocks; iv. raw ivory pursuant to the conditional sale of registered government-owned ivory stocks agreed at CoP12, which are 20,000 kg (Botswana), 10,000 kg (Namibia) and 30,000 kg (South Africa); v. in addition to the quantities agreed at CoP12, government-owned ivory from Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe registered by 31 January 2007 and IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 11 72 verified by the Secretariat may be traded and despatched, with the ivory in paragraph (g) iv) above, in a single sale per destination under strict supervision of the Secretariat; vi. the proceeds of the trade are used exclusively for elephant conservation and community conservation and development programmes within or adjacent to the elephant range; and vii. the additional quantities specified in paragraph g) v) above shall be traded only after the Standing Committee has agreed that the above conditions have been met; and h. no further proposals to allow trade in elephant ivory from populations already in Appendix II shall be submitted to the Conference of the Parties for the period from CoP14 and ending nine years from the date of the single sale of ivory that is to take place in accordance with provisions in paragraphs g) i), g) ii), g) iii), g) vi) and g) vii).

The Parties therefore need to be satisfied that the Precautionary Measures in Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) Annex 4 are met. The proponents state that \u201cRobust control measures are already in place within the legal framework of the proponents, at national level. The comprehensive commitments under various SADC regional initiatives and agreements ensure accountability and safeguards for compliance\u201d. Legal instruments are noted. The SS states that elephant populations are managed according to elephant management plans and strategies at national level and spatially-explicit management plans that are responsive to local dynamics. Zimbabwe is one such country with an up-to-date elephant management plan. However, for all the countries, details of the precautionary measures are lacking in the Supporting Statement (SS). The only safeguards for any future exports of raw ivory would be the basic requirements of Article IV of the Convention for trade in Appendix II species (i.e. non-detriment findings and legal acquisition findings). The SS does not provide details as to how the proposed trade would be assessed for sustainability and controlled. This proposal applies only to the Loxodonta africana population of four contiguous southern African countries: Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe. The most comprehensive and reliable information on distribution and population of the species is contained in the African Elephant Database (AED), maintained by the IUCN SSC African Elephant Specialist Group, and presented in the African Elephant Status Reports (AESR) the latest of which was published in 2016. The 2016 AESR estimates a combined range in the four countries considered here as approximately 500,000 km2 and a total population estimate of at least 255,000. This amounts to ca. 50\u201360% of the species as a whole (415,428 \u00b1 20,112 with possibly an additional 117,128 to 135,385 in areas not systematically surveyed).

Analysis: The Loxodonta africana population of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe is not small, nor does it have a restricted distribution or undergoing a marked decline. Therefore, this population does not meet the biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I (See Analyses for CoP18 Prop. 12). There are no explicit guidelines in Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) as to how to deal with a proposal to amend an annotation for an Appendix II-listed species. However, these proposed amendments can be interpreted as special measures under the terms of the precautionary measures in Annex 4 of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17). Adoption of the proposed changes would remove some which are no longer valid, with timeframes having passed and decisions no longer in effect. However, if accepted, the main effect would be to allow exports of registered raw ivory but without the oversight of previous mechanisms by the Standing Committee and the Conference of the Parties. Parties would need to be satisfied that Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe are implementing the requirements of the Convention, particularly Article IV, and that the appropriate enforcement controls and compliance with the requirements of the Convention are in place. Insufficient detail of such measures is provided in the SS to determine whether or not this would be the case.

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 11 74 Range The proposal relates to the populations of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe IUCN Global Category Vulnerable A2a (2008) ver 3.1 Biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I See IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses for CoP18 Prop. 12. Trade criteria for inclusion in Appendix I The species is or may be affected by trade Loxodonta africana is subject to both domestic and international trade. Within Africa, derivatives including skin and hair are made into a variety of products: elephant meat is consumed in parts of Western, Central and Southern Africa; elephants are sport-hunted; and live elephants are sometimes caught and traded. While Botswana has no legal domestic ivory market, legislation in Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe allows domestic sales of ivory subject to permit. The SS reports that robust monitoring systems controlled by permits and licences for domestic trade are in place, regular inspections are also done to check on compliance to set standards and security arrangements. Botswana is the only one of the four countries that currently has a suspension on trophy hunting, including that of elephants, although this is currently under review. Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe set annual export quotas for tusks and elephant trophies whereas Botswana placed a ban on trophy hunting in 2014 and a zero-export quota for exports of hunting trophies has been set since 2015 (CITES, 2019b; Thouless et al., 2016). Under the Appendix II listing, Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe were permitted two \u201cone-off\u201d sales of registered raw ivory from the government-owned stocks; the first to Japan in 1999 (ca. 50 t), and the second to Japan and China in 2008 (ca. 102 t) (South Africa was also permitted to sell its ivory in this sale). This resulted in a nine-year moratorium until 2017 specified in the current annotation, in accordance with the agreement reached at CoP14.

Although the SS outlines penalties for illegal hunting and/or trade in Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe and enforcement controls and compliance with CITES, the SS does not provide details as to how the proposed trade will be carried out and controlled beyond indicating that ivory collected through routine conservation management, which has been officially registered to ensure traceability of every ivory piece and secured in government storage facilities, and whose records are monitored by responsible authorities will be disposed to responsible markets. The income generated will be used to fund implementation of national elephant management plans and anti-poaching strategies, as well as supporting community-based initiatives for securing elephant habitat, dispersal areas and movement corridors. Analysis of the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) prepared for CoP18 (CITES, 2019a) and the report submitted to SC69 in 2017 (CITES, 2017) indicates that enforcement controls and compliance may be problematic in some countries. Zimbabwe was identified as one of the most important countries of origin or export of illegal commercial shipments of worked ivory products (10+ kg); this trade is important as it suggests ivory processing in Africa for Asian markets. Zimbabwe\u2019s seizure data also point to considerable movements of raw ivory during 2015\u20132017 as well. Zimbabwe\u2019s domestic ivory market is a concern. Although South Africa was not included in the National Ivory Action Plan (NIAP) process after CoP17, the country was identified as a Category A country in the ETIS analysis to CoP16, a Category B country in the ETIS report to CoP17 and a Category C country in the report to CoP18 pursuant to Annex 3 of Res. Conf. 10.10 (Rev. CoP17). These assessments continue to suggest that significant quantities of ivory have entered international trade from South Africa and large-scale movements of ivory suggest a considerable level of criminal activity operating here. It seems that enforcement and controls in these countries are not sufficient at present to ensure that no significant amounts of ivory taken or traded illegally from other countries are traded within or through these countries. For Botswana, frequency and scale measures point to a rather small number of mostly medium weight seizures, with no involvement in the large-scale ivory movements which are the hallmark of organised crime. Most seizures are made by Botswana showing generally good law enforcement. Namibia exhibits mid-range variables in terms of the mean number of seizures and the mean weight value, but most seizures take place within Namibia rather than further along the trade chain. There are some seizures involving large-scale movements, though a notable degree of organised criminal activity is not apparent (CITES, 2019a). Independent assessments of stockpile management have not been conducted in recent years (T. Milliken, in litt., 2019). The SS reports that robust control measures are already in place within the legal framework of the proponents, at national level. The comprehensive commitments under various Southern African Development Community (SADC) regional initiatives and agreements ensure accountability and safeguards for compliance. No information is provided in the SS on the implementation of these commitments by the countries in question. Export quota or other special measure No export quota is reported. There is no information provided in the SS on the quantity of ivory currently stockpiled by the proponents. Additional Information Threats See IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses for CoP18 Prop. 12.

The most comprehensive and reliable information on distribution and population of the species is contained in the African Elephant Database (AED), maintained by the IUCN/SSC African Elephant Specialist Group, and presented in the African Elephant Status Reports (AESR), the latest of which was published in 2016.

This is the second highest level ever recorded in this subregion. It is difficult to estimate poaching impact at the site level, especially in sites that do not report sufficiently large numbers of carcasses, or where there may be indications of bias in reported PIKE levels. The Supporting Statement (SS) of the proposal deals extensively with the wider Loxodonta africana population, which is not the subject of the amendment proposal. It draws attention to the high levels of illegal killing of elephants that have been recorded (chiefly through the MIKE programme) in many parts of the range since 2006 (see CoP18 Doc. 69.2), associated with elevated levels of illegal trade in ivory recorded from 2008 onwards, as indicated by seizure data contained in the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) (see CoP18 Doc. 69.3). The proponents argue that transferring the Appendix-II listed L. africana population to Appendix I will indicate that the CITES Parties do not IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 12 78 intend to allow commercial trade in ivory in the future, and that this will serve as a disincentive for the illegal killing of elephants,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "857b4305-36e1-4b04-b147-3ade0621c5dd": {"__data__": {"id_": "857b4305-36e1-4b04-b147-3ade0621c5dd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "84f08445d58b47257a5c2c049df8bc25bef00490cb546704ef70a7eb342bcf96"}, "3": {"node_id": "e56b4e0e-0177-4f52-ad66-5e455ac71193", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "101a5f04e5db7727c411c2c136eb35dee35f73094a001786e4523e68cb1b804c"}}, "hash": "53e416996c1d036fdbda7a654d837f527f4eaf64ab7f543345bd7605fcf29676", "text": "thereby enhancing the conservation status of this species in its range as a whole, and also benefitting the Appendix-I listed Asian Elephant Elephas maximus. Analysis: The Loxodonta africana population of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe is not small, nor does it have a restricted range and it is not undergoing a marked decline. Therefore, this population does not meet the biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I. Regarding the potential impact of this proposed listing amendment on elephant populations elsewhere, there is no provision to address this question in any guidelines or criteria under the Convention. There is a wide and divergent range of views on the subject, as can be seen in the SS of the current proposal and of proposals CoP18 Prop. 10, submitted by Zambia, and CoP18 Prop. 11 submitted by Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe.

There may be an additional 117,127 to 135,384 Loxodonta africana in areas not systematically surveyed. Together, these figures apply to an area of 1,932,732 km\u00b2, which is 62% of the estimated known and possible elephant range. There remains an additional 38% of range for which no elephant population estimates are available, although it is likely that average population densities across this range are much lower than in the surveyed areas (Thouless et al., 2016). Holding over 70% of the estimated elephants in Africa, Southern Africa (Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe) has by far the largest population, with an estimated 293,447 \u00b1 16,682 Loxodonta africana, with nearly 75% of the population occurring in the Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA TFCA) (Thouless et al., 2016).

Aerial sample count surveys in 2014 produced an estimate of 129,939 \u00b1 12,501 while equivalent surveys in 2010 gave 128,340 \u00b1 9,938. These differ considerably from estimates made by the Botswana Department of Wildlife and National Parks (154,658 \u00b1 21,253 in 2006 and 207,545 \u00b1 21,771 in 2012, the former being the figure used in the 2007 AESR). However, these differences are believed to result from differences in survey techniques or calculations rather than real population change or elephant movements across national boundaries. There is little evidence from other indicators of major changes in the Botswana elephant population from excess natural mortality, serious poaching or emigration. The 2014 survey report gave a carcass ratio of 7% for northern Botswana, which is not considered exceptionally high, as carcass ratios of up to 8% are considered typical of a stable or increasing elephant population. However, it showed a notable increase over the earlier carcass ratio of 2% in 2010 and 2012.

While the major population in Kruger National Park had increased substantially, the quality of information for other areas was lower in the AESR 2016 than in the AESR 2007, and many areas that previously had documented surveys now had unsupported population figures, meaning that elephant numbers were recorded as guesses. Zimbabwe The AESR 2016 reported that the estimated number of elephants in areas surveyed in the last ten years in Zimbabwe was 82,630 \u00b1 8,589 at the time of the last survey for each area. It noted there may be an additional 1,635 to 1,805 elephants in areas not systematically surveyed. These guesses likely represented a minimum number, and actual numbers could be higher than those reported. Together, this estimate and guess apply to 78,839 km2, which is 97% of the estimated known and possible elephant range. No population estimates were available for the remaining 3%. There had been a decline of just over 10,000 elephants from surveyed populations since the AESR 2007 and an increase of about 1,000 in guesses, mostly from previously unsurveyed areas in North West Matabeleland. Although there had been large losses from the Sebungwe and Lower Zambezi populations, these have been partially compensated by increases in Gonarezhou and North West Matabeland. Trade criteria for inclusion in Appendix I The species is or may be affected by trade Loxodonta africana is subject to both domestic and international trade. Within Africa, derivatives including skin and hair are made into a variety of products: elephant meat is consumed in parts of Western, Central and IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 12 80 Southern Africa; elephants are trophy hunted; and live elephants are sometimes caught and traded. While Botswana has no legal domestic ivory market, legislation in Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe allows domestic sales of ivory subject to permit. Botswana is the only one of the four countries that currently has a suspension on trophy hunting, including that of elephants, although this is currently under review. Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe set annual export quotas for tusks and elephant trophies whereas Botswana placed a suspension on trophy hunting in 2014 and a zero-export quota for exports of hunting trophies has been set since 2015 (CITES, 2019c; Thouless et al., 2016). Under their Appendix II status, Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe were permitted two \u201cone-off\u201d sales of registered raw ivory from the government-owned stocks; the first to Japan in 1999 (ca. 50 t), and the second to Japan and China in 2008 (ca. 102 t) (South Africa was also permitted to sell its ivory in this sale).

Direct trade in wild-sourced ivory carvings reported by African range States was notably lower than in 2014 (38 kg and 89 items reported by exporters 2015\u20132016 compared to 7,889 kg of ivory carvings reported in 2014) (CITES, 2018a). Additional Information Threats Across the continent, habitat loss and fragmentation through conversion of forests, savanna and corridors to plantations, subsistence agriculture and settlement, is the most significant long-term threat to elephant populations. Continual declines of the species\u2019 range have occurred since 1998; for example, between 2007 and 2015, a 6% decrease in approximate total range was reported, from approximately 3.3 million km2 to 3.1 million km2, respectively. Other underlying drivers of population declines include human\u2013elephant conflict and the impacts of climate change. The most immediate threat to Loxodonta africana populations is poaching for ivory and illegal trade, and the recent decline in population is attributed to this threat. Data from the CITES programme for Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) indicate that poaching levels peaked in 2011, since the programme began in 2002, with a moderately declining trend thereafter. According to the latest figures from the MIKE programme, the Proportion of Illegally Killed Elephants (PIKE) level shows a slight decline in 2017 over 2016 but remains a concern with a value above 0.5, suggesting that more of the elephant deaths reported are attributed to illegal killing than to natural causes (CITES, 2018a). The sub-regional PIKE estimates for 2017 compared with 2016 are as follows (CITES, 2018a; CITES 2019a): \u2022 Eastern Africa \u2013 decline from 0.32 in 2016, to 0.22 in 2017; \u2022 Southern Africa \u2013 increase from 0.41 in 2016, to 0.48 in 2017; \u2022 Central Africa \u2013 concerningly high levels, with a value of 0.76 over the last three years; and \u2022 West Africa \u2013 due to low sample sizes, reliable inferences based on the year-on-year trend for West Africa was challenging, however for sites where reporting has been conducted, PIKE estimates were extremely high. While overall, poaching has not had the same impact in Southern Africa as in other regions, it has severely affected populations in Zimbabwe, Angola, Mozambique, and to a lesser extent, Zambia (Thouless et al., 2016). Notable increases in PIKE were recorded in Kruger National Park (South Africa), with an increase of 44% between 2016 (0.27) and 2017 (0.39). PIKE also increased in Chobe National Park, Botswana from 0.00 to 0.21 between 2016 and 2017. Two sites in Zimbabwe (Chewore and Nyami Nyami) reported PIKE levels, with Chewore reporting 0.21 and 0.10 and Nyami Nyami reporting 0.27 and 0.21, in 2016 and 2017 respectively. In Namibia, PIKE levels are reported from Etosha and Zambezi, with Etosha reporting 0.00 and 0.07 and Zambezi reporting 0.33 and 0.28, in 2016 and 2017 respectively. In Zimbabwe, poaching of elephants has increased in the last decade, particularly in the north of the country (Thouless et al., 2016). The emergence of poisoning as a poaching technique has also been reported, with over 100 elephants reportedly killed in a single incident in Hwange National Park in late 2013 (Muboko et al., 2014). The National Ivory Action Plans (NIAPs) process is a practical tool under the direction of the Standing Committee to address illegal ivory trade by strengthening ivory trade controls, supporting law enforcement and improving IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 12 81 awareness by identifying countries in three categories of concern pursuant with Annex 3 of Resolution Conf. 10.10 (Rev.

Conservation, management and legislation Conservation management measures vary considerably across the continent. They range from the creation of migration corridors, population monitoring, development of artificial waterholes, regulating legal offtake and enforcement efforts to prevent poaching. Some community-based conservation programmes in which revenue from the trophy hunting of elephants is fed directly to local communities have proved effective in increasing tolerance to elephants, and thus indirectly in reducing levels of human-elephant conflict (Naidoo et al., 2006; Blanc, 2008). Transboundary elephant populations are increasingly being co-managed by relevant range States and large-scale conservation and management efforts are in place at the national and regional levels (Blanc, 2008) (Table 2). Although up to 70% of the species\u2019 range is believed to lie in unprotected land, most large populations occur within protected areas (Blanc, 2008) (Table 2). For example, Namibia\u2019s elephants occur across the northern region of the country, mostly in national parks and community areas, while South Africa\u2019s largest population inhabits Kruger National Park, and the majority of the remaining population exists in relatively small fenced areas, many of which are privately owned (Thouless et al., 2016).

During the last glacial period (around 115,000\u201312,000 years ago), Woolly Mammoths were at their most widespread and were present across North America, northern Asia and Europe. Woolly Mammoth extinction is thought to have been caused by a reduction in suitable habitat due to temperature increases, combined with an increase in anthropogenic hunting pressure.

While information on the global trade in mammoth ivory is not available, import and export data from Hong Kong SAR and USA import data are presented below: Hong Kong SAR customs data (between 2005-2016) report that: - Hong Kong SAR imports on average 36,000 kg of mammoth ivory (raw tusks and/or unworked tusk pieces) annually, mostly from Russia. - The majority of mammoth ivory is re-exported (on average 29,000 kg annually) to mainland China. USA import data (between 1999\u20132013) report that: - Average annual mammoth ivory commodity imports to the USA were 1,600 tusks, 800 kg and 120 pieces of tusk/ivory and 40,000 ivory carvings. - The majority of these imports were from Hong Kong SAR. Data on the origin of mammoth ivory traded by both Hong Kong SAR and the USA showed that although the vast majority of mammoth ivory traded was listed as originating in Russia, smaller volumes of trade were reported with origins where mammoth ivory is likely to be fossilised: mainly European countries, but small amounts reportedly originated from African Elephant Loxodonta africana range States (e.g. Chad, Gabon, Kenya, Mozambique and South Africa) and Asian Elephant Elephas maximus range States (e.g. China, Indonesia and Thailand). The Supporting Statement makes it clear that this proposal is aimed to help regulation of trade in ivory from living elephants by preventing the laundering/mislabelling of ivory from extant elephant species as Woolly Mammoth ivory. Evidence from mainland China, Hong Kong SAR, Myanmar and the USA suggests that some vendors are mislabelling elephant ivory as mammoth ivory, but there is no comprehensive assessment to suggest how widespread this practice is. The proposal of an extinct species for inclusion in the Appendices is unusual and CITES provisions for this are fairly limited.

Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) states that \u201cParties are encouraged to note any extinct species in the higher taxon and to clarify whether these are included or excluded from the proposed listing\u201d. The proponent goes on to argue that there are instances where the deletion of extinct species from the Appendices is discouraged, such as in Annex 4 Paragraph D of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17), which gives four situations where extinct species should not be deleted, including if \u201cthey resemble extant species included in the Appendices\u201d. When whole mammoth tusks are traded it is relatively straightforward to tell them apart from elephant tusks, as mammoth tusks display a twist whereas elephant tusks are generally straight. Cross IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 13 84 sections which display Schreger lines can also be used to distinguish mammoth ivory (average Schreger line angle <90\u00b0) from elephant ivory (average Schreger line angle >115\u00b0). Identification becomes more of an issue for worked mammoth ivory, especially small pieces (carvings, pendants etc.) which may not display Schreger lines and can often be very difficult to tell apart from elephant ivory. Instances of elephant ivory being painted or intentionally discoloured to appear as mammoth ivory have been observed. Fossilised mammoth ivory cannot be carved and therefore is not a substitute for elephant ivory for carvings or other processed items. There are few legal provisions for regulation of trade in mammoth ivory. Although many countries have laws banning trade in ivory, this is mostly directed at elephant ivory. Analysis: The Supporting Statement makes it clear that the purpose of the listing is to prevent illegal trade in living elephants by preventing the mislabelling of elephant ivory as mammoth ivory. Anecdotal evidence of elephant ivory being traded as mammoth ivory is found within the literature and surveys, but the scale of these substitutions is unclear and thought to be quite limited. Some believe that mammoth ivory should be promoted as an alternative to elephant ivory as mammoths are already extinct, whereas others feel there should be a complete trade ban on all ivory including mammoth in order to close the potential for laundering of elephant ivory. The proponent does not take a position on this, clarifying that its intention is simply to improve documentation and regulation of mammoth ivory trade in support of the conservation of extant elephant species. Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) states in Annex 3 that \u201cextinct species should not normally be proposed for inclusion in the Appendices\u201d, but this does not definitively preclude their inclusion. When traded as tusks or large pieces of tusk with a visible cross section, it is fairly straightforward to distinguish between elephant and mammoth ivory. Difficulties in identification occur with worked pieces of ivory, especially when they are small and the Schreger lines are not apparent. Given that USA customs data show high levels of international trade in mammoth ivory carvings, it would appear that the look-alike criteria in Annex 2b of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) would be met when non- fossilised mammoth ivory is traded in processed form. Overall, the regulation of international trade in mammoth ivory through an Appendix II listing may help reduce opportunities for misdeclaration and/or laundering of elephant ivory. However, the extent to which this would contribute to a reduction of global illegal elephant ivory trade flows is unknown and likely to be limited. The Parties will need to weigh these potential benefits against the costs of regulation of significant legal mammoth ivory movements. Other Considerations: Res. Conf. 11.21 (Rev. CoP17) Use of annotations in Appendices I and II indicates that only animal species listed in Appendix III can be annotated to specify the parts and derivatives covered by the listing. However, given the proposal to list an extinct species is somewhat unusual, if the Parties decided to list the species in Appendix II, it may be useful to consider restricting the proposal to whole tusks and the specimens of the species in the form in which they are traded that resemble elephant ivory and are hard to distinguish, namely worked ivory, which would help ensure that effective control of trade in elephants is achieved.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "80e3bf1f-879d-4b3b-9fd3-2912c041224c": {"__data__": {"id_": "80e3bf1f-879d-4b3b-9fd3-2912c041224c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cb1c47d98b849ef8cbbb57e8bc3d7e90f7f628773843fa157db5b1bcafce7d9a"}, "2": {"node_id": "c2197e87-9201-48b1-ad75-a6ee03084b2b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6cdd58e4205b228b01d2e9058d269345d867f30d4659929aac79fdbc8513ae00"}}, "hash": "ffb5fdb6cc882c829cc6c9e694ef79077b3fb64f058a415959ea64c6ba37e7ab", "text": "Fossils and other artefacts including non- commercial scientific exchanges of mammoth parts (such as bones, skin, hair, and DNA) for research and education by museums and universities could be excluded.

This family also includes all the living relatives of the mammoths: the elephants. The family Elephantidae first emerged in Africa as tropical animals about 55 million years ago (mya); about 10 million years after the last dinosaurs. The earliest members of the genus Mammuthus emerged about 5 mya in Africa and mammoths spread to Europe as forest-living IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 13 85 species about 3-4 mya, apparently via the Levant. From there, mammoths spread to northern and eastern Asia and to North America around 1.5 mya. They spread throughout North America into Mexico, and in Asia throughout Siberia, into Mongolia, China, Japan and India. Mammoth did not spread to South America. The cold-adapted species, the Woolly Mammoth M. primigenius, is the source of almost all mammoth ivory in trade today. The species emerged around 0.5 mya in Europe. By the start of the last ice age around 100,000 years ago M. primigenius occurred throughout Europe, northern Asia, and most of North America, and eventually having a large distribution covering almost all of Europe from Portugal and Spain in the southwest, all across Central and Eastern Europe, to Mongolia, northern China, South Korea and Japan up to north-eastern Siberia, and including the American mid-west, and eastern Canada. Remains have also been found from the shelf regions of the Arctic Ocean and north-western Europe to the bottom of the Adriatic Sea and to the mountains of Crimea, Ukraine. Most populations of Woolly Mammoths went extinct after the last ice age ended, around 10 to 40 thousand years ago, yet remnant populations were still living until about 5,600 years ago on St. Paul Island in Alaska and even more recently, until about 3,700 years ago (around the year 1,650 BC), on Wrangel Island in the East Siberian Sea. Woolly Mammoths were shown to have been at their most widespread during the most recent glacial period (Pelistocene) with a range of around 33,000,000 km 2 including in Europe, North America and Asia (Kahlke, 2015). Woolly Mammoth extinction is thought to have occurred due to the combination of climatic changes reducing suitable habitats and an increase in anthropogenic hunting pressure (Nogues-Bravo et al., 2008). Inclusion in Appendix II to improve control of other listed species A) Specimens in trade resemble those of species listed in Appendix II under Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) Annex 2 a or listed in Appendix I The species from which most mammoth ivory is currently in trade, the Woolly Mammoth M. primigenius, was about the same size as living African Elephants Loxodonta africana. Studies of bone development showed that Woolly Mammoths continued to grow throughout their life. Females were slightly smaller than males. Both male and female Woolly Mammoths grew tusks. Woolly Mammoths were born without tusks. Small milk tusks, only a few centimetres long, erupted at about six months age. After about one year they were replaced by the permanent tusks which grew continuously throughout life, at a rate of 5-15 cm per year. Woolly Mammoths apparently had a lifespan of about 60 years. Only the tusks of the cold-adapted Woolly Mammoths have been used in recent decades for carving and for decoration. Recovered tusks from other species of Mammuthus are apparently too brittle to be used for carving. Unlike those of elephants, mammoth tusks have a twist, twisting in opposite directions with the tips eventually crossing in the centre. The largest known Woolly Mammoth tusk is 4.2 m long and weighs 84 kg. Typically, males\u2019 tusks reached a length of 2.4-2.7 m weighing less than 50 kg. Females\u2019 tusks are smaller, thinner, and less tapered, with a length of 1.5\u20131.8 m, weighing 9-11 kg. Large, whole Woolly Mammoth tusks are distinguishable from elephant ivory by their shape (twisted and not straight), but worked mammoth ivory, especially small pieces, are difficult to differentiate from elephant ivory.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "536a05bb-5f67-4e0b-9f6c-24d4830f910f": {"__data__": {"id_": "536a05bb-5f67-4e0b-9f6c-24d4830f910f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "916a86e30c657a80b75fa3f13d98f2bb610bb8f8593c479ff69160bc1cf99056"}, "2": {"node_id": "d0b7a987-db7c-416e-be56-d7e41e0fb9bb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7698dacbc3da8619071225a7970dcc2eb2ac4e9360dcd7214f8ed3a3f53a3926"}}, "hash": "d34051691fb060c0b6ac9aa6632ddb092aa04da3146ec7c39d7ff5aa36f52bfa", "text": "Like living elephants, mammoths do not have enamel on their tusks.

But this method does not work for carvings where the Schreger lines are not evident (such as small pieces that are not cross-sectioned). It should be noted that an average of several of both the convex and concave Schreger lines should be used to identify if the ivory is from a mammoth or an elephant. It is also suggested that only the outer Schreger lines are used to identify the ivory (Espinoza & Mann, 2010). This suggests that it may be difficult correctly to identify mammoth ivory unless there is a clear cross section visible in the tusk. Smaller pieces or processed/carved ivory may be very difficult to tell apart from elephant ivory. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 13 86 Mammoth ivory will occasionally display intrusive brownish or blue-green coloured blemishes caused by an iron phosphate called vivianite, whereas elephant ivory will not; however, this discoloration is often imperceptible to the naked eye. Although these physical differences can in some cases provide a means of identifying mammoth ivory by expert enforcement officers, they are not always visible or obvious even to well-trained enforcement agencies tasked with determining the legality of items in international trade. In addition, elephant ivory in trade is sometimes painted or intentionally discoloured to make it appear older or more like mammoth ivory when in trade. National utilisation Historically mammoth ivory has been unearthed and sold domestically throughout its range. Domestic use is for decoration and jewellery only. The demand and use of mammoth ivory has been increasing over the past few decades, as it has become more available, especially since the beginning of the global moratorium on elephant ivory trade in 1989. China is the main ivory (all types including elephant, mammoth, hippopotamus and walrus) manufacturing centre in the world and has also witnessed increased domestic use. A review of the market for elephant and mammoth ivory in Beijing and Shanghai (China) found that 90% (both elephant and mammoth) of purchases were for domestic customers, as opposed to the situation in 2002 when foreigners were the major consumers. In another example, a recent review of the domestic mammoth ivory market in Macau SAR compared mammoth ivory sales from 2004 to sales in 2015, and found a fourfold increase in mammoth ivory sales over this period of time. China has announced a ban on domestic sales of elephant ivory, but this does not extend to mammoth ivory. China\u2019s ivory ban came into force on the 31st December 2017 (Meijer et al., 2018). Legal trade International trade in mammoth ivory is not illegal in most countries and is poorly documented. Some studies have been carried out to attempt to estimate the quantities of mammoth ivory in international trade. The major legal exporter of mammoth tusks is Russia. Mammoth tusk imports via Hong Kong SAR, one of the main trade routes into mainland China, have greatly expanded from an average of less than 9 tonnes per year from 2000 to 2003 to an average of 31 tonnes per year from 2007 to 2013. According to prices paid by some factories in Beijing, wholesale prices of mammoth ivory tusks have increased greatly recently due to the rise in demand in China. The mammoth ivory trade route from Russia to Hong Kong SAR is thought to be the main trade route for mammoth ivory globally as there is no import tax to pay when the tusks arrive in Hong Kong SAR. Tusks are then exported to Guangzhou (mainland China), which has the two largest ivory manufacturing centres in southern China, where the ivory is carved (Esmond Martin & Vigne, 2011). Hong Kong SAR customs data between 2005-2016 show: - total imports of mammoth ivory (raw tusks and/or unworked tusk pieces) of 430,000 kg, which averages 36,000 kg annually. - Re-export data from Hong Kong SAR over the same time period shows total re-exports of mammoth ivory (raw tusks and/or unworked tusk pieces) of 350,000 kg, averaging 29,000 kg annually. - Between 2005 \u2013 2016 data shows that most of Hong Kong SAR\u2019s mammoth ivory is imported from Russia (395,000 kg) and most if its re-exports are destined for mainland China (330,000 kg), as per the traditional trade route mentioned above.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fd436ba4-c85a-4947-bd6e-1f20afb2a941": {"__data__": {"id_": "fd436ba4-c85a-4947-bd6e-1f20afb2a941", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "35a50998b0be26ac44b884a8a71b3d33eee8c7e78c0fb78ee8c1ba62d9f08490"}, "2": {"node_id": "ff086f35-767c-47eb-8f04-0a81132737b5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "60a914d519d0e24ddd5072a073dc79513c9bd22f1ddcbc2956db29666765de78"}}, "hash": "13b1861be958f45e931ace473075475cf83230b776e42c9b3cd7b83a46841eaf", "text": "- Customs data from Hong Kong SAR also lists the origin of the specimen and imports predominantly originate from Russia (410,000 kg). - 10,000 kg of imports have origins that are not places where preserved mammoth ivory is found (e.g. the Netherlands and Germany were listed as the origin for a total of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7e2b71f6-b1e3-477b-8805-c8062da9cca8": {"__data__": {"id_": "7e2b71f6-b1e3-477b-8805-c8062da9cca8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fc0ebac7329ee6c39ee363488f248f4170ce5969ceae6cbab182730201847ef8"}, "3": {"node_id": "1960ab7e-a52c-4170-a61a-1f817871050b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "465f982967c051267191a432e696c97033f4b7944fb6c862e2eb4963b052ded4"}}, "hash": "d562897aa506a41e425fbd7487fc12892d38258c567a40db57694297c96ce21c", "text": "8,250 kg of mammoth ivory imports) - More than 1,000 kg of mammoth ivory imports were reported with the origin being an African Elephant range State (Mozambique, South Africa, Kenya or Chad). - The destinations of 340,000 kg of mammoth ivory re-exports were China and Macao SAR.

Listing the species in Appendix II will put the onus upon exporting countries to make proper identification and determination of legal acquisition before issuing export permits (according to Article IV of the Convention). Exporting countries will need to make sure that specimens marked as mammoth ivory are indeed mammoth ivory and not elephant ivory. The legal mammoth ivory trade has other impacts: permanent ecological damage is caused during the work to unearth them in the tundra regions of Siberia. The digging is done using very high-pressure water pumps (like those used on fire trucks) run by large petrol engines, to pound away at the permafrost and gouge out whole hillsides and deep pits in the ground. This work causes irreversible ecological damage to the permafrost with run- off polluting the streams and rivers. In addition, some scientific knowledge that could be reaped from mammoth remains and from other artefacts of paleontological interest that are unearthed (including remnants of other pre-historic animals like sabre-toothed cats, Woolly Rhinoceros and others), is lost to science in this process. Additional Information Conservation, management and legislation National Many countries have laws regulating or banning ivory trade, but in all the ones we are aware of this is directed at elephant ivory. India is the only country known to ban import and export of mammoth ivory. We were not able to obtain information on domestic laws concerning mammoth ivory from all countries, but we found out information about a few. For example, some countries are currently working to amend their regulations to include mammoth ivory within their definitions of ivory. Trade in mammoth ivory is not illegal in the European Union. Canada regulates trade in mammoth ivory as a \u201cfossil\u201d or as ancient relics as part of their antiquities or cultural property laws. Federal law in the USA does not regulate mammoth ivory trade. However, many States in the USA have State laws banning or regulating trade in ivory, and in some of these States the definition of ivory also includes mammoth ivory. China\u2019s elephant ivory ban came into force on the 31st December 2017. Prior to the ban, a market survey of 50 accredited ivory outlets in 22 cities in China showed that 12 stores had changed their business to trade in mammoth ivory and 38 had closed (Zhao et al., 2017). Research looking into ivory (all types) consumption and consumer perception towards the ivory ban in China showed that across 15 cities, incidences of ivory purchases had declined significantly since the implementation of the ivory ban (Meijer et al., 2018). Hong Kong SAR will also adopt an ivory ban which will come into force in 2021, but concerns have been raised that as mainland China accounts for 90% of Hong Kong SAR\u2019s ivory (all types) purchases that this will enable a four-year overlap where large amounts of laundering may occur with elephant ivory being smuggled into mainland China under the guise of being mammoth ivory (Cheung et al., 2017; Martin & Vigne, 2015). It has been reported that mammoth tusk hunters require Russian government permits to sell mammoth ivory, but many hunters circumvent this legislation and continue hunting without permits (Farah & Boyce, 2019). IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 13 89 International: It may be argued that the UNIDROIT Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects (Rome, 1995) could possibly relate also to mammoth specimens that have been \u201cstolen\u201d (i.e., unlawfully excavated and/or exported). The UNIDROIT Convention enables Parties to demand restitution from other Parties regarding stolen objects which include also \u201cspecimens of fauna, flora, minerals and anatomy, and objects of paleontological interest\u201d. Artificial propagation/captive breeding Media reports claim that there are projects to try to clone or \u201crevive\u201d Woolly Mammoths using ancient DNA, such as the project by Prof. George Church at Harvard University in the USA. If successful, Woolly Mammoths (or a mammoth-elephant hybrid) could possibly be reintroduced into the wild in the future. A site in northern Siberia has been proposed for them. Implementation challenges (including similar species) It would not be possible to perform a non-detriment finding (NDF) on mammoth ivory as an extinct species.

Potential benefit(s) of listing for trade regulation Given the issues with some of the origins of mammoth ivory explained above (in both US and Hong Kong SAR customs data) a CITES listing means Parties would be required to report imports and exports of Woolly Mammoth ivory which would enable an understanding of the scale and nature of the mammoth ivory trade. Other comments The SS states that listing the Woolly Mammoth in Appendix II is not intended to stop trade in mammoth ivory but rather to facilitate documentation of the international trade in mammoth ivory in order to better understand it and its implications for living elephant populations. The \u201clook-alike provision\u201d Paragraph 2 of Article II of the Convention on \u201cFundamental Principles\u201d explains the reasons why a species should be listed in Appendix II, as follows: 2. Appendix II shall include: (a) all species which although not necessarily now threatened with extinction may become so unless trade in specimens of such species is subject to strict regulation in order to avoid utilisation incompatible with their survival; and (b) other species which must be subject to regulation in order that trade in specimens of certain species referred to in sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph may be brought under effective control. Sub-paragraph (a) clearly explains that the goal of Appendix II is to prevent extinction of species that are or may be threatened due to trade, while sub-paragraph (b) provides for the listing of \u201clook-alike\u201d species in Appendix II even if not they are not threatened. Sub-paragraph (b) adds the notion that \u201cother species\u201d shall be listed in Appendix II when it will assist with the \u201ceffective control\u201d of trade in those species threatened with extinction. It is important to note that no biological criteria are attached to sub-paragraph (b) and as such, the requirement that a species be \u201cthreatened with extinction\u201d does not apply here. The criteria for inclusion of species under sub- paragraph (b), are listed in Annex 2b to Resolution Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17), as follows: \u201cSpecies may be included in Appendix II in accordance with Article II, paragraph 2 (b), if either one of the following criteria is met: A. The specimens of the species in the form in which they are traded resemble specimens of a species included in Appendix II under the provisions of Article II, paragraph 2 (a), or in Appendix I, so that enforcement officers who encounter specimens of CITES-listed species are unlikely to be able to distinguish between them; or B. There are compelling reasons other than those given in criterion A above to ensure that effective control of trade in currently listed species is achieved.\u201d These criteria have led to the nick-naming of Article II, sub-paragraph (b) of the Convention as \u201cthe lookalike provision\u201d, and they have been used in the past for listing a number of species. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 13 90 Listing an extinct species According to the SS, CITES legal experts have determined that there is nothing in the Convention or Resolutions against listing an extinct species. The SS also notes that at CoP17 (Johannesburg, 2016), Israel submitted a working document on trade in mammoth ivory. In the Secretariat\u2019s comments to that document, they wrote that regulating mammoth ivory trade \u201cmay appear to fall outside of the legal scope of the Convention\u201d. The Secretariat\u2019s comment did not consider whether an extinct species could be listed under Article II, paragraph (2)(b) of the Convention and as such does not provide an actual legal analysis. A full review of the Convention and of Resolution Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) on \u201cCriteria for Amendment of Appendices I and II\u201d shows instead that the listing of Woolly mammoth in Appendix II fully conforms to the Convention. Resolution Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) on \u201cCriteria for Amendment of Appendices I and II\u201d addresses the inclusion of extinct species in the Appendices in a few places, as follows: First, Annex 3 of Resolution Conf. 9.24 (Rev.

Wider views on the mammoth ivory trade There is a basic dichotomy of thought regarding the regulation of mammoth ivory trade in terms of its impact on living elephants. One view holds that mammoth ivory trade should be banned along with the trade in elephant ivory so as to prevent laundering of elephant ivory. Under this view, great emphasis should be put on demand reduction by teaching consumers not to use any ivory. An alternative view holds that mammoth ivory trade should be promoted as an alternative to elephant ivory, since mammoths are extinct anyway. References Cheung, H., Wong, R. W. Y., & Biggs, D.

The Periodic Review recognises there is a need to conduct reviews of species listed in Appendices I and II to ensure that species are appropriately listed, based on current biological and trade information, and that this properly reflects its conservation needs. Many of the taxa reviewed through this process are species which were listed very early in the history of the Convention and for which little or no trade has since been recorded. Due to the similarities in the proposals they are discussed together here. The reviews that resulted in these proposals were all undertaken by Australia and concern two birds and four mammals, all endemic to Australia. These have been listed in Appendix I since the early days of CITES, when a number of Parties, including Australia, included their threatened species in the Appendices regardless of whether trade was an important conservation issue for them or not. All four mammals and one of the birds are still extant and one bird subspecies is extinct. In all cases, Australia has determined that trade is not, and never has been, a concern for the species, with all the extant species fully protected under national legislation. None of these species therefore meets the trade criteria for inclusion in Appendix I, although some may meet the biological criteria. Furthermore, it is unlikely that a transfer of any of the species to Appendix II will stimulate trade in these or any other species included in Appendix I thus meeting the Precautionary Measures of Res.

All these species are proposed for transfer to Appendix II. This is because under Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17), extant species in Appendix I that do not meet the criteria for inclusion in the Appendices should first be transferred to Appendix II for a period of two intervals between CoPs before being deleted from the Appendices. In one case (Prop. 15 Pseudomys fieldi praeconis) a taxonomic change is also proposed to bring the listing into line with CITES standard nomenclature. Prop. 14 Transfer of the Greater Stick-nest Rat Leporillus conditor from Appendix I to Appendix II Summary and Analysis: The Greater Stick-nest Rat Leporillus conditor is endemic to Australia and is classified as Near Threatened by IUCN (2016). It was listed in Appendix I in 1975. No trade has been recorded in the CITES Trade Database since the species was listed. It does not meet the trade criteria for inclusion in Appendix I and it is unlikely that a transfer of the species to Appendix II will stimulate trade in this or any other species included in Appendix I thus meeting the Precautionary Measures of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) Annex 4 A2ai). Prop. 15 Transfer of the Djoongari or Shark Bay Mouse Pseudomys fieldi praeconis from Appendix I to Appendix II, with the new listing modified to Pseudomys fieldi in accordance with standard CITES nomenclature Summary and Analysis: The Shark Bay Mouse is currently listed in Appendix I as Pseudomys fieldi praeconis. It was first listed as P. praecornis in Appendix I in 1975 and a second taxon, \u201cPseudomys fieldi\u201d, was also listed at that time. In 1979 \u201cPseudomys fieldi\u201d was removed from the Appendices (known at the time only from one specimen on the mainland, and subsequently declared as extinct there). Fifteen years later P. praecornis was synonymised with fieldi, with fieldi taking IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop.14-17 and 20 and 21 92 priority over praeconis. With no other subspecies extant the taxon should correctly be identified as Pseudomys fieldi under standard CITES nomenclature. This species is endemic to Australia and is currently classified as Vulnerable by IUCN (2016). No trade has been recorded in the CITES Trade Database since the taxon was listed. It does not meet the trade criteria for inclusion in Appendix I. No other species of Pseudomys are included in the Appendices and therefore transfer of this taxon will not stimulate trade in any other species included in Appendix I thus meeting the Precautionary Measures of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) Annex 4 A2ai). Prop. 16 Transfer of the False Swamp Rat Xeromys myoides from Appendix I to Appendix II Summary and Analysis: The False Swamp Rat Xeromys myoides is endemic to Australia and is classified as Vulnerable by IUCN (2016). It was listed in Appendix I in 1975. No trade has been recorded in this species. It does not meet the trade criteria for inclusion in Appendix I. No other species of Xeromys are included in the Appendices and the transfer of this taxon will therefore not stimulate trade in any other species included in Appendix I thus meeting the Precautionary Measures of Res.

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 18 93 Inclusion of Reeves\u2019s Pheasant Syrmaticus reevesii in Appendix II Proponent: China Summary: Reeves\u2019s Pheasant Syrmaticus reevesii is a distinctly plumaged pheasant endemic to central China. Adult males have black and white-banded tail feathers that can measure up to 2.4 m, the longest of any pheasant species. Syrmaticus reevesii was widely distributed and relatively common in central China until the mid-20th century, but since then appears to have declined rapidly and is now primarily concentrated in three fragmented subpopulations (the Dabie and Qinling Mountains and the Shennongjia mountainous massif). Surveys in 2011-2012 at 89 sites across the species\u2019 known post-1980 range indicated that S. reevesii had disappeared from 46% of survey sites and declined in a further 52% of sites. The total effective population size of the species is estimated to have declined by at least 50% in the last ten years, equivalent to two generations. A survey published in 2009 estimated the population size at 23,000 individuals, while the IUCN Red List assessment in 2018 estimated 3,000-5,000 mature individuals and up to 15,000 individuals in total, and categorised the species as Vulnerable with a decreasing population trend. The species has been introduced to Pakistan, the USA and several European countries for sport hunting and for ornamental purposes, and some populations have naturalized. The main threats to the species are reported to be illegal hunting, habitat loss and fragmentation, and deliberate poisoning in farmland. While the species is protected from hunting under Chinese legislation, surveys in 2011-2012 found evidence of poaching in 83% of surveyed sites where the species was still known to be present. The species is reportedly hunted by local communities for food, while eggs are taken and live individuals are captured to supply zoos and captive breeding centres, although it is not clear whether this is to meet domestic or international demand. There is international demand for feathers that are reportedly used for circus costumes, home decorating and flower arranging, and fly-tying for angling. Although exports of the species for commercial purposes have reportedly been prohibited under Chinese legislation since 1989, the EU and the USA have reported imports of relatively large quantities of feathers originating in China for commercial purposes (approximately 40 kg and 1,500 wild-sourced and 1,800 captive-bred/born sourced feathers imported by the EU between 2007 and 2015; 5 kg and 27,000 wild-sourced/ranched and 127 kg and 90,300 captive-bred/born sourced feathers imported by the US between 2007 and 2013). No imports of the species have been reported by the EU since 2015 (US import data for 2014 onwards were not available for analysis).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d8ca30fa-cbf4-4a9d-a695-7ff233feef23": {"__data__": {"id_": "d8ca30fa-cbf4-4a9d-a695-7ff233feef23", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendice
