Definitions of terms used in the KBA criteria The terms used in the KBA Standard (IUCN, 2016) must be clearly understood to ensure that the KBA criteria are applied correctly. The following terms are defined in the KBA Standard (IUCN, 2016, pp. 9-15). In the text below, definitions taken verbatim from the KBA Standard are shown in black; additional clarifications are shown in grey. I.1 Terms used in defining KBAs Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) KBAs are sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity. Biodiversity Biodiversity is \u201cthe variability among living organisms from all sources including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems\u201d, according to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) (UN, 1992). Contributing/Contribution The contribution of a site to the global persistence of biodiversity depends on the global distribution and the abundance of the biodiversity elements for which the site is important. Sites holding biodiversity elements that are globally restricted, or at risk of disappearing, make high contributions to the persistence of those elements. The global persistence of a biodiversity element occurring at any given KBA, unless it is entirely confined to the site, depends not only on the fate of the site itself but also on that of other sites and of the land-/seascapes where it occurs. Global Global implies that the contributions of a site to the persistence of a given biodiversity element are measured in relation to its worldwide population size or extent.

Significantly/Significant Significant means that an outstanding proportion of a biodiversity element (e.g., species population size or ecosystem extent) occurs at the site, as defined by a quantitative threshold. Site A geographical area on land and/or in water with defined ecological, physical, administrative or management boundaries that is actually or potentially manageable as a single unit (e.g., a protected area or other managed conservation unit). For this reason, large-scale biogeographic regions such as ecoregions, Endemic Bird Areas and Biodiversity Hotspots, and land-/seascapes containing multiple management units, are not considered to be sites. In the context of KBAs, \u201csite\u201d and \u201carea\u201d are used interchangeably. I.2 Terms used in the KBA criteria and delineation procedures Aggregation (Criterion D) A geographically restricted clustering of individuals that typically occurs during a specific life history stage or process such as breeding, feeding or migration. This clustering is indicated by highly localised relative abundance, two or more orders of magnitude larger than the species\u2019 average recorded numbers or densities at other stages during its life-cycle. The KBA Standard refers to a difference in relative abundance of two or more orders of magnitude, but this is advisory rather than required. Other metrics may also be used to support KBA proposals under Criterion D1 (e.g., nearest-neighbour distances). Area of occupancy (Criteria A, B, E) The area within the range of a species that is actually occupied (IUCN, 2012a). AOO is the area of habitat that is occupied by the species, based on known, inferred and projected occurrences (IUCN 2001). This definition does not include old localities Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 189 where the species is no longer known, inferred or projected to be present as a result of habitat transformation or other factors likely to have caused the species\u2019 extirpation, such as disease, invasive species or over-exploitation. This definition also excludes localities with a single record or sporadic occurrence outside the species\u2019 habitat or beyond the species\u2019 dispersal range from known, inferred or projected occurrences, such that the species is not expected to occur regularly at the locality. Assemblage (Criterion B) A set of species within a taxonomic group having: a) their ranges \u226595% predictably confined to a single ecoregion for at least one life-history stage; b) their ranges \u226595% predictably confined to a single biome for at least one life-history stage (for taxonomic groups with a global median range size >25,000 km2); or c) their most important habitats in common with multiple other species. In the definition of \u201cassemblage\u201d, the term \u201cbiome\u201d should be replaced by the term \u201cbioregion\u201d. This will be corrected in the next version of the KBA Standard. For species with validated ESH maps, ESH may be substituted for range. The term \u201cassemblage\u201d is also used in the definition of \u201cecological integrity\u201d, but in a more generic sense. Biodiversity element Genes, species or ecosystems, as used by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) definition of biodiversity (Jenkins, 1988). Biological process (Criterion D) The demographic and life-cycle processes that maintain species such as reproduction and migration. Bioregion (Criterion B) Major regional terrestrial and aquatic habitat types distinguished by their climate, flora and fauna, such as the combination of terrestrial biomes and biogeographic realms (Olson et al., 2001) or marine provinces (Spalding et al., 2007, Spalding et al., 2012).

Ecoregion (Criteria B, C) A \u201crelatively large unit of land (or water) containing a distinct assemblage of natural communities and species with boundaries that approximate the original extent of natural communities prior to major land-use change\u201d (Olson et al., 2001). Ecoregions have been mapped for terrestrial (Olson et al., 2001), freshwater (Abell et al., 2008) and near-shore marine (Spalding et al., 2007) environments and are nested within bioregions or provinces. Please see Appendix V for ecoregion templates for terrestrial, freshwater and marine systems. Ecosystem type (Criteria A, B) A defined ecosystem unit for standard and repeatable assessment, at an intermediate level in a globally consistent ecosystem classification hierarchy such as macrogroup or equivalent (Faber-Langendoen et al., 2014). It is defined by a particular set of variables related to its characteristic native biota, an abiotic environment or complex, the interactions within and between them, and a physical space in which these operate (Keith et al., 2013, Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2015). Other terms such as \u201cecological Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 191 communities\u201d and \u201cbiotopes\u201d are often considered operational synonyms of ecosystem type. In the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology, biogeographic ecotypes (Level 4) and global ecosystem types (Level 5) are considered the relevant levels for KBA identification (see the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology Ver. 2.0, Table 2 for further details). The KBA Standard also allows for KBAs triggered by equivalent ecosystem types, defined using other globally consistent ecosystem classification hierarchies (e.g., EcoVeg, Faber-Langendoen et al., 2014). For consistency with the definition of ecosystem type in the KBA Standard (see above) and the ecosystem concept used in the Red List of Ecosystems, equivalent ecosystem types should be defined by a particular set of variables related to the characteristic native biota, abiotic environment or complex, the interactions within and between them, and a physical space in which these operate (Keith et al., 2013, Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2015). Endemic (Criteria A, E) A species having a global range wholly restricted to a defined geographic area such as a region, country or site. Environmental stress (Criterion D) Natural events like floods, droughts, storms, wildfires, earthquakes as well as high or low temperature caused by global change; it can also describe the lack of food due to the bottom-up effect of environmental stress or massive die off of prey in ecosystem due to infectious disease. Environmental stress refers to extreme environmental conditions, whether natural or anthropogenic. Extent of suitable habitat (Criteria A, B) The area of potentially suitable ecological conditions, such as vegetation or substrate types within the altitudinal or depth, and temperature and moisture preferences, for a given species (Beresford et al., 2011). ESH refers to the area of habitat available to a species within its range. ESH cannot extend beyond the range, but may include unoccupied habitat within the species\u2019 range, unlike AOO. ESH is broadly defined to include habitat maps based primarily on expert knowledge (deductive models) or statistical analysis (inductive models). ESH thus includes both Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 192 the concept of \u201carea of habitat\u201d (AOH), which focuses on deductive models (Brooks et al. 2019), and output from statistical habitat models. (See Appendix III.2 for further discussion.) Geographically restricted (Criterion B) A biodiversity element having a restricted global distribution, as measured by range, extent of suitable habitat or area of occupancy, and hence largely confined or endemic to a relatively small portion of the globe such as a bioregion, ecoregion or site. Intact ecological community (Criterion C) An ecological community having the complete complement of species known or expected to occur in a particular site or ecosystem, relative to a regionally appropriate historical benchmark, which will often correspond to pre-industrial times.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "99e9ba84-26f7-4768-9926-b33e2fbaa084": {"__data__": {"id_": "99e9ba84-26f7-4768-9926-b33e2fbaa084", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-biobiz-exchange-enabling-civil-society-engage-business", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN BioBiz Exchange: Enabling civil society to engage with business", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-biobiz-exchange-enabling-civil-society-engage-business", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fc6c2a3216dd9045a6ca1360e63adc0f5fe1a8452e2658e0bd063bb453fc1647"}, "2": {"node_id": "e97fa8a3-db17-4675-b50f-aa1e32a61f11", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-biobiz-exchange-enabling-civil-society-engage-business", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "97e04d97df6cc551c4e789bbce57d1e44152f6d580af804978ff211405afb36d"}}, "hash": "c47cd6d4ce3538df1fc697a71eb70e9bb90be3eb83658987bd333483e2a77a84", "text": "Irreplaceability (Criterion E) Either (a) the likelihood that an area will be required as part of a system that achieves a set of targets (Ferrier et al., 2000) or (b) the extent to which the options for achieving a set of targets are reduced if the area is unavailable for conservation (Pressey et al., 1994). Irreplaceability is heavily influenced by geographically restricted biodiversity, but it is a property of an area within a network rather than of an element of biodiversity and is related to the concept of complementarity.

Localities refer to known points of occurrence, and do not include inferred or projected occurrences or sampling points where the species was not found to occur. For the purposes of KBA identification, old records from areas where the species no longer occurs and vagrancies (i.e. records from areas where the species has only been recorded sporadically and is not known to be native) are excluded from known localities. Each locality should represent a discrete population, to the extent this can be inferred, given the degree of habitat fragmentation and what is known about the dispersal capabilities of the species. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 193 Manageability (Delineation) The possibility of some type of effective management across the site. Being a manageable site implies that it is possible to implement actions locally to ensure the persistence of the biodiversity elements for which a KBA has been identified. This requires that KBA delineation consider relevant aspects of the socio-economic context of the site (e.g., land tenure, political boundaries) in addition to the ecological and physical aspects of the site (e.g., habitat, size, connectivity). An additional aspect of manageability is site accessibility. In some cases, the scale of manageability will be determined by how large an area can be monitored in practice, given the configuration of roads or waterways or the range of typical survey vessels. Mature individuals (Criteria A, B, E) The number of individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction as defined in IUCN (2012a). Population size (Criteria A, B, D) The total, global, number of mature individuals of the species (IUCN, 2012a). Population size is used throughout the KBA Standard rather than simply \u201cpopulation\u201d, which IUCN, (2012a) use to mean the total number of individuals of a species. In the KBA Guidelines, the term \u201cpopulation size\u201d is used to refer to the total number of individuals in a species, as in \u201cglobal population size\u201d; and to the number of individuals in a geographically or otherwise distinct group, as in the \u201csite population size\u201d. This differs from the IUCN Red List, in which the term \u201csubpopulation\u201d is used to refer to a geographically or otherwise distinct group in the population (IUCN, 2012a). Predictably (Criterion D) An expectation of species occurrence at a site during particular seasons or at one or more stages of its life cycle, based on previous or known occurrence, such as in response to specific climate conditions. Predictable occurrence includes both regular (seasonal) occurrence and irregular (episodic) occurrence, as long as the occurrence is a predictable response to environmental conditions. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 194 For Criterion D1, which is based on regular (seasonal) occurrence, a site \u201cpredictably\u201d holds a species if the species is known to have occurred at the site in at least two thirds of the years for which adequate data are available for the relevant season (e.g., the breeding season in the case of a breeding aggregation); the total number of years considered should not be fewer than three. This is consistent with the definition of \u201cregularly\u201d in the application of Ramsar Criteria 5 and 6 (Ramsar, 2018). (See Section 9.3.2 for detailed guidelines.)

Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 195 Regularly (Criteria A, B) The occurrence of a species is normally or typically found at the site during one or more stages of its life cycle. A site \u201cregularly\u201d holds a species if the species is either continually present or occurs there on a predictable cyclical basis, typically (but not necessarily) following a seasonal pattern. In the case of seasonal occurrence, a site \u201cregularly\u201d holds a species if is known to have occurred there in two thirds of the years for which adequate data are available for the relevant season (e.g., the breeding season in the case of a breeding aggregation); the total number of years considered should not be fewer than three. This is consistent with the definition of \u201cregularly\u201d in the application of Ramsar Criteria 5 and 6 (Ramsar, 2018). Reproductive unit (Criteria A, B, E) The minimum number and combination of mature individuals necessary to trigger a successful reproductive event at a site (Eisenberg, 1977). Examples of five reproductive units include five pairs, five reproducing females in one harem, and five reproductive individuals of a plant species. Additional examples of five reproductive units include: \u25cf birds: 5 active nests; 5 pairs; or 5 mature females and at least 1 mature male in lekking species; \u25cf amphibians: 5 mature females and at least 1 mature male for most species; 5 pairs for species that provide biparental care; \u25cf turtles: 5 mature females for marine turtles on nesting beaches; \u25cf fish: 5 mature females and at least 1 mature male for most species; 5 pairs for species that form bonded pairs (e.g., some seahorse species); \u25cf insects: 5 females and at least 1 male for non-social insects; 5 colonies with a single reproducing queen each for social insects; 5 reproductive females for parthenogenetic insects; \u25cf cooperative breeders: 5 cooperative units (e.g., 5 packs of African Wild Dog, Lycaon pictus); \u25cf fungi: 5 mature individuals; \u25cf plants: 5 mature individuals for self-fertilising monoecious or hermaphroditic species; \u25cf clonal species: 5 distinct clones. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 196 Restricted range (Criterion B) Species having a global range size less than or equal to the 25th percentile of range- size distribution in a taxonomic group within which all species have been mapped globally, up to a maximum of 50,000 km2. If all species in a taxonomic group have not been mapped globally, or if the 25th percentile of range-size distribution for a taxonomic group falls below 10,000 km2, restricted range should be defined as having a global range size less than or equal to 10,000 km2. For coastal, riverine and other species with linear distributions that do not exceed 200 km width at any point, restricted range is defined as having a global range less than or equal to 500 km linear geographic span (i.e. the distance between occupied locations [i.e. localities] farthest apart). Species known only from their type locality should not automatically be assumed to have a restricted range, since this may be indicative of under-sampling. For species that have been assessed for the IUCN Red List, information on whether the species is likely to occur more widely, should be available in the IUCN Red List account. Note that range, not ESH, must be used for identifying restricted-range species. The minimum threshold for restricted range is set at 10,000 km2 as a precautionary measure. A list of all species that have been assessed for the IUCN Red List that qualify as restricted-range (using the 10,000 km2 threshold for any taxonomic group that has not yet been comprehensively assessed) is provided on the KBA website (Tools page).

Threatened ecosystems are those assessed as CR, EN or VU according to the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (IUCN, 2015). The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems Categories and Criteria (Version 2.0) were established as a standard by IUCN (2014), based on Keith et al. (2013), not by \u201cIUCN (2015)\u201d as erroneously cited in the KBA Standard. The formatting (but not the content) of these has been updated in the two versions of the RLE Guidelines produced to date (Bland et al., 2016, 2017). Threshold (Criteria A-E) Numeric or percentage minima which determine whether the presence of a biodiversity element at a site is significant enough for the site to be considered a KBA under a given criterion or subcriterion. Trigger (Criteria A-E) A biodiversity element (e.g., species or ecosystem) by which at least one KBA criterion and associated threshold is met. I.3 Additional terms The following terms defined here were not defined in the KBA Standard. Biogeographic ecotype (Criteria A, B) Biogeographic ecotypes (Level 4) are defined as: \u201cAn ecoregional expression of an ecosystem functional group derived from the top down by subdivision of Ecosystem functional groups (Level 3). They are proxies for compositionally distinctive geographic variants that occupy different areas within the distribution of a functional group.\u201d (See the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology Ver. 2.0, Table 2 for further details.) Ecological refugium (Criterion D) In the KBA Standard (IUCN, 2016), ecological refugia are sites that maintain necessary resources (such as food and water) during periods of environmental stress (such as Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 198 severe droughts) when conditions elsewhere become inhospitable, sometimes over multiple years or decades. Note that the KBA Standard states that ecological refugia are used in times of environmental stress. Sites where individuals concentrate in times of environmental plenty (e.g., when prey is available at unusually high densities) do not meet this definition. Extent of an ecosystem type (Criteria A, B) Extent of an ecosystem type refers to the current geographic distribution of an ecosystem type, representing all spatial occurrences of the ecosystem type (Bland et al., 2017, p. ix). Equivalent system (Criterion A) Equivalent systems refers to regional- or national-based assessment processes that produce global status assessments that: i) are based on similar criteria to the IUCN Red List and can be reliably cross-walked to the IUCN Red List; ii) set similar standards for minimum supporting documentation and involve an appropriate process of independent review; and iii) are implemented by recognised assessment bodies in the region/country in question, based on science and input from scientists/ experts throughout the entirety of each species\u2019 range. (See Appendix VII for further details.) Global ecosystem type (Criterion B) Global ecosystem types are defined as: \u201cA complex of organisms and their associated physical environment within an area occupied by an ecosystem functional group. Global ecosystem types grouped into the same ecosystem functional group share similar ecological processes, but exhibit substantial difference in biotic composition. They are derived from the bottom up, either directly from ground observations or by aggregation of subglobal types (Level 6).\u201d (See the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology Ver. 2.0, Table 2 for further details.)

Appendix III.2 includes a section on Validation that is relevant to all habitat maps or models used in KBA assessments. III.1 Range Existing data on range For species that have been assessed for the IUCN Red List, range polygons can be downloaded from the IUCN Red List account22. If the IUCN Red List account for a species assessed since 2004 does not include a range map or locality data, this may indicate that distribution data for the species are considered sensitive. KBA Proposers should also check whether range polygons are coded \u201cGeneralised = 1\u201d; if so, this also indicates that the range polygon has been generalised and that distribution data for the species are considered sensitive. In both cases, KBA Proposers should review Section 9.1.1 on sensitive data and check with their KBA RFP, who will liaise with the IUCN Red List Unit, before submitting a KBA proposal for these species. Range estimates derived from a generalised polygon should not be used as an assessment parameter in KBA identification. With the exception of species listed as CR (PE) or CR (PEW), KBA Proposers should use the range map in the IUCN Red List assessment coded as follows: \u25cf Presence = 1 (Extant) and 2 (Probably Extant)23; \u25cf Origin = 1 (Native) and 2 (Reintroduced) and 6 (Assisted Colonisation); and 22 Individual range maps for non-commercial use can be downloaded from IUCN Red List species accounts; whole groups may be downloaded from http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical- documents/spatial-data; and custom-built sets using a free Red List user account. 23 Note that Presence = 2 is deprecated and will be discontinued. Any range maps that include areas coded as Presence = 2 that extend beyond known occurrences should be reviewed carefully and updated if appropriate prior to KBA identification. Range polygons coded as Presence = 3 (Possibly Extant), Presence = 4 (Possibly Extinct), Presence = 5 (Extinct) or Presence = 6 (Presence Uncertain) should be excluded. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 205 \u25cf any Season code (see below for migratory species). Select the polygons with the codes listed above to calculate total range area, or breeding and non-breeding range area. (See the IUCN Red List Mapping Standards for detailed definitions of mapping codes.) Migratory species For migratory species that have distinct breeding and non-breeding ranges identified in IUCN Red List assessment maps, breeding and non-breeding ranges will typically be assessed separately. Proposers should use the area of the range coded as follows for the breeding range: \u25cf Presence = 1 (Extant) and 2 (Probably Extant)24; \u25cf Origin = 1 (Native) and 2 (Reintroduced) and 6 (Assisted Colonisation); and \u25cf Seasonality = 1 (Resident) and 2 (Breeding Season) and 5 (Seasonal Occurrence Uncertain). Proposers should use the area of the range coded as follows for the non-breeding range: \u25cf Presence = 1 (Extant) and 2 (Probably Extant)25; \u25cf Origin = 1 (Native) and 2 (Reintroduced) and 6 (Assisted Colonisation); and \u25cf Seasonality = 1 (Resident) and 3 (Non-breeding Season) and 5 (Seasonal Occurrence Uncertain). Species listed as CR (PE) or CR (PEW) For species listed as CR (PE) or CR (PEW), KBA Proposers may use polygons coded as Presence = 3 (Possibly Extant) and coded for Origin and Seasonality as above. KBA Proposers are encouraged to reach out to IUCN Red List assessors if the presence coding for species listed as CR (PE) or CR (PEW) is unclear. Estimating range If there is no range map for a species or the range map needs updating, please see the IUCN Red List Mapping Standards for detailed guidelines on developing distribution maps for estimating range,.

III.2 Estimating extent of suitable habitat (ESH) Habitat maps show the distribution of habitat for a species and are used as the basis for estimating ESH.

ESH is broadly defined to include habitat maps based primarily on expert knowledge (deductive models) or statistical analysis (inductive models). ESH thus includes both the concept of \u201carea of habitat\u201d (AOH), which focuses on deductive models (Brooks et al., 2019), and output from statistical habitat models (also referred to as species distribution models, ecological niche models, bioclimatic models, density distribution models, etc.) Deductive approaches are well suited to developing consistent binary habitat maps for entire taxonomic groups, including data-limited species. They have lower data, technical and computational demands than inductive approaches. Deductive approaches are well suited to sedentary species and species with fixed breeding and/or non-breeding habitats. They are not well suited to species with spatially dynamic habitats, including many pelagic marine species. For such species, inductive approaches based on statistical habitat models provide the best available methods for estimating the distribution of mature individuals, if sufficient data are available. Existing data on ESH Validated ESH maps, derived using a deductive approach, are available for terrestrial mammals and birds (Dahal et al., in press) and will be provided through the IUCN Red List (spatial downloads page). Validated ESH maps for other taxonomic groups will also be provided when available. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 207 Estimating ESH If there is no validated ESH map or there is scope for improving the existing ESH map, the first step for KBA Proposers seeking to use ESH as an assessment parameter is to download the existing range map or develop a new range map (see Appendix III.1). Spatial resolution An ESH map is typically a raster (i.e. set of grid cells), but may be a polygon. If ESH is based on grid cells, the proportion of a species\u2019 ESH that is found within a site will depend in part on the spatial resolution of analysis. Analysis at a finer spatial resolution (for example, using 1-km2 or 4-km2 grid cells rather than 100-km2 grid cells) will generally lead to a lower global ESH and make it more likely that a site that falls entirely within the ESH exceeds the thresholds specified in the criteria. The standard resolution for AOO is 2 x 2 km grid cells; a link to a standardised 2 x 2 km grid is provided on the KBA website (Tools page). KBA Proposers are encouraged to use this grid for ESH where appropriate, but may use other resolutions if the 2 x 2 km grid is not suitable given the species\u2019 distribution patterns or the resolution of available data. Deductive approaches Deductive approaches, such as AOH (Brooks et al. 2019), typically involve classifying topographical and environmental data layers (e.g., altitude, bathymetry, land cover and benthic habitats, distance to water bodies), using information on altitudinal limits and habitat classes in IUCN Red List accounts (see IUCN Red List Habitat Classification Scheme) derived from published and unpublished literature and expert knowledge. A similar approach may be used in marine systems, especially for relatively sedentary benthic or demersal species, using bathymetry and other physiological limits (e.g., sea-surface temperature and salinity) together with benthic habitat classes. Once a range map is available, ESH can be delimited as follows: i. in a GIS, rasterise the range map into grid cells (optional); ii. remove cells or areas that fall outside the altitudinal/bathymetric or climate/temperature/salinity/soil type limits of the species distribution; iii. remove cells or areas that are otherwise unlikely to be suitable for the species, based on land cover or benthic habitat.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "32dd878c-8676-40d2-a6a2-0a8c662afb0e": {"__data__": {"id_": "32dd878c-8676-40d2-a6a2-0a8c662afb0e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-biobiz-exchange-enabling-civil-society-engage-business", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN BioBiz Exchange: Enabling civil society to engage with business", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-biobiz-exchange-enabling-civil-society-engage-business", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a1219463efe4285d86d7c272b4021d7b7c0e55599ccfc17398cb77a3d85afbfb"}, "2": {"node_id": "6d215e33-2cba-422b-8f64-e3430d650f54", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-biobiz-exchange-enabling-civil-society-engage-business", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9e9d3c11e1f11742accf00e599ef945ab95f9898ace86a48f27e367840e3ddca"}}, "hash": "131c596f4ff86fa80f2e7df35897730c04afef004987650c738ccfac394d57fb", "text": "Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 208 Inductive approaches ESH maps may also be developed using inductive approaches, by applying statistical methods (e.g., generalized linear or additive models, classification or regression trees) to known localities and topographical and environmental covariates (Elith & Leathwick, 2009; Franklin, 2010; Zurell et al., 2020).

Given adequate data, statistical analysis can account for variation in sampling effort and detectability. Validation The final ESH map should include all known, inferred or projected occurrences (including conservation translocations but excluding vagrancies), and all habitat (with unsuitable areas removed). Habitat maps and models can vary widely in quality and accuracy. A map or model may not provide an accurate representation of habitat if key variables are omitted. For example, a map would overestimate the habitat of a forest-dependent montane species if it identified all forest areas as potential habitat, irrespective of altitude. All habitat maps or models used in KBA assessments should therefore be subject to a critical evaluation based on biological and statistical considerations (where applicable). The selection of environmental covariates should be based on knowledge of the biology of the species and not simply fitted statistically from a pool of candidate variables that are conveniently available. All habitat maps or models used in KBA assessments (including ESH maps) should be validated with independent occurrence data. See Dahal et al. (in press) for validation methods for deductive approaches. When using inductive approaches, appropriate methods for model selection and evaluation should be employed, Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 209 including statistical tests of goodness-of-fit (e.g., the area-under-the-curve, Akaike\u2019s Information Criterion). Habitat maps and models that have not been published in the peer-reviewed literature should be sufficiently rigorous to pass peer review. Documentation In the documentation, KBA Proposers are requested to include sufficient information on datasets and mapping procedures to enable reproduction of the final ESH layer, and describe the process whereby the ESH map was created and validated (including the degree of expert engagement). The final ESH spatial data layer should also be submitted to the KBA Secretariat for archiving. This file may then be provided to other KBA Proposers for use in future KBA proposals (with a reference to the original spatial data source). III.3 Estimating area of occupancy (AOO) The area within the range of a species that is actually occupied (IUCN, 2012a). AOO is the area of habitat that is occupied by the species, based on known, inferred and projected occurrences (IUCN, 2001). Existing data on AOO For some species that have been assessed for the IUCN Red List, AOO may have been defined and mapped already. AOO maps must be validated before they can be used in KBA identification. Validated AOO maps can be obtained from the KBA Secretariat, if available. Estimating AOO If there is no validated AOO map or the AOO map needs updating, KBA Proposers seeking to use AOO as an assessment parameter should see the IUCN Red List Mapping Standards for detailed guidelines on mapping AOO. Habitat maps and models cannot be used to estimate a species\u2019 AOO directly because they map areas of habitat that may presently be unoccupied (i.e. outputs are closer to ESH than AOO). Low habitat-occupancy may result because factors other than habitat are limiting, such as exploitation, availability of prey, impacts of predators, competitors or disturbance, dispersal limitations. Habitat maps and models may therefore need to be filtered to produce a valid depiction of AOO for use in KBA identification. In some cases, filtering out areas that are unlikely to be occupied may Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 210 be fairly straight-forward. For example, projected occurrences in habitat patches that are small and distant from habitat patches with known localities may be filtered out using knowledge of the species\u2019 dispersal limitations; projected occurrences in areas close to roads or human population centres may be filtered out if hunting is a threat; areas that lack recent known occurrences and are known to have been affected by pathogens may be filtered out. AOO must be assessed based on a grid. The IUCN Red List Guidelines (IUCN SPC, 2022, Section 4.10.7) provide the following three conditions for using habitat maps or models to estimate AOO: i) Habitat maps and models must be justified in the documentation as accurate representations of the habitat requirements of the species and validated by a means that is independent of the data used to construct them.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "089563f3-4196-47aa-98c1-7573a6ff146c": {"__data__": {"id_": "089563f3-4196-47aa-98c1-7573a6ff146c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-biobiz-exchange-enabling-civil-society-engage-business", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN BioBiz Exchange: Enabling civil society to engage with business", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-biobiz-exchange-enabling-civil-society-engage-business", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "262f7803d5aa2ba7f4f9c1bb43fb055cb0fbaad70d5e7db2558df2e4b6b96c15"}, "2": {"node_id": "635177f7-034c-40ca-b7d7-9e2b70680716", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-biobiz-exchange-enabling-civil-society-engage-business", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0cc1bbd35d57b783b0d13063133c008b6aed860e34245b3598b1d692f9548e24"}}, "hash": "aa1506c68d47db38dfcba247525c11ae567074a5ae8a0d1126443caab9872be4", "text": "ii) The area of potential habitat must be filtered to produce an estimate of the area of occupied habitat. iii) The estimated area of occupied habitat derived from the map must be scaled to the reference scale of 2 x 2 km.

Remote sensing is a common approach for mapping the geographic distributions of many terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Global data sets, such as those available for forests (Hansen et al., 2013), mangroves (Giri et al., 2011), water cover (Pekel et al., 2016), and coral reefs (Andr\u00e9fou\u00ebt et al., 2006), may provide a useful basis for superimposing appropriate classifications of ecosystem types. Spatial proxies for ecosystem distributions (such as climate, substrate, topography, bathymetry, ocean currents, flood regimes, water cover, aquifers or some synthesis of these that can be justified in the documentation as valid representations of the distribution of ecosystem biota or its niche space) may be used in some cases. Physical factors such as sea floor characteristics, ocean currents, water temperatures and water chemistry may be appropriate predictors of ecosystem distribution for marine ecosystems. Spatial distribution models offer an additional opportunity to formally select and combine the most suitable set of spatial proxies to predict ecosystem distributions. Clark et al. (2015), for example, used bathymetric spatial data and remote sensing data on sea ice concentration to model the distribution of suitable light conditions for under-ice marine benthic invertebrate communities in Antarctic waters. When using spatial proxies or developing spatial distribution models, a mechanistic understanding of the relationship between occurrence of the ecosystem and limiting environmental factors is essential for developing a valid representation of the geographic distribution of an ecosystem type.

Pressey et al. (1994) proposed a method that was computed as the number of representative combinations including the focal spatial unit divided by the total number of representative combinations, but this is computationally costly and cannot be calculated for large numbers of spatial units. Ferrier et al. (2000) proposed two methods, including summed irreplaceability, but this can exceed a value of 1 and is not easily rescaled, which makes it difficult to use in Criterion E assessments. The software Marxan (Ball et al., 2009) approximates irreplaceability by running an algorithm with the objective function of minimising the total network area or cost, subject to the constraint of achieving the representation targets. The algorithm is run a large number of times and the irreplaceability of each spatial unit is approximated by its selection frequency. This is the most widely used approach for estimating irreplaceability. However, it is based on a large number of suboptimal solutions \u2014 it can approximate irreplaceability if Marxan can find near-optimal solutions, but selection frequencies across spatial units will then tend to 0 or 1. CLUZ (Smith, 2019) is a user-friendly GIS plug-in that links to Marxan. With integer linear programming methods now available in tools such as prioritizr (Hanson et al., 2017), it is possible to calculate the optimal solution for a given conservation planning problem. Given a single optimal solution, the selection frequency for each spatial unit will be 0 or 1. prioritizr provides two alternative methods for estimating irreplaceability \u2014 the replacement cost method (Cabeza & Moilanen, 2006) is recommended for Criterion E analysis. KBA Proposers are advised to review software manuals carefully to check for relevant practical limitations (e.g., the maximum number of planning units that can be Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 220 included and expected run times), recognising that software and computing power are improving all the time (see Schuster et al., 2019 for example). Baisero et al. (2021) developed a proximity-to-irreplaceability metric (proxirr) that separates measurement of irreplaceability from complementarity. This is not currently recommended for use in Criterion E assessments because the KBA Standard specifies that complementarity-based methods should be used. Given the various ways that irreplaceability can be estimated, KBA Proposers should clearly document the method used to enable proper review. References Baisero, D., Schuster, R. and Plumptre, A.J.

Species that can trigger KBA Criterion A1 are: \u25cf species assessed as globally threatened (i.e. CR, EN or VU) on the IUCN Red List; and \u25cf species that (a) have not been assessed globally and (b) are endemic to the region/country in question and (c) have been assessed as regionally/nationally threatened following the Guidelines for Application of IUCN Red List Criteria at Regional and National Levels (IUCN, 2012b) or equivalent systems. What are equivalent systems? Equivalent systems refers to regional- or national-based assessment processes that produce global status assessments that: i) are based on similar criteria to the IUCN Red List and can be reliably cross-walked to the IUCN Red List; ii) set similar standards for minimum supporting documentation and involve an appropriate process of independent review; and iii) are implemented by recognised assessment bodies in the region/country in question (e.g., NatureServe in the USA/Canada, the Threatened Species Scientific Committee in Australia), based on science and input from scientists/experts throughout the entirety of each species\u2019 range. By definition, equivalent systems have demonstrated consistency with IUCN Red List assessments and so can serve as reliable proxies.

Allowing such species to trigger KBAs under Criterion A1 expands the scope of Criterion A1 to include taxonomic groups that have not yet been assessed for the IUCN Red List, in a way that is consistent with the IUCN Red List and hence with the intent of the KBA Standard.

Each species in the WDKBA must have a unique identification number, unique scientific name, and a single status assessment, as per the database that underpins the Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 222 IUCN Red List (i.e. the Species Information Service, SIS). This is essential for the functionality of the WDKBA. In the case of a mismatch in taxonomy, the species concept used for KBA identification must be consistent with the species concept used in the SIS. In the case of a simple difference in nomenclature for the same species concept (e.g., Morus capensis in SIS; Sula capensis in the equivalent system), the difference in nomenclature should not impede KBA assessment. On the other hand, where there is a difference in treatment of a species or species complex (e.g., Canis lupus lycaon is recognised as a subspecies of C. lupus on the IUCN Red List, but as a distinct species in some other systems), a KBA may only be triggered by a full species recognised by the IUCN SSC Red List Authority or IUCN Red List Unit (see Section 2.2.1). (See also Section 2.2.1 for detailed guidelines on the process for updating taxonomy in the case of new information.) What if there is already a global IUCN Red List assessment?

The KBA Proposer should request that the national/regional assessment body prepare an updated IUCN Red List account and submit it to the relevant IUCN SSC Red List Authority. In addition, the KBA Proposer may ask the their KBA RFP to request that the IUCN SSC Red List Authority update the assessment for the species. If the national/regional assessment body provides the required information, but the IUCN SSC Red List Authority does not submit an updated assessment for publication on the IUCN Red List within a reasonable timeframe, the KBA Proposer may request the KBA Secretariat (through their KBA RFP) to allow that the equivalent system assessment be used in the interim for species that are endemic to the region or country where the equivalent system is recognised. The KBA Secretariat will then consult with the IUCN SSC Red List Authority or IUCN Red List Unit to check that the equivalent system assessment corresponds to the expected updated IUCN Red List assessment 26 Note. A species listed as \"Not Evaluated (NE)\" has not yet been assessed against the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria. This does not qualify as having an IUCN Red List assessment for the purposes of this appendix. A species listed as \"Data Deficient (DD)\" does not have adequate data to assess its extinction risk using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria. This qualifies as having an IUCN Red List assessment for the purposes of this appendix. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 223 (in particular, the delay should not reflect a significant disagreement about the species\u2019 status). Decisions will be made on a species-by-species basis. (Please note that this option may no longer be available once the WDKBA is fully linked to the SIS. This appendix will then be updated accordingly.) What about non-endemic species? Regional- or national-based equivalent systems cannot be used for species that are not endemic to the region or country where the equivalent system is the recognised assessment body (e.g., USA/Canada for NatureServe\u2019s G-ranks, Australia for species listed under Australia\u2019s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act). Given that each species can only have a single global status in the WDKBA, this stipulation minimises the potential for conflict over status assessments (for example, because the assessor is not recognised as the relevant assessment body in some part of a species\u2019 range and/or different assessments are made for the same species by different regional/national authorities). For non-endemic species that have been identified as globally threatened by equivalent systems, the best solution is for the KBA Proposer to request that the national/regional assessment body prepare an IUCN Red List account and submit it to the relevant IUCN SSC Red List Authority. In addition, the KBA Proposer may ask their KBA RFP to request that the IUCN SSC Red List Authority prioritise assessment of the species. Where does the responsibility lie for determining whether a system meets the criteria for use as an equivalent system? The KBA Standards and Appeals Committee has the responsibility for verifying that criteria (i) and (ii) above are met, i.e. that the criteria are similar and there is a reliable cross-walk and that documentation standards and review are appropriate. KBA NCGs are responsible for determining whether (iii) is met, i.e. whether the assessment agency is the recognised authority in the region/country, and whether assessments are based on science and input from scientists/experts throughout the species\u2019 range. Are NatureServe\u2019s G-ranks considered an equivalent system? Yes, NatureServe\u2019s G-ranks are considered an equivalent system, as the system complies with the three criteria established above. Specifically, species that (a) have not been assessed globally for the IUCN Red List and (b) are endemic to the USA/Canada and (c) have been assessed as possibly extinct (GH), possibly extinct in the wild (GHC), critically imperiled (G1) or imperiled (G2) can trigger KBA Criterion Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 224 A1.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b64259c-f224-4348-b07d-6ac72fba063e": {"__data__": {"id_": "7b64259c-f224-4348-b07d-6ac72fba063e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-biobiz-exchange-enabling-civil-society-engage-business", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN BioBiz Exchange: Enabling civil society to engage with business", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-biobiz-exchange-enabling-civil-society-engage-business", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "df64715a6551ad449f2604b406a3e6f9910eec7f9bcf1c1a96429c19940b708c"}, "2": {"node_id": "d08af7fe-5d70-42a5-8261-a70b04a580bb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-biobiz-exchange-enabling-civil-society-engage-business", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "292077ae0a1971d8d8f70a9ee8a3e0ba3658378d4702376c4c26ae90c993c8c6"}}, "hash": "763ba2b835906848f6081517b3983478217e98ca9e208e773b449ddfdcc3eddd", "text": "For the purposes of KBA identification, species listed as GH, GHC or G1 are considered equivalent in status to species listed as CR or EN on the IUCN Red List; whereas species listed as G2 are considered approximately equivalent in status to species listed as VU on the IUCN Red List (Master et al. 2012).

Abu Baker, Yousef A. Buhadi, Abdulrahman Alenezi and Zuhair S. Amr About Environment Public Authority The Environment Public Authority of Kuwait (EPA) is an independent governmental organization dedicated to environmental action in addition to domestic and international legislation and policy regarding the environ- ment. The Environment Public Authority was founded in 1995 and since then it serves as the epicentre of governmental action regarding the pres- ervation of the environment in Kuwait. Environment and health protection is one of the main priorities of EPA by implementing deliberate plans and projects to protect air, soil, aquatic habitats, coastal habitats, biodiversity, and environmental impact evaluation. EPA focuses on community ser- vices and public awareness directed to different groups of the community especially the younger generations as they are the leaders of the future (https://epa.org.kw). About IUCN IUCN, International Union for Conservation of Nature, with its Head- quarters in Gland, Switzerland, was created in 1948 as a membership organisation. IUCN is the world\u2019s first and largest global environmental network. It is a democratic membership union with more than 1,500 gov- ernment and nongovernment member organisations, and almost 18,000 volunteer scientists and experts in over 160 countries. IUCN\u2019s work is supported by approximately 900 professional staff in more than 160 countries and hundreds of partners in public, NGO and private sectors around the world. IUCN seeks to help the world find pragmatic solutions to the most pressing environmental and sustainable development chal- lenges. IUCN supports scientific research, manages field projects all over the world and brings governments, nongovernment organisations, United Nations agencies, companies and local communities together to develop and implement policy, laws and best practices (www.iucn.org). About IUCN Regional Office for West Asia The Regional Office for West Asia (ROWA) was established in 2004 in Amman, Jordan. The IUCN West Asian region comprises of 13 countries including Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, the Syrian Arab Republic, Ye- men and Iran in addition to the Gulf countries including Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait, Qatar, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. IUCN Regional Office for West Asia aims to be active in all 13 countries in various conservation and sustainable development activities. Mammals of the State of Kuwait Mohammad A.

The project also aimed at raising the capacity of the EPA staff in biodiversity research and introducing them to modern techniques and most recent research standards and procedures. The project outcomes contribute to establishing a biodiversity database that will enhance the decision-making process related to protected areas and biodiversity conservation. The general objectives of this project included the following: a) Developing a long-term plan for inventory and taxonomic study of Kuwait\u2019s biodiversity. b) Providing technical training for national teams in different fields including biodiversity research methods, taxonomy and biodiversity monitoring. c) Establishing a national biodiversity database that is linked with the state\u2019s research and educational institutions. The database will contribute to the following: identifying the ecological hot spots and priority sites for conservation, monitoring the implementation of the obligations of the State of Kuwait towards regional and international conventions related to biodiversity conservation (the international Convention on Biological Diversity, Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and the Convention on the Conservation of Wildlife and Natural Habitats in the Countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council. 1 Introduction 6 Mammals of the State", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "27d565e3-87aa-4f39-8f32-4e27b9e6a252": {"__data__": {"id_": "27d565e3-87aa-4f39-8f32-4e27b9e6a252", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/mammals-state-kuwait", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Mammals of the State of Kuwait", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/mammals-state-kuwait", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "30f3e45586673d62f97afdc6f26b92951b50a30794c2e7f44454f72daa09b938"}, "3": {"node_id": "f2e85863-377f-4146-9989-5e8c342c0766", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/mammals-state-kuwait", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "25c85542e60c8906382807e049da46388cdacd35d053c3e0277e39733bb6a9a9"}}, "hash": "c5d313a3b9a86a4dbbc1c504dcba10d2c5e20edc17f400d9bc546089ccd4e9b0", "text": "of Kuwait 2.1 Location and topography The total area of the State Kuwait is 17,818 km2 of land and about 1,000 km2 of off-shore islands. It is situated in the most northwestern corner of the Arabian Gulf (Figure 1). Kuwait is an arid country and consists mainly of des- ert land. It is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the south and southwest and with Iraq to the north and northwest. The landscape is relatively flat, broken only by occasional low sand dunes and shallow depressions. The surface elevates gently from east to west reaching about 300 m above sea level at Al-Shigaya and Al-salmi. The eastern part of the state, including all of the inhabited area, is overlooking the Arabian Gulf with coastline that extends about 195 km. Figure 1: Map showing location of the State of Kuwait (Source: IUCN, H. Haddad) 2 General description 7 2.2 Geographical setting The total area of the State Kuwait is 17,818 km2 of land and about 1,000 km2 of off-shore islands. It is situated in the most northwestern corner of the Ara- bian Gulf (Figure 1). Kuwait is an arid country and consists mainly of desert land. It is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the south and southwest and with Iraq to the north and northwest. The landscape is relatively flat, broken only by occasional low sand dunes and shallow depressions. The surface elevates gently from east to west reach- ing about 300 m above sea level at Al-Shigaya and Al-Salmi. The eastern part of the state, including all of the inhabited area, is overlooking the Arabian Gulf with coastline that extends about 195 km. The surface consists of flat sandy plains interspersed with some low-rise hills, some of which reach a height of nearly 145 meters, and in northern Kuwait there are a series of hills such as Jal Al-Zour ridge, the hills of Al-Marw and Al-Liiah. In the south, hills in the form of domes are common in the regions of Warah and Burgan. Sand dunes areas are mostly located in northwestern Kuwait along Al-Huwamiliyah-Al-Nimritayn zone reaching Al Atraf area. Kuwait is crossed by several dry desert wadi sys- tems, such as Wadi Al-Batin, extending along the Kuwaiti-Iraqi borders about 150 km, and runs along the western borders of Kuwait, with a width in some parts reaching about 10 km and a maximum depth of about 57 meters. To the north lies the Rawdatain Plain, consisting of flat land that slopes towards the east and the northeast. Kuwait includes nine islands in the Arabian Gulf, the largest is Bubiyan Is- land (683 km2). The coastal strip extends for about 500 km, with a number of small bays and lagoons. The largest of are Kuwait and Kazma Bays, with several lagoons; Abdullah, Boubyan, and Al Subiya khawrs in the north, and Al Maftah and Al Amma khawrs in the south. 2.3 Phasical parameters The physical factors mainly in the form of extreme temperature fluctua- tions and elevated salinity exert considerable natural stress on the marine and coastal ecosystems of the Gulf. As a consequence, the biodiversity is significantly lower compared with the Indian Ocean. Because of the relative shallowness, the Gulf supports highly productive coastal habitats, such as the extensive intertidal mudflats and seagrass beds. Along parts of the coast there are also areas of dwarf mangrove and coral reefs. However, the coral reefs show relatively very low biodiversity. Many species of corals as well as other species of animals and several plants in the area live close to their toler- ance thresholds. In the northern Gulf, most of the subtidal areas are soft sedi- ment bottoms. Extensive seagrass beds mostly cover these sediments, which 8 Mammals of the State of Kuwait supports a number of commercially important species such as the prawn. Al- gae mats associated with the tidal flats are also highly productive as they are covered with blue-green nitrogen-fixating algae during part of the year. These tidal flats are a key feeding area for wintering and migrating waders (Lind\u00e9n et al., 2004).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f2e85863-377f-4146-9989-5e8c342c0766": {"__data__": {"id_": "f2e85863-377f-4146-9989-5e8c342c0766", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/mammals-state-kuwait", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Mammals of the State of Kuwait", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/mammals-state-kuwait", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "30f3e45586673d62f97afdc6f26b92951b50a30794c2e7f44454f72daa09b938"}, "2": {"node_id": "27d565e3-87aa-4f39-8f32-4e27b9e6a252", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/mammals-state-kuwait", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c5d313a3b9a86a4dbbc1c504dcba10d2c5e20edc17f400d9bc546089ccd4e9b0"}}, "hash": "25c85542e60c8906382807e049da46388cdacd35d053c3e0277e39733bb6a9a9", "text": "2.4 Vegetation of Kuwait The native vegetation of Kuwait is of high values as it represents semi-arid and arid vegetation of the region and contains highly adaptable genes to the harsh environment, extreme drought, poor soil and organic matter and toler- ates high salinity (Zaman et al., 2009). The vegetation types of Kuwait are mainly defined by geomorphological changes, soil types and climatic condi- tions. Four main vegetation types are recognised in Kuwait according to Halwagy and Halwagy (1974b), Halwagy (1986), and Omar (2000): 1.

The following is a summary based on Abdullah, (2017). The first attempt to define the vegetation cover of Kuwait goes back to the med fifties; where in her book \u201cWild Flowers of Kuwait and Bahrain\u201d, Dickson (1955) in- cluded a map showing four plant communities; Rhanterium epapposum, Hal- oxylon salicornicum, Panicum turgidum and Cyperus conglomeratus. Later, Kernick (1963) modified the later map by adding a fifth vegetation type, Zygo- phyllum qatarenses. Kernick (1966) modified the map and included Anabasis vegetation community within the Haloxylon community to the west of Kuwait. Halwagy (1973) and Halwagy et al., (1982) studied the ecology of the desert vegetation of Kuwait, with emphasis on salt marshes vegetation. Halwagy and Halwagy (1974a) identified the physical environment along with the ge- ology of the State of Kuwait. In general, the country is a flat to moderately rolling desert with very limited elevations, wadis, with some low sand dunes and salt marshes.

Halwagy and Halwagy (1974b) recognised the five different plant commu- nities, their proposed map showed that the Haloxylon plant community was the most widely distributed across Kuwait, followed by the Rhanterium com- munity, while the Panicum plant community decreased and the Zygophyllum community decreased around coastal areas (Figure 3). Omar et al. (2001) employed modern Geographical Information system (GIS), based on soil types and vegetation data. This comprehensive study covered all Kuwait (Figure 4). The final map showed eight different vegetation types: Centropodietum, Cyperetum, Halophyletum, Haloxyletum, Panicetum, Rhanterietum, Stipagrostietum, and Zygophylletum (Omar et al., 2007). 2.6 Changes to plant communities Over a period of 25 years (1974-2001), Omar et al. (2001) compared veg- etation communities of Kuwait based on Halwagy and Halwagy (1974b) and recent studies showed significant changes to the vegetation cover. It was con- cluded that some plant communities decreased while others had increased. Perennial shrubs accounted for about 27% of the studied area while perennial 11 Figure 3: Vegetation map of Kuwait showing five plant communities (After: Halwagy & Halwagy, 1974b). grass and sedge represented 67.9% (Omar et al., 2001).

Al-Awadhi et al. (2005) gave a comprehensive account on land degradation in Kuwait, thus affecting the vegetation cover. These changes were attributed to environmental factors; including climate change and human activities (e.g. over-grazing, uprooting of shrubs, soil compaction, military activities, and soil oil pollution). Uddin et al. (2010) addressed the micro-climatic variations as a result of land-cover changes. They stated that the environmental catastro- phes that emerged during the Gulf war (e.g. oil lakes and spills over land) left permanent damages. Additionally, Kuwait exhibited large scale of urban expansion. All these accounted for changes in the vegetation cover country 12 Mammals of the State of Kuwait wide. Abdullah (2017) stated that the current status of vegetation communi- ties in Kuwait underwent intensive land deterioration and reduction of plant communities such as Rhanterium spp. and Haloxylon spp., while on the other hand, grasses and sedges communities increased (e.g. Stipagrostis spp. and Cyperus spp.). Figure 4: Current vegetation map of Kuwait (Source: Omar et al., 2001). 16 Mammals of the State of Kuwait 3.1 General overview of the methodology Standard methods for studying and monitoring mammalian diversity were conducted to record species presence and distribution in Kuwait. This includ- ed rapid diagnosis surveys to validate available information and to fill in in- formation gaps through on-foot transects, opportunistic observations, Sher- man trapping and camera traps within selected localities (Wilson et al., 1996; Braun, 2005). The methods provided sighting for diurnal and nocturnal ani- mals. Rapid diagnosis visits were conducted to record species presence in the study sites. This included rapid diagnosis surveys to validate available infor- mation and to fill in information gaps through on-foot transects, opportunistic observations, trapping and camera traps within selected localities (Wilson et al., 1996; Long et al., 2008). Direct (trapping and observations) and indirect methods (transects for animals and their signs such as footprints, scats and dens) were adopted to record species presence in the study sites. On-foot transects, opportunistic observations, Sherman trapping, and remote-sens- ing camera traps were used. These methods provide direct observations for diurnal and nocturnal animals as well as information about the abundance of each species. The study sites were distributed to cover the two peak activities of animals, the morning peak and the afternoon peak. Specimens for differ- ent species caught during the study were collected as a reference collection for further identification and studies. Observed animals and their signs were identified in the field. GPS coordinates, photographs, and notes on the habitat will be recorded for each transect. Observations on agricultural expansion and urban development, livestock grazing, off-road driving, wood-cutting, and touristic activities were recorded within all visited sites to evaluate the threats on the mammalian diversity. The following methods will be used to assess the mammalian diversity with- in the study area: 3.2 Literature review and previous records A literature review was conducted based on the biophysical and natural en- vironment of Kuwait. The review covered all available publications of scien- tific papers, books, technical ecological, biodiversity reports, and communi- cations on personal observations. A list of all cited references was compiled and included the biogeographic zones, bio-climatic zones, ecosystems, key biological habitat, sensitive and important habitat, species diversity with more emphasis on red list, indicator and key species. 3. Methodology 17 3.3 Spoor transects, car transects, and on-foot day transects Transects for mammals and their signs (footprints, scats and dens) will pro- vide direct and indirect recordings for species presence in the study sites. On- foot transects, car-transect, and opportunistic observations were conducted within the study sites. Most on-foot transects will be conducted in the wadis and in areas with dense vegetation cover, whereas, car transects and oppor- tunistic transects will be used to cover the vast distances between selected sites.

Remote-sensing camera traps equipped with motion sensors were distributed along animal trails and areas with active dens within the study sites. This non-invasive method provides sightings for diurnal and nocturnal animals as well as information about the abundance of species with minimal disturbance. Cameras were set for 1-2 night in sites that were determined after scouting for signs and possible trails used by the animals. Depending on the size of the target species, the cam- 19 eras were fixed on tree branches (or poles) at appropriate heights (about 1m above ground), Figure 7. Figure 7: Camera trap used to survey medium to large-sized mammals. Red fox pho- tocaptured using camera traps (Photos by M. Abu Baker). 3.6 Bat surveys The presence and distribution of bats in Kuwait was recorded through per- sonal observations, bat capturing using mist nets, and bat detectors (Figure 8). Suitable habitats for bats (shelters and day roost sites) were determined using the following methods: inspection for physical sings of bats activity (signs for feeding, faecal remains), surveying roosting sites such as aban- doned and/or old buildings and caves, and visual sighting and remote sensing of bat activity (bat detectors: Song Meter) to determine activity patterns of bats in the study sites.

These species belong to seven orders (Artiodactyla, Carnivora, Cetacea, Chiroptera, Eulipotyphla, Lagomorpha and Rodentia). Species of order Rodentia constitutes the highest number. Cowan (2013) gave the most comprehensive review on the mammals of Kuwait. He listed 25 species of confirmed presence, four uncommon or rare visitors, seven used to occur and are considered by now extinct (Table 2), and two of doubtful provenance. Clayton and Pilcher (1983) and Clayton and Wells (1987) reported on several mammalian species in Kuwait. Here, species descriptions and distributions are based on Harrison and Bates (1991) and Cowan (2013). Range of distribution and valid names were followed as in the IUCN Red List, Mammal Species of the World, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution. Common names were given as possible, based on Harrison and Bates (1991) and Cowan (2013). The geographic names for localities and their coordinates follow the Gazetteer of Jordan (Anonymous, 1990). The acronyms are BMNH British Museum of Natural History, FMNH Field Museum of Natural History, HZM Harrison Zoological Museum, SMNH Smith- sonian Museum of Natural History.

The tail is longer than the head and body length, usually bicoloured covered by short hair. The hair on the base of tail is whitish with brown upper part. The fur colour is grey dorsally, whitish on the ventral side. A sharp line on the flanks separates the dorsal and the ventral aspect. The skull is extremely small and delicate. The upper jaw has 4 unicuspid teeth. Key to the Orders 4.1 Order Soricomorpha This order includes all the shrews, solenodons and moles. 4.1.1 Family Soricidae This family contains the shrews. This group of mammals is distinguished by their long, narrow, and pointed snout. The family includes the smallest living mammals, some species do not exceed 4 cm long and weigh 2 grams. They are short legged, with five toes per foot. Shrews are known for their extremely high metabolic rate and their rapid heart rate. They feed exclusively on lower invertebrates and insects. 25 This species is found in moist habitats within semiarid areas. Large number of skulls were recovered from owl pellets in Jordan (Amr, 2012). No official records have been made for this species from Kuwait, however, it was re- cently recorded from Al Jahra based on a dead specimen. A photograph of a Isabelline shrike (Lanius isabellinus) also seen in Al Jahra with a small shrew in its beak, most likely of this species (Figure 9). The closest records in Arabia come from Basra area, southern Iraq (Harrison & Bates, 1991).

Al Shaheen). 26 Mammals of the State of Kuwait 4.2 Erinaceomorpha (formerly known as Insectivora) 4.2.1 Family Erinaceidae This family includes the hedgehogs. They are characterized by the presence of spines that covers the dorsal and the lateral aspects of their body.The tail is short and stumpy. Eyes are rather small but well developed. Hedgehogs are nocturnal animals. They remain in sheltered areas for most of the day, and become active by dusk, where they seek small animals as prey (insects and lizards). Some species hibernate during winter. Hedgehogs are the most primitive mammals in the Arabian des- erts, some became very adapted to live in the arid regions of the Middle East (Bates, 1996).

Fur fine and dense. Skull is robust and broad, with a wide braincase. Strongly inflated tympanic bullae, with their cavities extending into the pterygoids. This species is considered as an uncommon or rare resident in Kuwait (Cowan, 2013; Clayton, 1983; Clayton & Wells, 1987). It was reported from Al-Salmi, western Kuwait, April 2007 (Al-Sirhan, 2021; Cowan, 2013). 4.3 Order Chiroptera Order Chiroptera includes the flying bats, one of the most successful mam- mal groups that spread throughout the world. Their forelimbs are modified into a membranous-wing like structure enabled bats to fly and cross continents. Bats are crepuscular or nocturnal; they seek flying insects and look for a water source to drink. Bat\u2019s eyes are usually small in size, with some exception as the fruit bats. They depend entirely on echolocation to make their way and capture its prey. In Jordan, some bats hibernate during winter; while other migrates on seasonal basis. Only three species of bats belonging to three different families (Emballonu- ridae, Hipposideridae, and Vespertilionidae) have been previously recorded in Kuwait, all insect-eating microchiropterans (Cowan, 2013).

Fur colour variable, in general greyish-brown dorsally, with whitish hair on the shoulders, underside is much paler, nearly white, getting lighter towards the posterior. Orange-brownish variants are known to occur. The Trident Leaf-nosed Bat is a desert adapted colonial species. Its colo- nies were found in caves and underground shelters and buildings (Kowaliski & Rzebik-Kowalska, 1991).

It is seen in public and home gardens near the coasts, far from the desert and on farms. It feeds on insects while flying at sunset. It is very useful for humans as it controls the numbers of insects and keeps their numbers in check. It has a wide distribution as it spreads from southern Europe and North Africa in the west to the Arabian Peninsula in the south and to the northern Caspian Sea and the Black Sea, extending to Pakistan, Afghanistan and Turkmenistan in the east (Harrison & Bates, 1991). Clayton and Wells (1987) and Cowan (2013) reported it as a fairly common urban resident Harrison & Bates (1991) mentioned three records of Pipistrellus kuhlii based on specimens at the Brit- ish Museum of Natural History (BMNH). 4.4 Order Carnivora 4.4.1 Family Canidae 4.4.1.1 Red fox Vulpes vulpes (Linnaeus 1758) This is the largest fox in Arabia. It has a pointed snout with prominent large bluntly pointed ears. The tip of each ear is brown, back of ear black or greyish black in colour (Figure 15). The anterior edge of the ear is covered by white Figure 15: The Red fox, Vulpes vulpes (Photo by J. Al Ajmi). 33 hair that extends backwards. A black spot is usually located on each side of the muzzle. Tail tip usually white. Black mark on the foreleg. The Red Fox co- louration varies from brown, light brown to red-yellow, with a very dark ventral side. Skull robust with a moderately elongated rostrum. Tympanic bullae less inflated. Posterior part of mandible high. Upper carnassial with a well-formed inner lobe, and a distinct cup is present. Lower canine tall and strongly curved. It can inhabit all types of habitats and perhaps considered a pioneer species in newly established cultivated areas in the desert. The Red Fox is known to feed on small rodents, small birds and reptiles as well as figs, grapes and other fruits. This is a common resident throughout the Arabian Peninsula found in all re- gions (Harrison & Bates, 1991). It is considered common to Kuwait (Clayton & Wells, 1987; Harrison & Bates, 1991; Al-Sirhan, 2021; Pope, 2012). Al-Khalifa et al. (2012) reported the red fox, vulpes vulpes from Al Wafra area.

Clayton and Wells (1987) stated: \u201cAs recently as forty years ago they [In- dian grey mongooses] were reported as being very common in Kuwait City. However, they are unlikely to be found in the modern city and nowadays have been relegated to outlying districts such as Jahra or Fahaheel.\u201d They proba- bly originated as stowaways on trading dhows or as escaped pets (Clayton & Wells, 1987). 4.4.3 Family Felidae 4.4.3.1 Wildcat Felis silvestris (Schreber 1777) This is a small cat.

It is distinguished from the rest of the species with a large and wide head, large ears, and the ears are always in a horizontal position (Figure 18). The sand cat still lives in the wilds of Kuwait, despite its exposure, like other mammals, to the pursuit of the abusers, who throw hunting rifles as if they were a valuable catch. Kitten photographed at Wafra on the Kuwait border (Harrison and Bates, 1991). Several live individuals, apparently caught in Kuwait, were donated to the Desert Animal Facility (Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research,Kabd) and The Scientific Center (Kuwait city) from 2001 (Cowan, 2013). Four cats were seen in the Jal Az-Zor national park 26 June 2003 two of which were photo- graphed (Al-Sirhan, 2021). Figure 18: The sand cat, Felis margarita (Photos by A.

It is observed year-round in the north off Boubyan island with a maximum pod size of 30 individuals, and routinely observed in Kuwait bay (Bishop and Alsaffar, 2008), it was also recorded off Fahaheel and in the south off Khiran (Cowan, 2013). Recent sightings be- tween Mina Al-Zour and Khiran included calves (Nithyanandan, 2010; Pope, 2012; Cowan, 2013). 4.5.1.1.2 Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphin Sousa plumbea (G.

Significant morphological aspects that distinguish them in- clude Colouration (Baldwin et al., 2004) where their color is observed to be dark grey, to which the authors in the cited reference mention that is the rea- soning for naming it the \u201cPlumbeous dolphin\u201d; it has the darkest tone of gray among its kin in the genus, see Figure 19. (Jefferson & Hung, 2004). Figure 19: Illustrations of the different species found in the Sousa genus. This figure represents adult males. It shows the different morphological features that distinguish each species. (Photo by Jefferson and Rosenbaum, 2014). 39 Sousa plumbea is known to be more comfortable around humans, with in- stances of them snatching food falling off of fishing vessels. They can be seen in areas with human activity, as well as other secluded areas (Figure 20, 21). Figure 20: The distribution of Sousa plumbea (Source: Y.

Although there aren\u2019t any official photos for the spe- cies here in Kuwait. Many of the public confirm their presence around Kuwait Bay and what makes this species easy to distinguish from other animals is the hourglass pattern on its side, as well as the creamy yellow colors seen on the pattern (Figure 22).

It is believed that the public sightings of these animals are of individuals that are known to frequent UAE waters. One particular sighted individual has been identified as being part of the local UAE population (Figure 26, 27). Figure 25: The distribution of Tursiops aduncus (Source: Y.

Its skeleton was mounted and displayed in the Natural History Museum of Kuwait (Al-Robaae, 1971a). 4.5.1.2 Family Phocoenidae 4.5.1.2.1 Indo-Pacific finless porpoise Neophocaena phocaenoides (G. Cuvier 1829) As one of the smaller marine mammals seen in Kuwait, N. phocaenoides is one of the harder animals to spot in the wild. The fact that it lacks a dorsal fin lends more to it being an elusive animal. In general, they are shy animals that do not approach boats, but calves of this species have been seen approach- ing and interacting with vessels. Calves start out light grey, and as they grow older, they adopt a black overall coloration (Figure 28A). Unfortunately, adult animals are only seen in strand- ing incidents (Figure 28B,C), there are no conclusive deviance that explains Figure 28: Photos of Neophocaena phocaenoides. A: A stranded adult on Failaka Island, after prolonged exposure to the sun the black skin starts to peal off as the deg- radation process takes place (Photo credit: Abu Omar).

The Indo-Pacific finless porpoise is known to inhabit shallow waters and are thus seen around islands and the shores of Kuwait (Figure 29). This species was recorded based on a photo of a stranded individual (Farmer, 1983). Hen- ningsen and Constantine (1992) reported a group of two and a group of five in Kuwait bay about 2 km from shore. Several sightings and stranding were previously reported (Cowan, 2013).

Suborder: Mysticeti (baleen whales or mysticetes) 4.5.2.1 Family: Balaenopteridae 4.5.2.1.1 Bryde\u2019s whale Balaenoptera edeni Anderson, 1879 As one of the larger marine mammals seen in Kuwait waters, its appearance can be a cause of wonder and concern, especially if found stranded. In the past, this species used to be mixed with the Sei whale due to their similarities (Kato & Perrin, 2009), and for some time that was the case with the recent stranding incidents. But upon closer inspection, experts were able to distin- guish most baleen whales stranded in recent years to be Bryde\u2019s whale. The triangular dorsal fins, the pronounced blow hole, and the number of ridges above the snout all help in distinguishing this animal form other members of the Mysticeti suborder (Figure 30).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4aa0a848-189d-4eb5-a3ed-b10d3c3a687e": {"__data__": {"id_": "4aa0a848-189d-4eb5-a3ed-b10d3c3a687e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/mammals-state-kuwait", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Mammals of the State of Kuwait", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/mammals-state-kuwait", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "03b9161380de7a79506ff533aefea9ffc05e51a524f048d396a9f4d0d34cf6fc"}, "2": {"node_id": "d512870a-7c2b-41a6-aad8-9518939d15e4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/mammals-state-kuwait", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a61d238a2a4298de323d450b71901fc2b8c2ce557b29149189320dff9186b977"}}, "hash": "1699e6cdf5f6e761f04d95dddd4a2bf75067ac0ff2aab357bb6fdf1e4a7e0d70", "text": "For a whale, their presence in Kuwait waters was a mystery, especially since most were found dead.

The lack of sightings in the later half might suggest that they leave the area during that time. With only stranding incidents showing up in northern Kuwait waters, and based on the current live individuals\u2019 sightings, it is believed that these animals are present in the southern parts (Figure 31). 4.5.2.1.2 Sei whale Balaenoptera borealis Lesson, 1828 Bishop and Alsaffar (2008) reported on a 10 m long whale carcass that washed ashore in March 1999 and was identified as B. borealis (Cowan, Figure 31: The distribution of Balaenoptera edeni (Source: Y. Buhadi). 49 2013). 4.5.2.1.3 Blue whale Balaenoptera musculus (Linnaeus 1758) Cowan (2013), reported on three specimens previously identified as blue whales: a skeleton of a whale stranded at Kadhima in June 1963 was re- trieved and placed in the Natural History Museum, later identified as that of B. musculus by Al-Robaae (1971b). The skeleton is currently in the Educational Science Museum (Cowan, 2013), a second skeleton at the museum labelled as blue whale (length 6.5 m) from the Khowaysat area between Kadmah and Doha 10 October 1976, while a third specimen, caught north of Shuaiba in- dustrial area on 26 December 1980 and measuring 7 m in length, it is also on display at the museum (Nithyanandan, 2010; Cowan, 2013). 4.6 Order Artiodactyla The antelopes and their conservation status in Kuwait were reviewed by Kingswood et al. (2001). Three species occurred in Kuwait: the Arabian oryx, Saudi gazelle, and the Arabian sand gazelle (Stewart, 1963; Harrison & Bates, 1991). There have been no recent sightings of any antelopes in Kuwait, and the three indigenous species are considered to be locally extinct (Kingswood et al., 2001). In 1972, there was a report of five gazelles that were seen graz- ing with a flock of sheep and goats in the area of Fahaheel and Fintas, south of the city of Kuwait (Kingswood et al., 2001). Faunal surveys were conducted throughout the country by the Ahmadi Natural History and Field Studies Group before 1990, however, none have been sighted in Kuwait for a number of years, and it is unlikely that populations of antelopes still survive in the pres- ent time (Cowan, 2013). The extermination of antelopes in Kuwait may have resulted from overhunting, overgrazing by domestic livestock, and agricultural expansion (East, 1992; Kingswood et al., 2001). 4.7 Order Lagomorpha 4.7.1 Cape hare Lepus capensis (Linnaeus 1758) The cape hare is distinguished by its long ears long with black tips (Figure 32). Its body is covered with dense and soft fur, colour grey to grey-brown, underside white, neck and chest ventrally with a wide brown band. Its feet are covered with dense brushes of hair that nearly cover the claws. It has five digits on fore feet and four on hind feet. The tail is short with a tuft, colour dark dorsally and white ventrally. The hair around the eyes is white. Skull slender, with a small braincase. Zygomatic arches characteristically with nearly hor- izontal median parts. No sagittal crest. First upper incisor pro-odont with a deep groove anteriorly. Second upper incisor minute. Molars without roots. 50 Mammals of the State of Kuwait The cape hare occurs virtually throughout the Arabian Peninsula, with sev- eral records from Kuwait (Harrison & Bates, 1991). Harrison & Bates (1991) identifies six subspecies in the regions, L. c. arabicus was designated for specimens from western Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Yemen. Thus, any reintroduction plan would require geographically appropriate animals (Omar et al.,1986b; Harrison & Bates, 1991; Omar & Abdulraheem, 1996; Cowan, 2013).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3dacf58f-4fe4-4d87-a46a-ebb1bfa0215c": {"__data__": {"id_": "3dacf58f-4fe4-4d87-a46a-ebb1bfa0215c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/mammals-state-kuwait", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Mammals of the State of Kuwait", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/mammals-state-kuwait", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "46971a28e2e1e4289f65aeb94972abb736885e6a73d09ad02322167f1e923888"}, "2": {"node_id": "0047e52b-72c5-4957-89e1-070347212473", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/mammals-state-kuwait", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "db99457b94ee014990933d25333bc3e16c6ab9cf6c355d67fea245ef75592240"}}, "hash": "1f9afd78635fdad2de901c5e728861817fe3a0d672c81749404984e2737124cc", "text": "Two specimens from 97 km W of Kuwait and Dibdibbah are found at the BMNH. 4.8 Order Rodentia Rodents are by far the largest mammalian order, including over 1700 spe- cies world-wide.

Most of the rodents in Kuwait are relatively small in size, with the exception of the Indian Crested Porcupine.

The dorsal side is covered with layers of modified hair called quills (Figure 36), with longer, thinner quills covering a layer of shorter, thicker ones. The quills are brown or black with alternating white and black bands. Quills can grow up to 50 cm long, small- er (20 cm) and more rigid quills are packed densely on the back and rump. These smaller quills are used for stabbing when the animal is threatened. The tail is short, its base contains shorter quills that appear white in colour, with longer, hollow quills that the porcupine can rattle to produce a warning sound when threatened. It has broad feet with long claws used for burrowing. Eyes and ears small, ears round and covered by hair. Long and well-developed vibrissae. Skull large and robust with small tympanic bullae. Infraorbital fora- men very massive. Frontal region of skull very broad. Cheekteeth are strongly hypsodont and complexly folded with flat crowns. Quills belonging to the porcupine were collected in the Kuwait/Saudi Arabia border area in Wadi al Batin, February 1995 by S.T. Spencer and C.W.T. Pilcher (Cowan, 2013).

The head and body length is 17-20 cm and the tail length is 20-21 cm. The tail is conspicuously bi-coloured, covered with black hair on the dorsal and ventral sides while pale white on the lateral sides, with a black terminal tuft. The tail is slightly longer than the length of the head and body. The pelage is soft and dense, is light brown or light brown with rusty wash on the dorsal surface including entire head and flanks with greyish-black hair bases (Figure 42). The underparts are pure white with a distinct demar- cation line. The ears are relatively large and rounded. The eyes are conspic- uous, surrounded by white hair above the orbit. The hind foot is narrow, with five digits armed with heavy claws, the lateral toes are short. The soles are completely naked, with five pads. Females have four pairs of mammae. The skull is robust with a flattened brain case. The zygomatic arches are heavily built. The rostrum is narrow and elongated. The tympanic bullae are small- 59 er than in Meriones sp. and the mastoid portions do not reach the occipital bones. The upper incisor is powerful with a single longitudinal groove on its orange-yellow anterior surface (Shehab et al., 2011). This large rodent was previously recorded (one female specimen, head and body length 20.5 cm., tail 22 cm.) living in warrens with large entrance holes in the immediate vicinity of some wells in a shallow depression just to the south of Kuwait City (Vesey-Fitzgerald, 1953; Harrison & Bates, 1991; Alyan, 1989). Probably eradicated by the Kuwait Ministry of Health (Al-Sirhan, 2021). Seven specimens from Kuwait are found at the BMNH. Seven specimens of Tatera indica, two from Al Kuwait, outside Gate, and five from Abraj Khaitan, 13 Km S of Al Kuwait are found at the SMNH.

The fur colour is very variable, ranging from blackish dorsally to greyish to brownish, with the underside being lighter. The tail is longer than the head and body length. There is little and short hair on the tail. The skull is elongated in shape, with laterally curved tempoparietal ridges. It has large and well inflated tympanic bullae. The outer tubercles of upper molars are well developed. The first upper molar has an anterolateral cusp. The black rat is found in Kuwait, but seems to be declining (Clayton, 1983; Cowan, 2013). 5.2 Brown rat Rattus norvegicus (Berkenhout 1769) The brown rat is a larger, more robust rat, with a head body length about 380 mm, and tail about 175 mm. The fur colour is solid greyish brown above and below (Figure 45). It is similar to R. rattus, but the tail is shorter than head and body length. The tail also has distinctive epidermal scales. Females have six pairs of mammae. The skull is large and very elongated, with parallel tem- po-parietal ridges. The tympanic bullae are small and only little inflated. First upper molar without an anterolateral cusp. This species is considered locally common in Kuwait (Bezjak & Thornburn, 1983; Clayton, 1983; Clayton & Wells, 1987; Harrison & Bates, 1991; Cowan, 2013). 5.

Extinct mammals of Kuwait Currently, eight mammalian species have been eradicated locally but still exist elsewhere in the Arabian Peninsula (Alsdirawi, 1989). These include: the wolf (Canis lupus), wildcat (Felis silvestris iraki), caracal lynx (Caracal caracal), cheetah (Acinoyx jubatus), Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx), Saudi ga- zelle (Gazella dorcas saudiya), sand gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa marica), and cape hare (Lepus capensis arabicus). It is also believed that all wildlife in Kuwait are in imminent danger as long as the rate at which their habitats are being altered, fragmented, and destroyed is high (Alsdirawi, 1989). A priority system for reintroduction efforts for these species or other wildlife species in the area has been developed (Alsdirawi, 2003). This system aimed to help decision makers in their efforts to conserve Kuwait\u2019s wildlife biodiversity, its application requires the accumulation of basic information the target species, of which, the most important is the historic range and major extinction factors for each of the local species. 6.1 Arabian oryx Oryx leucoryx (Pallas 1777) This species is distinguished by its very long, thin horns. Its ground coloura- tion is white with dark facial and leg markings. Newborns are gray, quick- ly changing to brown then white. The Arabian oryx inhabited gravel plains, sand dunes, and wadis. Gravel plains were probably preferred for their food and shade, and sand dunes were preferred as refuge. Succulent grasses and shoots of Tamarix sp. and other shrubs are preferred foods; bulbs and tubers provide moisture. Oryx are known to wander great distances in search of pas- ture (Harrison & Bates, 1991; Kingswood et al., 2001). Oryx leucoryx presumably occurred in the western and northwestern des- erts of Kuwait prior to 1900 (Kingswood et al., 2001). Its reintroduction into Ku- wait has been recommended in Al-Batin, however, because if its large home range and daily movement, a protected area of considerable size that spans over adjacent countries would be needed in addition to conservation mea- sures to manage its population and mitigate the threats (Omar et al., 1986b; Omar & Abdulraheem, 1996; Kingswood et al., 2001; Alsdirawi & Faraj, 2004). 6.2 Dorcas gazelle Gazella dorcas (Linnaeus 1758) This is a small gazelle, shorter than the other gazelles. Males are larger than females. The horns of males are long and straight, but both sexes have well-developed horns and annuli. Its fur colour is brownish red dorsally with fa- cial markings, and white ventrally, flankstripes faint. Facial markings consist of 71 dark stripes extending from the posterior mouth opening to the eye and a dark broad stripe extending from nasals to bases of horns, else facial colour whit- ish. Its ears are very long and reach nostrils when laid forward. The posterior margin of nasals triangular in shape. The tail has a dark streak. The premax- illae is long and in touch with nasals, the nasal bones are narrow and widest anteriorly. Fenestrae of infraorbital fossa not present. Parietal ridges present. The dorcas gazelle is known to have occurred in Kuwait based on speci- mens at the British Museum (Harrison & Bates, 1991).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29484377-b034-44dc-8c53-62d5a6fd2a97": {"__data__": {"id_": "29484377-b034-44dc-8c53-62d5a6fd2a97", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/mammals-state-kuwait", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Mammals of the State of Kuwait", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/mammals-state-kuwait", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "53b6fa7e639b22e123286128b83cad7ec0795de11653a1ed439f9a8c3cc00bf1"}, "2": {"node_id": "3b2c5573-1fdd-4ab4-b673-80009033e10f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/mammals-state-kuwait", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4e41cfbcacfc6503b8b73e937a41bd0ad210f560483fefefc74f516ee472983f"}}, "hash": "e4790d98cf9e8db2824a9dce976212f21cafc0ebaad4a600fba2b7000139a7f3", "text": "6.3 Saudi gazelle Gazella saudiya (Carruthers & Schwarz 1935) The Saudi gazelle was considered as a subspecies of the dorcas gazelle, however, recent genetic studies supported its position as a separate species (Rebholz et al., 1991).

The species was always rare and de- clining due to excessive hunting; it has not been seen for a few decades and was declared extinct in the wild in 1980 (East, 1992; Kingswood et al., 2001). Recent genetic analysis of all reported specimens of G. saudiya in captive collections has shown these represent different species or hybrids. Despite frequent surveys attempting to find pure Saudi gazelles in the wild and pri- vately owned, no evidence of surviving individuals has been found.

This species has been recorded from Kuwait based on a specimen found at the BMNH (Harrison & Bates, 1991). However, Dunham et al. (2001) cast doubt on the existence of the species in the past in Kuwait because it was recorded on the western side of the Arabian Peninsula, with all records west of 47 \u00b0E except for one anomalous specimen from Kuwait, which reached the British Museum after a period of captivity at London Zoo (Cowan 2013). The Saudi gazelle is now considered extinct in the wild and may well be extinct in captivity too, as certain claimed captive G. saudiya populations have been shown not to be so (Kingswood et al., 2001; Hammond et al., 2001). 6.4 Arabian sand gazelle Gazella marica (Thomas 1897) This is a large heavy-build gazelle with a rather short black tail. Males have a conspicuous swelling around the throat. The fur colour dorsally light clay brown, ventral white, with indistinct flank stripes (Figure 48). The facial colour 72 Mammals of the State of Kuwait white, with a faint facial stripe going from the anterior of the eyes to the muz- zle. Its ears are short. The females either hornless or with very short, slender horns. Males with long annulated horns and lyrate and close together at base. Skull robust, distinctively large in size and with a large orbital width. Nasals in contact with premaxillae. This species prefers desert plains, salt flats, and sand dunes. It is primarily a browser, but grasses and forbs are also eaten. Group sizes are usually one to nine, but herds may number in the hundreds or thousands; herds have been known to migrate long distances in response to rainfall and availability of for- age. Females usually give born to one or two calves after a gestation period of five to six months (Kingswood & Blank, 1996). Until recently, the Arabian sand gazelle was considered a subspecies of the goitered gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa Guldenstaedt, 1780), as Gazella subgutturosa marica. Wacher et al. (2010) established them within distinct lineages based on mitochondrial DNA analysis and it is now considered a separate species. The Arabian sand gazelle was even found to closely related to two North African gazelles, Cuvier\u2019s gazelle (Gazella cuvieri) and the rhim (Gazella leptoceros) (Hassanin et al., 2012). Records include specimens of Arabian sand gazelles from Al-Batin and Dib- Figure 48: The goitred or reem gazelle, Gazella subgutturosa (Photo by A.

The goitred gazelle is known to have occurred in Kuwait based on specimens at the British Museum (Green, 1986; Harrison & Bates, 1991). 3 specimens of Gazella subgutturosa are found at the BMNH, 2 labeled Kuwait, 1 from Dibdibbah, 97 km SW Ku- wait. Today, this species survives in the wild in small, isolated populations in Sau- di Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, and southeastern Turkey. Small numbers may also be present in Kuwait, Iraq, Jordan, and Syria. The total population of wild sand gazelles is thought to be less than 3,000. Significantly more are held in captivity, reserves, or breeding programs, perhaps more than 100,000. The reintroduction of the reem gazelle in Kuwait was proposed with- in its former range (e.g., Al-Batin).

Omar et al. (1986a, b) listed the fennec fox as part of the fauna of Jal Az-Zor national park based on a photo that depicted a red fox (Cowan, 2013). Alsdirawi & Faraj (2004) indicated the presence of fennec fox in the Kuwait border demilitarized zone without proof, presumably on the basis of the Kuwait and Iraq individuals.

The historical changes in dugong distribution and perceived changes in their abundance was examined by Al-Abdulrazzak & Pauly (2017). They found that since 1950, dugong range may have contracted by one quarter, and despite their large population, their overall densities in the Gulf are far lower than in other areas within their range. The global IUCN status for the dugong is vulnerable with its presence in Kuwait listed as \u201cuncertain or vagrant\u201d (Marsh & Sobtzick, 2019) The dugong was reported in Kuwait from Failaka F5 and Tell Akkaz in Kuwait (Desse & Desse-Berset, 1990; Tome, 2003; Beech, 2010). 78 Mammals of the State of Kuwait 7. Nature conservation in Kuwait Figure 49: Protected areas in the State of Kuwait (Source: Environment Public Au- thority of Kuwait) Kuwait has long been regarded as a vast hema, but since the 1970s, this tradition has been eroded by urban development and industrialization (IUCN, 1992; Kingswood et al., 2001). In 1980, the general policy of environmental protection Decree Law Number 62 was established which included sections on preservation of the desert environment and designation of protected areas in Kuwait. The Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research (KISR) was contract- ed by the government (Kuwait Municipality). KISR planned the development and management of the country\u2019s first national park and, in 1990, Jal Az-Zor National Park, a 33,000 ha protected area. KISR also proposed a system of protected areas, Figure 49 (Green et al., 1991; IUCN, 1992; Evans, 1994). The proposed system of protected areas included three desert parks or re- serves (Al-Batin, Al-Khiran, and Umm Niga). The primary objectives of nation- al parks and nature reserves in Kuwait are to preserve natural and ecologi- cal components of the environment and to provide areas for environmental and ecological research. National parks also have an educational component through proper land use and to provide facilities for education and training. Nature reserves were designated to preserve the natural and ecological com- ponents of the environment and restrict human activity. Livestock grazing is 79 restricted and hunting is prohibited within the parks and reserves. Hunting is permitted throughout the country outside protected areas and there are no laws for its regulation (IUCN, 1992; Evans, 1994; Omar & Abdulraheem, 1996). 7.1 Conservation measures The establishment and integrated management of a network of protected areas in Kuwait is of high priority for the conservation of threatened species. Protected areas provide refuge and suitable sites for the reintroduction of threatened and extinct fauna (such as antelopes). For example, the reintro- duction of Arabian oryx and Arabian sand gazelles was recommended in Jal Az-Zor National Park (Omar & Abdulraheem, 1996). Other sites such as Umm Niga was identified for reintroduction of threatened species (e.g. G. saudiya) as it occurs within is former distribution range (Green et al., 1991). Popula- tions of Arabian oryx and other antelopes exist in reserves and captive breed- ing programs in the region, thus, stocks are available for reintroduction efforts after careful examination of their taxonomic status. However, for the reintro- duction efforts to succeed in Kuwait, the elimination of threats such as habitat loss, competition with livestock, and hunting, and it will require monitoring the reintroduced populations as part of the management programs of protected areas (Sausman & Correll, 1994). The reintroduction of antelope populations in Kuwait should also be managed as part of a regional joint efforts with neigh- boring countries to maintain minimum viable populations and provide areas that may support these desert species that roam over large home ranges Green et al., (1991). 80 Mammals of the State of Kuwait Abdullah, M.

Amr, Abdulrahman Al-Sirhan Alenezi, Amani Al-Zaidan and Mohammad A. Abu Baker About Environment Public Authority The Environment Public Authority of Kuwait (EPA) is an independent governmental organization dedicated to environmental action in addition to domestic and international legislation and policy regarding the environ- ment. The Environment Public Authority was founded in 1995 and since then it serves as the epicentre of governmental action regarding the pres- ervation of the environment in Kuwait. Environment and health protection is one of the main priorities of EPA by implementing deliberate plans and projects to protect air, soil, aquatic habitats, coastal habitats, biodiversity, and environmental impact evaluation. EPA focuses on community ser- vices and public awareness directed to different groups of the community especially the younger generations as they are the leaders of the future (https://epa.org.kw). About IUCN IUCN, International Union for Conservation of Nature, with its Head- quarters in Gland, Switzerland, was created in 1948 as a membership organisation. IUCN is the world\u2019s first and largest global environmental network. It is a democratic membership union with more than 1,500 gov- ernment and nongovernment member organisations, and almost 18,000 volunteer scientists and experts in over 160 countries. IUCN\u2019s work is supported by approximately 900 professional staff in more than 160 countries and hundreds of partners in public, NGO and private sectors around the world. IUCN seeks to help the world find pragmatic solutions to the most pressing environmental and sustainable development chal- lenges. IUCN supports scientific research, manages field projects all over the world and brings governments, nongovernment organisations, United Nations agencies, companies and local communities together to develop and implement policy, laws and best practices (www.iucn.org).

Both groups are considered as one of the ancient vertebrates, with a wide range of distribution worldwide except the arctic regions. Reptiles are mysterious animals having several adaptations which allow them to survive in arid habitats. Reptiles play an integral role in ecosystems where they live. They are part of the food webs especially in arid areas. Lizards and agamids feed on a wide range of arthropods including a wide range of adult and larvae of insects, and some are herbivores such as the Egyptian spiny-tailed lizard, Uromastyx aegyptius. Adult snakes, in particular, feed on small mammals and birds, am- phibians as well as on other reptiles, while young and juvenile snakes feed on arthropods and small lizards. On the other hand, reptiles are a valuable food source for many raptors and birds of prey. Diversity of reptiles reflects the health of the environment and is a good in- dicator for viable ecosystems. In arid regions, reptiles flourish and shows high diversity in terms of species composition and niche selection, that all pour into a diversified ecosystem. In addition, reptiles, and particularly venomous snakes, are of health hazard to humans. Care should be taken when handling snakes. Typically, snakes do not attack humans, and snakebite accidents occur due to neglect or by mis- handling snakes. In general, people dislike and fear reptiles. Consequently, many superstitions have stigmatised certain reptiles like geckos, which have been blamed as the cause of leprosy, or snakes that are believed to have the ability to cut a human in half, as well as others. Misunderstanding of these creatures is one reason that these animals have been persecuted by humans in the Middle East. In some cultures, reptiles are considered as a source of food. In this region, the Egyptian spiny-tailed lizard is consumed in Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Additionally, some reptiles are hunted for their skin to make belts, shoes and handbags. Recently, many hobbyists have been keeping reptiles, such as tortoises and different species of pythons as pets . The reptiles of the Middle East have been receiving much attention during the past two decades. Regional field guides were published covering Jordan (Disi et al., 2001), Iran (Anderson, 1999), Qatar (Castilla et al., 2016), Oman the United Arab Emirates (Gardner, 2013) and Oman (Carranza et al., 2021). The previously published book on the Reptiles of Iraq by Khalaf (1959) is outdated and requires updates to meet the massive nomenclatural revisions. 1 Introduction Reptiles and amphibians of Kuwait 6 The first study on reptiles of Kuwait was published by Eissa and El Assy (1975), which included 29 species.

A recent account on sea snakes of the Arabian Gulf with an illustrated key was published by Rezaie-Atagholipour et al. (2016). Recently, Amr et al. (2021) identified the diversity of the freshwater, marine and terrestrial herpetofauna of the State of Kuwait. It consists of a total of 45 extant species; 44 species of reptiles and a single species of amphibian ac- cording to recent updated taxonomic studies. All specimens of reptiles collect- ed and held in American and European natural history museums were doc- umented. Four species were added to the herpetofauna of Kuwait including Chalcides ocellatus, Hydrophis lapemoides, Hydrophis viperina, and Trapelus agnetae. 2 Historical background on reptiles of Kuwait Reptiles and amphibians of Kuwait 10 The total area of the State Kuwait is 17,818 km2 of land and about 1,000 km2 of offshore islands. It is situated in the most northwestern corner of the Ara- bian Gulf (Figure 1). Kuwait is an arid country and consists mainly of desert land. It is bordered by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to the south and south- west and Iraq to the north and northwest. Figure 1: General map of Kuwait (Source: IUCN ROWA). The landscape is relatively flat, broken only by occasional low sand dunes and shallow depressions. The surface elevates gently from east to west reach- ing about 300 m above sea level at Al-Shigaya and Al-Salmi. The eastern part of the State, including all the inhabited area, overlook the Arabian Gulf with the coastline that extends approximately 195 km. The surface consists of flat sandy plains interspersed with some low-rise hills, some of which reach a height of nearly 145 m. Moreover, in northern Kuwait, there are a series of hills Reptiles and amphibians of Kuwait 3 Geographical setting 11 such as the Jal Al-Zour ridge, the hills of Al-Marw and Al-Liiah. In the south, hills in the form of domes are common in the regions of Warah and Burgan. Sand dune areas are mostly located in northwestern Kuwait along the Al-Hu- wamiliyah-Al-Nimritayn zone reaching the Al Atraf area. Several dry desert wadi systems, such as Wadi Al-Batin, crisscross Kuwait extending along the Kuwaiti-Iraqi borders about 150 km, and runs along the western borders of Kuwait, with a width in some parts reaching about 10 km and a maximum depth of about 57 m. To the north lies the Rawdatain Plain, consisting of flat land that slopes towards the east and the northeast (Figure 2). Figure 2: Habitats in Kuwait A. Water frontier on the Arabian Gulf B.

Kuwait contains nine islands in the Arabian Gulf, the largest is being Bubi- yan Island (683 km2). The coastal strip extends for about 500 km, with numer- ous small bays and lagoons. The two largest bays are Kuwait and Kadhma and Sulaibikhat. Several lagoons; such as Abdullah, Boubyan, and Al Subiya Khawrs are located in the north, and Al Maftah and Al Amma Khawrs in the south. A C E B D F 14 In arid regions, several methods are employed to study the diversity of rep- tiles. To have a reliable taxonomic identity for a certain species, specimens should be collected in order to verify their specific identity. This is true for many species of lizards (i.e. species of the genus Acanthodactylus and Steno- dactylus) and geckos, whereas visual observation is not sufficient to deter- mine exact identification. Detailed methods on collecting reptiles and amphibians are summarised by Bennett (1999).

Torches, both hand and head were used to locate the species in the study area. Each of the four persons in the team spent at least 3 hours each, totalling 12 hours of the team\u2019s survey work. Car route: This method involved simply driving slowly (10-20km/hr) along a road while looking carefully for reptiles. If any reptile species is were spot- ted, light was shown on them for further identification. Other standard methods such as pitfall traps are not suitable for arid re- gions like Kuwait, where temperatures may reach up to 50oC during daytime. During such extreme temperatures, animals in pitfall traps will become dehy- drated and die. High resolution images of observed or collected species, either in their natural habitat or in a terrarium after being caught, should be documented. Specimens representing all species in the country should be collected and preserved as a reference in 75% ethyl alcohol. This collection should be housed in a natural history museum or within the collection of the EPA, with all relevant data on collection date, species identification, locality and collector. With advances in molecular biology as a tool for identification, tissue samples should also be preserved in 95% ethyl alcohol for future studies. 4.3 Equipment needed for reptiles collecting: \u2022 Insect nets with long handle. \u2022 Snake sticks. \u2022 Torches (hand and head). \u2022 Plastic containers of different sizes. \u2022 Cloth bags. \u2022 Digital camera. \u2022 GPS. \u2022 Safety boots. \u2022 Cloth gloves for handling collected animals. 18 5.1 Handling of roaming and nesting sea turtles Roaming sea turtles are sited either by the naked eye and/or with binocu- lars. Once a roaming sea turtle is sited surfacing in coastal waters (Figure 4), it is slowly pursued by the watercraft. As it begins to tire, the watercraft slowly maneuvers slowly closer to the sea turtle and the boat engine is put in neutral. The turtle is carefully lifted from the gunwale of the watercraft. Sea turtles are never to be handled or lifted from their flippers. Small turtles are lifted on board using both hands (hand capture) to grasp the anterior edge of nuchal scute notch (front) and posterior (back) margins of the carapace. For large sea turtles, a net or a sling is used to hoist it on board with assistance of a winch/ pulley if necessary. Once on board, sea turtles are to be kept in a safe shaded place. A wet towel is placed over the turtle\u2019s carapace, making sure not to cov- er the head, and periodically spraying the turtle with water to keep it hydrated. When all data is recorded (qualitative and quantitative data and photography), the turtle is ready to be returned to the sea. It is released gently into the water headfirst while still holding onto its carapace before being entirely released. The watercraft is only restarted when the turtle is at a safe distance from it. On nesting beaches, female turtles are approached as they are crawling towards the sea after nesting has occurred. Female turtles lay more than one clutch of eggs per season and might return to the same beach to lay another clutch within 2-3 weeks. Hence, it is vital to approach her slowly and calmly so as not to cause disorientation and abandonment of the entire nesting process. When on the beach, the use of torch/flashlights is to be limited.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1cb20b0b-2343-4b1f-afb9-751d1057a5f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "1cb20b0b-2343-4b1f-afb9-751d1057a5f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reptiles-and-amphibians-state-kuwait", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Reptiles and amphibians of the State of Kuwait", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reptiles-and-amphibians-state-kuwait", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b59edc02abab716544adaac369fd835e1cbb2610da3dcb9887152486de8aa470"}, "2": {"node_id": "8345d61f-4bbc-43b6-9094-804bf6ff2fb6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reptiles-and-amphibians-state-kuwait", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "785965cb0f6699a1eddf72d532a99b80042d32d0792704a270577a18924ec6ef"}}, "hash": "609e27c4a297725488d5e14255a04749c9da12734b80ad0ee836dc150bd9bf6d", "text": "When on the beach, the use of torch/flashlights is to be limited.

Size frequency of roaming sea turtles acts as an important parameter to determine the population\u2019s demographic structure, while that linked to nest- ing sea turtles allows for understanding female reproductive biology (sexual maturity, reproductive output, female size, etc.). Two standard measurements are commonly used: minimum curved carapace length (CCLMIN) and curved carapace width (CCW); where CCLMIN is measured from the anterior-most edge of the carapace (nuchal scute) to the rearmost edge of the carapace (supracaudal scute). Measurements are obtained using a flexible fibreglass tape read to the nearest 0.1 cm. Additional morphometric measurements can be recorded based on the objective of the study and are described in IUCN/ SSC Marine Turtle Specialist manual (Eckert et al., 1999) (Figure 5). On nesting beaches, once the female sea turtle has successfully deposited and incubated the eggs and morphometric data is recorded, the nest is then safely secured with caution tape and a warning notice to prevent trampling. Nests are numbered and their location is determined using a GPS. The nest\u2019s distance from high tide mark is measured using a distance-measuring wheel read to the nearest 5 cm. Images are a valuable source of data and an essen- tial part of the documentation process, hence it is advised to capture several scaled photographical shots of the encountered females, their morphological traits, tracks and nests. 5.3 Tagging, satellite and bio samples (roaming and nesting) During documenting and monitoring of roaming and nesting sea turtles, it Figure 5: Measuring the sea turtles\u2019 carapaces. A. Green sea turtle, Chelonia mydas, curved carapace length, CCL. B. Curved carapace width, CCW, of the loggerhead sea turtle, Caretta caretta (Photos by S. Al-Mohanna). A B 20 is advised to seize the opportunity to collect bio-samples (i.e. blood) and to administer tracking devices (flipper and satellite tagging) both of which are im- portant techniques contributing towards the conservation of sea turtles. Both are conducted directly following oviposition as the female sea turtle is crawling away from the nest. Blood samples can be used to identify species using a standardised gene region (DNA barcoding) and to understand the interactions of the genes with each other, and with the individual\u2019s environment through mapping of the or- ganism\u2019s entire DNA (genome). Integrating both DNA barcoding and genomics with evolutionary biology and population genetics enables the understanding of turtle biology and the assessment of the species\u2019 genetic diversity geo- graphically (Phylogeography) (Bowen & Karl, 2007; Komoroske et al., 2017). Small blood samples can also be used to verify the sex of neonate sea turtles using sex-specific markers (Tezak et al., 2020) thus eliminating the challeng- es associated with sex identification due to the lack of sexual dimorphism in hatchlings and juveniles. For blood collection in sea turtles, the vein located in the neck (dorsal cervical sinus) is a commonly used site.

Varia- tion among hatchlings of various sea turtle species is detailed in Eckert et al. (1999). This identification method requires monitoring the nest during the incubation period on a regular basis, especially if the actual nesting date is unknown, to encounter hatchlings as they emerge. Incubation period for most sea turtle species in the Gulf region is approximately 60 days (50-61 days) from initial nesting; regular beach patrols are scheduled accordingly, from dusk until dawn, 45 days from nesting date to guarantee witnessing hatchling emergence. During this period, all artificial lights should be switched off as not to disorient the emerging hatchling since hatchling orientation is also affected by illumination of a new moon. The average maximum summer temperature during sea turtle nesting period in Kuwait ranges between 40\u00b0C and 46\u00b0C (MET KW, 2021); hence, it is critical to assist the emerging hatchlings if they fail to reach the water by dawn as to avoid death by exposure to scorching heat, consequently contributing to increasing hatchling survival rate. Other threats to hatchling survival on the island includes predatory birds and ghost crabs. Post-hatching, preferably a week after the emergence of the first hatchlings, the nest is carefully excavated. Empty shells and unhatched eggs, which are either undeveloped or contain premature embryos, are retrieved and counted to determine clutch size and successful hatching rate. The nest dimensions (mouth width, bottom width, nest depth) can also be recorded and read to the nearest cm (Figures 7A-7B). Figure 7: A. Emerging hatchlings. B. Content of excavated nest of a Green turtle, Chelonia mydas (Photos by S. Al-Mohanna). A B 24 6.1 Family Bufonidae This family of toads is represented by a single species, Bufotes sitibundus. Kuwait lacks natural freshwater bodies. Species of this family are dependent on rainfall, and are found around agricultural areas and sewage treatment plants. 6.1.1 Genus Bufotes Species of the genus Bufotes are usually small to medium-large toads, reach- ing 3.5-12 cm as adults. Females are usually larger than males, whereas males only have a vocal sack to produce calls. Skin is covered by granular glands and warts. Parotoid glands and the tympanum are very prominent. Colouration is usually brown, brown olive to greyish. 6.1.1.1 Bufotes sitibundus (Pallas, 1771) Variable green toad 6 Class Amphibia Figure 8: Variable green toad, Bufotes sitibundus (Photo by A.

Marine turtles Reptiles and amphibians of Kuwait 31 The family Cheloniidae includes seven species of marine turtles within five dif- ferent genera (Caretta, Chelonia, Eretmochelys, Lepidochelys and Natator). Species of this family have a worldwide distribution in all tropical oceans, in the Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific Oceans. The size of carapace ranges from 70-220 cm. The fore and hind limbs of these marine turtles have evolved into flippers to help in swimming. Four species of this family have been reported in Kuwait. 7.1.1 Caretta caretta (Linnaeus, 1758) The loggerhead turtle 7.1 Family Cheloniidae Distribution range: All semi and tropical oceans. Diagnosis: The carapace is heart-shaped when viewed dorsally, head large, wide and subtriangular with two pairs of prefrontal scales; and one inter-pre- frontal scale. Beak horny and thick. Scutes of the carapace thin and hard. They consist of five pairs of lateral, five central and usually 12 or 13 pairs of marginal scutes, including the postcentral scute. Three pairs of inframarginal scutes are located under the plastron\u2019s bridge. Front flippers are relatively short and thick; with two claws while back flippers have two or three claws. Figure 11: Loggerhead turtle, Caretta caretta (Photo by Ehab Eid). 32 Carapace length ranges from 75-110 cm for adults, with a maximum weight up to 150 kg. Biology: Females lay 40 to 190 eggs per nest in two to five clutches per season. The loggerhead turtle feeds mainly on fishes, and other crustaceans, mollusks and marine invertebrates. Remarks: The loggerhead turtle is a rare species in the Kuwaiti waters. It was seen and reported once by Al-Mohanna and Meakins (2000) in the water near Shuaiba Industrial Area. Masirah Island, Oman, hosts the largest nesting aggregations worldwide, with thousands of individual turtles frequenting the island for nesting on a yearly basis (Ross & Barwani, 1995).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1ee2cf43-e99b-476d-81b7-9aacdbd4eff9": {"__data__": {"id_": "1ee2cf43-e99b-476d-81b7-9aacdbd4eff9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reptiles-and-amphibians-state-kuwait", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Reptiles and amphibians of the State of Kuwait", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reptiles-and-amphibians-state-kuwait", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e4d6695893fd396c4171ca79e612f37d1c609ac8e9a80a3d1050fd61777b9601"}, "2": {"node_id": "69bbf141-7204-4f4d-b7a8-c128c0153918", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reptiles-and-amphibians-state-kuwait", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "275eccc3b864b47526e3cd86af6b6be95026ab5f170591b8be160254d62a6d7f"}}, "hash": "37f188a31f4f8742ad1f206b95122a0b3b69452ef0c8d25d9e8ded7d5dd2b9a1", "text": "7.1.2 Chelonia mydas (Linnaeus, 1758) The green turtle Distribution range: All semi and tropical oceans.

Head is narrow and medium-sized with a prominent pointed beak. Head scales with two pairs of prefrontals, and 3 or 4 postorbital scales. Carapace scutes are as follows: five centrals, four pairs of laterals and 11 pairs of marginals in addition to one pair of postcentral. Plastron with five pairs of scutes. At the bridge, four poreless inframarginal scutes are present on each side. Front and back flippers have two claws. Carapace length ranges from 53-100 cm for adults, with a maxi- mum weight up to 120 kg. Biology: Females lay 120-200 eggs in 2-5 clutches per season. The hawksbill sea turtle feeds mainly on sponges, soft corals and other invertebrates asso- ciated with coral reefs communities. Remarks: This is an uncommon species in the Kuwaiti waters. Few individu- als were found to nest in Kuwait (Rees et al., 2018). Gasperetti et al. (1993) stated that this a rare species in the Arabian Gulf with nesting populations around the coasts of Saudi Arabia. 7.1.4 Lepidochelys olivacea (Eschscholtz, 1829) The olive ridley turtle Figure 14: Olive ridley turtle, Lepidochelys olivacea (Photo by Ehab Eid). Reptiles and amphibians of Kuwait 35 Distribution range: Tropical waters of the Pacific, Indian and south Atlantic Oceans. Diagnosis: The carapace is almost round in shape. Head is medium-sized, and subtriangular in shape. Carapace scutes are as follows: more than five pairs of laterals, five centrals and nine marginals. Two pairs of prefrontal scales are present. Fore flippers have 1 or 2 claws. Colour of adult specimens is usually plain olive-grey dorsally, and creamy or whitish ventrally. Length may reach up to 75 cm, with a maximum weight up to 80 kg. Biology: The olive ridley turtle feeds mainly on crustaceans, mollusks, jelly- fish, and less frequently on seaweed and plants. Remarks To date, this is the only record regarding Kuwait (Bishop et al., 2007). The olive ridley turtle is considered as a pan-tropical turtle of the Atlan- tic and the Indo-Pacific Oceans (Gasperetti et al., 1993). Tollab et al. (2015) gave recent observations about this species in the Arabian Gulf including the records from Kuwait and Bahrain. 7.2 Family Dermochelyidae This family includes a single species, Dermochelys coriacea, one of the larg- est living reptiles. It is characterised by its spindle-shaped and leathery cara- pace, which is void of scutes as are present in other marine turtles. 7.2.1 Dermochelys coriacea (Vandelli, 1761) The leatherback turtle Figure 15: Leatherback turtle, Dermochelys coriacea (Photo by Ehab Eid). 36 Distribution range: All oceans except extreme cold waters. Diagnosis: The carapace is spindle-shaped, leathery and without scutes. The carapace has seven dorsal longitudinal keels or dorsal ridges. Head is small and round with no scales.

Pupil is vertical. Males with preanal pores. Caudal tubercles in each semicircle of one segment are in contact with each other along the entire lateral edge; subdigital lamellae with a single transverse series of tubercles, particularly on the free margin under magnification (sometimes worn down in latter part of epidermal cycle); distal phalanges not compressed. This genus includes several species distributed from Palestine to Pakistan, and across the Arabian Peninsula. 7.3.1.1 Bunopus tuberculatus Blanford, 1874 Baluch rock gecko Figure 18: Baluch rock gecko, Bunopus tuberculatus (Photo by A. Alenezi). Reptiles and amphibians of Kuwait 39 Distribution range: The Arabian Peninsula, Jordan, Palestine, Iraq and east- wards to Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan (Arnold, 1986). Records from Kuwait: Al Jahrah, Al Jahrah East Outfall, Ali Al Salem, Air Base, Auhha Island, Al Wafrah, Kabed Reserve, Kubbar Island, Mahboula, Khwaisat, Kuwait, Mina Al Zour, Sabah Al-Ahmad Natural Reserve. Diagnosis: Head is elongated oval in shape, eyes are large with elliptical pupil. Ear opening is vertically oval in shape. Limbs are relatively short with moderately long figures lacking adhesive pads. Body is covered with small unequal granular scales, mostly trihedral tubercles of unequal size. Tail is moderately thick, slightly depressed at the base and longer than SV length. Postmental shields are absent; ventral scales small and smooth, subcircular and subimbricate in shape. Habitat: It has been collected in several localities in Kuwait. It was observed Figure 19: Distribution of Bunopus tuberculatus in Kuwait (Source: IUCN ROWA). 40 Figure 20: Rough bent-toed gecko, Cyrtodactylus scabrum (Photo by S. Bogaerts). close to or hidden in vegetation and under small rocks as well as around entrances of rodent burrows. This species hides under vegetation for hunting and foraging. In islands of the UAE, Soorae (2004) found the Baluch Stone Gecko mostly under debris along shoreline. Menton (1966) encountered this species along a stream in Pakistan. Arnold (1980, 1984) stated that B. tuber- culatus has a wide distribution in the deserts of Arabia and occupies a variety of habitats of soft and hard sandy areas but dominates on harder substrates. Biology: Bunopus tuberculatus is a nocturnal species that is usually seen after sunset. It feeds on beetles (Andeson, 1999). Females lay two eggs (Wer- ner, 1995). In the United Arab Emirates, remains of this species were recov- ered from the Little Owl pellets (Cunningham & Aspinall, 2001). 7.3.2 Genus Cyrtodactylus Species of the genus Cyrtodactylus possess slender, curved toes.

Ibrahim (2013) gave an account on the ecology of this species in the Suez Canal area, Egypt. He stated that C. scabrum is a solitary species with a small home range. Peaks of daily activity were observed during the first three hours after sunset. Air temperature was the main factor affecting its daily and seasonal activity. Fourteen orders of arthropod were found to be consumed by C. scabrum, whereas dipterans and hymenopterans were the most abundant in its diet. Reproduction commences in March and extends to September, with peak ac- tivity for both sexes in June and July. Female deposit single-egg clutches. Khan (2008) provided a detailed description for the mating behavior of this gecko in Punjab, Pakistan. 7.3.3 Genus Hemidactylus Dorsal scales are either uniform or heterogeneous. Eye pupil vertical.

Records from Kuwait: Al Dubaiya, Al Jahrah East Outfall, Al-Nuwaiseeb, Kuwait, Mina Said, W Sulaibikhat Reserve. Diagnosis: This is a medium-sized gecko up to at least 60 mm from snout to vent; toes not depressed, at most slightly fringed, three rows of scales be- neath; rostral and sometimes upper labial scales reach nostril which is direct- ed forwards and sometimes upwards and somewhat outwards; 10-11 upper labials, preanal pores often present, cloacal tubercles in a single row. Tail with 6 to 8 dark bands (Arnold, 1980). Habitat: Al-Sirhan (2009) found that this species is the dominant gecko spe- cies in Al Jahrah East Outfall, inhabiting areas with bushes of Nitraria retusa. Figure 27: Distribution of Stenodactylus affinis in Kuwait (Source: IUCN ROWA). 48 Biology: Females have larger body features than males, perhaps as a repro- ductive advantage for females for developing two large eggs (Torki, 2010). Remarks: Metallinou et al. (2012) gave a comprehensive account on species of the genus Stenodactylus across its distribution range. They showed the existence of three major clades with high divergences. 7.3.4.2 Stenodactylus doriae Blanford, 1874 Middle Eastern short-fingered gecko Distribution range: Widespread in the Arabian Peninsula.

This species is easily collected since it leaves a funnel-like depression at the site where it is hidden in the early morning. It is entirely nocturnal and peak activity is just after sunset. Sand-dunes are the perfect habitat for this species. Individuals are usually observed in open areas away from vegetation. When alarmed, the animal inflates its body with the forearms Figure 28: Middle Eastern short-fingered gecko, Stenodactylus doriae (Photo by S. Bogaerts). Reptiles and amphibians of Kuwait 49 extended to their full length. Biology: In the United Arab Emirates, remains of this species were recovered from the Little Owl pellets (Cunningham & Aspinall, 2001). Remarks: Metallinou et al. (2012) gave a comprehensive account on species of the genus Stenodactylus across its distribution range. They showed the existence of three major clades with high divergences.

Tail is rounded, depressed at base. Habitats: This is a diurnal species, typically found in soft, wind-blown sand habitats but can occupy harder and drier substrates with sparse vegetation. Biology: Ross (1995) recognised three types of tail signals; territorial, aggres- sion and submission/appeasement. The typical display behaviour of dominant males is curling the tail tightly up over its back and then uncurling it after that. It repeats this ritualised signal several times, even if it changes its place. Fe- males use different tail signals (Ross, 1995). If it is pursued, it runs away and hides in small holes at the base of desert shrubs When threatened, it stands on fully erected limbs with opened mouth and the tail is rolled up or it quickly buries itself into the loose sand by rapidly shaking its whole body.

Phrynocephalus maculatus uses their tails for intraspecific sig- naling by curling the tail upwards. It is a \u201csit and wait\u201d hunter, utilizing its very good eyesight. In addition, sitting on a high area overlooking the surrounding habitat also helps it detect its prey. (Ross, 1989). Phrynocephalus maculatus avoids predation by having cryptic colouration of the dorsum with the sub- strate. Moreover, lying in a small depression or flat on the ground reducing its shadow is possibly the animal\u2019s first line of defense when threatened. It occupies open areas and thermoregulation by posture and possibly by adopt- ing pale colouration as it becomes hotter. If approached by predators, it will sometimes face them stand high on its legs with its tail curbed upwards (Ross, 1989). Remarks: This is a common species associated with mixed sand and gravel vegetated areas. Al-Sirhan and Brown (2010) gave an account of its presence in Kuwait. 62 7.4.2.1 Trapelus agnetae (Werner, 1929) Figure 40: Trapelus agnetae. A. Male. B. Female (Photos by A. Al-Yousef).

Males bask at the top of the shrub and remain motionless for several hours at mid-noon when the ambi- ent temperature exceeds 40\u00b0C. Females bask on lower parts of bushes. This species is ground dwelling, but often climbs small shrubs and twigs during hot summer days. Perched on bushes up to one metre height above the ground Figure 42: Trapelus persicus (Photos by A. Al-Yousef). Reptiles and amphibians of Kuwait 65 for extended periods of time may provide convective cooling for these animals (Disi, 2002). Biology: They are \u201csit and wait\u201d foragers, feeding on different types of inverte- brates. The proclaiming male stays on the highest twigs, as an observational point, for several hours and adjusts its body according to the orientation of the sun. Moreover, males can control their body temperature through different processes: by attaining light colouration at midday; different postures at differ- ent times of the day, and changing the distance between themselves and the plants which allow for an increase or decrease of the movement of air currents around their bodies. Females lay seven eggs. Remarks: Leviton et al. (1992) noted the presence of nominotypic subspecies in Jordan which has not yet been confirmed. Anderson (1966) suggested the name Agama blanfordi instead of Agama persica citing priority of this name Figure 43: Distribution of Trapelus persicus in Kuwait (Source: IUCN ROWA). 66 as the reason. After splitting the genus Agama and reintroducing the genus Trapelus, the first specific name persica should be used.

Reptiles and amphibians of Kuwait 67 Habitat: The Egyptian dabb lizard inhabits flat gravelly hard substrate and is never seen on sandy habitats. The dabb prefers plains and avoids moderate slopes. Biology: The Egyptian spiny-tailed lizard is a generalist herbivore, usually feeds on a large variety of non-halophyte desert plants near its burrow in early spring. In summer, it switches to feeding on only one species, and prefers to feed close to its burrow, and that may reduce predation (Bouskila, 1985). Stomach content analysis showed that the adults feed on Anabasis sp. and H. persicum. It is heliothermic. The lowest level of activity was recorded from December to mid-February, with the exception of the young. It has two major activity peri- ods, a pre-noon and a pre-dusk during summer months. Wilms et al. (2009) gave a comprehensive account of the seasonal activity of U. a. microlepis in Saudi Arabia. A bimodal activity in spring and summer, with 73% total ob- served animals, occurred during these two seasons, while a unimodal activity was observed during autumn. Peak activity was recorded in early afternoon. The Egyptian spiny-tailed lizard is mostly solitary, or lives in groups of different composition, but only with a dominant male. It spends most of its time sitting in a lookout posture close to the den. The dabb can regulate its body tempera- ture by changing colouration as temperatures reache 39-40\u00b0C, or by changing its posture according to the orientation of the sun, or by panting and gular flut- tering when the temperature reaches 42\u00b0C (Mendelssohn & Bouskila, 1989). Figure 44: Egyptian spiny-tailed lizard, Uromastyx aegyptius (Photo by A. Alenezi). 68 Moreover, U. a. microlepis controls its temperature by behavioural postures, climbing on stones, and colour changes in relation to the time of the day. An- nually, in May females lay one clutch which consists of 17-41 eggs. It takes about nine weeks for eggs to hatch. Females usually lay eggs in separate nesting burrows, which are close to the main dwelling burrows of the female. Remarks: This is a common species in the arid habitats of Kuwait with many records as mentioned above. The spiny-tailed lizard, Uromastyx aegyptius, was the focus of several studies.

Eyes are covered by translucent skin. Body colouration is usually pink to pur- ple, speckled with dark brown spots or flecks. Habitat: This is a fossorial species associated with sand deserts across its known range, it was found to inhabit sand dunes and sand sheets, as well as sandy beaches (Gardner, 2013). In Kuwait, it was collected and observed in sand areas across the whole country (Amr et al., 2021). It lives in deep sandy soil. Biology: Zarudnyi\u2019s worm lizard is a nocturnal species. It feeds mainly on beetles and their larvae (Al-Sadoon et al., 2016). In Saudi Arabia, this species commences its activities at 20.00 hrs, where the ground temperature ranges between 30-32\u00b0C, and retreats between 03:00-04:00 hrs. It is evident that D. zarudnyi can tolerate a wide range of temperatures, keeping its mean body temperature within a narrow range (Al-Johany, 1999).

Records from Kuwait: Al Abraq, Al Ahmadi, Al Jalia, Al Mutla, Al Wafrah, Kadma, Rhawdatain. Diagnosis: Medium to large size species. Usually four entire supraocu- lars, sometimes, the first is divided. Pectinate anterior border of ear open- ing. Keeled temporals. Slightly denticulated eyelids. Conspicuous gular fold. Three series of scales on fingers. Ventrals arranged in 10 straight longitudinal rows. Very large, keeled, imbricate dorsals. Granular scalation on sides of the body. Moderate to intense pectination of fourth toe. Large, imbricate, and sharply keeled scales on the upper surface of the tail (Salvador, 1982). Habitats: Acanthodactylus boskianus inhabits fairly hard substrates. In Egypt, it was exclusively recorded from coastal and urban habitats, and seemed to be highly abundant in sand dunes between sparse vegetation (Amer et al., 2008; Milto, 2017). It is one of the most abundant species in the arid regions of Jordan (Disi & Amr, 1998). Figure 59: Bosk\u2019s fringe-fingered lizard, Acanthodactylus boskianus (Photo by A. Alenezi). 82 Figure 60: Distribution of Acanthodactylus boskianus in Kuwait (Source: IUCN ROWA). Biology: This is a diurnal species. In Syria, A. boskianus was found to feed on the scorpion, Buthacus tadmorensis (Shehab et al., 2011). This lizard is reproductively active from March to June, with clutch size ranging from 3-4, with no evidence of multiple clutches among females (Goldberg, 2013). Fem- oral gland secretions are involved in intraspecific chemical communication, male territorial behaviour and sex recognition (Khannoon et al., 2010). Males of A. boskianus had a wider home range than females, whereas spring home ranges were larger than those during winter (Al-Johany & Spellerberg, 1989). Remarks: This a common species in Kuwait and was recorded from several localities (Eissa & El Assy, 1975). Molecular and morphological results have indicated that Acanthodactylus descend from south-west Asia, and later in- vaded North Africa (Harris & Arnold, 2000).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e1c4d80-3c23-43a2-8d70-d948d7e8d156": {"__data__": {"id_": "2e1c4d80-3c23-43a2-8d70-d948d7e8d156", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reptiles-and-amphibians-state-kuwait", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Reptiles and amphibians of the State of Kuwait", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reptiles-and-amphibians-state-kuwait", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7b88407a6e13e3620df8215bf160ed035ad6213465bbd1b16f3c7b015351e607"}, "2": {"node_id": "b508860a-07dc-4e5c-bb9c-1a3d392e9e7f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reptiles-and-amphibians-state-kuwait", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "de7e72bead8015370618e4fab6bc9d31f7e9f1cd0084c5cd1b2b423931048126"}}, "hash": "b200f45f226d5aa3ec02a6cc5896a18f70c2a06f16c7c86fb38d26dd854d7d92", "text": "Further molecular findings show that both Acanthodactylus schreiberi and Acanthodactylus boskianus asper are paraphyletic (Tamar et al., 2014).

Activity pattern during hot summer was recorded during the morning hours with ambient temperatures ranging from 35\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C, where most of the foraging time was spent under shade vegetation in the United Arab Emirates (Cunningham, 2001). The hunting strategy is a sit-and-wait approach. It chas- es its prey even when spotted at a distance and uses shadows of vegetation for cover (Cunningham, 2001).

Records from Kuwait: Al Ahmadi, Al Jalia, Al Mutla, Al Subiya, Al Wafrah, N Bubiyan Bridge, Kadma, Rhawdatain, Sabah Al-Ahmad Natural Reserve. Diagnosis: Species of variable size. Pointed snout. First, second, and third supraoculars large; fourth usually divided into two. Five supralabials anteri- or to the subocular. Subocular not in contact with the upper lip and wedged among fourth, fifth and sixth supralabial. Two keeled supratemporals. Tem- porals sharply keeled. Ear opening with distinct anterior pectination. Scales on the sides of the posterior dorsum double the size of those in the center of the dorsum and those on the sides of the body. Thirty-two to fifty-four dorsals across the midbody. Ventrals arranged in 14 or 16 oblique longitudinal rows with the outer rows consisting of pointed scales. Fingers present. Four series of scales while toes are strongly pectinate. Reticulate colour pattern in both young and adults. Habitat: Acanthodactylus schmidti inhabits areas of soft sand, partly stabi- lised by root systems of spiny bushes and uses places shaded by vegetation. It is considered a sand-dwelling species more than any other Acanthodacty- lus species. Burrows are usually located under bushes of Haloxylon sp.

In the United Arab Emir- ates, this species is usually associated with relatively firm sand and observed close to bushes or low vegetation (Arnold, 1984). Biology: It is active about four and a half hours after sunrise (Arnold, 1984). When hunting, it walks jerkily over the sand, touches regularly the ground by its snout and scents with its tongue. It feeds mostly on ants, isopterans, flies, insect larvae and coleopterans (Arnold, 1984; Ross, 1989). Al-Johany and Spellerberg (1989) reported on male lizards as having had larger home ranges than females reaching a maximum of 1000 m2, and that spring home ranges were larger than winter ones. Ross (1989) gave a comprehensive ac- count on the copulation behavior of this species. Remarks: Collected from several localities in Kuwait (Eissa & El Assy, 1975).

In 1957, it was originally described as a subspecies of Acanthodactylus scutellatus by Haas. From a taxonomic point of view, several authorities considered A. hardyi a member of the scutellatus group (Salvador, 1982; Tamar et al., 2016). All pre- vious records which referred to this species as A. scutellatus should regard it as A. hardyi. Moreover, Arnold (1983) recognised A. hardyi as a member of the A. scutellatus complex group based on morphological features, whereas, Sindaco and Jerem\u010denko (2008) considered this species as a subspecies of A. scutellatus.

Habitat: This is a diurnal species that occupies a fairly large habitat with hard substrates. This is a rather common species in Kuwait inhabiting gravelly des- Reptiles and amphibians of Kuwait 91 erts. This species has no preference for specific plants. If alarmed, it hides among plants or retreats into burrows. It inhabits gravel plains and often stays near the entrance of its burrow. Ross (1988) reports similar observations from Saudi Arabia. He indicated that this species appears to be the best environ- mentally adapted lizard since it occupies different habitats which include sea- shore, inland gravel plains and hill tops. Faraj and Banaja (1980) collected this species under rocks at AI-Wajh in Saudi Arabia. In Kuwait, it was reported in semi -arid regions (Eissa & El-Assy, 1975). However, Arnold (1984) found this species confined to moist areas with succulent halophytic vegetation in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.

Habitats: The Arabian sand boa is a desert dwelling species, inhabiting sand or soft soil. It is rather common around sand dunes in many parts of Kuwait. Biology: Eryx jayakari is a nocturnal forager, feeding mostly on lizards, ro- dents and arthropods. Reptiles and amphibians of Kuwait 101 7.11 Family Colubridae Family Colubridae includes the highest number of species with worldwide distribution. In Kuwait, it is represented by four species in four genera (Dol- ichophis, Lytorhynchus, Platyceps and Spalerosophis). Some colubrids are aglyphous (fangs are not grooved and the venom gland is absent), opistho- glyphous (some maxillary teeth are grooved and usually located under the eye level, and connected to a venom gland). Morphologically, this family exhibits a wide range in type and shape of dorsal and subcaudal scales, as well as in other external features. Key to species of Family Colubridae 1.

In southern Iraq, it was found in Al-Kufa district (Rhadi et al. 2017). Certainly, this snake represents a relict population in Kuwait. 7.11.1.1 Dolichophis jugularis (Linnaeus, 1758) Reptiles and amphibians of Kuwait 103 7.11.2 Genus Lytorhynchus Species of this genus are characterised by their projecting flat snout and large rostrum. Their eyes have elliptical pupils. The nostril forms an oblique slit between two large nasals. Six species belonging to this genus have been described, with a distribution ranging from North Africa to the Sahara in the west, through southern Turkey and the former Soviet Union to Pakistan and Afghanistan to the east (Gasperetti, 1988).

Records from Kuwait: Al Jalia, Al Jahrah, Al Ritqa, Al Wafrah, Kuwait. Diagnosis: Snout moderately long; rostral angularly bent, with straight hori- zontal edge, detached on the sides, the portion visible from above as long as its distance from the frontal; no lateral cleft in the rostral. Suture between the internasals much shorter than that between the prefrontals. Frontal nearly as long as its distance from the end of the snout, slightly shorter than the pari- etals. A small, squarish loreal. One or two preoculars, with or without a sub- ocular below; two postoculars. Temporals 1 + 2 or 2 + 3; seven or eight upper labials, fourth, fifth or fourth and fifth, entering the eye. Three lower labials in contact with the anterior chin-shields; posterior chin-shields as long as or a little longer than the anterior and separated from each other by two series of scales. Scales smooth in 19 rows, ventral scales152-195; caudal scales 30- 49. Anal divided.

Habitats: The diademed sand snake is a nocturnal species. It inhabits sand deserts, gravel plains and sabkhah. The modified rostral scale of this snake is an adaptation for its burrowing behavior in sandy habitats. Biology: It feeds most frequently on animals inhabiting burrows or holes (Baha El Din, 1996). It seems to prefer nocturnal lizards, particularly geckos (Egan, 2007). Remarks: Shafiei et al. (2015) showed that L. d. gaddi occurs to the west of Iran with localities bordering Iraq. This snake is associated with loose soil, preferably sand. 106 7.11.3 Genus Platyceps This genus includes the racers, which are thin-bodied snakes.

Habitats: This is an aggressive snake inhabiting arid regions. Biology: It feeds on rodents such as mice and rats (Amr & Disi, 2011). Fe- males lay up to 13 eggs. It is active during daytime in winter, and at night-time in summer. 110 7.12 Family Psammophiidae This family includes two species in two genera (Malpolon and Psammophis). Both species are desert adapted species. Species of this family were previ- ously listed under Colubridae. Recent molecular studies supported the sepa- ration of this family as Psammophiidae. Species of this family are character- ised by having an extremely reduced, short and thread-like hemipenis, and clearly different dentition in the upper and lower jaws, and loss of the ventral processes (Kelly et al., 2008).

Ventral is usually sprinkled with very small reddish-brown spots. A dark, narrow longitudinal band extends on both sides of head. Habitats: This is a common snake inhabiting arid habitats as well as temper- ate Mediterranean areas. It is usually observed during daytime under bushes or around rock piles. Biology: Psammophis schokari is a diurnal species. It was observed in ar- boreal postures on bushes and shrubs. Females are oviparous, laying two to six eggs. 114 7.13 Family Viperidae This family includes one species of the genus Cerastes. This genus is wide- spread across the deserts of northern North Africa eastward through Arabia and to Iran, with three species: Cerastes gasperettii, Cerastes cerastes and Cerastes vipera (Sindaco et al., 2013). 7.13.1 Genus Cerastes The head is clearly distinct from the neck and covered with small juxtaposed feebly keeled imbricate scales.

Colour varies by region, and can be red- dish, yellowish or grey, depending upon the actual colour of the sand where a population lives. The pattern consists of indistinct brown spots in four to six longitudinal series, a dark streak on the tail and a variable head pattern. The head pattern is accentuated in some populations of C. g. gasperettii, in which case the dark band between the eye and the angle of mouth is accompanied dorsally by a light band. Habitats: The Arabian horned-viper is a true psamophile species. It was seen and collected from sand dunes in various locations in Kuwait. During the day- time it hides in rodent borrows, and specimen has been seen buried in the sand with only its eyes protruding from the ground surface. It starts its activity after sunset and is active at night, moving across the sand searching for food, especially rodents. Side-winding trails are very characteristic of this viper. Biology: It feeds mostly on rodents (Gerbillus nanus, Gerbillus dasyurus, and Meriones crassus) as well as Scincus scincus (Amr & Disi, 1998). C. g. gaspretti is oviparous, laying 8-23 eggs in abandoned rodent burrows. Remakes: An illustrated guide to the horned-viper of Kuwait was published by Al-Fares and Al-Metairie (2014) with a series of photographs.

Four main categories of threats affect the amphibians and reptiles of Kuwait. Some specific threats are very dangerous for particular species\u2019 survival; while a combination of threats may lead to population decline. 8.1 Terrestrial habitats 8.1.1 Urbanisation Kuwait is a small country with an increasing population that consists of Ku- waiti citizens", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ef724aff-4f60-4ece-ba1a-b8d1e276d275": {"__data__": {"id_": "ef724aff-4f60-4ece-ba1a-b8d1e276d275", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reptiles-and-amphibians-state-kuwait", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Reptiles and amphibians of the State of Kuwait", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reptiles-and-amphibians-state-kuwait", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5ea85682a376475642cc75ed0541df3f962d0d8da7c5613dfa131f01d1fd4e63"}, "3": {"node_id": "df3b20da-2986-48a4-9d37-7fae94e48ac3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reptiles-and-amphibians-state-kuwait", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "28854a783c6e7b4a5cda3c6a3449ffd1a0f28c3647fc6f157d0d162d1a772d5a"}}, "hash": "1167f49b2e41ce52fb1eeee3876729c2b11df52fd0f7285883d41e18884ff2a8", "text": "and expatriates from many different countries. Within the past six decades, Kuwait\u2019s population has increased rapidly, affecting the overall natu- ral habitats. For example, the black-tail toad-head agama, Ph. maculatus, will be driven into extinction, due to extensive development, which has resulted in the destruction of the species\u2019 \u201csabkha\u201d preferred habitats by the construction of artificial lagoons and high-rise buildings. The same is true for the Egyptian spiny-tailed lizard, U. aegyptius. 8.1.2 Grazing Previous studies showed that the number of domestic animals grazing in rangeland has increased by 36% for sheep and 100% for camels over a peri- od of three years. About 45% of these animals come from neighboring coun- tries. Most of the overgrazed areas are close to human settlements. In 2017, a total of 871,811 grazing livestock (sheep, goats, and camels) were observed in 2,473 grazing areas across Kuwait (Al Dousari et al., 2019). 8.1.3 Soil compaction Off-road vehicle use is considered by far as one of the most adverse ef- fects on desert habitats. During the Iraqi invasion, tanks and military vehicles caused extensive soil compaction all over the country. Consequently, natural vegetation was destroyed and soil compaction resulted. This is especially true for sand dwelling species such as A. schmidti, C. gasperetti, D. zarudnyi, E. jaculus, L. diadema, Ph. arabicus, S. mitranus, S. scincus and S. doriae, as well as for other gravel inhalants such as V. griseus and U. aegyptia. In 2017, soil compaction was estimated at totalling 1390 km2 which was caused by off-road vehicle tracks and grazing activities in Ku- wait. This accounts for 7.8% of Kuwait\u2019s total area (Al Dousari et al., 2019). Reptiles and amphibians of Kuwait 125 8.1.4 Recreational activities and tourism Camping and driving in the open desert areas is on the increase in Kuwait. Large vehicles are widely used for racing on sand dunes. This will certainly affect many sand-dwelling lizard and snake species and therefore, cause dis- turbance. In general, in this part of the world, reptiles and particularly snakes are disliked animals. During recreational activities in the desert, burrows of the spiny-tailed lizard, U. aegyptia, have been damaged. 8.2 Marine habitats 8.2.1 Pollution and marine debris Plastic particles and tar pollution are among the most common forms of pol- lution of the marine environment of Kuwait (Shiber, 1989). This perhaps can affect the marine turtles frequenting the Kuwaiti waters. Extensive damage to the marine environment of Kuwait was caused after the Iraqi invasion. Millions of tons of oil from destroyed oil wells spilled into the marine ecosystems, kill- ing many forms of marine life. Almost the entire shoreline surrounding Kuwait was damaged during the war (i.e. land mines, construction of concrete military structures and trenches) (Meakins & Al-Mohanna, 2000). This has led to a total habitat destruction of marine turtles. 8.2.2 Bycatch of marine turtles The number of nesting Green Turtles, C. mydas, has declined over the years, with limited number of nesting individuals around Qaru and Failaka is- lands (Rees et al., 2013). This is mainly due to that the foraging habitat of the Green Turtles overlaps with a coastal trap-fishery. This issue is raising con- cern on the future of these small populations (Rees et al., 2013).

contributed to the emergence of the Blue Economy as a critical arena for making substantive impact, both for the environment and for local prosperity. IUCN continues to engage in the discussion and aims to develop a pilot model to serve the greater WIO (Western Indian Ocean) region. This report is the first step in identifying and targeting priority interventions and solutions that can support local marine-based com- munities, as suggested interventions help spearhead the work of trialing key concepts along Kenya\u2019s coastline. This scoping study utilizes a combination of primary research (stakeholder interviews, focus group dis- cussions, and field research) and secondary research (literature review) to prioritize value chains and recommendations. The study highlights seaweed farming, sea cucumber farming, and finfish farming as", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "98de2cc1-e662-4ebf-a3de-388ccc05fdc3": {"__data__": {"id_": "98de2cc1-e662-4ebf-a3de-388ccc05fdc3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-entrepreneurship-scoping-study-kenya", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blue entrepreneurship scoping study for Kenya", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-entrepreneurship-scoping-study-kenya", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1e62f22873f94978ceb7001144a9d3511150cd575f9eb473d61dd3e120e4f62f"}, "3": {"node_id": "c1761087-6ce4-4218-bd16-b6c424865dfa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-entrepreneurship-scoping-study-kenya", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "df977ee4bbf2d85d65425ee8348ac8db0f7cd07b81809334f10b574c1d87a257"}}, "hash": "3dc2a4941fdc7307cea0dab155bce96220ed7ab7c90b26e50197eca9edb67784", "text": "key oppor- tunities. This executive summary overviews strengths and weaknesses of each value chain along with recommendations to drive sector transformation and reach optimal im- pact. Alongside the strategic levers for each value chain are opportunities for the sector, Kenya\u2019s current competitive position, and the potential for an inclusive market system. Additional detail and specific suggestions are developed in further detail in Chapter 7: Recommendations. Seaweed farming Kenya can maximize potential in the sea- weed industry through a dramatic increase in production and scale, as unlocking the potential for communities to produce at capacity can lead to sector-wide transforma- tion. At present, Kenya is not competitive in the regional seaweed market, and success hinges on both attracting new farmers and utilizing productive space at full capacity. By offering substantive volume, Kenya can draw the attention of additional exporters, devel- oping pricing competition that can benefit smallholders. The research identified three strategic levers to catalyse transformation in the seaweed sector: Executive summary vi Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya Table 1: Seaweed farming strategic levers Opportunity Competitiveness Inclusivity \u2022 Develop business case for seaweed farmers to produce at maximum capacity \u2022 Sensitize communities and expand production base to include additional farming locales \u2022 Improve efficiency with covered drying facility to reduce labour and time required \u2022 Mobilize technical assistance for ongoing farmer support and new farmer upstart \u2022 Tanzania (specifically Zanzibar) is Kenya\u2019s biggest regional competitor, producing over 103,000 tonnes of seaweed in 2019 \u2022 With similar ecosystems and with an extra 100km of available coastline, Kenya has the capacity to develop its seaweed production volumes and be competitive in the WIO region \u2022 As over 90% of current Kenyan seaweed farming is done by women, expansion opportunities stand to include even more female farmers in the sector \u2022 Furthermore, opportunity exists to encourage household participation for value-add tasks (like carrying heavy loads and transportation) \u2022 Develop business case for seaweed exporters to enter the Kenyan market \u2022 Sensitize communities and expand production base to include additional farming locales \u2022 Mobilize technical assistance for new farmer upstart \u2022 An uptick in post- pandemic global price will unlock better margins for exporters coming into Kenya \u2022 As the Kenyan national and coastal governments are prioritizing seaweed as a sector, enabling environments for foreign investment are expected to be favourable \u2022 Expanding competition among seaweed purchasers is expected to elevate farmgate price, enabling more Kenyan farmers to join \u2022 Incorporating additional high-value species stands to earn farmers 3x the current value with the same yields \u2022 Offshore farming is less prone to negative effects of rising ocean temperatures \u2022 Mastering deeper- ocean seaweed cultivation (which has historically been challenging for both Kenya and neighbour Zanzibar), has the potential to unlock access to a much larger seaweed market, as the \u201cEucheuma spp.\u201d (which includes Cottonii) category represents 29% of global production \u2022 Female seaweed farmers are highly motivated to start cultivating this species (despite male dominance), pending investment needed to kickstart the offshore farm \u2022 Female inclusion requires sea-safety training and boat- operator training, or these services could be provided by men in the community Source: TechnoServe The current seaweed industry in Kenya faces many addressable challenges. Limited production, which thereby limits income potential and market diversity, is caused by intensive labour conditions, a falling global price, historical dependence on external (do- nor or private sector) funding, and current perceptions among farmers, as they see an unattractive value proposition. COVID-19 has impacted the global price for seaweed, as an influx of farmers from once-tourism-de- pendent countries have fallen back on farming, increasing current global supply.

Due to decades of overfishing, sea cucumber wild stocks are dwindling, harming the overall biodiversity of coastal ecosystems and forcing fishers into increas- ingly-risky diving practices. With a high price point, growing global demand, and an existing link to the export market, spear- heading inclusive sea cucumber farming models in Kenya will revolutionize the sector. Neighbouring countries in the WIO region have spent years trialing and refining the smallholder-outgrower model, and Kenya\u2019s success in the industry hinges on a three- step intensive investment: 1) establish sus- tainable models for short-term wild-capture of fingerlings, 2) pilot inclusive farming and generate proof-of-concept for both commu- nity-government and farmer engagement, and 3) draw private sector investment for hatchery systems that will enable long-term scale and sustainability.

Hatchery setup has proven challenging in the region, but Kenya can lean on global models and learn from failed attempts. Using the on- going research and investment in a coastal multi-species marine hatchery as a business case, Kenya has the opportunity to develop proof-of-concept for private sector investors, yielding a more sustainable hatchery option for the long-term growth of the industry.

Farming sea cucumber can offer lucrative al- ternatives to overfishing, giving coastal eco- systems an opportunity to regenerate, while increasing the presence of species that sup- port environmental health. Further, current government support for this priority crop creates a favourable enabling environment. Finfish farming Fishing plays a vital role for coastal commu- nities, both in terms of food security and in terms of income generation. Kenya and the rest of the world suffer as global fish stocks disappear through overfishing. Investing in finfish farming using cage structures in marine sites has the potential to disrupt the current Kenyan value chain for local coastal consumption of fish by increasing and controlling production, avoiding restrictive market relationships, and reducing pressure on local environments. Local demand fish re- mains strong, and Kenya has an opportunity to develop sustainable production methods through marine-based finfish cage farming. Investment in fingerling access (through hatcheries) and responsibly-sourced feed are critical to long-term success in the sector, both financially and environmentally.

A lack of technical knowledge and relatively high startup costs, especially without viable financial products to sup- port community-level investment, can bar smallholders from entering the sector. Even more, the high-risk nature of mariculture, in that stocks are vulnerable to theft and escape, make the potential investment even more precarious.

Fortunately, the Kenyan government, through KMFRI (Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute) is proving the business case in active testing, priming the space to pilot a scalable model among the private sector. Once constructed and regulated, the low running costs bring community-level operations within reach of smallholders. The industry benefits from strong local coastal demand for fish con- sumption (through a growing population and increasing dependence on fish imports). Finally, investing in finfish farming has the potential to disrupt the current value chain by increasing and controlling production and harvests, allowing farmers to avoid re- strictive market relationships and drawing more of the value toward the smallholder. Once scaled, sector innovations like cage farming can offer nature-based solutions that combat the impacts of destructive fish- ing practices and reduce pressure on local environments. What follows are detailed assessments and recommendations for each value chain that outline critical steps for success in the sectors, along with overall suggestions for boosting coastal economies and supporting pilots for farmer programs. Important to note is the ever-present threat of climate change, as each of the selected value chains will be affected by rising sea temperatures and more turbulent waters. These efforts are expected to contribute to a holistic approach for ensuring sustainable, meaningful impact, both for Kenyan ecosystems and for local-ar- ea alternative livelihoods.

Background The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), dedicated to actions that \u201cconserve nature and accelerate the transi- tion to sustainable development\u201d1, seeks to further engage in the Blue Entrepreneurship space, build on existing successes across East Africa, and scale creative solutions, using Kenya as the pilot location. By participating in the Kenyan Blue Economy (definition and details further outlined in Chapter 2) with a focus on coastal regions, IUCN hopes to positively impact communities whose livelihoods depend on the ocean and ma- rine-based incomes, while also promoting sustainable, regenerative value propositions that actively protect and enhance the ocean environment.

Furthermore, Kenya sits among the 14 countries on the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy (Ocean Panel),4 an initiative which further highlights Kenya\u2019s enthusiasm for identifying innovative solutions that will protect the ocean and develop ocean-based economic opportunities. Not only does Kenya\u2019s participation in the groundbreaking Ocean Panel reinforce the degree to which the national government is primed to en- gage in this space, but the Ocean Panel itself serves as a resource for cutting-edge technologies and captivating ideas, and it acts as a global support for sustainable Blue Economy ventures. Looking at the potential support for entre- preneurship, Kenya shows immense prom- ise around innovation and new ventures, as evidenced by the World Economic Forum flagging Kenya as an \u201cemerging global start- up hotspot.\u201d5 Kenya is actively prioritizing startup ventures through its Enterprise Kenya program, the government\u2019s \u201cnational accelerator to catalyse innovations and pro- vide entrepreneurs with needed support in Introduction 2 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya their innovation journey.\u201d6 Additionally, the amount of funding toward startups and the number of investments shows a continued increase from previous years, with Kenya benefitting from US$564 million in invest- ment funding in 2019, ranked second across the African continent behind Nigeria only.7 While still battling some of the challenges common to lower middle-income econo- mies, Kenya showcases that its startup envi- ronment is conducive and can be expected to grow ocean ventures. The potential to drive impact among coastal communities grows year-on-year, as a combination of factors highlights Blue Entrepreneurship as a key driver. For example, global demand for ocean-based and ocean-adjacent products and services continues to grow, due to a rising global population8 who need inexpensive protein sources,9,10 an increasing middle-class inter- ested in travel,11 and a growing proportion of world tourism being dedicated to \u201cemerging markets.\u201d12 Kenya benefits from both of these sectors, with 0.8%13 of national gross domes- tic product (GDP) dedicated to fisheries and 6 ICT Authority.

The recommendations will not only identify ways to catalyse investment but also under- score strategies to catalyse inclusive impact in the sectors, particularly in regards to the scaling of initiatives that positively impact the climate and ocean biodiversity. It is also particularly important that the strat- egy builds on existing donor and govern- ment initiatives and harnesses ways to both enhance and scale what is already working as well as recommend improved coordina- tion among market actors where there is an opportunity. The sub-objectives of the research are orien- tated around the following elements: \u2022 Establish market fundamentals: Gain clear understanding of how the sector currently operates, the opportunities and gaps in terms of competitiveness, the opportunities and challenges in regards to inclusive supply chains (particularly how value flows upstream and downstream), and develop a clear map of current donor initiatives and government policies supporting the sector. \u2022 Prioritize opportunities: Develop a long-list of potential interventions to support the sector, assess their potential for additionality in terms of i) climate impact ii) ocean biodiversity impact iii) employment opportunities created, and iv) feasibility, and identify those 2-3 value chains and/or strategies that seem to offer the greatest potential. \u2022 Deliver overall vision and strategies for transformation: Bring the analytical components together into a broader sector vision. Detail the strategies required, how they would work, how they will close the competitiveness gap, how they will deliver climate and conservation impact, how they drive greater inclusivity, how they will leverage existing programs and policies. Quantify the investment and impact benefits. Illuminate strategic pillars to achieve these visions and outline a roadmap over the next four years. 1.3. Research questions and methodology Ultimately, the research aims to answer: \u2022 Which three value chains present the optimal opportunity and most immediate potential for Kenya to positively impact coastal communities in terms of livelihoods and environmental progress (both conservation and regeneration)? By addressing this question using a com- bination of intensive literature review, desk research, and semi-structured interviews, the research will reveal the influential factors enabling or blocking potential for positive impact. Once the broad framework is in place, more specific value-chain-related questions can be explored and expounded. From there, the research hopes to address sub-questions like: \u2022 What are the market constraints and opportunities in the selected value chains? Introduction 4 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya \u2022 Which specific dynamics should be accounted for when planning future interventions? 1.4. Limitations of the research This research intends to utilize available re- sources to understand the current landscape for enterprises in coastal Kenya. We have limited the scoping efforts to ocean- based opportunities or value chains that have a direct connection to the coastline, thereby excluding on-land drivers of ocean health like plastics pollution and waste man- agement. Additionally, we excluded in-depth analyses of enablers, like government policy or large-scale infrastructure. These param- eters help us target impacts around coastal communities, enterprises, and households. While there is a pressing need to find scalable opportunities that can benefit the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) region, the scope of this research is limited to the Kenyan context, with a specific focus on coastal geographies. Due to time constraints, local-area primary research was conducted exclusively in Kwale County locations, but we can reasonably ex- pect some transferability across geograph- ical areas when assessing the enablers and blockers. Secondary research is limited by widely-ac- knowledged over- and under-reporting of global fisheries data, complicating the exercise of pinpointing and reporting exact figures. We recognize the constraints to available data, and we proceed with the 18 TechnoServe. (n.d.).

For example, in line with what the World Bank describes as the \u201csustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, improved livelihoods and jobs, and ocean ecosystem health,\u201d21 the Commonwealth of Nations depicts the Blue Economy as \u201can emerging concept which encourages better stewardship of our ocean or \u2018blue\u2019 resources.\u201d22 This research will not attempt to define the \u201cBlue Economy,\u201d per se.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "677dca57-41a0-4f56-b755-23423ee19e2f": {"__data__": {"id_": "677dca57-41a0-4f56-b755-23423ee19e2f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-entrepreneurship-scoping-study-kenya", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blue entrepreneurship scoping study for Kenya", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-entrepreneurship-scoping-study-kenya", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a2ac4772370731812f732eb51085b2489dcbe99d958aaf5c3cc2b9938841be9a"}, "2": {"node_id": "3c2ccd22-ae94-4ab0-9fd0-510ecc4ff519", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-entrepreneurship-scoping-study-kenya", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f64429bc16b20c768253f3923949450a16b70b5ef38d127362d4ce43bcfa80b2"}}, "hash": "c07a8df1f797821190d5c1c242a48c02527110f277e40d63719ee4dfa448ef74", "text": "However, embedded in the purposes of this inves- tigation is an underlying expectation that interventions or recommendations will pro- mote the livelihoods of coastal communities (including vulnerable populations) and en- gage in enterprising activities that promote both active (conservation) and proactive (re- generation) benefits toward the ocean and the species therein. For the purposes of this study, we interpret \u2018Blue Entrepreneurship\u2019 as components within the Blue Economy space that involve individual (or household) business opportunities. Additionally, coastal communities are among the most affected by climate change impacts and ocean over- exploitation, as their direct livelihoods are dependent on ocean resources, making the focus on coastal Blue Entrepreneurship all the more urgent. By responsibly engaging in the Blue Economy sector, Kenya also showcases the initiative\u2019s support of and contributions toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs).23 Regenerative, sustainable ocean-facing ventures contribute directly toward SDG 14: Life Below Water, and these initiatives also have the potential to support SDG 13: Climate Action. By applying a gen- der-aware lens during data collection, data analysis, and innovation ideation phases, the Economy 8 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya study is positioned to produce outcomes that also address gender equity among coastal communities (SDG 5). In addition, the follow-on effects from increased local in- vestment in critical ecosystems is expected to support SDG 12: Sustainable Consumption and Production, while with improved, more-stable incomes enable enterprising households and communities to tackle pov- erty (SDG 1), food insecurity (SDG 2), health (SDG 3), and education (SDG 4). According to insights from the OECD Roundtable held in March 2019, it is estimated that we will only achieve the SDGs by 209424 if we continue to operate with a business-as-usual approach.

People According to the 2019 national census,25 the 6 coastal counties in Kenya, including Kilifi, Kwale, Lamu, Mombasa, Taita-Taveta, and Tana River, collectively represent just over 9%26 of Kenya\u2019s total population.

Ministry Of Agriculture, Livestock & Fisheries country population has increased by around 23%27 in the past 10 years,28 the population along the coast has increased by around 30%.29 Comprehensive research and sustain- able interventions that prioritize the Blue Economy stand to serve a growing propor- tion of Kenya\u2019s people. It also seems that county governments are adopting and promoting Blue Economy interventions as of late, as they recognize the importance of the sector on their local populations. For example, Lamu County government reports the fisheries industry as affecting 70%30 of county incomes, un- derscoring the need for attention in this space. Interestingly, when reviewing Kenya\u2019s documented 2016 County Prioritised Value Chains31 across the 6 coastal counties, only Tana River claimed \u2018fish\u2019 as an industry of in- terest. Despite being hailed as a priority from the national government, on-land agriculture and livestock has historically been perceived at the highest importance. However, in more recent years, it is clear from individual county development plans for 2018 - 2022 actions that fisheries are a focus. Even more, plans reinforce county appreciation for the ocean, and they emphasize interest in developing the sector in a sustainable way. Despite movement toward ocean-based support, it is clear that Kenyan coastal counties have Economy 9 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya yet to capitalize on the boundless potential of their access to this Blue natural resource. Furthermore, Kenya\u2019s coastline is home to both intensely crowded areas (Mombasa\u2019s population density is 67x32 the national av- erage) and notably rural areas (Tana River\u2019s population density is 1/1033 the national av- erage). With an array of settings, economic makeups, and community needs, it becomes critical to focus on enterprise solutions that speak to the diverse local contexts and area issues. Not only will this research aim to parse out how different communities expe- rience Blue Entrepreneurship growth, that is, understanding the needs of both the pro- ducing and consuming parties, but we will also consider the various ways communities are able to leverage natural resources sus- tainably, given local resource management constraints. Additionally, the Blue Economy is growing unevenly across regions and sec- tors, with supporting infrastructure follow- ing a similar pattern. Therefore, problems in an urban coastal region will not be the same as the problems in a rural one, underscoring the need for thoughtful analysis and flexible solutions. 32 Calculated from: KNBS 2019 census (see footnote #25 for citation) 33 Calculated from: KNBS 2019 census (see footnote #25 for citation) 34 National Geographic.

Profit According to recent research, if the ocean was an economy (specifically, thinking of the total \u201cvalue of key ocean assets\u201d), it would be the world\u2019s 7th largest, worth $24 tril- lion.45,46 From that immense global resource, the \u201cocean asset base\u201d of the WIO region values around an estimated $334 billion.47 Measuring economic output in a manner similar to measuring a country\u2019s GDP, the WIO produces nearly $21 billion annually, comprised from sectors like coastal tourism ($10.4 billion), carbon sequestration ($2.9 billion), and \u2018direct outputs\u2019 like fisheries and aquaculture ($1.9 billion).47 With Kenya\u2019s 536 kilometres48 of coastline, it benefits from a range of ocean-based industries like fishing and seafood capture, coastal and marine tourism, and shipping. Kenya, which was cit- ed as one of the fastest-growing economies49 in Sub-Saharan Africa, showcases potential for economic growth across the country\u2019s coasts across a variety of sectors. The Blue Economy currently contributes just under 180 billion KES per year (2.5% of the national GDP), and at full potential, the Blue Economy stands to bring in 500 billion KES per year.50 Economy 11 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya However, Kenya fell victim to the economic constriction of Q2 2020,51 taking a particular hit in the tourism sector, as the COVID-19 pandemic struck. Global supply chain disruptions along with changes to daily operating life (like a government-mandated curfew) have impacted the Kenyan local and national economies in ways not yet fully cap- tured. Even so, this research and subsequent recommended interventions are informed with an awareness of the economic im- pacts, both globally and domestically, of the COVID-19 crisis, especially as more focus is being brought to the profit potential of the ocean and coastal ecosystems. 51 Focus Economics.

Climate impact The devastating results of climate change not only threaten the health of our planet and the ocean, but they put Blue Economy development at risk. This makes it vital to develop a resilient Blue Economy that can adapt to these threats. Climate change increases the frequency and intensity of natural disasters. When occur- ring offshore, these natural disasters are a threat to marine industries such as the cruise industry (tourism), shipping (trade), and oil and gas (energy). If happening inshore, they dramatically increase coastal erosion and biodiversity loss, through destruction of nat- ural habitats. Natural disasters that happen on land transport pollution to the ocean. Another climate change impact is acidifi- cation of the ocean. This change leads to widespread collapse of coral systems, which are home to at least 25% of all species in the ocean. Moreover, ocean acidification threatens the health of zooplankton; if these die alongside the 25% of all biodiversity sus- tained by reefs, the whole ocean food chain is at risk of collapse. Such a dramatic impact on the marine food chain would directly impact the 2.4 billion people living less than 100km from the coast52,53 and who rely on the ocean for business and food security. Furthermore, ocean stratification due to climate change means that the oxygen-rich upper layer of the ocean heats up faster than the nutrient-rich bottom layer. This leads to less natural stirring of the two layers, and in the long run, can create a precarious en- vironment in which the majority of species will struggle to find both food and oxygen. Additionally, the rise of sea levels, due to increasing global temperatures and glacial ice melting, impacts photo-dependent ma- rine species (like corals and seaweed) whose positions under water will soon be too deep for the sun\u2019s rays to reach.

Percent GDP of Kenyan economy In 2019, the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics published a report tallying Gross County Product from 2013 - 2017, which re- ports that coastal counties contributed \u00b19% to Kenya\u2019s overall GDP.54 However, according to Jumuiya ya Kaunti za Pwani (JKP), Kenya\u2019s Economic Development Organization for coastal counties, the total Blue Economy in Kenya currently contributes only \u00b11% (that is, about 44 billion KES)55 to national-level GDP. Although a relatively small portion of the overall country economics, the Blue Economy plays a major role among coastal communities who depend on the ocean for food security and income. Across the Kenyan coastline, innovative ven- tures are emerging that blend community livelihoods targets with conservation and regenerative aims. These Blue Economy strategies are proving that environmental protection and profit can, in fact, go hand-in- hand. For example, Mikoko Pamoja (which means \u201cMangroves Together\u201d in Swahili) operates as \u201ca business case for carbon credit in Gazi - Kwale County, Kenya\u201d56 and builds a community-level income-genera- tion system that simultaneously incentivises ecosystem preservation.

This research aims to further contribute to the growing body of evidence that supports the Blue Economy as not only necessary for ocean health and long-term viability, but also as profitable enough to enrich and sustain livelihoods for coastal communities. 3.1.3. Forecasts / expectations With the expanding global population and with ever-decreasing barriers to globaliza- tion, we are seeing increased demand for transportation, shipping, food, medicine, and entertainment from the ocean. While more and more global consumers are making purchasing decisions that account for supply chains and their environmental impacts, this grassroots interest is not enough to main- tain and preserve the Blue natural capital resource for the long run. Instead, the Ocean Panel and other organizations are calling upon countries to plan for and execute strat- egies that address the increasing economic and resource pressure being placed upon the ocean. Citing Kenya\u2019s National Spatial Planning (NSP) 2015-2045, Jumuiya ya Kaunti za Pwani (JKP) highlights how the Kenyan national strategy is developing expectations and ac- cordingly positioning the Blue Economy for growth in coming years.

Policy environment At the national-policy level, the \u201cClimate Change Act, 201658 is the key legislation guiding Kenya\u2019s climate change response.\u201d59 As part of the effort to fulfill that Act, Kenya\u2019s Ministry Of Environment And Forestry re- leased the National Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP) 2018 - 2022. This Action Plan supports \u201cthe achievement of [Kenya\u2019s] Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement,\u201d which identifies \u201cwater and the Blue Economy\u201d as one of the targeted areas for intervention.59 Certainly as Kenya works toward its devolution status,60 legislative challenges and delays can be ex- pected as each county becomes responsible for its own interpretations, enactments, and enforcements of national-level initiatives and goals.61 Even so, efforts that support en- vironmental conservation and regeneration are primed to be supported at high levels by Kenya\u2019s policy structures.

De-risking coastal communities through diversification, while simultaneous- ly stimulating Blue Economy growth and prosperity, depends on collective effort that regenerates and conserves the Blue natural capital upon which all these coastal indus- tries depend. This research underscores the need for interventions that link livelihoods and economic benefits with long-term ocean health. A final important challenge to the Blue Economy is lack of specific technical know- how around ocean-related economies. Kenyan coastal communities, while armed with a wealth of indigenous and historical knowledge, lack technical ocean under- standings and are disadvantaged from a lack of access to advanced technologies. At the high-level, the translation of research into development and implemented practic- es is minimal, as evidenced by a noticeable lack of marine economic ventures, despite years of marine research in the country. Kenyan coastal success depends on relia- ble biodiversity and human ocean-activity data, ocean floor and coral mapping, and economic data related to Blue outputs. At the local-level, communities are under-edu- cated about simple, actionable conservation and restoration practices and how critical these practices are to both their livelihoods as well as to the long-term health of their local ecosystems. 77 Ecorys.

Based on the scoping study framing and the intended impacts for results and recommendations, we did not include ven- tures that were: \u2022 Non-income-generating (e.g.: volunteer or unpaid conservation efforts); \u2022 Inland-based (e.g.: on-land pollution- reduction schemes); and/or \u2022 Enablers (e.g.: government policy) From there, we set out to pare down to the fi- nal Long List of 8-12 ventures, so the research team needed to: \u2022 Develop selection criteria for the first assessment (further detailed in Section 3.3) that could quickly and efficiently reduce the exhaustive list across a variety of cross-cutting measures \u2022 Use stakeholder interviews and secondary research to evaluate each option on the exhaustive list against the first-assessment selection criteria \u2022 Promote the ventures with the strongest potential to the Long List Finally, the research team developed the Short List, aiming for 2-3 high-priority value chains for the deep-dive investigation. To arrive at the final Short List, we took the fol- lowing actions: \u2022 Develop a set of selection criteria for the second assessment (further detailed in Section 3.3), introducing additional metrics that could point to economic and community potential within the value chains \u2022 Conduct secondary research and stakeholder interviews to assess the Long List against the second- assessment selection criteria \u2022 Host a Focus Group session with a variety of industry experts to generate an engaging discussion around the Long List status and the potential of an initial suggested Short List \u2022 Work closely with IUCN for final approval of the Short List Ultimately, the research team identified 66 value chains for the Blue Economy in Kenya, 11 options for the Long List, and ended with 3 Blue Economy value chains for the Short List. 3.3. Selection criteria As part of the \u2018prioritizing value chains\u2019 step in the study process, the research team developed an efficient, comprehensive set of selection criteria. These criteria pinpoint Blue Economy sectors and value chain overview 19 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya value chains that exist in the overlap between ventures positioned to meet the livelihoods and environmental goals of the overall pro- ject and value chain areas primed to benefit from long-term support and current nation- al and regional momentum. The first-assessment selection criteria fo- cused on the following metrics: \u2022 Community- Enterprise Potential: Can you start or promote an inclusive enterprise (scaled thru community) with this value chain? \u2022 Regenerative Potential: What is the potential for the local environment to be restored and conserved? What is the potential to avoid future degradation of ecosystems? \u2022 Nature Conservation & Climate Change Potential: To what degree will the value chain activities conserve animals or plants in the ecosystems? To what degree will activities mitigate effects or help communities adapt to climate change impacts? \u2022 Upstart Time: How long until profit potential? 78 Ministry of Environment and Forestry.

The second-assessment selection evaluation embedded the assumption that activities highly negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic would be de-prioritized until some stability and regularity return to the industries. All criteria are equally weighted. Figure 2 shows the 11 value chains in the Long List, presented by function, as ranked against the second-assessment selection criteria. The four-colour visual rating scale ranges from Red = low suitability to Dark Green = high suitability. The research team then engaged in the Focus Group activity, with the aim of gener- ating discussion around the Long List and the emerging Short List. At that time, the front-running value chains were: \u2022 Seaweed farming \u2022 Finfish cage farming \u2022 Sea Cucumber farming \u2022 Planting On-land Trees (to prevent mangrove deforestation) The virtual Focus Group event was held on 18 February 2021. Besides the research team and IUCN representation, there were six attend- ees from across Kenya, bringing expertise in various subjects and representing various stakeholders, including: Coastal Women in Fisheries Entrepreneurship (CWiFE), Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI), Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), and Jumuiya ya Kaunti za Pwani (JKP). Several key takeaways emerged from the Focus Group, notably: \u2022 Social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic affected the local fisheries industry primarily through a government-mandated curfew ordinance which affected traditional fishing and fish-processing working hours, with the majority of the economic disruption occurring for women Blue Economy sectors and value chain overview 25 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya \u2022 Seaweed is an important focus of government-led or government-backed organizations \u2022 Sea cucumber and octopus present strong potential across coastal fisheries and mariculture projects, and these value chains were targeted as priority for Kenya among the Blue Economy Implementation Committee Additionally, since financing and innovation are already in place to achieve scale for on- land timber production, other value chains seemed to have more need, and therefore more potential, for additional support and investment.

With this updated knowledge, alongside the secondary research, first-hand accounts from stakeholder interviews, and insights from the expert panel, the research team finalized the prioritization of value chains exercise.

Production base The global commercial landscape for sea- weed production includes a variety of mech- anisms, ranging from small-scale operations (like wild-harvest and near-shore cultivation) to large-scale commercial ventures (like off- shore -or \u201cat sea\u201d- cultivation) to innovative designs (like integrated multi-trophic aqua- culture (IMTA) systems). In Kenya, production of exportable seaweed is exclusively farmed, as the sole exporter, C-WEED Corporation,90 does not purchase wild-harvested products. To maintain qual- ity and a transparent purchasing chain, the Kenya Country Representative buys exclu- sively from its own registered farmers. Reports confirm that Kenya\u2019s seaweed pro- duction potential is bolstered by its \u201clengthy coastline endowed with a wide variety of habitats for seaweed communities\u201d as well as its many (over 380) naturally-occurring species, some of which are unique to Kenyan coastal areas.91 However, current production is limited to Kwale County, where previous seaweed farming program pilots existed and then went dormant. A scout from C-WEED, a global exporting company operating in Zanzibar, Tanzania for over 30 years, hap- pened upon villages where farmers had successfully stored seaweed for up to three to four years, ready for purchase and export. By early 2018, C-WEED had registered in Kenya, and the once-quiet seaweed industry Value chain analysis: seaweed farming 31 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya began to restart along the southern coast. At present, Kenya\u2019s seaweed farms are cen- tred around eight seaweed centres, located in Gazi, Nyumba Sita, Tumbe, Funzi Island, Mwambao, Mkwiro, Jimbo, and Kibuyuni, all in Kwale County.

Additionally, as seaweed is propagated by retying smaller harvested bunches back onto the ropes and allowing them to re-grow, there is no \u2018seed- ling\u2019 cost past the first season. Farmers are currently only growing the Eucheuma den- ticulatum species. This variety is farmed for carrageenan, used as a gelling and stabilizing agent in the \u201cproduction of pharmaceutical, cleaning and personal care products like lotions and toothpaste, as well as in edible food such as burgers and various types of desserts.\u201d92 Farming cycles align with tidal cycles, and farmers work during the spring tide that comes every two weeks. During this period (5-7 days) where the low tides are lowest and the high tides are highest, farmers ideally spend the first three days harvesting and drying seaweed, with the remaining four days dedicated to re-seeding the ropes and securing them back into position. After two to four spring tides of growth (approximately 6 weeks), the seaweed should be ready. Farmers must take care to harvest quickly enough, else over-grown seaweed that pushes too hard against the tie-tie becomes severed and floats away. During working weeks, farmers average roughly three to four hours per day, when tides are low enough to access farm plots. On site, farmers monitor their crops and do the tiring work of carrying heavy loads to drying stations, often without help. Production cycles are also depending on seasonal weather patterns. Conditions are Value chain analysis: seaweed farming 32 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya good and yields are generally high from March through early May, during the in- ter-monsoon season. From June to July/ August, coastal areas in Kenya are subject to the Southeast Monsoon. This season brings extreme wind and rough sea conditions that not only cause seaweed to break away from ropes but also bring invasive filamentous green algae that destroy crops. Production increases again during August/September to November when conditions are relatively cool. From December to February, seaweed plants are unable to survive the hot temper- atures of summer waters, so farmers plant \u2018survival seedlings\u2019 in deep-water storage zones where cooler and more regulated wa- ter temperatures will keep the seedlings safe until it is time to replant. To date, there are around 1,500 registered seaweed farmers in Kwale County;93 howev- er, only about 500-600 are active and have substantial production. While some youth participate, farmers are generally between 40 and 55 years old, and over 90% of farmers are women. Kenyan seaweed faces a number of produc- tion-specific challenges. Unsurprisingly, envi- ronmental factors, like unfavourable weather patterns and warming sea temperatures, make farming in certain seasons impossible and come with higher risk of infestation or disease. Farmers also complain of a lack of assets, such as boots, mallets, and boats/ rafts, that would support farming activities. Although, some stakeholders argue that the frustration around inputs is a natural result of dependence on a revolving door of NGO and donor-funded projects. With the arrival of each new program, and the accompanying flurry of funding and startup support, local 93 Martin Kiogora (stakeholder interview, 12 Mar 2021) farmers are further disincentivised to see seaweed farming as a business and invest in necessary assets and equipment them- selves. Between the expectation of support and the current perception of low prices for difficult labour, motivation among farmers can be a challenge to production. 4.3. Broader value chain mapping As the seaweed value chain in Kenya is ex- port-only and dominated by a single export- er, the broader dynamics are relatively sim- ple. Seaweed is grown and dried by coastal farmers, and then seaweed is collected, transported, and exported by the C-WEED Corporation.

Farmers might be paid once or twice a year, and the infrequency is due to low production and the time it takes the com- munity to meet a minimum village volume that justifies exporter collection and trans- portation costs.

Purchases are made in bulk, ranging any- where from 2 - 23 tonnes in a given collec- tion. The exporting company takes on the operating costs of transportation and labour, and collections are taken to the main centre in Kibuyuni, where dried seaweed is baled. The commercial-grade baling machine packs seaweed from farmer sacks into 100kg bales. These bales are then transported to Mombasa, where they are loaded into shipping containers, holding 20 tonnes of dried seaweed each (200 bales for each 120ft container).

The global price for seaweed dropped by US$ 100 per metric ton in 2020, and again by US$ 120 per metric ton in early 2021.90 This means the exporter is now earn- ing only 74 KES/kg on the global market, as opposed to the pre-pandemic price of 92 KES/kg. Using estimates of operating costs, it is likely that farmers retain 30-45% of the profit pro- portion in the value chain, while the exporter retains 55-70%. With decreasing global pric- es, the export business is caught between the challenges of low production volumes and shrinking margins. Increasing both yield (which is sometimes an issue of farmer mo- tivation) and number of farms would help justify continued spending on operational costs. While not yet developed, the sector has the potential to incorporate additional market actors for value-add and support activities. For example, intensive labour and carrying of heavy loads might be outsourced to local income-generating youth groups. With suf- ficient production, transportation services might also be a sustainable business model for local entrepreneurs. Kenya has yet to be competitive in the WIO seaweed trade, limited by scale and produc- tivity challenges. With target expansion ef- forts and thoughtful farmer support, Kenya\u2019s coastal farmers have the potential to outstrip production in Zanzibar, which currently stands at over 100,000 tonnes annually.83 Value chain analysis: seaweed farming 34 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya Enabling environment The sector is also marked by the presence of NGOs who have historically offered farmer training programs and distributed inputs.

Finally, the seaweed value chain is influenced by government research facilities responsible for completing suitability mapping and up- dated environmental impact assessments. 4.4. Key challenges and threats Several prominent challenges face the sea- weed industry in Kenya today. First is one of scale. At present, only a small number of farmers are producing seaweed, limiting the attractiveness of investment by private sec- tor players and exporters. Farmer issues, like difficult, exposed working conditions and the poor value proposition of intensive effort for minimum payout, all discourage new farm- ers from entering the market. Fewer farmers thereby limits Kenya\u2019s overall potential to scale the industry. Furthermore, seaweed farming, as a relatively new venture, still struggles with dependence on government and donor support, and only a few farmers in Kwale County have managed to create a fully-autonomous business. Scaling seaweed output in Kenya, especially as global prices are currently falling, requires either easing the production burden or capturing more of the market value at the smallholder level, Value chain analysis: seaweed farming 35 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya driving farming adoption in the category and bringing critical attention to Kenya as a viable market player. Additional scaling challenges have been reported from some coastal communities who are unwilling to set up seaweed farming in their areas. Some local leaders fear that developing farming ventures will disrupt the status quo and are wary of the increased empowerment that comes with female farmers generating their own incomes. Over the past decade, several seaweed farming pilots have been launched across Kenya\u2019s coastline. As such, the local BMUs have developed protocols for sea-use access and leasing to farmer groups. Even though the governance work has begun, gaps for comprehensive management remain. Currently, seaweed farmers complain of con- flict with local fishers, who take advantage of increased fish populations in the newfound habitats but destroy seaweed lines and crops in the process. The lack of complete zoning and protections, that is gazetting the sea-access rights, threatens the security and scalability of the seaweed farming sector. Another threat to seaweed farming longevity is unstable access to a changing global mar- ket. First and foremost, there is no domestic market for farmed seaweed, apart from small value-added products that have yet to prove large enough to absorb significant lev- els of production. Therefore, the industry is dependent on global exports. At present, the entire sector rests on the export capacity of a single, solitary buyer; without enough volume to attract additional export players, farmers and their livelihoods are dependent on the success and intervention of this sole market actor. Highlighting the risk of dependence are reports from stakeholders of infrequent exports. The Country Representative from C-WEED Corporation confirmed the delay in shipments was due to deflated global de- mand related to an oversupply in the global market and a downward price trend. Moreover, financial impacts of the COVID-19 crisis also threaten the success of the sector, as production from other tourism-depend- ent countries has increased, dropping global prices. Granted, any worldwide event that dramatically reduces the price for farmers will exacerbate already-thin margins and a waning value proposition. The influx of supply due to COVID-19 happens to be the current culprit. Incomes from seaweed are already relatively low due to the commod- itised nature of the product, and Kenya will struggle to entice farmers and generate required sector scale if prices drop further. Finally, as with all mariculture initiatives, climate change impacts pose a threat to long-term Kenyan seaweed production.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9229c28d-11b0-4d6f-9f07-1a7412c68931": {"__data__": {"id_": "9229c28d-11b0-4d6f-9f07-1a7412c68931", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-entrepreneurship-scoping-study-kenya", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blue entrepreneurship scoping study for Kenya", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-entrepreneurship-scoping-study-kenya", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c01791986f919cf5fc4ea8cb0edaf0a05e064832ceff3d2d07d8af17a8a002e1"}, "2": {"node_id": "6bed88b5-4fcf-4d56-8a8f-32a58728818c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-entrepreneurship-scoping-study-kenya", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c0863318e6f2359d14f46740f8570c81167f3aebcd061268e8405060105ea1a3"}}, "hash": "daaaf5c6b9f29b64e95111b4d21d54f88382d8cfe1fc36d98f98f4520467a203", "text": "The intertidal areas where seaweed is grown are at greater risk of rising temperatures, and changes in weather patterns that generate rougher seas negatively impact farming infrastructure.

Key strengths and opportunities Leaning on lessons from Kwale County seaweed pilots and learnings from seaweed farming projects in Zanzibar, Tanzania, it is clear that Kenya boasts coastal ecosystems that are conducive to growing seaweed. As farming gains more traction, the extensive Kenyan coastline offers untold expansion potential for smallholder farming.

Additionally, seaweed production does not require clearing of land or use of freshwater. These \u2018avoided produc- tion costs\u2019 also make farming relatively envi- ronmentally-friendly, albeit farmer practices and community conflict are the main drivers of unintended negative environmental consequences (like destruction of seagrass meadows). In Kenya, seaweed farming appeals to wom- en. Beyond the low cost, there is no require- ment for land ownership, and the near-shore area is safer (as compared to deep-water ventures like fishing). At this stage in value chain development, profit margins are also limited, so seaweed is not yet appealing as a crop for male involvement. Further involvement in the sector must responsibly consider the societal and family dynamics at play in Kenyan coastal communities, as the role of women as primary seaweed farmers develops. Innovations and interventions must be cognisant of potential harm (emo- tionally, financially, or otherwise) to women by outlining an expectation of intensive work with minimal benefit. Reports from the field suggest that the sec- tor also benefits from momentum driven by local enthusiasm and word-of-mouth pro- motion. Farmer-focused efforts will be more effective and have stronger staying-power if they can reduce the effort spent on mobili- zation and idea-pitching by capitalizing on the organic energy and supporting commu- nities on projects they select. 100 Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI).

Another strength of the seaweed industry in Kenya is its status as a high-priority area for government support. Its position as a key sec- tor for the Blue Economy agenda in Kenya is encouraging for market players who want to be assured of high-level attention and coop- eration, in funding, research, and policy, for pushing seaweed success.100 County govern- ments are also taking the lead on seaweed. In Kwale County,93 for example, the county government already allocates funds to the sector, and the Fisheries Director reports on plans to expand the value-chain by ensuring a ready-market for the current production. Additionally, because pilots are already un- derway in key areas, local government Beach Management Units (BMUs) have already outlined governance structures for sea-use access of community-based seaweed farms. Replicating the model and adapting for local context across other geographies will be much simpler than developing all the regu- lations from scratch. Seaweed farming is attractive to farmers, as the barriers to entry are relatively low (like low-tech farming mechanics and minimal input cost). As seaweed can be produced year-round and does not require full-time attention, coastal households benefit from an alternative livelihood option that offers supplemental, rather than replacement, income and constant cash flow. As the plots utilize near-shore intertidal zones, seaweed Value chain analysis: seaweed farming 37 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya farming can be taken up by a full range of community members, including women and youth, making it a welcome economic option to help coastal areas recover from COVID-19 declines. Diversification and access are two critical components for building household economic resilience, and seaweed farming serves to both reduce the community\u2019s de- pendence on fishing as an income source as well as reduce the strain on the local ecosys- tems from overfishing.

Demand for edible sea cucumbers continues to grow on the global market, with a boom among China\u2019s middle class in the 1980s spearheading the trend.107 Additionally, chemicals found in the skin can be used in both traditional and modern medicine, so the market is also responding to a growing interest among pharmaceutical firms.107 These converging interests com- pound demand and have led to dramatic overfishing of sea cucumber globally. Sources say that upwards of 70% of glob- al fisheries for sea cucumber are fully or over-exploited or depleted,102,104 with \u201cno natural populations remaining\u201d in China.102 This dramatic rise in demand and price have led to what Mongabay terms a \u201cmarine gold rush.\u201d104 As of 1996, only 35 countries engaged in the sea cucumber export business, but by 2011, that number had more than doubled to 83.107,108 Furthermore, between 2011 to 2016, the global average market price for sea cu- cumbers rose nearly 17%.107 Value chain analysis: sea cucumber farming 40 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya This extreme demand generates damaging results. Fisheries around the world are see- ing drops in wild availability. For example, in Yucatan, Mexico it took only 2 years (2012 to 2014) for wild sea cucumber harvests to drop 95% (from 260 tons to only 14 tons).107 Business Insider reports that, as of 2019, from the \u201c70 or more species of exploited sea cucumbers, seven are now classified as endangered\u2026 all through exploitation.\u201d107 These results do critical damage to local ecosystems as well as to the communities whose livelihoods depend on fisheries for survival. The decline in available resources is linked to a combination of foreign demand, ineffective governance structures, and daily economic pressure among poor coastal communities.109 Over-reliance on small scale fisheries is common, and 66% of sea cucum- ber fisheries are small-scale.106 Exploitation of any piece of these fragile ecosystems puts the environment and the livelihoods of hun- dreds of millions of people at stake. As much of the sea cucumber trade world- wide exists through informal channels sup- ported by poaching, global production sta- tistics are hardly comprehensive. The market is fraught with illegal hunting and, either through negligence or intentional subver- sion, underreported import and export figures.110,111 For example, a 2020 study from Traffic shows that between 2012 and 2019, Hong Kong reported receiving sea cucumber 109 KCET (KCET-TV).

Additional challenges of the rainy season include lower production base, as many fishers avoid the practice when seas are rough, and post-harvest losses due to ex- cess rain that make drying processes slower or less effective. Export prices from Kenya are highest from November to February, coinciding with holidays like Christmas and Lunar New Year. Kenya competes on the global market with Asian countries, like Fiji in particular, and with other African countries, like Madagascar and Seychelles. When vying for a position in the global export market, Kenya faces production challenges like climate change, insufficient supply, and declining stocks. According to the Fisheries Directors of Kwale County, wild sea cucumber stocks have been on the decline for decades, forcing several operators to close their sea cucumber busi- nesses.93 Sea cucumber aquaculture is an option for Kenyan production that could solve some of the problems with availability, while also building back the ecosystems in ways that protect and regenerate other ani- mal populations. Several examples of sea cucumber aquacul- ture projects exist in the WIO region, some more successful than others. A Zanzibar, Tanzania sea cucumber project, supported by FAO and Korea International Cooperation Agency,122 faces the aftermath of a liveli- hoods program cut short.

However, leaning on decades of trial, adap- tation, and learning, Blue Ventures102,106 offers an example of a community-farming setup in Madagascar and points to the potential successes that can be found for both eco- systems and local community livelihoods. In Madagascar, Blue Ventures sea cucumber farmers are earning on-par with the coun- try\u2019s agricultural minimum wage,124 just from doing sea cucumber farming part-time (roughly 20 hours/month).115 These farmers also produce high-value seaweed, adding to their incomes. Additionally, the farming practices are yielding a 60% return on juve- niles to harvest, which is double the return at a standard industrial farm. By 2015, the 100+ active farmers in 2 villages in southwest Madagascar had produced and sold nearly 24,000 market-sized sea cucumbers, with a total value of more than US$ 18,000.125 This model also encourages community engage- ment and supports local leaders as they es- tablish and enforce sustainable governance practices that protect farmers and mitigate conflict. Additionally, locals in Madagascar are seeing ecosystem improvements,126 like more biodiversity and faster-growing seaweed, due to the increased presence of sandfish.

One exporter interviewed chooses to travel to Hong Kong from Mombasa, carrying the shipment himself. This work, of course, requires a special export license, as well as four additional certifications.

At present, the sea cucumber export market in Kenya is limited, as exporters are facing increased financial pressure, and some have recently shut down operations.93 Throughout the whole of Kenya, no sea cucumber aquaculture presently exists,93 and introducing sea cucumber farming will disrupt the current value chain. Opportunity exists to harness a lucrative industry, incor- porate innovative ideas (that are inclusive of vulnerable populations) to boost supply, and generate substantial value for local-fisher livelihoods.

This means that wild populations are not monitored or measured, no catch quo- tas exist, and sea cucumber businesses are Value chain analysis: sea cucumber farming 46 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya subject to general sector regulations, rather than measures informed specifically for the product. The Kwale County Fisheries Director confirmed that, in the county, regulations around sea cucumber catch are nonexistent. However, the county is currently undergo- ing efforts to revive aquaculture practices that stalled during the Economic Stimulus Program. As the county government prior- itizes its constituent\u2019s demands, efforts cur- rently focus on freshwater aquaculture near dams. Positively, Kilifi County government set targets for 2018 - 202295 that include con- ducting feasibility studies, with sea cucum- ber named specifically as a priority. Market actors can expect the enabling environment and government regulation of sea cucumber on the coast to be a work-in-progress for the foreseeable future. 5.4. Key challenges and threats The most pressing bottleneck for a robust, sustainable sea cucumber aquaculture value chain in Kenya is the issue of institut- ing and maintaining viable hatcheries. At present, not a single hatchery exists, and the sector has no chance of survival or scale without operational hatcheries relatively close to farming grounds, as fingerlings are too delicate to transport far distances (that is, no further than 100km).115,120 As seen with the Zanzibar effort, the hatchery challenge represents a combination of issues including funding (even with an active hatchery, simi- lar projects require a minimum of five years115 of external program funding to achieve self-sufficient systems), technical expertise 137 Karega, V.
