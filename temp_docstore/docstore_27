It provides public, private and non-governmental organisations with the knowledge and tools that enable human progress, economic development and nature conservation to take place together. Created in 1948, IUCN is now the world\u2019s largest and most diverse environmental network, harnessing the knowledge, resources and reach of 1,400 Member organisations and some 15,000 experts. It is a leading provider of conservation data, assessments and analysis. Its broad membership enables IUCN to fill the role of incubator and trusted repository of best practices, tools and international standards. IUCN provides a neutral space in which diverse stakeholders including governments, NGOs, scientists, businesses, local communities, indigenous peoples\u2019 organisations and others can work together to forge and implement solutions to environmental challenges and achieve sustainable development. Working with many partners and supporters, IUCN implements a large and diverse portfolio of conservation projects worldwide. Combining the latest science with the traditional knowledge of local communities, these projects work to reverse habitat loss, restore ecosystems and improve people\u2019s well-being. www.iucn.org https://twitter.com/IUCN/ IUCN Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation The IUCN Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation (IUCN-Med) opened in Malaga (Spain) in October 2001 with the core support of the Spanish Ministry of Environment and the regional Government of Junta de Andaluc\u00eda. The Centre\u2019s mission is to influence, encourage and assist Mediterranean societies to conserve and use sustainably the natural resources of the region and work with IUCN Members and cooperate with all other agencies that share the objectives of IUCN. www.iucn.org/mediterranean Analysis of knowledge on cultural landscapes at the Mediterranean level The designation of geographical entities in this report, and the presentation of the material do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of IUCN or other participating organisations concerning the legal status of any country, territory, or area, or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries.

They constitute an important landscape in the Mediterranean region, but have long been studied both by social and natural scientists from different perspectives. Several NGOs working on building awareness and knowledge of cultural landscapes in the Mediterranean region have bundled their forces and formed the Alliance for Mediterranean Nature & Culture (AMNC) in 2021. The focus is on strengthening the knowledge on the economic, social, cultural and environmental benefits of cultural landscapes and advocating for international recognition of cultural landscapes. This report tries to combine the existing literature dealing with the environmental and socio-cultural aspects of cultural landscapes, focusing on the Mediterranean region. An interactive map was created to visualize the distribution of the cited landscapes. Literature was found for a total of 70 cultural landscapes, including 8 cultural landscapes that form part of the AMNC. Publications issued before 2000 were not considered, nor gray literature (with few exceptions), and the scope was limited by the exclusive use of publications in English. The Mediterranean region has many models to offer for sustainable land-use management. It is not only a biodiversity hotspot, but also has a rich history of cultural landscapes. Many of these landscapes are characterized by a specific dominant feature like tree-crops (mainly olives, chestnuts, cork oaks and almonds). The traditional land management practices have created a socio-ecological system beneficial for people and the environment and important to protect at a European and global scale. Executive summary V ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL IUCN-Med would like to thank the partners of the Alliance for Mediterranean Nature & Culture for their valuable expertise and insights. This report would not have been possible without their continuing work and focus on the cultural landscapes situated in the Mediterranean region.

Introduction Kapikiri village and Latmos Besparmak Mountains, Aegean region of Turkey \u00a9 Serturvetan on Dreamstime 2 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL INTRODUCTION At the European level, the relationship between landscapes and biodiversity and other benefits is merely implicit in the European Landscape Convention of 2000, which defines its object as \u201can area, as perceived by people, whose character is the result of the action and interaction of natural and/or human factors\u201d and \u201clandscape protection\u201d as \u201cactions to conserve and maintain the significant or characteristic features of a landscape, justified by its heritage value derived from its natural configuration and/or from human activity\u201d (Seardo, 2016). On the other hand, despite the Natura 2000 framework\u2019s focus on biodiversity, the Habitats Directive foresees that \u201cMember States shall endeavour, where they consider it necessary, in their land-use planning and development policies and, in particular, with a view to improving the ecological coherence of the Natura network, to encourage the management of features of the landscape which are of major importance for wild fauna and flora\u201d (Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora, consolidated text, art. 10). Still focusing on the European level, the Florence Declaration promoted by UNESCO and the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity might be the document that offers the most comprehensive, and in a sense up-to-date \u2013 at least with the literature included in this report \u2013 view on cultural landscapes. \u201cAs it assimilates economic, social, cultural and environmental processes in time and space, the European landscape is predominantly a biocultural multifunctional landscape. As such, it provides a crucial and effective space for integration of biological and cultural diversity for human well-being, including in the context of rural territories [\u2026]\u201d (UNESCO-SCBD, 2014; Agnoletti and Emanueli, 2016). Still, cultural landscapes are not explicitly considered within the Agenda 2030 (although SDG target 11.4 \u201cStrengthen efforts to protect and safeguard the world\u2019s cultural and natural heritage\u201d), nor in documents related to the Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021\u20132030) (FAO & UNEP, 2022). Considering the essential relationships between cultural landscapes, sustainable development and ecosystems, highlighted within UNESCO programmes such as World Heritage and Man and the Biosphere but also in FAO\u2019s GIAHS, there seems to be room for further integration of the concept within the United Nations\u2019 standards and strategies. 1.2. Cultural landscapes, ecosystem services and biodiversity: outlining a growing research field Cultural landscapes in the Mediterranean have long been studied both by social and natural scientists, although from different perspectives and approaches \u2013 and following different definitions of the concept. As elsewhere, the introduction of the concept of ecosystem services, especially through the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment international research project (or MA, concluded in 2005), has prompted further research and cross- disciplinary dialogue. Still, research exploring relationships between landscapes and ecosystems rather than focusing on one or the other dimension, thus involving at once humanities, social and natural sciences, seems relatively limited. While it might be said that landscapes host or correspond to ecosystems, the former characterized by a significant cultural dimension, which in turn has been recognized in terms of ecosystem services. Cultural Ecosystem Services, defined by the MA as \u2018nonmaterial benefits people obtain from ecosystems through spiritual enrichment, cognitive development, reflection, recreation, and aesthetic experiences\u2019, have been dedicated a vast amount of literature on their own \u2013 often dealing with the issue of how to quantify them with respect to the other Ecosystem Services categories (Blicharska et al., 2017; Daniel et al., 2012; H\u00f8lleland et al., 2017; Paracchini et al., 2014; Plieninger et al., 2014; Smith & Ram, 2017; Scholte et al., 2015; Winthrop, 2014).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "edbfe44f-cb9d-4984-9645-7f02dcf8bef4": {"__data__": {"id_": "edbfe44f-cb9d-4984-9645-7f02dcf8bef4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/economic-impact-plastic-pollution-saint-lucia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The economic impact of plastic pollution on Saint Lucia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/economic-impact-plastic-pollution-saint-lucia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "94d298dd6fc89a9a10f02f43ee172dd982786f3161a46397be4e2f5262e18a90"}, "2": {"node_id": "3de5253e-f181-4d9e-b7fb-f6f22b14488f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/economic-impact-plastic-pollution-saint-lucia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8d145ce9deecdf4aa9e1a4fdf2ccaed729ab9da2e6d8335051207722c30b6fc0"}}, "hash": "8873c83af85b7eb412999a1ceb00f9345eae7ae67acae1277a47d1161702a0d6", "text": "3 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL INTRODUCTION Focusing on landscape management in relationship to ecosystem services, Setten et al. (2012) identify the three following challenges: A lack of compatibility between the framework and the inherent character, or the logics of landscapes. Difficulties arise in addressing the complexity of ecosystems, unsubstitutable values, and intangible dimensions in economic valuation when applied to landscapes. The Ecosystem Services framework to a large degree falls short in understanding how context-specific sociocultural processes are crucial to environmental attitudes and behaviours.

A glance at the amount of literature produced over the last decade suggests that although much has been done in that sense, the plea is more relevant than ever. Answering this plea is the Alliance for Mediterranean Nature and Culture (AMNC), a partnership between several NGOs working on building awareness and knowledge of cultural landscapes. Joining forces in 2021, the partners of AMNC share the vision of a Mediterranean region where cultural landscapes contribute effectively to conserving both biodiversity and maintaining the well-being of communities. The focus in their project sites, ranging from mountain ranges to lowland areas and islands, is on the economic, social, cultural and environmental processes of cultural landscapes. This partnership works on strengthening awareness and understanding of cultural landscapes and advocates for the international recognition of their benefits by scaling up its membership and impact. METHODOLOGY 4 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL This report seeks to account for existing literature dealing at least partially with the issues mentioned above, focusing on the Mediterranean area. Beside a significant number of literature reviews (Blicharska et al., 2017; Cicinelli et al., 2021; Daniel et al., 2012; H\u00f8lleland et al., 2017; Mart\u00edn-L\u00f3pez et al., 2016; Orr et al., 2021; Picchi et al., 2019; Sayer et al., 2013; Vall\u00e9s-Planells et al., 2014), many publications provide case analyses from virtually all parts of the world. A map was presented to visualize the distribution of those landscapes in the Mediterranean area (Figure 1). The cultural landscapes of the Alliance for Mediterranean Nature and Culture (AMNC) are separated. An interactive map, with more in-depth information on each landscape is available online. The sections have been elaborated following AMNC\u2019s objectives on the one hand, and seeking for thematic coherence among references on the other. References selected and used in this report include both types of publications, retrieved from the main academic journal portals including Web of Science, Scopus and through cross-reference. The initial survey of publications on \u201clandscape + benefits\u201d, \u201clandscape + ecosystem\u201d and \u201clandscape + biodiversity\u201d was completed with specific search for publications dealing with cultural landscapes identified as such within UNESCO World Heritage programme, FAO\u2019s GIAHS or other programmes (see further, par. \u201cLandscape typologies/patterns\u201d). The use of the most cited literature reviews and conceptual papers has thus provided the background for a wider overview of case analyses, including a wide array of the various areas of the Mediterranean and landscape typologies, as well as of different approaches and methodologies. 2.

As for the latter type of publication, the survey has been focused on cases situated in the Mediterranean area and corresponding to the three broad typologies represented among AMNC project areas (listed below between parentheses), several of which also appear in one or more publications included in the bibliography: Mountain/high altitude sites characterised by traditional farming, grazing, agrofor- estry and water management practices (the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco, the Al-Shouf Biosphere Reserve, West Bekaa and Mount Lebanon in Lebanon, and the Taurus mountains in Central and Southern Anatolia, Turkey). Traditional agro-silvo-pastoral systems in lowland areas (the corridor with dehe- sas/montados stretching from Extremadura and C\u00f3rdoba, Spain, to Coruche in Santar\u00e9m, Portugal, and Kroumirie Mogod in North-western Tunisia). Island sites characterised by a mosaic of traditional farming, livestock breeding and water management (the islands of Lemnos, Greece and Menorca, Spain).

Accounting for Mediterranean cultural landscapes and their benefits for the environment and communities through existing literature thus raises several difficulties, briefly discussed in the following paragraphs in order to introduce and comment the landscapes list (Figure 1): Different definitions of landscape typologies and/or units are used and/or provided. Various methods have been developed to analyse landscape change, which suggest a cautious approach to causalities. Fewer studies provide a comprehensive analysis of benefits provided by cultural landscapes. While many publications assess how policies at various levels affect cultural landscapes and related benefits, only few attempts to analyse and contextualize such policies. 3.

Each of the following works according to its own principles and guidelines, but all share a rather comprehensive view of (cultural) landscapes and include one or more sites in the Mediterranean area: UNESCO MAB reserves UNESCO World Heritage properties (including \u2018cultural landscapes\u2019) FAO GIAHS Natura 2000 National and Regional Parks (in turn often part of EUROPARC network) High Nature Value Farming systems (included in the data set based on the JRC/EEA methodology, introduced by Paracchini et al.

It should be noted that such labels and programmes (see the dedicated column in online map) may be either cited as an element of the studied landscape\u2019s setting, or considered for their own sake within the case analyses (see for instance Mathevet & Cibien, 2020; Torralba et al., 2020; Lafrenz Samuels, 2017 and Osipova et al., 2014 on World Heritage sites). Several of the labels and programmes mentioned above may apply at least partially to the same landscape. Similarly, a few landscape units and typologies concentrate a large amount of literature, like dehesas/montados and terraced landscapes. Much less knowledge is available, at least in English, on many other landscapes, like Slow Food Presidia or PPI-OSCAN project areas not included in Figure 1 because of the lack of dedicated scientific literature \u2013 not to mention areas which may not be labelled or included in programmes such as the above \u2013.

Changing landscapes: drivers and scenarios In a significant attempt to analyse and systematize \u201cdriving forces of landscape change\u201d (B\u00fcrgi et al., 2004), identified four major challenges to that aim: \u201cstudying processes and not merely spatial patterns, extrapolating results in space and time, linking data of different qualities, and considering culture as a driver of landscape change\u201d. Their method thus implied the following tasks: While such a systematic approach to landscape change is not always developed in case studies cited in this report, the concept of landscape-change drivers itself has been further discussed and put into perspective. For instance, Plieninger et al. (2021) propose an approach along more coordinates, including, in addition to \u201cdrivers\u201d themselves, \u201cpressures\u201d, \u201cstate\u201d, \u201cimpacts\u201d and \u201cresponses\u201d. Resuming results from B\u00fcrgi et al. (2004), Wolpert et al. (2020) highlight that \u201cdriving forces mostly appear in bundles and interdependencies across natural, political technological, socio-cultural and economic factors, calling for a multi-sectorial and holistic approach to landscape management\u201d.

Rather than through their physical features and associated practices, or by their either \u201ctraditional\u201d or \u201cabandoned\u201d state (Frattaroli et al., 2014), landscapes have been increasingly characterised in terms of \u201cscenarios\u201d, \u201ctrajectories\u201d, \u201cpatterns\u201d, or \u201cprocesses\u201d. This latter term is used by Wolpert et al. (2020), who identify the following among the three types of tree-crop Mediterranean landscapes they analyse: EXPANSION A tree-crop landscape that is flourishing and growing in its extent as well as in its importance for human use CONTINUITY A landscape that is not significantly changing but rather remaining in the same state over a period of time. The tree crop is either still one of many trees or already enjoys a certain level of importance, depending on the landscape POLARISATION Concurrent processes of abandonment on less fertile, steeper places as well as intensification on fertile zones ABANDONMENT A tree-crop landscape that is undergoing a process of decreasing inputs as well as outputs INTENSIFICATION A tree-crop landscape whose management has resulted in an increased yield per area.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2d1ba706-2f99-42ca-bfb6-02360e97d4c9": {"__data__": {"id_": "2d1ba706-2f99-42ca-bfb6-02360e97d4c9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/economic-impact-plastic-pollution-saint-lucia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The economic impact of plastic pollution on Saint Lucia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/economic-impact-plastic-pollution-saint-lucia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5a7ae197b46a7f4d3123dc9f76afe7a3cfa23f5601f0c3f1c4ceb8ab2a247389"}, "2": {"node_id": "eb2a8193-02a8-4cc6-a3d9-a7a18bae1769", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/economic-impact-plastic-pollution-saint-lucia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "192edd2cfe6ff986032ffb56044b556617034d1579878cf38e107a7bfd97f225"}}, "hash": "90a84627296281901ceff1353d77d2354675e92343c9c8e25af40ac652213fc1", "text": "This often but does not necessarily coincide with an intensified use of industrial inputs, such as machinery and agrochemicals RENAISSANCE The process of returning to expansion following a phase of abandonment, intensification or polarisation Such processes can be confronted for instance with the \u201cscenario\u201d identified by Felipe-Lucia et al., (2022), i.e. \u201ccurrent situation\u201d, \u201cconservation and active ecological restoration\u201d, \u201cintensive agriculture\u201d, \u201cconservation and agricultural production\u201d, and \u201crural abandonment\u201d.

Several studies emphasize the relevance of cultural drivers, but also the difficulty to assess their impacts (Plieninger et al., 2016; Wolpert et al., 2020; Zagaria et al., 2017). The question of stakeholders\u2019 perceptions and involvement in landscape management is crucial, as much as the understanding of cultural and especially recreational services, from the impact of tourism on land-use (Aretano et al., 2013; Savo et al., 2016) to natural park trails on biodiversity (Atik et al., 2012).

Such elaborate methods to analyse change in landscapes appear especially useful when they shed light on unexpected evolutions: for instance, Acha and Newing (2015) suggest that rewilding degraded dehesas landscapes could provide increased ecosystem services and biodiversity. Similarly, Agnoletti et al. (2011, 2019) show that terraced landscapes abandoned for a long time provide more ecosystem services and biodiversity than those abandoned more recently. Other studies highlight patterns of change differing from those observed at the Mediterranean, national or regional scale, like (Salvati et al., 2016) on reforestation. THE MULTIPLE VALUES OF CULTURAL LANDSCAPES 11 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL 3.3. Which benefits? Climate change impacts vs. ecosystem services, biodiversity and well-being During the session on \u2018Traditional agricultural landscapes and community conserved areas\u2019 at the International Congress on Ethnobiology of 2011, it was stated that \u201cthese [traditional agricultural landscapes] are rich in agro- biodiversity values as well as inherent wild biodiversity and cultural values, and encompass holistic knowledge and collective management systems and complex institutions of customary law. They play a vital role in ensuring resilience, ecosystem function, and livelihood and food sovereignty. Inextricably linked to the material values of these landscapes are their spiritual and cultural values. These special landscapes offer us beauty and a palpable sense of place. They are living landscapes worth living in\u201d (presented in Brown & Kothari, 2011). Still, it may be argued that there is an overall focus on drivers of landscape change \u2013 and often on the consecutive loss of ecosystem services, biodiversity and well-being \u2013 rather than on an effective assessment of the benefits provided by landscapes themselves. Beside sophisticated mapping and modelling exercises registering land-use change (Perpi\u00f1a Castillo et al., 2021; van Vliet et al., 2015) or bioclimatic evolution (Savo et al., 2016) or dating man-made structures (Turner et al., 2018) with a significant level of detail, benefits provided by landscapes are not always assessed in such a comprehensive and dynamic way. Instead, when they are not merely described, benefits are assessed singularly, i.e. in terms either of a single class of ecosystem services (Arslan & Kaymaz, 2020; Howlett et al., 2011; Paracchini et al., 2014; Picchi et al., 2019, the latter dealing with the relationship between renewable energy and ecosystem services for landscape planning and design), or of biodiversity (Atik et al., 2012; Bassols Isamat et al., 2011; Dudley & Stolton, 2012; Manenti, 2014; Santoro et al., 2020; Saadaoui et al., 2018).

Well-being is directly considered by fewer studies, and following even more various and less systematic approaches. Soy-Massoni et al.

Finally, S\u00f8rensen et al. (2021) inquire into Montados\u2019 cork value chain, suggesting \u201cpotential leverage points for sustainability in the landscape of origin, which could eventually bring a positive trickle-effect of benefits for the whole sector\u201d. The question of ecosystem services\u2019 management \u201ccosts\u201d is tackled by Campos et al. (2021) in the national context of Portugal and by Rocchi et al. (2019) in the case of Natura 2000 sites in Umbria, Italy, suggesting that they are significantly lower than related benefits (see also Shirvani Dastgerdi (2020) still in the context of Central Italy, Dimopoulos et al. (2017) on the Greek context, Flinzberger et al. (2020) on agroforestry labels in the Mediterranean area). Indeed, recent studies emphasize the opportunity to consider benefit \u2018bundles\u2019 (Meacham et al., 2022) or \u2018baskets\u2019 (Morgan et al., 2022), or landscapes\u2019 \u2018multifunctionality\u2019, the latter consisting in \u2018the capacity of a landscape to simultaneously support multiple benefits to society from its interacting ecosystems\u2019 (Mastrangelo et al., 2014). Such capacity relies as much upon to landscapes\u2019\u2019 management and local practices (especially in terms of land use, see Crouzat et al., 2015), as upon \u201clandscape features, most notably a mosaic of land uses, scattered tree cover, low-intensity livestock grazing, rich landscape structure, and unfragmented ecosystems, underpin the biodiversity and ecosystem services values\u201d (Plieninger et al., 2021, in the case of the dehesa system). On the other hand, multifunctionality also requires a realistic approach, as suggested by Pedroli et al. (2016), inasmuch as \u201cthe demand for multifunctionality has also overwhelmed agriculture as many of the functions that society expects today from rural areas cannot be provided by a single farm or managed by individual farmers\u201d, whilst \u2013 the same authors argue \u2013 \u201cthe polarising trends affecting European rural landscapes [have led] to a segregation of agricultural production landscapes and high-priority nature reserves\u201d. Similarly, Torquati et al. (2015), analysing \u201cTraditional Cultural Vineyard Landscapes\u201d in Italy in terms of wine farms\u2019 economic performance, suggest that \u201cthe key issue is not the contrast between those who support the costs of landscape preservation (vineyard owners) and those who reap its benefits (the community as a whole), but rather in the way in which the added value resulting from preservation of the landscape is being obtained and distributed\u201d. THE MULTIPLE VALUES OF CULTURAL LANDSCAPES 13 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL Following the brief discussion initiated in par. 3.2, it may be argued that a clear distinction between \u201cchallenges\u201d or \u201cthreats\u201d and \u201cbenefits\u201d is not always easy, both because of the complexity of landscape processes through time, which imply \u201ccontrasts and contingencies\u201d at various scales (Bevan & Conolly, 2013), and because of differing perceptions and potentially conflicting expectations regarding especially, but not exclusively, \u201cproductive functions [and] cultural values, including recreation and conservation values\u201d (Soy-Massoni, 2016b). Some studies thus develop an approach to how stakeholder perceive ecosystem services and biodiversity: for instance Sagie and Orenstein (2022) conclude, in the case of Mount Carmel Biosphere Reserve, that ecosystem services are considered overall \u201cas an empirical tool to influence decision-makers (instrumental), as a support tool to advance plans/actions/policies/initiatives that they are already advancing (strategic) and mostly as an effective rhetorical to raise public awareness (conceptual)\u201d.

This has led not only to a separation between nature and culture in policies, but also between science and humanities in the study and management of natural and cultural values, affecting the conservation of cultural heritage as well as the natural heritage\u201d (UNESCO-SCBD, 2014). Indeed, literature considered in this report generally suggests a sensible gap between landscape management at the local level, and policies which have an impact on both at national and international \u2013 and especially EU \u2013 level. On the one hand landscape management is generally considered as an opportunity for landscapes conservation and/or sustainable development. While as evoked in par. 3.1 it may be framed by specific principles and guidelines, labels and programmes are often presented as best practices that may be replicated elsewhere (Samuels, 2017; Osipova, 2014; Salizzoni, 2016). On the other hand, landscapes may not be sustained by \u201ca set of visions and more concrete objectives for protection and change, a number of strategic projects which are more or less comprehensively described, and a spatial outline to which the objectives and projects refer\u201d, for instance, Pedroli et al. (2016) observe the implementation of such landscape strategies in the two Northern Europe cases they analyse, but not in Portuguese case of Serpa olive groves. Based upon a systematic literature review and following expert discussions, Sayer et al. (2013) develop \u201cten principles for a landscape approach to reconciling agriculture, conservation, and other competing land uses\u201d. Policies evolve as much as landscapes themselves, moreover, several policy sectors affect landscapes in various ways. At the EU level, Pedroli et al. (2016) identify \u201ctwo policy agendas affecting European landscape\u201d: THE SUSTAINABILITY AGENDA has become an important policy agenda involving a large number of high-level policymakers in the public debate. It has grown steadily in terms of the number of issues covered and the significance of the competence. Objectives and regulations are often filtered down through the various levels becoming more and more landscape specific at the low levels. THE MARKET AGENDA, on the other hand, is highly centralised and most policy decisions are now high-level decisions, usually made at the EU level or in countries outside the EU, but in both cases increasingly compliant with WTO regulations. This agenda is characterised by de-regulation and expanding markets, leaving few competences to local or regional bodies. Agricultural and land market policies are now decided at the EU level for most of Europe. Consequently, the integration of environmental and societal concerns into the market policy agenda can only take place at the higher levels even though the European Treaty prescribes that policy integration must be ensured. Thus, highly globalised technologies and market forces are becoming increasingly influential and the local farmer and the local community are losing autonomy. The most relevant feature of the \u201cmarket agenda\u201d is the Common Agricultural Policy, generally considered to have sustained intensification of agriculture in Southern Europe \u2013 the membership process of Croatia and the consequent application of the Policy is thus considered by Kale (2016) as \u201cthe second most important modern motion after post-feudal agrarian reforms\u201d \u2013, contributing also to a failure of the EU biodiversity strategy and of the Natura 2000 scheme (Palac\u00edn & Alonso, 2018), which themselves constitute prominent element THE MULTIPLE VALUES OF CULTURAL LANDSCAPES 15 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL of what Pedroli et al.

Furthermore, Agnoletti and Emanueli (2016) argue that if \u201cpolicies are devoted to the conservation of biodiversity and cultural heritage, [they are] rarely focused on the result of interactions between nature and culture expressed by the rural landscape\u201d. \u201cGreening measures\u201d introduced by the 2014 reform of CAP, which include rules on maintaining permanent grassland, crop diversification and Ecological Focus Areas (EFAs), have instead been acknowledged and their potential highlighted by Tzilivakis et al.

Regarding the broader international level, although it considers the Intergovernmental Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services\u2019 role for heritage rather than for cultural landscapes more specifically, Bridgewater\u2019s (2017) statement that \u201cexamining issues raised in assessments through the prism of heritage can help modify the utilitarian approaches and view of biodiversity and ecosystem services, enriching and humanising the IPBES outputs\u201d is significant.

Focusing instead on heritage professionals\u2019 perspectives on climate change, a similar reflection is proposed by Sesana et al. (2018). Many authors suggest, like Plieninger et al. (2021) about the dehesa system, that \u201cplenty of management and policy responses are available, but [that] there is a need to move from single-topic to cross sectorial, landscape-level approaches (Metzger et al., 2021). The dehesa system depends on measures and grants that fit the complexity of their biodiversity and ecosystem services values. Such policy responses should also take landowner and farmer perceptions, willingness, and capacity to innovate or to adopt measures for dehesa conservation into consideration. At the same time, the dehesa has become important for cultural identification and nature conservation, including the values and demands of a wider, more distant, and more urbanized society\u201d. Local practices, research and policies at regional, national and international levels may still be brought to a closer dialogue, and secure a more decisive role for cultural landscapes at the outset of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration.

It has been identified as a biodiversity hotspot (Myers et al., 2000) and, as remarked in the Introduction to the Mediterranean strategy for sustainable development 2016\u20132025, \u201cwith its rich history and exceptional natural and cultural landscapes, its coasts accounted for 31 per cent of global tourist arrivals in 2011\u201d (UNEP/MAP, 2016). As illustrated in this report, many publications consider the Mediterranean scale, either as the broader context for case-studies or as the scale for typological or comparison analysis, focused for instance on landscapes characterized by a specific dominant feature like tree-crops (mainly olives, chestnuts, cork oaks and almonds). Indeed, \u201clong-established Mediterranean land management practices have created a socioecological system with an extraordinary wealth of actors, practices, biodiversity, and ecosystem services, a system that has raised European and global conservation interest\u201d (Plieninger et al., 2021). As for policies with a relevant im- pact \u2013 be it intended or not \u2013 on landscapes, they may be developed, implemented and assessed in a coherent way among the EU countries on its northern shore. \u201cThe physical configuration of the Mediterranean structures, the flow of people, plants, animals, objects and ideas in specific directions, with important effects over both the short and long term\u201d.

They constitute an important landscape in the Mediterranean region, but have long been studied both by social and natural scientists from different perspectives. Several NGOs working on building awareness and knowledge of cultural landscapes in the Mediterranean region have bundled their forces and formed the Alliance for Mediterranean Nature & Culture (AMNC) in 2021. The focus is on strengthening the knowledge on the economic, social, cultural and environmental benefits of cultural landscapes and advocating for international recognition of cultural landscapes. This report tries to combine the existing literature dealing with the environmental and socio-cultural aspects of cultural landscapes, focusing on the Mediterranean region. An interactive map was created to visualize the distribution of the cited landscapes. Literature was found for a total of 70 cultural landscapes, including 8 cultural landscapes that form part of the AMNC. Publications issued before 2000 were not considered, nor gray literature (with few exceptions), and the scope was limited by the exclusive use of publications in English. The Mediterranean region has many models to offer for sustainable land-use management. It is not only a biodiversity hotspot, but also has a rich history of cultural landscapes. Many of these landscapes are characterized by a specific dominant feature like tree-crops (mainly olives, chestnuts, cork oaks and almonds). The traditional land management practices have created a socio-ecological system beneficial for people and the environment and important to protect at a European and global scale. Executive summary V ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL IUCN-Med would like to thank the partners of the Alliance for Mediterranean Nature & Culture for their valuable expertise and insights. This report would not have been possible without their continuing work and focus on the cultural landscapes situated in the Mediterranean region.

Introduction Kapikiri village and Latmos Besparmak Mountains, Aegean region of Turkey \u00a9 Serturvetan on Dreamstime 2 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL INTRODUCTION At the European level, the relationship between landscapes and biodiversity and other benefits is merely implicit in the European Landscape Convention of 2000, which defines its object as \u201can area, as perceived by people, whose character is the result of the action and interaction of natural and/or human factors\u201d and \u201clandscape protection\u201d as \u201cactions to conserve and maintain the significant or characteristic features of a landscape, justified by its heritage value derived from its natural configuration and/or from human activity\u201d (Seardo, 2016). On the other hand, despite the Natura 2000 framework\u2019s focus on biodiversity, the Habitats Directive foresees that \u201cMember States shall endeavour, where they consider it necessary, in their land-use planning and development policies and, in particular, with a view to improving the ecological coherence of the Natura network, to encourage the management of features of the landscape which are of major importance for wild fauna and flora\u201d (Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora, consolidated text, art. 10). Still focusing on the European level, the Florence Declaration promoted by UNESCO and the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity might be the document that offers the most comprehensive, and in a sense up-to-date \u2013 at least with the literature included in this report \u2013 view on cultural landscapes. \u201cAs it assimilates economic, social, cultural and environmental processes in time and space, the European landscape is predominantly a biocultural multifunctional landscape. As such, it provides a crucial and effective space for integration of biological and cultural diversity for human well-being, including in the context of rural territories [\u2026]\u201d (UNESCO-SCBD, 2014; Agnoletti and Emanueli, 2016). Still, cultural landscapes are not explicitly considered within the Agenda 2030 (although SDG target 11.4 \u201cStrengthen efforts to protect and safeguard the world\u2019s cultural and natural heritage\u201d), nor in documents related to the Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021\u20132030) (FAO & UNEP, 2022). Considering the essential relationships between cultural landscapes, sustainable development and ecosystems, highlighted within UNESCO programmes such as World Heritage and Man and the Biosphere but also in FAO\u2019s GIAHS, there seems to be room for further integration of the concept within the United Nations\u2019 standards and strategies. 1.2. Cultural landscapes, ecosystem services and biodiversity: outlining a growing research field Cultural landscapes in the Mediterranean have long been studied both by social and natural scientists, although from different perspectives and approaches \u2013 and following different definitions of the concept. As elsewhere, the introduction of the concept of ecosystem services, especially through the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment international research project (or MA, concluded in 2005), has prompted further research and cross- disciplinary dialogue. Still, research exploring relationships between landscapes and ecosystems rather than focusing on one or the other dimension, thus involving at once humanities, social and natural sciences, seems relatively limited. While it might be said that landscapes host or correspond to ecosystems, the former characterized by a significant cultural dimension, which in turn has been recognized in terms of ecosystem services. Cultural Ecosystem Services, defined by the MA as \u2018nonmaterial benefits people obtain from ecosystems through spiritual enrichment, cognitive development, reflection, recreation, and aesthetic experiences\u2019, have been dedicated a vast amount of literature on their own \u2013 often dealing with the issue of how to quantify them with respect to the other Ecosystem Services categories (Blicharska et al., 2017; Daniel et al., 2012; H\u00f8lleland et al., 2017; Paracchini et al., 2014; Plieninger et al., 2014; Smith & Ram, 2017; Scholte et al., 2015; Winthrop, 2014).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "13c289ca-bf1c-48b3-a7c1-1bff1c355a98": {"__data__": {"id_": "13c289ca-bf1c-48b3-a7c1-1bff1c355a98", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/economic-impact-plastic-pollution-grenada", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The economic impact of plastic pollution in Grenada", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/economic-impact-plastic-pollution-grenada", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d036ded5fc3413ffe2205f768ad67ef4a7d8dc3d96e9fc1cf18eeea26a8e111f"}, "2": {"node_id": "520c1865-3478-4ff0-82ac-200626a7fde5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/economic-impact-plastic-pollution-grenada", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "26f0bc8307a188cef0cc2946471085a878f78d1133b4b9f793dfd3fb1a5d3cc5"}}, "hash": "b2c5dbcf360e707c3c389c0e36421bce8913e47e87ff498d8e85acba5649a33e", "text": "3 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL INTRODUCTION Focusing on landscape management in relationship to ecosystem services, Setten et al. (2012) identify the three following challenges: A lack of compatibility between the framework and the inherent character, or the logics of landscapes. Difficulties arise in addressing the complexity of ecosystems, unsubstitutable values, and intangible dimensions in economic valuation when applied to landscapes. The Ecosystem Services framework to a large degree falls short in understanding how context-specific sociocultural processes are crucial to environmental attitudes and behaviours.

A glance at the amount of literature produced over the last decade suggests that although much has been done in that sense, the plea is more relevant than ever. Answering this plea is the Alliance for Mediterranean Nature and Culture (AMNC), a partnership between several NGOs working on building awareness and knowledge of cultural landscapes. Joining forces in 2021, the partners of AMNC share the vision of a Mediterranean region where cultural landscapes contribute effectively to conserving both biodiversity and maintaining the well-being of communities. The focus in their project sites, ranging from mountain ranges to lowland areas and islands, is on the economic, social, cultural and environmental processes of cultural landscapes. This partnership works on strengthening awareness and understanding of cultural landscapes and advocates for the international recognition of their benefits by scaling up its membership and impact. METHODOLOGY 4 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL This report seeks to account for existing literature dealing at least partially with the issues mentioned above, focusing on the Mediterranean area. Beside a significant number of literature reviews (Blicharska et al., 2017; Cicinelli et al., 2021; Daniel et al., 2012; H\u00f8lleland et al., 2017; Mart\u00edn-L\u00f3pez et al., 2016; Orr et al., 2021; Picchi et al., 2019; Sayer et al., 2013; Vall\u00e9s-Planells et al., 2014), many publications provide case analyses from virtually all parts of the world. A map was presented to visualize the distribution of those landscapes in the Mediterranean area (Figure 1). The cultural landscapes of the Alliance for Mediterranean Nature and Culture (AMNC) are separated. An interactive map, with more in-depth information on each landscape is available online. The sections have been elaborated following AMNC\u2019s objectives on the one hand, and seeking for thematic coherence among references on the other. References selected and used in this report include both types of publications, retrieved from the main academic journal portals including Web of Science, Scopus and through cross-reference. The initial survey of publications on \u201clandscape + benefits\u201d, \u201clandscape + ecosystem\u201d and \u201clandscape + biodiversity\u201d was completed with specific search for publications dealing with cultural landscapes identified as such within UNESCO World Heritage programme, FAO\u2019s GIAHS or other programmes (see further, par. \u201cLandscape typologies/patterns\u201d). The use of the most cited literature reviews and conceptual papers has thus provided the background for a wider overview of case analyses, including a wide array of the various areas of the Mediterranean and landscape typologies, as well as of different approaches and methodologies. 2.

As for the latter type of publication, the survey has been focused on cases situated in the Mediterranean area and corresponding to the three broad typologies represented among AMNC project areas (listed below between parentheses), several of which also appear in one or more publications included in the bibliography: Mountain/high altitude sites characterised by traditional farming, grazing, agrofor- estry and water management practices (the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco, the Al-Shouf Biosphere Reserve, West Bekaa and Mount Lebanon in Lebanon, and the Taurus mountains in Central and Southern Anatolia, Turkey). Traditional agro-silvo-pastoral systems in lowland areas (the corridor with dehe- sas/montados stretching from Extremadura and C\u00f3rdoba, Spain, to Coruche in Santar\u00e9m, Portugal, and Kroumirie Mogod in North-western Tunisia). Island sites characterised by a mosaic of traditional farming, livestock breeding and water management (the islands of Lemnos, Greece and Menorca, Spain). Further selection has been operated in order to avoid redundancy both in terms of case studies, authors, topics and approaches.

Accounting for Mediterranean cultural landscapes and their benefits for the environment and communities through existing literature thus raises several difficulties, briefly discussed in the following paragraphs in order to introduce and comment the landscapes list (Figure 1): Different definitions of landscape typologies and/or units are used and/or provided. Various methods have been developed to analyse landscape change, which suggest a cautious approach to causalities. Fewer studies provide a comprehensive analysis of benefits provided by cultural landscapes. While many publications assess how policies at various levels affect cultural landscapes and related benefits, only few attempts to analyse and contextualize such policies. 3.

Each of the following works according to its own principles and guidelines, but all share a rather comprehensive view of (cultural) landscapes and include one or more sites in the Mediterranean area: UNESCO MAB reserves UNESCO World Heritage properties (including \u2018cultural landscapes\u2019) FAO GIAHS Natura 2000 National and Regional Parks (in turn often part of EUROPARC network) High Nature Value Farming systems (included in the data set based on the JRC/EEA methodology, introduced by Paracchini et al.

It should be noted that such labels and programmes (see the dedicated column in online map) may be either cited as an element of the studied landscape\u2019s setting, or considered for their own sake within the case analyses (see for instance Mathevet & Cibien, 2020; Torralba et al., 2020; Lafrenz Samuels, 2017 and Osipova et al., 2014 on World Heritage sites). Several of the labels and programmes mentioned above may apply at least partially to the same landscape. Similarly, a few landscape units and typologies concentrate a large amount of literature, like dehesas/montados and terraced landscapes. Much less knowledge is available, at least in English, on many other landscapes, like Slow Food Presidia or PPI-OSCAN project areas not included in Figure 1 because of the lack of dedicated scientific literature \u2013 not to mention areas which may not be labelled or included in programmes such as the above \u2013.

Changing landscapes: drivers and scenarios In a significant attempt to analyse and systematize \u201cdriving forces of landscape change\u201d (B\u00fcrgi et al., 2004), identified four major challenges to that aim: \u201cstudying processes and not merely spatial patterns, extrapolating results in space and time, linking data of different qualities, and considering culture as a driver of landscape change\u201d. Their method thus implied the following tasks: While such a systematic approach to landscape change is not always developed in case studies cited in this report, the concept of landscape-change drivers itself has been further discussed and put into perspective. For instance, Plieninger et al. (2021) propose an approach along more coordinates, including, in addition to \u201cdrivers\u201d themselves, \u201cpressures\u201d, \u201cstate\u201d, \u201cimpacts\u201d and \u201cresponses\u201d. Resuming results from B\u00fcrgi et al. (2004), Wolpert et al. (2020) highlight that \u201cdriving forces mostly appear in bundles and interdependencies across natural, political technological, socio-cultural and economic factors, calling for a multi-sectorial and holistic approach to landscape management\u201d.

Rather than through their physical features and associated practices, or by their either \u201ctraditional\u201d or \u201cabandoned\u201d state (Frattaroli et al., 2014), landscapes have been increasingly characterised in terms of \u201cscenarios\u201d, \u201ctrajectories\u201d, \u201cpatterns\u201d, or \u201cprocesses\u201d. This latter term is used by Wolpert et al. (2020), who identify the following among the three types of tree-crop Mediterranean landscapes they analyse: EXPANSION A tree-crop landscape that is flourishing and growing in its extent as well as in its importance for human use CONTINUITY A landscape that is not significantly changing but rather remaining in the same state over a period of time. The tree crop is either still one of many trees or already enjoys a certain level of importance, depending on the landscape POLARISATION Concurrent processes of abandonment on less fertile, steeper places as well as intensification on fertile zones ABANDONMENT A tree-crop landscape that is undergoing a process of decreasing inputs as well as outputs INTENSIFICATION A tree-crop landscape whose management has resulted in an increased yield per area.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ce994216-5ab4-450a-bfb7-e1b18871b73b": {"__data__": {"id_": "ce994216-5ab4-450a-bfb7-e1b18871b73b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/economic-impact-plastic-pollution-grenada", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The economic impact of plastic pollution in Grenada", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/economic-impact-plastic-pollution-grenada", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ed61c6b173cbf439197c5ef4e4180d1d9056f27a6963311400367298ed124c50"}, "2": {"node_id": "10bdcc12-4337-4912-a646-505de42cb9b0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/economic-impact-plastic-pollution-grenada", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7cdae7920dd4f756f01a8b0dce62ddd1bba4ca426e38976b65fd7ac58edbc639"}}, "hash": "c046723388f3783e2c69abcfefa41d3d5d0ecee4f125f135b95c44fdd60a86ec", "text": "This often but does not necessarily coincide with an intensified use of industrial inputs, such as machinery and agrochemicals RENAISSANCE The process of returning to expansion following a phase of abandonment, intensification or polarisation Such processes can be confronted for instance with the \u201cscenario\u201d identified by Felipe-Lucia et al., (2022), i.e. \u201ccurrent situation\u201d, \u201cconservation and active ecological restoration\u201d, \u201cintensive agriculture\u201d, \u201cconservation and agricultural production\u201d, and \u201crural abandonment\u201d.

Similarly, Agnoletti et al. (2011, 2019) show that terraced landscapes abandoned for a long time provide more ecosystem services and biodiversity than those abandoned more recently. Other studies highlight patterns of change differing from those observed at the Mediterranean, national or regional scale, like (Salvati et al., 2016) on reforestation. THE MULTIPLE VALUES OF CULTURAL LANDSCAPES 11 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL 3.3. Which benefits? Climate change impacts vs. ecosystem services, biodiversity and well-being During the session on \u2018Traditional agricultural landscapes and community conserved areas\u2019 at the International Congress on Ethnobiology of 2011, it was stated that \u201cthese [traditional agricultural landscapes] are rich in agro- biodiversity values as well as inherent wild biodiversity and cultural values, and encompass holistic knowledge and collective management systems and complex institutions of customary law. They play a vital role in ensuring resilience, ecosystem function, and livelihood and food sovereignty. Inextricably linked to the material values of these landscapes are their spiritual and cultural values. These special landscapes offer us beauty and a palpable sense of place. They are living landscapes worth living in\u201d (presented in Brown & Kothari, 2011). Still, it may be argued that there is an overall focus on drivers of landscape change \u2013 and often on the consecutive loss of ecosystem services, biodiversity and well-being \u2013 rather than on an effective assessment of the benefits provided by landscapes themselves. Beside sophisticated mapping and modelling exercises registering land-use change (Perpi\u00f1a Castillo et al., 2021; van Vliet et al., 2015) or bioclimatic evolution (Savo et al., 2016) or dating man-made structures (Turner et al., 2018) with a significant level of detail, benefits provided by landscapes are not always assessed in such a comprehensive and dynamic way. Instead, when they are not merely described, benefits are assessed singularly, i.e. in terms either of a single class of ecosystem services (Arslan & Kaymaz, 2020; Howlett et al., 2011; Paracchini et al., 2014; Picchi et al., 2019, the latter dealing with the relationship between renewable energy and ecosystem services for landscape planning and design), or of biodiversity (Atik et al., 2012; Bassols Isamat et al., 2011; Dudley & Stolton, 2012; Manenti, 2014; Santoro et al., 2020; Saadaoui et al., 2018).

Finally, S\u00f8rensen et al. (2021) inquire into Montados\u2019 cork value chain, suggesting \u201cpotential leverage points for sustainability in the landscape of origin, which could eventually bring a positive trickle-effect of benefits for the whole sector\u201d. The question of ecosystem services\u2019 management \u201ccosts\u201d is tackled by Campos et al. (2021) in the national context of Portugal and by Rocchi et al. (2019) in the case of Natura 2000 sites in Umbria, Italy, suggesting that they are significantly lower than related benefits (see also Shirvani Dastgerdi (2020) still in the context of Central Italy, Dimopoulos et al. (2017) on the Greek context, Flinzberger et al. (2020) on agroforestry labels in the Mediterranean area). Indeed, recent studies emphasize the opportunity to consider benefit \u2018bundles\u2019 (Meacham et al., 2022) or \u2018baskets\u2019 (Morgan et al., 2022), or landscapes\u2019 \u2018multifunctionality\u2019, the latter consisting in \u2018the capacity of a landscape to simultaneously support multiple benefits to society from its interacting ecosystems\u2019 (Mastrangelo et al., 2014). Such capacity relies as much upon to landscapes\u2019\u2019 management and local practices (especially in terms of land use, see Crouzat et al., 2015), as upon \u201clandscape features, most notably a mosaic of land uses, scattered tree cover, low-intensity livestock grazing, rich landscape structure, and unfragmented ecosystems, underpin the biodiversity and ecosystem services values\u201d (Plieninger et al., 2021, in the case of the dehesa system). On the other hand, multifunctionality also requires a realistic approach, as suggested by Pedroli et al. (2016), inasmuch as \u201cthe demand for multifunctionality has also overwhelmed agriculture as many of the functions that society expects today from rural areas cannot be provided by a single farm or managed by individual farmers\u201d, whilst \u2013 the same authors argue \u2013 \u201cthe polarising trends affecting European rural landscapes [have led] to a segregation of agricultural production landscapes and high-priority nature reserves\u201d. Similarly, Torquati et al. (2015), analysing \u201cTraditional Cultural Vineyard Landscapes\u201d in Italy in terms of wine farms\u2019 economic performance, suggest that \u201cthe key issue is not the contrast between those who support the costs of landscape preservation (vineyard owners) and those who reap its benefits (the community as a whole), but rather in the way in which the added value resulting from preservation of the landscape is being obtained and distributed\u201d. THE MULTIPLE VALUES OF CULTURAL LANDSCAPES 13 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL Following the brief discussion initiated in par. 3.2, it may be argued that a clear distinction between \u201cchallenges\u201d or \u201cthreats\u201d and \u201cbenefits\u201d is not always easy, both because of the complexity of landscape processes through time, which imply \u201ccontrasts and contingencies\u201d at various scales (Bevan & Conolly, 2013), and because of differing perceptions and potentially conflicting expectations regarding especially, but not exclusively, \u201cproductive functions [and] cultural values, including recreation and conservation values\u201d (Soy-Massoni, 2016b). Some studies thus develop an approach to how stakeholder perceive ecosystem services and biodiversity: for instance Sagie and Orenstein (2022) conclude, in the case of Mount Carmel Biosphere Reserve, that ecosystem services are considered overall \u201cas an empirical tool to influence decision-makers (instrumental), as a support tool to advance plans/actions/policies/initiatives that they are already advancing (strategic) and mostly as an effective rhetorical to raise public awareness (conceptual)\u201d.

This has led not only to a separation between nature and culture in policies, but also between science and humanities in the study and management of natural and cultural values, affecting the conservation of cultural heritage as well as the natural heritage\u201d (UNESCO-SCBD, 2014). Indeed, literature considered in this report generally suggests a sensible gap between landscape management at the local level, and policies which have an impact on both at national and international \u2013 and especially EU \u2013 level. On the one hand landscape management is generally considered as an opportunity for landscapes conservation and/or sustainable development. While as evoked in par. 3.1 it may be framed by specific principles and guidelines, labels and programmes are often presented as best practices that may be replicated elsewhere (Samuels, 2017; Osipova, 2014; Salizzoni, 2016). On the other hand, landscapes may not be sustained by \u201ca set of visions and more concrete objectives for protection and change, a number of strategic projects which are more or less comprehensively described, and a spatial outline to which the objectives and projects refer\u201d, for instance, Pedroli et al. (2016) observe the implementation of such landscape strategies in the two Northern Europe cases they analyse, but not in Portuguese case of Serpa olive groves. Based upon a systematic literature review and following expert discussions, Sayer et al. (2013) develop \u201cten principles for a landscape approach to reconciling agriculture, conservation, and other competing land uses\u201d. Policies evolve as much as landscapes themselves, moreover, several policy sectors affect landscapes in various ways. At the EU level, Pedroli et al. (2016) identify \u201ctwo policy agendas affecting European landscape\u201d: THE SUSTAINABILITY AGENDA has become an important policy agenda involving a large number of high-level policymakers in the public debate. It has grown steadily in terms of the number of issues covered and the significance of the competence. Objectives and regulations are often filtered down through the various levels becoming more and more landscape specific at the low levels. THE MARKET AGENDA, on the other hand, is highly centralised and most policy decisions are now high-level decisions, usually made at the EU level or in countries outside the EU, but in both cases increasingly compliant with WTO regulations. This agenda is characterised by de-regulation and expanding markets, leaving few competences to local or regional bodies. Agricultural and land market policies are now decided at the EU level for most of Europe. Consequently, the integration of environmental and societal concerns into the market policy agenda can only take place at the higher levels even though the European Treaty prescribes that policy integration must be ensured. Thus, highly globalised technologies and market forces are becoming increasingly influential and the local farmer and the local community are losing autonomy. The most relevant feature of the \u201cmarket agenda\u201d is the Common Agricultural Policy, generally considered to have sustained intensification of agriculture in Southern Europe \u2013 the membership process of Croatia and the consequent application of the Policy is thus considered by Kale (2016) as \u201cthe second most important modern motion after post-feudal agrarian reforms\u201d \u2013, contributing also to a failure of the EU biodiversity strategy and of the Natura 2000 scheme (Palac\u00edn & Alonso, 2018), which themselves constitute prominent element THE MULTIPLE VALUES OF CULTURAL LANDSCAPES 15 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL of what Pedroli et al.

Regarding the broader international level, although it considers the Intergovernmental Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services\u2019 role for heritage rather than for cultural landscapes more specifically, Bridgewater\u2019s (2017) statement that \u201cexamining issues raised in assessments through the prism of heritage can help modify the utilitarian approaches and view of biodiversity and ecosystem services, enriching and humanising the IPBES outputs\u201d is significant. In that way \u2013 writes the same author \u2013 \u201cheritage issues can be effectively portrayed in IPBES outputs, then that process, in turn, will ensure IPBES outcomes reflect, and have positive impacts on, heritage practice and communication\u201d. Focusing instead on heritage professionals\u2019 perspectives on climate change, a similar reflection is proposed by Sesana et al. (2018). Many authors suggest, like Plieninger et al. (2021) about the dehesa system, that \u201cplenty of management and policy responses are available, but [that] there is a need to move from single-topic to cross sectorial, landscape-level approaches (Metzger et al., 2021). The dehesa system depends on measures and grants that fit the complexity of their biodiversity and ecosystem services values. Such policy responses should also take landowner and farmer perceptions, willingness, and capacity to innovate or to adopt measures for dehesa conservation into consideration. At the same time, the dehesa has become important for cultural identification and nature conservation, including the values and demands of a wider, more distant, and more urbanized society\u201d. Local practices, research and policies at regional, national and international levels may still be brought to a closer dialogue, and secure a more decisive role for cultural landscapes at the outset of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. THE MEDITERRANEAN AS A UNIQUE GROUND FOR MAINSTREAMING PRACTICES, RESEARCH AND POLICIES 16 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL \u201cIf the Mediterranean region is a microcosm of the world\u2019s problems, it also has many models to offer for sus- tainable development and human well-being in a beautiful and biologically diverse environment\u201d (Blondel, 2010). It has been identified as a biodiversity hotspot (Myers et al., 2000) and, as remarked in the Introduction to the Mediterranean strategy for sustainable development 2016\u20132025, \u201cwith its rich history and exceptional natural and cultural landscapes, its coasts accounted for 31 per cent of global tourist arrivals in 2011\u201d (UNEP/MAP, 2016). As illustrated in this report, many publications consider the Mediterranean scale, either as the broader context for case-studies or as the scale for typological or comparison analysis, focused for instance on landscapes characterized by a specific dominant feature like tree-crops (mainly olives, chestnuts, cork oaks and almonds). Indeed, \u201clong-established Mediterranean land management practices have created a socioecological system with an extraordinary wealth of actors, practices, biodiversity, and ecosystem services, a system that has raised European and global conservation interest\u201d (Plieninger et al., 2021). As for policies with a relevant im- pact \u2013 be it intended or not \u2013 on landscapes, they may be developed, implemented and assessed in a coherent way among the EU countries on its northern shore. \u201cThe physical configuration of the Mediterranean structures, the flow of people, plants, animals, objects and ideas in specific directions, with important effects over both the short and long term\u201d. What Bevan and Conolly (2013) write about Antikythera, which \u201csits at one of those geographically nodal points where the resulting con- trasts and contingencies are particularly powerful\u201d, may apply to many other landscapes in the Mediterranean, which benefits for people and the environment outreach its borders. 4.

They constitute an important landscape in the Mediterranean region, but have long been studied both by social and natural scientists from different perspectives. Several NGOs working on building awareness and knowledge of cultural landscapes in the Mediterranean region have bundled their forces and formed the Alliance for Mediterranean Nature & Culture (AMNC) in 2021. The focus is on strengthening the knowledge on the economic, social, cultural and environmental benefits of cultural landscapes and advocating for international recognition of cultural landscapes. This report tries to combine the existing literature dealing with the environmental and socio-cultural aspects of cultural landscapes, focusing on the Mediterranean region. An interactive map was created to visualize the distribution of the cited landscapes. Literature was found for a total of 70 cultural landscapes, including 8 cultural landscapes that form part of the AMNC. Publications issued before 2000 were not considered, nor gray literature (with few exceptions), and the scope was limited by the exclusive use of publications in English. The Mediterranean region has many models to offer for sustainable land-use management. It is not only a biodiversity hotspot, but also has a rich history of cultural landscapes. Many of these landscapes are characterized by a specific dominant feature like tree-crops (mainly olives, chestnuts, cork oaks and almonds). The traditional land management practices have created a socio-ecological system beneficial for people and the environment and important to protect at a European and global scale. Executive summary V ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL IUCN-Med would like to thank the partners of the Alliance for Mediterranean Nature & Culture for their valuable expertise and insights.

Introduction Kapikiri village and Latmos Besparmak Mountains, Aegean region of Turkey \u00a9 Serturvetan on Dreamstime 2 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL INTRODUCTION At the European level, the relationship between landscapes and biodiversity and other benefits is merely implicit in the European Landscape Convention of 2000, which defines its object as \u201can area, as perceived by people, whose character is the result of the action and interaction of natural and/or human factors\u201d and \u201clandscape protection\u201d as \u201cactions to conserve and maintain the significant or characteristic features of a landscape, justified by its heritage value derived from its natural configuration and/or from human activity\u201d (Seardo, 2016). On the other hand, despite the Natura 2000 framework\u2019s focus on biodiversity, the Habitats Directive foresees that \u201cMember States shall endeavour, where they consider it necessary, in their land-use planning and development policies and, in particular, with a view to improving the ecological coherence of the Natura network, to encourage the management of features of the landscape which are of major importance for wild fauna and flora\u201d (Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora, consolidated text, art. 10). Still focusing on the European level, the Florence Declaration promoted by UNESCO and the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity might be the document that offers the most comprehensive, and in a sense up-to-date \u2013 at least with the literature included in this report \u2013 view on cultural landscapes. \u201cAs it assimilates economic, social, cultural and environmental processes in time and space, the European landscape is predominantly a biocultural multifunctional landscape. As such, it provides a crucial and effective space for integration of biological and cultural diversity for human well-being, including in the context of rural territories [\u2026]\u201d (UNESCO-SCBD, 2014; Agnoletti and Emanueli, 2016). Still, cultural landscapes are not explicitly considered within the Agenda 2030 (although SDG target 11.4 \u201cStrengthen efforts to protect and safeguard the world\u2019s cultural and natural heritage\u201d), nor in documents related to the Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021\u20132030) (FAO & UNEP, 2022). Considering the essential relationships between cultural landscapes, sustainable development and ecosystems, highlighted within UNESCO programmes such as World Heritage and Man and the Biosphere but also in FAO\u2019s GIAHS, there seems to be room for further integration of the concept within the United Nations\u2019 standards and strategies. 1.2. Cultural landscapes, ecosystem services and biodiversity: outlining a growing research field Cultural landscapes in the Mediterranean have long been studied both by social and natural scientists, although from different perspectives and approaches \u2013 and following different definitions of the concept. As elsewhere, the introduction of the concept of ecosystem services, especially through the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment international research project (or MA, concluded in 2005), has prompted further research and cross- disciplinary dialogue. Still, research exploring relationships between landscapes and ecosystems rather than focusing on one or the other dimension, thus involving at once humanities, social and natural sciences, seems relatively limited. While it might be said that landscapes host or correspond to ecosystems, the former characterized by a significant cultural dimension, which in turn has been recognized in terms of ecosystem services. Cultural Ecosystem Services, defined by the MA as \u2018nonmaterial benefits people obtain from ecosystems through spiritual enrichment, cognitive development, reflection, recreation, and aesthetic experiences\u2019, have been dedicated a vast amount of literature on their own \u2013 often dealing with the issue of how to quantify them with respect to the other Ecosystem Services categories (Blicharska et al., 2017; Daniel et al., 2012; H\u00f8lleland et al., 2017; Paracchini et al., 2014; Plieninger et al., 2014; Smith & Ram, 2017; Scholte et al., 2015; Winthrop, 2014).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fae065a7-8205-4bba-957b-29f5d9311924": {"__data__": {"id_": "fae065a7-8205-4bba-957b-29f5d9311924", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/economic-impact-plastic-pollution-antigua-and-barbuda", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The economic impact of plastic pollution in Antigua and Barbuda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/economic-impact-plastic-pollution-antigua-and-barbuda", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5dfd030e33103d9b15c455cfcb91fcf1a037432a7d8edc645e8edd362e3e0361"}, "2": {"node_id": "747a9831-72be-40dc-858a-77dd1eb4d7c4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/economic-impact-plastic-pollution-antigua-and-barbuda", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a1e1d6f74d323d90333dcc40bb208b6a00090c70a28a05c1564c3e52983ae7fb"}}, "hash": "cfedbb1173a8a612d5e00f900ab2c5c114d63dc50dd9d54aecda7ba0b6610114", "text": "3 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL INTRODUCTION Focusing on landscape management in relationship to ecosystem services, Setten et al. (2012) identify the three following challenges: A lack of compatibility between the framework and the inherent character, or the logics of landscapes. Difficulties arise in addressing the complexity of ecosystems, unsubstitutable values, and intangible dimensions in economic valuation when applied to landscapes. The Ecosystem Services framework to a large degree falls short in understanding how context-specific sociocultural processes are crucial to environmental attitudes and behaviours.

A glance at the amount of literature produced over the last decade suggests that although much has been done in that sense, the plea is more relevant than ever. Answering this plea is the Alliance for Mediterranean Nature and Culture (AMNC), a partnership between several NGOs working on building awareness and knowledge of cultural landscapes. Joining forces in 2021, the partners of AMNC share the vision of a Mediterranean region where cultural landscapes contribute effectively to conserving both biodiversity and maintaining the well-being of communities. The focus in their project sites, ranging from mountain ranges to lowland areas and islands, is on the economic, social, cultural and environmental processes of cultural landscapes. This partnership works on strengthening awareness and understanding of cultural landscapes and advocates for the international recognition of their benefits by scaling up its membership and impact. METHODOLOGY 4 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL This report seeks to account for existing literature dealing at least partially with the issues mentioned above, focusing on the Mediterranean area. Beside a significant number of literature reviews (Blicharska et al., 2017; Cicinelli et al., 2021; Daniel et al., 2012; H\u00f8lleland et al., 2017; Mart\u00edn-L\u00f3pez et al., 2016; Orr et al., 2021; Picchi et al., 2019; Sayer et al., 2013; Vall\u00e9s-Planells et al., 2014), many publications provide case analyses from virtually all parts of the world. A map was presented to visualize the distribution of those landscapes in the Mediterranean area (Figure 1). The cultural landscapes of the Alliance for Mediterranean Nature and Culture (AMNC) are separated. An interactive map, with more in-depth information on each landscape is available online. The sections have been elaborated following AMNC\u2019s objectives on the one hand, and seeking for thematic coherence among references on the other. References selected and used in this report include both types of publications, retrieved from the main academic journal portals including Web of Science, Scopus and through cross-reference. The initial survey of publications on \u201clandscape + benefits\u201d, \u201clandscape + ecosystem\u201d and \u201clandscape + biodiversity\u201d was completed with specific search for publications dealing with cultural landscapes identified as such within UNESCO World Heritage programme, FAO\u2019s GIAHS or other programmes (see further, par. \u201cLandscape typologies/patterns\u201d). The use of the most cited literature reviews and conceptual papers has thus provided the background for a wider overview of case analyses, including a wide array of the various areas of the Mediterranean and landscape typologies, as well as of different approaches and methodologies. 2.

As for the latter type of publication, the survey has been focused on cases situated in the Mediterranean area and corresponding to the three broad typologies represented among AMNC project areas (listed below between parentheses), several of which also appear in one or more publications included in the bibliography: Mountain/high altitude sites characterised by traditional farming, grazing, agrofor- estry and water management practices (the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco, the Al-Shouf Biosphere Reserve, West Bekaa and Mount Lebanon in Lebanon, and the Taurus mountains in Central and Southern Anatolia, Turkey). Traditional agro-silvo-pastoral systems in lowland areas (the corridor with dehe- sas/montados stretching from Extremadura and C\u00f3rdoba, Spain, to Coruche in Santar\u00e9m, Portugal, and Kroumirie Mogod in North-western Tunisia). Island sites characterised by a mosaic of traditional farming, livestock breeding and water management (the islands of Lemnos, Greece and Menorca, Spain). Further selection has been operated in order to avoid redundancy both in terms of case studies, authors, topics and approaches. In case of similar contributions in one or more of those terms, only the most cited and/or recent paper was included in the bibliography.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6d2c1302-a201-4242-a359-3bb948b53564": {"__data__": {"id_": "6d2c1302-a201-4242-a359-3bb948b53564", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/economic-impact-plastic-pollution-antigua-and-barbuda", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The economic impact of plastic pollution in Antigua and Barbuda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/economic-impact-plastic-pollution-antigua-and-barbuda", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9ccb835c006e0b1c1ba9944b7ec448ee05f8e0cd448f4adc9bd378bcd4ac505a"}, "2": {"node_id": "1a750538-1bc7-480e-a328-b687c141e04e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/economic-impact-plastic-pollution-antigua-and-barbuda", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6d70156dc8fc898d6c7ec3659e08c49b3676ddb9f07c5a6fc8e8a7120f15bfff"}}, "hash": "f01706c362f96ddc2728ff37e90a74a04c8df4860c6a08c630ac8fe17d0a6de3", "text": "Publications issued before 2000 were not considered, nor grey literature (with few exceptions).

Accounting for Mediterranean cultural landscapes and their benefits for the environment and communities through existing literature thus raises several difficulties, briefly discussed in the following paragraphs in order to introduce and comment the landscapes list (Figure 1): Different definitions of landscape typologies and/or units are used and/or provided. Various methods have been developed to analyse landscape change, which suggest a cautious approach to causalities. Fewer studies provide a comprehensive analysis of benefits provided by cultural landscapes. While many publications assess how policies at various levels affect cultural landscapes and related benefits, only few attempts to analyse and contextualize such policies. 3.

Each of the following works according to its own principles and guidelines, but all share a rather comprehensive view of (cultural) landscapes and include one or more sites in the Mediterranean area: UNESCO MAB reserves UNESCO World Heritage properties (including \u2018cultural landscapes\u2019) FAO GIAHS Natura 2000 National and Regional Parks (in turn often part of EUROPARC network) High Nature Value Farming systems (included in the data set based on the JRC/EEA methodology, introduced by Paracchini et al.

Several of the labels and programmes mentioned above may apply at least partially to the same landscape. Similarly, a few landscape units and typologies concentrate a large amount of literature, like dehesas/montados and terraced landscapes. Much less knowledge is available, at least in English, on many other landscapes, like Slow Food Presidia or PPI-OSCAN project areas not included in Figure 1 because of the lack of dedicated scientific literature \u2013 not to mention areas which may not be labelled or included in programmes such as the above \u2013.

Changing landscapes: drivers and scenarios In a significant attempt to analyse and systematize \u201cdriving forces of landscape change\u201d (B\u00fcrgi et al., 2004), identified four major challenges to that aim: \u201cstudying processes and not merely spatial patterns, extrapolating results in space and time, linking data of different qualities, and considering culture as a driver of landscape change\u201d. Their method thus implied the following tasks: While such a systematic approach to landscape change is not always developed in case studies cited in this report, the concept of landscape-change drivers itself has been further discussed and put into perspective. For instance, Plieninger et al. (2021) propose an approach along more coordinates, including, in addition to \u201cdrivers\u201d themselves, \u201cpressures\u201d, \u201cstate\u201d, \u201cimpacts\u201d and \u201cresponses\u201d. Resuming results from B\u00fcrgi et al. (2004), Wolpert et al. (2020) highlight that \u201cdriving forces mostly appear in bundles and interdependencies across natural, political technological, socio-cultural and economic factors, calling for a multi-sectorial and holistic approach to landscape management\u201d.

Rather than through their physical features and associated practices, or by their either \u201ctraditional\u201d or \u201cabandoned\u201d state (Frattaroli et al., 2014), landscapes have been increasingly characterised in terms of \u201cscenarios\u201d, \u201ctrajectories\u201d, \u201cpatterns\u201d, or \u201cprocesses\u201d. This latter term is used by Wolpert et al. (2020), who identify the following among the three types of tree-crop Mediterranean landscapes they analyse: EXPANSION A tree-crop landscape that is flourishing and growing in its extent as well as in its importance for human use CONTINUITY A landscape that is not significantly changing but rather remaining in the same state over a period of time. The tree crop is either still one of many trees or already enjoys a certain level of importance, depending on the landscape POLARISATION Concurrent processes of abandonment on less fertile, steeper places as well as intensification on fertile zones ABANDONMENT A tree-crop landscape that is undergoing a process of decreasing inputs as well as outputs INTENSIFICATION A tree-crop landscape whose management has resulted in an increased yield per area.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b061bc2a-7ee2-42bb-94a9-a26e6f04dc26": {"__data__": {"id_": "b061bc2a-7ee2-42bb-94a9-a26e6f04dc26", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/economic-impact-plastic-pollution-antigua-and-barbuda", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The economic impact of plastic pollution in Antigua and Barbuda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/economic-impact-plastic-pollution-antigua-and-barbuda", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bc2d6ca39a1eabf6fdf07bcb11827c2f3bcbba9c46bf0bcc5f71ec54ce084a7d"}, "2": {"node_id": "4f3843d4-3155-4c62-93af-80c6222c6613", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/economic-impact-plastic-pollution-antigua-and-barbuda", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "76edf50c3a972d0ca52b7996cb594f39cdcdfe6d2151253d56c7d38dcfd8055b"}}, "hash": "38b06059f86d16ef63ed591b44d4c90a9234150c89a9452c720f81ef29d7c930", "text": "This often but does not necessarily coincide with an intensified use of industrial inputs, such as machinery and agrochemicals RENAISSANCE The process of returning to expansion following a phase of abandonment, intensification or polarisation Such processes can be confronted for instance with the \u201cscenario\u201d identified by Felipe-Lucia et al., (2022), i.e. \u201ccurrent situation\u201d, \u201cconservation and active ecological restoration\u201d, \u201cintensive agriculture\u201d, \u201cconservation and agricultural production\u201d, and \u201crural abandonment\u201d.

Such elaborate methods to analyse change in landscapes appear especially useful when they shed light on unexpected evolutions: for instance, Acha and Newing (2015) suggest that rewilding degraded dehesas landscapes could provide increased ecosystem services and biodiversity. Similarly, Agnoletti et al. (2011, 2019) show that terraced landscapes abandoned for a long time provide more ecosystem services and biodiversity than those abandoned more recently. Other studies highlight patterns of change differing from those observed at the Mediterranean, national or regional scale, like (Salvati et al., 2016) on reforestation. THE MULTIPLE VALUES OF CULTURAL LANDSCAPES 11 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL 3.3. Which benefits? Climate change impacts vs. ecosystem services, biodiversity and well-being During the session on \u2018Traditional agricultural landscapes and community conserved areas\u2019 at the International Congress on Ethnobiology of 2011, it was stated that \u201cthese [traditional agricultural landscapes] are rich in agro- biodiversity values as well as inherent wild biodiversity and cultural values, and encompass holistic knowledge and collective management systems and complex institutions of customary law. They play a vital role in ensuring resilience, ecosystem function, and livelihood and food sovereignty. Inextricably linked to the material values of these landscapes are their spiritual and cultural values. These special landscapes offer us beauty and a palpable sense of place. They are living landscapes worth living in\u201d (presented in Brown & Kothari, 2011). Still, it may be argued that there is an overall focus on drivers of landscape change \u2013 and often on the consecutive loss of ecosystem services, biodiversity and well-being \u2013 rather than on an effective assessment of the benefits provided by landscapes themselves. Beside sophisticated mapping and modelling exercises registering land-use change (Perpi\u00f1a Castillo et al., 2021; van Vliet et al., 2015) or bioclimatic evolution (Savo et al., 2016) or dating man-made structures (Turner et al., 2018) with a significant level of detail, benefits provided by landscapes are not always assessed in such a comprehensive and dynamic way. Instead, when they are not merely described, benefits are assessed singularly, i.e. in terms either of a single class of ecosystem services (Arslan & Kaymaz, 2020; Howlett et al., 2011; Paracchini et al., 2014; Picchi et al., 2019, the latter dealing with the relationship between renewable energy and ecosystem services for landscape planning and design), or of biodiversity (Atik et al., 2012; Bassols Isamat et al., 2011; Dudley & Stolton, 2012; Manenti, 2014; Santoro et al., 2020; Saadaoui et al., 2018).

The question of ecosystem services\u2019 management \u201ccosts\u201d is tackled by Campos et al. (2021) in the national context of Portugal and by Rocchi et al. (2019) in the case of Natura 2000 sites in Umbria, Italy, suggesting that they are significantly lower than related benefits (see also Shirvani Dastgerdi (2020) still in the context of Central Italy, Dimopoulos et al. (2017) on the Greek context, Flinzberger et al. (2020) on agroforestry labels in the Mediterranean area). Indeed, recent studies emphasize the opportunity to consider benefit \u2018bundles\u2019 (Meacham et al., 2022) or \u2018baskets\u2019 (Morgan et al., 2022), or landscapes\u2019 \u2018multifunctionality\u2019, the latter consisting in \u2018the capacity of a landscape to simultaneously support multiple benefits to society from its interacting ecosystems\u2019 (Mastrangelo et al., 2014). Such capacity relies as much upon to landscapes\u2019\u2019 management and local practices (especially in terms of land use, see Crouzat et al., 2015), as upon \u201clandscape features, most notably a mosaic of land uses, scattered tree cover, low-intensity livestock grazing, rich landscape structure, and unfragmented ecosystems, underpin the biodiversity and ecosystem services values\u201d (Plieninger et al., 2021, in the case of the dehesa system). On the other hand, multifunctionality also requires a realistic approach, as suggested by Pedroli et al. (2016), inasmuch as \u201cthe demand for multifunctionality has also overwhelmed agriculture as many of the functions that society expects today from rural areas cannot be provided by a single farm or managed by individual farmers\u201d, whilst \u2013 the same authors argue \u2013 \u201cthe polarising trends affecting European rural landscapes [have led] to a segregation of agricultural production landscapes and high-priority nature reserves\u201d. Similarly, Torquati et al. (2015), analysing \u201cTraditional Cultural Vineyard Landscapes\u201d in Italy in terms of wine farms\u2019 economic performance, suggest that \u201cthe key issue is not the contrast between those who support the costs of landscape preservation (vineyard owners) and those who reap its benefits (the community as a whole), but rather in the way in which the added value resulting from preservation of the landscape is being obtained and distributed\u201d. THE MULTIPLE VALUES OF CULTURAL LANDSCAPES 13 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL Following the brief discussion initiated in par. 3.2, it may be argued that a clear distinction between \u201cchallenges\u201d or \u201cthreats\u201d and \u201cbenefits\u201d is not always easy, both because of the complexity of landscape processes through time, which imply \u201ccontrasts and contingencies\u201d at various scales (Bevan & Conolly, 2013), and because of differing perceptions and potentially conflicting expectations regarding especially, but not exclusively, \u201cproductive functions [and] cultural values, including recreation and conservation values\u201d (Soy-Massoni, 2016b). Some studies thus develop an approach to how stakeholder perceive ecosystem services and biodiversity: for instance Sagie and Orenstein (2022) conclude, in the case of Mount Carmel Biosphere Reserve, that ecosystem services are considered overall \u201cas an empirical tool to influence decision-makers (instrumental), as a support tool to advance plans/actions/policies/initiatives that they are already advancing (strategic) and mostly as an effective rhetorical to raise public awareness (conceptual)\u201d.

This has led not only to a separation between nature and culture in policies, but also between science and humanities in the study and management of natural and cultural values, affecting the conservation of cultural heritage as well as the natural heritage\u201d (UNESCO-SCBD, 2014). Indeed, literature considered in this report generally suggests a sensible gap between landscape management at the local level, and policies which have an impact on both at national and international \u2013 and especially EU \u2013 level. On the one hand landscape management is generally considered as an opportunity for landscapes conservation and/or sustainable development. While as evoked in par. 3.1 it may be framed by specific principles and guidelines, labels and programmes are often presented as best practices that may be replicated elsewhere (Samuels, 2017; Osipova, 2014; Salizzoni, 2016). On the other hand, landscapes may not be sustained by \u201ca set of visions and more concrete objectives for protection and change, a number of strategic projects which are more or less comprehensively described, and a spatial outline to which the objectives and projects refer\u201d, for instance, Pedroli et al. (2016) observe the implementation of such landscape strategies in the two Northern Europe cases they analyse, but not in Portuguese case of Serpa olive groves. Based upon a systematic literature review and following expert discussions, Sayer et al. (2013) develop \u201cten principles for a landscape approach to reconciling agriculture, conservation, and other competing land uses\u201d. Policies evolve as much as landscapes themselves, moreover, several policy sectors affect landscapes in various ways. At the EU level, Pedroli et al. (2016) identify \u201ctwo policy agendas affecting European landscape\u201d: THE SUSTAINABILITY AGENDA has become an important policy agenda involving a large number of high-level policymakers in the public debate. It has grown steadily in terms of the number of issues covered and the significance of the competence. Objectives and regulations are often filtered down through the various levels becoming more and more landscape specific at the low levels. THE MARKET AGENDA, on the other hand, is highly centralised and most policy decisions are now high-level decisions, usually made at the EU level or in countries outside the EU, but in both cases increasingly compliant with WTO regulations. This agenda is characterised by de-regulation and expanding markets, leaving few competences to local or regional bodies. Agricultural and land market policies are now decided at the EU level for most of Europe. Consequently, the integration of environmental and societal concerns into the market policy agenda can only take place at the higher levels even though the European Treaty prescribes that policy integration must be ensured. Thus, highly globalised technologies and market forces are becoming increasingly influential and the local farmer and the local community are losing autonomy. The most relevant feature of the \u201cmarket agenda\u201d is the Common Agricultural Policy, generally considered to have sustained intensification of agriculture in Southern Europe \u2013 the membership process of Croatia and the consequent application of the Policy is thus considered by Kale (2016) as \u201cthe second most important modern motion after post-feudal agrarian reforms\u201d \u2013, contributing also to a failure of the EU biodiversity strategy and of the Natura 2000 scheme (Palac\u00edn & Alonso, 2018), which themselves constitute prominent element THE MULTIPLE VALUES OF CULTURAL LANDSCAPES 15 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL of what Pedroli et al. (2016) call the \u201csustainability agenda\u201d. Furthermore, Agnoletti and Emanueli (2016) argue that if \u201cpolicies are devoted to the conservation of biodiversity and cultural heritage, [they are] rarely focused on the result of interactions between nature and culture expressed by the rural landscape\u201d. \u201cGreening measures\u201d introduced by the 2014 reform of CAP, which include rules on maintaining permanent grassland, crop diversification and Ecological Focus Areas (EFAs), have instead been acknowledged and their potential highlighted by Tzilivakis et al.

Regarding the broader international level, although it considers the Intergovernmental Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services\u2019 role for heritage rather than for cultural landscapes more specifically, Bridgewater\u2019s (2017) statement that \u201cexamining issues raised in assessments through the prism of heritage can help modify the utilitarian approaches and view of biodiversity and ecosystem services, enriching and humanising the IPBES outputs\u201d is significant. In that way \u2013 writes the same author \u2013 \u201cheritage issues can be effectively portrayed in IPBES outputs, then that process, in turn, will ensure IPBES outcomes reflect, and have positive impacts on, heritage practice and communication\u201d. Focusing instead on heritage professionals\u2019 perspectives on climate change, a similar reflection is proposed by Sesana et al. (2018). Many authors suggest, like Plieninger et al. (2021) about the dehesa system, that \u201cplenty of management and policy responses are available, but [that] there is a need to move from single-topic to cross sectorial, landscape-level approaches (Metzger et al., 2021). The dehesa system depends on measures and grants that fit the complexity of their biodiversity and ecosystem services values. Such policy responses should also take landowner and farmer perceptions, willingness, and capacity to innovate or to adopt measures for dehesa conservation into consideration. At the same time, the dehesa has become important for cultural identification and nature conservation, including the values and demands of a wider, more distant, and more urbanized society\u201d. Local practices, research and policies at regional, national and international levels may still be brought to a closer dialogue, and secure a more decisive role for cultural landscapes at the outset of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. THE MEDITERRANEAN AS A UNIQUE GROUND FOR MAINSTREAMING PRACTICES, RESEARCH AND POLICIES 16 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL \u201cIf the Mediterranean region is a microcosm of the world\u2019s problems, it also has many models to offer for sus- tainable development and human well-being in a beautiful and biologically diverse environment\u201d (Blondel, 2010). It has been identified as a biodiversity hotspot (Myers et al., 2000) and, as remarked in the Introduction to the Mediterranean strategy for sustainable development 2016\u20132025, \u201cwith its rich history and exceptional natural and cultural landscapes, its coasts accounted for 31 per cent of global tourist arrivals in 2011\u201d (UNEP/MAP, 2016). As illustrated in this report, many publications consider the Mediterranean scale, either as the broader context for case-studies or as the scale for typological or comparison analysis, focused for instance on landscapes characterized by a specific dominant feature like tree-crops (mainly olives, chestnuts, cork oaks and almonds). Indeed, \u201clong-established Mediterranean land management practices have created a socioecological system with an extraordinary wealth of actors, practices, biodiversity, and ecosystem services, a system that has raised European and global conservation interest\u201d (Plieninger et al., 2021). As for policies with a relevant im- pact \u2013 be it intended or not \u2013 on landscapes, they may be developed, implemented and assessed in a coherent way among the EU countries on its northern shore. \u201cThe physical configuration of the Mediterranean structures, the flow of people, plants, animals, objects and ideas in specific directions, with important effects over both the short and long term\u201d. What Bevan and Conolly (2013) write about Antikythera, which \u201csits at one of those geographically nodal points where the resulting con- trasts and contingencies are particularly powerful\u201d, may apply to many other landscapes in the Mediterranean, which benefits for people and the environment outreach its borders. 4.

It provides public, private and non-governmental organisations with the knowledge and tools that enable human progress, economic development and nature conservation to take place together. Created in 1948, IUCN is now the world\u2019s largest and most diverse environmental network, harnessing the knowledge, resources and reach of 1,400 Member organisations and some 15,000 experts. It is a leading provider of conservation data, assessments and analysis. Its broad membership enables IUCN to fill the role of incubator and trusted repository of best practices, tools and international standards. IUCN provides a neutral space in which diverse stakeholders including governments, NGOs, scientists, businesses, local communities, indigenous peoples\u2019 organisations and others can work together to forge and implement solutions to environmental challenges and achieve sustainable development. Working with many partners and supporters, IUCN implements a large and diverse portfolio of conservation projects worldwide. Combining the latest science with the traditional knowledge of local communities, these projects work to reverse habitat loss, restore ecosystems and improve people\u2019s well-being. www.iucn.org https://twitter.com/IUCN/ IUCN Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation The IUCN Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation (IUCN-Med) opened in Malaga (Spain) in October 2001 with the core support of the Spanish Ministry of Environment and the regional Government of Junta de Andaluc\u00eda. The Centre\u2019s mission is to influence, encourage and assist Mediterranean societies to conserve and use sustainably the natural resources of the region and work with IUCN Members and cooperate with all other agencies that share the objectives of IUCN. www.iucn.org/mediterranean Analysis of knowledge on cultural landscapes at the Mediterranean level The designation of geographical entities in this report, and the presentation of the material do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of IUCN or other participating organisations concerning the legal status of any country, territory, or area, or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries.

They constitute an important landscape in the Mediterranean region, but have long been studied both by social and natural scientists from different perspectives. Several NGOs working on building awareness and knowledge of cultural landscapes in the Mediterranean region have bundled their forces and formed the Alliance for Mediterranean Nature & Culture (AMNC) in 2021. The focus is on strengthening the knowledge on the economic, social, cultural and environmental benefits of cultural landscapes and advocating for international recognition of cultural landscapes. This report tries to combine the existing literature dealing with the environmental and socio-cultural aspects of cultural landscapes, focusing on the Mediterranean region. An interactive map was created to visualize the distribution of the cited landscapes. Literature was found for a total of 70 cultural landscapes, including 8 cultural landscapes that form part of the AMNC. Publications issued before 2000 were not considered, nor gray literature (with few exceptions), and the scope was limited by the exclusive use of publications in English. The Mediterranean region has many models to offer for sustainable land-use management. It is not only a biodiversity hotspot, but also has a rich history of cultural landscapes. Many of these landscapes are characterized by a specific dominant feature like tree-crops (mainly olives, chestnuts, cork oaks and almonds). The traditional land management practices have created a socio-ecological system beneficial for people and the environment and important to protect at a European and global scale. Executive summary V ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL IUCN-Med would like to thank the partners of the Alliance for Mediterranean Nature & Culture for their valuable expertise and insights. This report would not have been possible without their continuing work and focus on the cultural landscapes situated in the Mediterranean region.

Introduction Kapikiri village and Latmos Besparmak Mountains, Aegean region of Turkey \u00a9 Serturvetan on Dreamstime 2 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL INTRODUCTION At the European level, the relationship between landscapes and biodiversity and other benefits is merely implicit in the European Landscape Convention of 2000, which defines its object as \u201can area, as perceived by people, whose character is the result of the action and interaction of natural and/or human factors\u201d and \u201clandscape protection\u201d as \u201cactions to conserve and maintain the significant or characteristic features of a landscape, justified by its heritage value derived from its natural configuration and/or from human activity\u201d (Seardo, 2016). On the other hand, despite the Natura 2000 framework\u2019s focus on biodiversity, the Habitats Directive foresees that \u201cMember States shall endeavour, where they consider it necessary, in their land-use planning and development policies and, in particular, with a view to improving the ecological coherence of the Natura network, to encourage the management of features of the landscape which are of major importance for wild fauna and flora\u201d (Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora, consolidated text, art. 10). Still focusing on the European level, the Florence Declaration promoted by UNESCO and the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity might be the document that offers the most comprehensive, and in a sense up-to-date \u2013 at least with the literature included in this report \u2013 view on cultural landscapes. \u201cAs it assimilates economic, social, cultural and environmental processes in time and space, the European landscape is predominantly a biocultural multifunctional landscape. As such, it provides a crucial and effective space for integration of biological and cultural diversity for human well-being, including in the context of rural territories [\u2026]\u201d (UNESCO-SCBD, 2014; Agnoletti and Emanueli, 2016). Still, cultural landscapes are not explicitly considered within the Agenda 2030 (although SDG target 11.4 \u201cStrengthen efforts to protect and safeguard the world\u2019s cultural and natural heritage\u201d), nor in documents related to the Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021\u20132030) (FAO & UNEP, 2022). Considering the essential relationships between cultural landscapes, sustainable development and ecosystems, highlighted within UNESCO programmes such as World Heritage and Man and the Biosphere but also in FAO\u2019s GIAHS, there seems to be room for further integration of the concept within the United Nations\u2019 standards and strategies. 1.2. Cultural landscapes, ecosystem services and biodiversity: outlining a growing research field Cultural landscapes in the Mediterranean have long been studied both by social and natural scientists, although from different perspectives and approaches \u2013 and following different definitions of the concept. As elsewhere, the introduction of the concept of ecosystem services, especially through the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment international research project (or MA, concluded in 2005), has prompted further research and cross- disciplinary dialogue. Still, research exploring relationships between landscapes and ecosystems rather than focusing on one or the other dimension, thus involving at once humanities, social and natural sciences, seems relatively limited. While it might be said that landscapes host or correspond to ecosystems, the former characterized by a significant cultural dimension, which in turn has been recognized in terms of ecosystem services. Cultural Ecosystem Services, defined by the MA as \u2018nonmaterial benefits people obtain from ecosystems through spiritual enrichment, cognitive development, reflection, recreation, and aesthetic experiences\u2019, have been dedicated a vast amount of literature on their own \u2013 often dealing with the issue of how to quantify them with respect to the other Ecosystem Services categories (Blicharska et al., 2017; Daniel et al., 2012; H\u00f8lleland et al., 2017; Paracchini et al., 2014; Plieninger et al., 2014; Smith & Ram, 2017; Scholte et al., 2015; Winthrop, 2014).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "015657ba-262f-4787-ba1b-9c715623a843": {"__data__": {"id_": "015657ba-262f-4787-ba1b-9c715623a843", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-synthesis-results-and-lessons-mekong-wet-small-grants-2021-2022", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Regional Synthesis of Results and Lessons from Mekong WET Small Grants 2021-2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-synthesis-results-and-lessons-mekong-wet-small-grants-2021-2022", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "01aa2e1a92f26a044a1655251a33e83a67a575cb769b339cd00342809a238df3"}, "2": {"node_id": "1729c3c3-6254-4e2e-b3dd-152234de64df", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-synthesis-results-and-lessons-mekong-wet-small-grants-2021-2022", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "59620a98014c611854c8ac5fd57e06f8a40ce58658f26785a3127cfd6ce73dbf"}}, "hash": "1e19cb9e527f2551f62b3cd1f1c2814039d3687b56b620cae55be03c866846a0", "text": "3 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL INTRODUCTION Focusing on landscape management in relationship to ecosystem services, Setten et al. (2012) identify the three following challenges: A lack of compatibility between the framework and the inherent character, or the logics of landscapes. Difficulties arise in addressing the complexity of ecosystems, unsubstitutable values, and intangible dimensions in economic valuation when applied to landscapes. The Ecosystem Services framework to a large degree falls short in understanding how context-specific sociocultural processes are crucial to environmental attitudes and behaviours.

A glance at the amount of literature produced over the last decade suggests that although much has been done in that sense, the plea is more relevant than ever. Answering this plea is the Alliance for Mediterranean Nature and Culture (AMNC), a partnership between several NGOs working on building awareness and knowledge of cultural landscapes. Joining forces in 2021, the partners of AMNC share the vision of a Mediterranean region where cultural landscapes contribute effectively to conserving both biodiversity and maintaining the well-being of communities. The focus in their project sites, ranging from mountain ranges to lowland areas and islands, is on the economic, social, cultural and environmental processes of cultural landscapes. This partnership works on strengthening awareness and understanding of cultural landscapes and advocates for the international recognition of their benefits by scaling up its membership and impact. METHODOLOGY 4 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL This report seeks to account for existing literature dealing at least partially with the issues mentioned above, focusing on the Mediterranean area. Beside a significant number of literature reviews (Blicharska et al., 2017; Cicinelli et al., 2021; Daniel et al., 2012; H\u00f8lleland et al., 2017; Mart\u00edn-L\u00f3pez et al., 2016; Orr et al., 2021; Picchi et al., 2019; Sayer et al., 2013; Vall\u00e9s-Planells et al., 2014), many publications provide case analyses from virtually all parts of the world. A map was presented to visualize the distribution of those landscapes in the Mediterranean area (Figure 1). The cultural landscapes of the Alliance for Mediterranean Nature and Culture (AMNC) are separated. An interactive map, with more in-depth information on each landscape is available online. The sections have been elaborated following AMNC\u2019s objectives on the one hand, and seeking for thematic coherence among references on the other. References selected and used in this report include both types of publications, retrieved from the main academic journal portals including Web of Science, Scopus and through cross-reference. The initial survey of publications on \u201clandscape + benefits\u201d, \u201clandscape + ecosystem\u201d and \u201clandscape + biodiversity\u201d was completed with specific search for publications dealing with cultural landscapes identified as such within UNESCO World Heritage programme, FAO\u2019s GIAHS or other programmes (see further, par. \u201cLandscape typologies/patterns\u201d). The use of the most cited literature reviews and conceptual papers has thus provided the background for a wider overview of case analyses, including a wide array of the various areas of the Mediterranean and landscape typologies, as well as of different approaches and methodologies. 2. Methodology Cork oak trees in National Park Tazekka, Morocco \u00a9 Marketa Novakova on Dreamstime METHODOLOGY 5 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL In the map, you will find more specific information on 70 Mediterranean cultural landscapes, including 8 cultural landscapes that form part of the Alliance for Mediterranean Culture and Nature (AMNC). As for the latter type of publication, the survey has been focused on cases situated in the Mediterranean area and corresponding to the three broad typologies represented among AMNC project areas (listed below between parentheses), several of which also appear in one or more publications included in the bibliography: Mountain/high altitude sites characterised by traditional farming, grazing, agrofor- estry and water management practices (the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco, the Al-Shouf Biosphere Reserve, West Bekaa and Mount Lebanon in Lebanon, and the Taurus mountains in Central and Southern Anatolia, Turkey).

Accounting for Mediterranean cultural landscapes and their benefits for the environment and communities through existing literature thus raises several difficulties, briefly discussed in the following paragraphs in order to introduce and comment the landscapes list (Figure 1): Different definitions of landscape typologies and/or units are used and/or provided. Various methods have been developed to analyse landscape change, which suggest a cautious approach to causalities. Fewer studies provide a comprehensive analysis of benefits provided by cultural landscapes. While many publications assess how policies at various levels affect cultural landscapes and related benefits, only few attempts to analyse and contextualize such policies. 3.

Changing landscapes: drivers and scenarios In a significant attempt to analyse and systematize \u201cdriving forces of landscape change\u201d (B\u00fcrgi et al., 2004), identified four major challenges to that aim: \u201cstudying processes and not merely spatial patterns, extrapolating results in space and time, linking data of different qualities, and considering culture as a driver of landscape change\u201d. Their method thus implied the following tasks: While such a systematic approach to landscape change is not always developed in case studies cited in this report, the concept of landscape-change drivers itself has been further discussed and put into perspective. For instance, Plieninger et al. (2021) propose an approach along more coordinates, including, in addition to \u201cdrivers\u201d themselves, \u201cpressures\u201d, \u201cstate\u201d, \u201cimpacts\u201d and \u201cresponses\u201d. Resuming results from B\u00fcrgi et al. (2004), Wolpert et al. (2020) highlight that \u201cdriving forces mostly appear in bundles and interdependencies across natural, political technological, socio-cultural and economic factors, calling for a multi-sectorial and holistic approach to landscape management\u201d.

Rather than through their physical features and associated practices, or by their either \u201ctraditional\u201d or \u201cabandoned\u201d state (Frattaroli et al., 2014), landscapes have been increasingly characterised in terms of \u201cscenarios\u201d, \u201ctrajectories\u201d, \u201cpatterns\u201d, or \u201cprocesses\u201d. This latter term is used by Wolpert et al. (2020), who identify the following among the three types of tree-crop Mediterranean landscapes they analyse: EXPANSION A tree-crop landscape that is flourishing and growing in its extent as well as in its importance for human use CONTINUITY A landscape that is not significantly changing but rather remaining in the same state over a period of time. The tree crop is either still one of many trees or already enjoys a certain level of importance, depending on the landscape POLARISATION Concurrent processes of abandonment on less fertile, steeper places as well as intensification on fertile zones ABANDONMENT A tree-crop landscape that is undergoing a process of decreasing inputs as well as outputs INTENSIFICATION A tree-crop landscape whose management has resulted in an increased yield per area.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c8bb649-77a2-4928-afed-e6584dced558": {"__data__": {"id_": "8c8bb649-77a2-4928-afed-e6584dced558", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-synthesis-results-and-lessons-mekong-wet-small-grants-2021-2022", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Regional Synthesis of Results and Lessons from Mekong WET Small Grants 2021-2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-synthesis-results-and-lessons-mekong-wet-small-grants-2021-2022", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cebfbe5a708c808926e36f8b11bef9665813fe6e69c76a6aef4423c805c5cc48"}, "2": {"node_id": "124f343e-a370-4c8c-94e5-3b40b2d909a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-synthesis-results-and-lessons-mekong-wet-small-grants-2021-2022", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1056e189faa26621fba6c5834501665671a7b7e9f63a8422edba2e07911babd5"}}, "hash": "178167a4453d0247a028f76198f858d0b6aa2c02eadbb8bdddf7ad3b360f3bd7", "text": "This often but does not necessarily coincide with an intensified use of industrial inputs, such as machinery and agrochemicals RENAISSANCE The process of returning to expansion following a phase of abandonment, intensification or polarisation Such processes can be confronted for instance with the \u201cscenario\u201d identified by Felipe-Lucia et al., (2022), i.e. \u201ccurrent situation\u201d, \u201cconservation and active ecological restoration\u201d, \u201cintensive agriculture\u201d, \u201cconservation and agricultural production\u201d, and \u201crural abandonment\u201d.

Such elaborate methods to analyse change in landscapes appear especially useful when they shed light on unexpected evolutions: for instance, Acha and Newing (2015) suggest that rewilding degraded dehesas landscapes could provide increased ecosystem services and biodiversity. Similarly, Agnoletti et al. (2011, 2019) show that terraced landscapes abandoned for a long time provide more ecosystem services and biodiversity than those abandoned more recently. Other studies highlight patterns of change differing from those observed at the Mediterranean, national or regional scale, like (Salvati et al., 2016) on reforestation. THE MULTIPLE VALUES OF CULTURAL LANDSCAPES 11 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL 3.3. Which benefits? Climate change impacts vs. ecosystem services, biodiversity and well-being During the session on \u2018Traditional agricultural landscapes and community conserved areas\u2019 at the International Congress on Ethnobiology of 2011, it was stated that \u201cthese [traditional agricultural landscapes] are rich in agro- biodiversity values as well as inherent wild biodiversity and cultural values, and encompass holistic knowledge and collective management systems and complex institutions of customary law. They play a vital role in ensuring resilience, ecosystem function, and livelihood and food sovereignty. Inextricably linked to the material values of these landscapes are their spiritual and cultural values. These special landscapes offer us beauty and a palpable sense of place. They are living landscapes worth living in\u201d (presented in Brown & Kothari, 2011). Still, it may be argued that there is an overall focus on drivers of landscape change \u2013 and often on the consecutive loss of ecosystem services, biodiversity and well-being \u2013 rather than on an effective assessment of the benefits provided by landscapes themselves. Beside sophisticated mapping and modelling exercises registering land-use change (Perpi\u00f1a Castillo et al., 2021; van Vliet et al., 2015) or bioclimatic evolution (Savo et al., 2016) or dating man-made structures (Turner et al., 2018) with a significant level of detail, benefits provided by landscapes are not always assessed in such a comprehensive and dynamic way. Instead, when they are not merely described, benefits are assessed singularly, i.e. in terms either of a single class of ecosystem services (Arslan & Kaymaz, 2020; Howlett et al., 2011; Paracchini et al., 2014; Picchi et al., 2019, the latter dealing with the relationship between renewable energy and ecosystem services for landscape planning and design), or of biodiversity (Atik et al., 2012; Bassols Isamat et al., 2011; Dudley & Stolton, 2012; Manenti, 2014; Santoro et al., 2020; Saadaoui et al., 2018).

Finally, S\u00f8rensen et al. (2021) inquire into Montados\u2019 cork value chain, suggesting \u201cpotential leverage points for sustainability in the landscape of origin, which could eventually bring a positive trickle-effect of benefits for the whole sector\u201d. The question of ecosystem services\u2019 management \u201ccosts\u201d is tackled by Campos et al. (2021) in the national context of Portugal and by Rocchi et al. (2019) in the case of Natura 2000 sites in Umbria, Italy, suggesting that they are significantly lower than related benefits (see also Shirvani Dastgerdi (2020) still in the context of Central Italy, Dimopoulos et al. (2017) on the Greek context, Flinzberger et al. (2020) on agroforestry labels in the Mediterranean area). Indeed, recent studies emphasize the opportunity to consider benefit \u2018bundles\u2019 (Meacham et al., 2022) or \u2018baskets\u2019 (Morgan et al., 2022), or landscapes\u2019 \u2018multifunctionality\u2019, the latter consisting in \u2018the capacity of a landscape to simultaneously support multiple benefits to society from its interacting ecosystems\u2019 (Mastrangelo et al., 2014). Such capacity relies as much upon to landscapes\u2019\u2019 management and local practices (especially in terms of land use, see Crouzat et al., 2015), as upon \u201clandscape features, most notably a mosaic of land uses, scattered tree cover, low-intensity livestock grazing, rich landscape structure, and unfragmented ecosystems, underpin the biodiversity and ecosystem services values\u201d (Plieninger et al., 2021, in the case of the dehesa system). On the other hand, multifunctionality also requires a realistic approach, as suggested by Pedroli et al. (2016), inasmuch as \u201cthe demand for multifunctionality has also overwhelmed agriculture as many of the functions that society expects today from rural areas cannot be provided by a single farm or managed by individual farmers\u201d, whilst \u2013 the same authors argue \u2013 \u201cthe polarising trends affecting European rural landscapes [have led] to a segregation of agricultural production landscapes and high-priority nature reserves\u201d. Similarly, Torquati et al. (2015), analysing \u201cTraditional Cultural Vineyard Landscapes\u201d in Italy in terms of wine farms\u2019 economic performance, suggest that \u201cthe key issue is not the contrast between those who support the costs of landscape preservation (vineyard owners) and those who reap its benefits (the community as a whole), but rather in the way in which the added value resulting from preservation of the landscape is being obtained and distributed\u201d. THE MULTIPLE VALUES OF CULTURAL LANDSCAPES 13 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL Following the brief discussion initiated in par. 3.2, it may be argued that a clear distinction between \u201cchallenges\u201d or \u201cthreats\u201d and \u201cbenefits\u201d is not always easy, both because of the complexity of landscape processes through time, which imply \u201ccontrasts and contingencies\u201d at various scales (Bevan & Conolly, 2013), and because of differing perceptions and potentially conflicting expectations regarding especially, but not exclusively, \u201cproductive functions [and] cultural values, including recreation and conservation values\u201d (Soy-Massoni, 2016b). Some studies thus develop an approach to how stakeholder perceive ecosystem services and biodiversity: for instance Sagie and Orenstein (2022) conclude, in the case of Mount Carmel Biosphere Reserve, that ecosystem services are considered overall \u201cas an empirical tool to influence decision-makers (instrumental), as a support tool to advance plans/actions/policies/initiatives that they are already advancing (strategic) and mostly as an effective rhetorical to raise public awareness (conceptual)\u201d.

This has led not only to a separation between nature and culture in policies, but also between science and humanities in the study and management of natural and cultural values, affecting the conservation of cultural heritage as well as the natural heritage\u201d (UNESCO-SCBD, 2014). Indeed, literature considered in this report generally suggests a sensible gap between landscape management at the local level, and policies which have an impact on both at national and international \u2013 and especially EU \u2013 level. On the one hand landscape management is generally considered as an opportunity for landscapes conservation and/or sustainable development. While as evoked in par. 3.1 it may be framed by specific principles and guidelines, labels and programmes are often presented as best practices that may be replicated elsewhere (Samuels, 2017; Osipova, 2014; Salizzoni, 2016). On the other hand, landscapes may not be sustained by \u201ca set of visions and more concrete objectives for protection and change, a number of strategic projects which are more or less comprehensively described, and a spatial outline to which the objectives and projects refer\u201d, for instance, Pedroli et al. (2016) observe the implementation of such landscape strategies in the two Northern Europe cases they analyse, but not in Portuguese case of Serpa olive groves. Based upon a systematic literature review and following expert discussions, Sayer et al. (2013) develop \u201cten principles for a landscape approach to reconciling agriculture, conservation, and other competing land uses\u201d. Policies evolve as much as landscapes themselves, moreover, several policy sectors affect landscapes in various ways. At the EU level, Pedroli et al. (2016) identify \u201ctwo policy agendas affecting European landscape\u201d: THE SUSTAINABILITY AGENDA has become an important policy agenda involving a large number of high-level policymakers in the public debate. It has grown steadily in terms of the number of issues covered and the significance of the competence. Objectives and regulations are often filtered down through the various levels becoming more and more landscape specific at the low levels. THE MARKET AGENDA, on the other hand, is highly centralised and most policy decisions are now high-level decisions, usually made at the EU level or in countries outside the EU, but in both cases increasingly compliant with WTO regulations. This agenda is characterised by de-regulation and expanding markets, leaving few competences to local or regional bodies. Agricultural and land market policies are now decided at the EU level for most of Europe. Consequently, the integration of environmental and societal concerns into the market policy agenda can only take place at the higher levels even though the European Treaty prescribes that policy integration must be ensured. Thus, highly globalised technologies and market forces are becoming increasingly influential and the local farmer and the local community are losing autonomy. The most relevant feature of the \u201cmarket agenda\u201d is the Common Agricultural Policy, generally considered to have sustained intensification of agriculture in Southern Europe \u2013 the membership process of Croatia and the consequent application of the Policy is thus considered by Kale (2016) as \u201cthe second most important modern motion after post-feudal agrarian reforms\u201d \u2013, contributing also to a failure of the EU biodiversity strategy and of the Natura 2000 scheme (Palac\u00edn & Alonso, 2018), which themselves constitute prominent element THE MULTIPLE VALUES OF CULTURAL LANDSCAPES 15 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL of what Pedroli et al. (2016) call the \u201csustainability agenda\u201d. Furthermore, Agnoletti and Emanueli (2016) argue that if \u201cpolicies are devoted to the conservation of biodiversity and cultural heritage, [they are] rarely focused on the result of interactions between nature and culture expressed by the rural landscape\u201d. \u201cGreening measures\u201d introduced by the 2014 reform of CAP, which include rules on maintaining permanent grassland, crop diversification and Ecological Focus Areas (EFAs), have instead been acknowledged and their potential highlighted by Tzilivakis et al.

Regarding the broader international level, although it considers the Intergovernmental Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services\u2019 role for heritage rather than for cultural landscapes more specifically, Bridgewater\u2019s (2017) statement that \u201cexamining issues raised in assessments through the prism of heritage can help modify the utilitarian approaches and view of biodiversity and ecosystem services, enriching and humanising the IPBES outputs\u201d is significant.

Focusing instead on heritage professionals\u2019 perspectives on climate change, a similar reflection is proposed by Sesana et al. (2018). Many authors suggest, like Plieninger et al. (2021) about the dehesa system, that \u201cplenty of management and policy responses are available, but [that] there is a need to move from single-topic to cross sectorial, landscape-level approaches (Metzger et al., 2021). The dehesa system depends on measures and grants that fit the complexity of their biodiversity and ecosystem services values. Such policy responses should also take landowner and farmer perceptions, willingness, and capacity to innovate or to adopt measures for dehesa conservation into consideration. At the same time, the dehesa has become important for cultural identification and nature conservation, including the values and demands of a wider, more distant, and more urbanized society\u201d. Local practices, research and policies at regional, national and international levels may still be brought to a closer dialogue, and secure a more decisive role for cultural landscapes at the outset of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. THE MEDITERRANEAN AS A UNIQUE GROUND FOR MAINSTREAMING PRACTICES, RESEARCH AND POLICIES 16 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL \u201cIf the Mediterranean region is a microcosm of the world\u2019s problems, it also has many models to offer for sus- tainable development and human well-being in a beautiful and biologically diverse environment\u201d (Blondel, 2010). It has been identified as a biodiversity hotspot (Myers et al., 2000) and, as remarked in the Introduction to the Mediterranean strategy for sustainable development 2016\u20132025, \u201cwith its rich history and exceptional natural and cultural landscapes, its coasts accounted for 31 per cent of global tourist arrivals in 2011\u201d (UNEP/MAP, 2016). As illustrated in this report, many publications consider the Mediterranean scale, either as the broader context for case-studies or as the scale for typological or comparison analysis, focused for instance on landscapes characterized by a specific dominant feature like tree-crops (mainly olives, chestnuts, cork oaks and almonds). Indeed, \u201clong-established Mediterranean land management practices have created a socioecological system with an extraordinary wealth of actors, practices, biodiversity, and ecosystem services, a system that has raised European and global conservation interest\u201d (Plieninger et al., 2021). As for policies with a relevant im- pact \u2013 be it intended or not \u2013 on landscapes, they may be developed, implemented and assessed in a coherent way among the EU countries on its northern shore. \u201cThe physical configuration of the Mediterranean structures, the flow of people, plants, animals, objects and ideas in specific directions, with important effects over both the short and long term\u201d. What Bevan and Conolly (2013) write about Antikythera, which \u201csits at one of those geographically nodal points where the resulting con- trasts and contingencies are particularly powerful\u201d, may apply to many other landscapes in the Mediterranean, which benefits for people and the environment outreach its borders. 4.

They constitute an important landscape in the Mediterranean region, but have long been studied both by social and natural scientists from different perspectives. Several NGOs working on building awareness and knowledge of cultural landscapes in the Mediterranean region have bundled their forces and formed the Alliance for Mediterranean Nature & Culture (AMNC) in 2021. The focus is on strengthening the knowledge on the economic, social, cultural and environmental benefits of cultural landscapes and advocating for international recognition of cultural landscapes. This report tries to combine the existing literature dealing with the environmental and socio-cultural aspects of cultural landscapes, focusing on the Mediterranean region. An interactive map was created to visualize the distribution of the cited landscapes. Literature was found for a total of 70 cultural landscapes, including 8 cultural landscapes that form part of the AMNC. Publications issued before 2000 were not considered, nor gray literature (with few exceptions), and the scope was limited by the exclusive use of publications in English. The Mediterranean region has many models to offer for sustainable land-use management. It is not only a biodiversity hotspot, but also has a rich history of cultural landscapes. Many of these landscapes are characterized by a specific dominant feature like tree-crops (mainly olives, chestnuts, cork oaks and almonds). The traditional land management practices have created a socio-ecological system beneficial for people and the environment and important to protect at a European and global scale. Executive summary V ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL IUCN-Med would like to thank the partners of the Alliance for Mediterranean Nature & Culture for their valuable expertise and insights. This report would not have been possible without their continuing work and focus on the cultural landscapes situated in the Mediterranean region.

Introduction Kapikiri village and Latmos Besparmak Mountains, Aegean region of Turkey \u00a9 Serturvetan on Dreamstime 2 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL INTRODUCTION At the European level, the relationship between landscapes and biodiversity and other benefits is merely implicit in the European Landscape Convention of 2000, which defines its object as \u201can area, as perceived by people, whose character is the result of the action and interaction of natural and/or human factors\u201d and \u201clandscape protection\u201d as \u201cactions to conserve and maintain the significant or characteristic features of a landscape, justified by its heritage value derived from its natural configuration and/or from human activity\u201d (Seardo, 2016). On the other hand, despite the Natura 2000 framework\u2019s focus on biodiversity, the Habitats Directive foresees that \u201cMember States shall endeavour, where they consider it necessary, in their land-use planning and development policies and, in particular, with a view to improving the ecological coherence of the Natura network, to encourage the management of features of the landscape which are of major importance for wild fauna and flora\u201d (Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora, consolidated text, art. 10). Still focusing on the European level, the Florence Declaration promoted by UNESCO and the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity might be the document that offers the most comprehensive, and in a sense up-to-date \u2013 at least with the literature included in this report \u2013 view on cultural landscapes. \u201cAs it assimilates economic, social, cultural and environmental processes in time and space, the European landscape is predominantly a biocultural multifunctional landscape. As such, it provides a crucial and effective space for integration of biological and cultural diversity for human well-being, including in the context of rural territories [\u2026]\u201d (UNESCO-SCBD, 2014; Agnoletti and Emanueli, 2016). Still, cultural landscapes are not explicitly considered within the Agenda 2030 (although SDG target 11.4 \u201cStrengthen efforts to protect and safeguard the world\u2019s cultural and natural heritage\u201d), nor in documents related to the Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021\u20132030) (FAO & UNEP, 2022). Considering the essential relationships between cultural landscapes, sustainable development and ecosystems, highlighted within UNESCO programmes such as World Heritage and Man and the Biosphere but also in FAO\u2019s GIAHS, there seems to be room for further integration of the concept within the United Nations\u2019 standards and strategies. 1.2. Cultural landscapes, ecosystem services and biodiversity: outlining a growing research field Cultural landscapes in the Mediterranean have long been studied both by social and natural scientists, although from different perspectives and approaches \u2013 and following different definitions of the concept. As elsewhere, the introduction of the concept of ecosystem services, especially through the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment international research project (or MA, concluded in 2005), has prompted further research and cross- disciplinary dialogue. Still, research exploring relationships between landscapes and ecosystems rather than focusing on one or the other dimension, thus involving at once humanities, social and natural sciences, seems relatively limited. While it might be said that landscapes host or correspond to ecosystems, the former characterized by a significant cultural dimension, which in turn has been recognized in terms of ecosystem services. Cultural Ecosystem Services, defined by the MA as \u2018nonmaterial benefits people obtain from ecosystems through spiritual enrichment, cognitive development, reflection, recreation, and aesthetic experiences\u2019, have been dedicated a vast amount of literature on their own \u2013 often dealing with the issue of how to quantify them with respect to the other Ecosystem Services categories (Blicharska et al., 2017; Daniel et al., 2012; H\u00f8lleland et al., 2017; Paracchini et al., 2014; Plieninger et al., 2014; Smith & Ram, 2017; Scholte et al., 2015; Winthrop, 2014).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ef680a04-e9b1-4280-8937-c99b1ff0cd82": {"__data__": {"id_": "ef680a04-e9b1-4280-8937-c99b1ff0cd82", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/contribution-assessment-methodological-guidelines", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Contribution Assessment Methodological Guidelines", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/contribution-assessment-methodological-guidelines", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a413010ab48017921145776343a0162d4ea9c2abdb3808a4931df47e19e43619"}, "2": {"node_id": "4a7d6a69-67b4-484d-ac98-62725dfa87dc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/contribution-assessment-methodological-guidelines", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4bf3fdb44ed17d0a07661a81436b902e00412616c4607bc59fff8cabb4e96924"}}, "hash": "59b446976ff34e8885dc20d8843a165b95e22b6d2b9d48e222b427e414d1889d", "text": "3 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL INTRODUCTION Focusing on landscape management in relationship to ecosystem services, Setten et al.

Difficulties arise in addressing the complexity of ecosystems, unsubstitutable values, and intangible dimensions in economic valuation when applied to landscapes. The Ecosystem Services framework to a large degree falls short in understanding how context-specific sociocultural processes are crucial to environmental attitudes and behaviours.

A glance at the amount of literature produced over the last decade suggests that although much has been done in that sense, the plea is more relevant than ever. Answering this plea is the Alliance for Mediterranean Nature and Culture (AMNC), a partnership between several NGOs working on building awareness and knowledge of cultural landscapes. Joining forces in 2021, the partners of AMNC share the vision of a Mediterranean region where cultural landscapes contribute effectively to conserving both biodiversity and maintaining the well-being of communities. The focus in their project sites, ranging from mountain ranges to lowland areas and islands, is on the economic, social, cultural and environmental processes of cultural landscapes. This partnership works on strengthening awareness and understanding of cultural landscapes and advocates for the international recognition of their benefits by scaling up its membership and impact. METHODOLOGY 4 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL This report seeks to account for existing literature dealing at least partially with the issues mentioned above, focusing on the Mediterranean area. Beside a significant number of literature reviews (Blicharska et al., 2017; Cicinelli et al., 2021; Daniel et al., 2012; H\u00f8lleland et al., 2017; Mart\u00edn-L\u00f3pez et al., 2016; Orr et al., 2021; Picchi et al., 2019; Sayer et al., 2013; Vall\u00e9s-Planells et al., 2014), many publications provide case analyses from virtually all parts of the world. A map was presented to visualize the distribution of those landscapes in the Mediterranean area (Figure 1). The cultural landscapes of the Alliance for Mediterranean Nature and Culture (AMNC) are separated. An interactive map, with more in-depth information on each landscape is available online. The sections have been elaborated following AMNC\u2019s objectives on the one hand, and seeking for thematic coherence among references on the other. References selected and used in this report include both types of publications, retrieved from the main academic journal portals including Web of Science, Scopus and through cross-reference. The initial survey of publications on \u201clandscape + benefits\u201d, \u201clandscape + ecosystem\u201d and \u201clandscape + biodiversity\u201d was completed with specific search for publications dealing with cultural landscapes identified as such within UNESCO World Heritage programme, FAO\u2019s GIAHS or other programmes (see further, par. \u201cLandscape typologies/patterns\u201d). The use of the most cited literature reviews and conceptual papers has thus provided the background for a wider overview of case analyses, including a wide array of the various areas of the Mediterranean and landscape typologies, as well as of different approaches and methodologies. 2.

As for the latter type of publication, the survey has been focused on cases situated in the Mediterranean area and corresponding to the three broad typologies represented among AMNC project areas (listed below between parentheses), several of which also appear in one or more publications included in the bibliography: Mountain/high altitude sites characterised by traditional farming, grazing, agrofor- estry and water management practices (the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco, the Al-Shouf Biosphere Reserve, West Bekaa and Mount Lebanon in Lebanon, and the Taurus mountains in Central and Southern Anatolia, Turkey). Traditional agro-silvo-pastoral systems in lowland areas (the corridor with dehe- sas/montados stretching from Extremadura and C\u00f3rdoba, Spain, to Coruche in Santar\u00e9m, Portugal, and Kroumirie Mogod in North-western Tunisia). Island sites characterised by a mosaic of traditional farming, livestock breeding and water management (the islands of Lemnos, Greece and Menorca, Spain).

Accounting for Mediterranean cultural landscapes and their benefits for the environment and communities through existing literature thus raises several difficulties, briefly discussed in the following paragraphs in order to introduce and comment the landscapes list (Figure 1): Different definitions of landscape typologies and/or units are used and/or provided. Various methods have been developed to analyse landscape change, which suggest a cautious approach to causalities. Fewer studies provide a comprehensive analysis of benefits provided by cultural landscapes. While many publications assess how policies at various levels affect cultural landscapes and related benefits, only few attempts to analyse and contextualize such policies. 3.

Each of the following works according to its own principles and guidelines, but all share a rather comprehensive view of (cultural) landscapes and include one or more sites in the Mediterranean area: UNESCO MAB reserves UNESCO World Heritage properties (including \u2018cultural landscapes\u2019) FAO GIAHS Natura 2000 National and Regional Parks (in turn often part of EUROPARC network) High Nature Value Farming systems (included in the data set based on the JRC/EEA methodology, introduced by Paracchini et al.

Several of the labels and programmes mentioned above may apply at least partially to the same landscape.

Changing landscapes: drivers and scenarios In a significant attempt to analyse and systematize \u201cdriving forces of landscape change\u201d (B\u00fcrgi et al., 2004), identified four major challenges to that aim: \u201cstudying processes and not merely spatial patterns, extrapolating results in space and time, linking data of different qualities, and considering culture as a driver of landscape change\u201d. Their method thus implied the following tasks: While such a systematic approach to landscape change is not always developed in case studies cited in this report, the concept of landscape-change drivers itself has been further discussed and put into perspective. For instance, Plieninger et al. (2021) propose an approach along more coordinates, including, in addition to \u201cdrivers\u201d themselves, \u201cpressures\u201d, \u201cstate\u201d, \u201cimpacts\u201d and \u201cresponses\u201d. Resuming results from B\u00fcrgi et al. (2004), Wolpert et al. (2020) highlight that \u201cdriving forces mostly appear in bundles and interdependencies across natural, political technological, socio-cultural and economic factors, calling for a multi-sectorial and holistic approach to landscape management\u201d.

Rather than through their physical features and associated practices, or by their either \u201ctraditional\u201d or \u201cabandoned\u201d state (Frattaroli et al., 2014), landscapes have been increasingly characterised in terms of \u201cscenarios\u201d, \u201ctrajectories\u201d, \u201cpatterns\u201d, or \u201cprocesses\u201d.

(2020), who identify the following among the three types of tree-crop Mediterranean landscapes they analyse: EXPANSION A tree-crop landscape that is flourishing and growing in its extent as well as in its importance for human use CONTINUITY A landscape that is not significantly changing but rather remaining in the same state over a period of time. The tree crop is either still one of many trees or already enjoys a certain level of importance, depending on the landscape POLARISATION Concurrent processes of abandonment on less fertile, steeper places as well as intensification on fertile zones ABANDONMENT A tree-crop landscape that is undergoing a process of decreasing inputs as well as outputs INTENSIFICATION A tree-crop landscape whose management has resulted in an increased yield per area.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d5bd1a3-7031-4427-86b3-1b2941e6d1ee": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d5bd1a3-7031-4427-86b3-1b2941e6d1ee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/contribution-assessment-methodological-guidelines", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Contribution Assessment Methodological Guidelines", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/contribution-assessment-methodological-guidelines", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4c4e2266258f6259e0fdabbb5fa53cc45eacc339e0dc68d1bf3cac238fbe8ca2"}, "2": {"node_id": "d537e8ac-136a-45e5-a5d3-a8359c0eb2ef", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/contribution-assessment-methodological-guidelines", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "43d6115556a3d509953ae3e52a2d0fed4ba4e111c49db435bbc858e398593d39"}}, "hash": "1b4831ff4cb61972007ade7c8c9dff7c5ba1d315855efc23dabcd65b1ebe6af7", "text": "This often but does not necessarily coincide with an intensified use of industrial inputs, such as machinery and agrochemicals RENAISSANCE The process of returning to expansion following a phase of abandonment, intensification or polarisation Such processes can be confronted for instance with the \u201cscenario\u201d identified by Felipe-Lucia et al., (2022), i.e. \u201ccurrent situation\u201d, \u201cconservation and active ecological restoration\u201d, \u201cintensive agriculture\u201d, \u201cconservation and agricultural production\u201d, and \u201crural abandonment\u201d.

Similarly, Agnoletti et al. (2011, 2019) show that terraced landscapes abandoned for a long time provide more ecosystem services and biodiversity than those abandoned more recently. Other studies highlight patterns of change differing from those observed at the Mediterranean, national or regional scale, like (Salvati et al., 2016) on reforestation. THE MULTIPLE VALUES OF CULTURAL LANDSCAPES 11 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL 3.3. Which benefits? Climate change impacts vs. ecosystem services, biodiversity and well-being During the session on \u2018Traditional agricultural landscapes and community conserved areas\u2019 at the International Congress on Ethnobiology of 2011, it was stated that \u201cthese [traditional agricultural landscapes] are rich in agro- biodiversity values as well as inherent wild biodiversity and cultural values, and encompass holistic knowledge and collective management systems and complex institutions of customary law. They play a vital role in ensuring resilience, ecosystem function, and livelihood and food sovereignty. Inextricably linked to the material values of these landscapes are their spiritual and cultural values. These special landscapes offer us beauty and a palpable sense of place. They are living landscapes worth living in\u201d (presented in Brown & Kothari, 2011). Still, it may be argued that there is an overall focus on drivers of landscape change \u2013 and often on the consecutive loss of ecosystem services, biodiversity and well-being \u2013 rather than on an effective assessment of the benefits provided by landscapes themselves. Beside sophisticated mapping and modelling exercises registering land-use change (Perpi\u00f1a Castillo et al., 2021; van Vliet et al., 2015) or bioclimatic evolution (Savo et al., 2016) or dating man-made structures (Turner et al., 2018) with a significant level of detail, benefits provided by landscapes are not always assessed in such a comprehensive and dynamic way. Instead, when they are not merely described, benefits are assessed singularly, i.e. in terms either of a single class of ecosystem services (Arslan & Kaymaz, 2020; Howlett et al., 2011; Paracchini et al., 2014; Picchi et al., 2019, the latter dealing with the relationship between renewable energy and ecosystem services for landscape planning and design), or of biodiversity (Atik et al., 2012; Bassols Isamat et al., 2011; Dudley & Stolton, 2012; Manenti, 2014; Santoro et al., 2020; Saadaoui et al., 2018).

(2021) inquire into Montados\u2019 cork value chain, suggesting \u201cpotential leverage points for sustainability in the landscape of origin, which could eventually bring a positive trickle-effect of benefits for the whole sector\u201d. The question of ecosystem services\u2019 management \u201ccosts\u201d is tackled by Campos et al. (2021) in the national context of Portugal and by Rocchi et al. (2019) in the case of Natura 2000 sites in Umbria, Italy, suggesting that they are significantly lower than related benefits (see also Shirvani Dastgerdi (2020) still in the context of Central Italy, Dimopoulos et al. (2017) on the Greek context, Flinzberger et al. (2020) on agroforestry labels in the Mediterranean area). Indeed, recent studies emphasize the opportunity to consider benefit \u2018bundles\u2019 (Meacham et al., 2022) or \u2018baskets\u2019 (Morgan et al., 2022), or landscapes\u2019 \u2018multifunctionality\u2019, the latter consisting in \u2018the capacity of a landscape to simultaneously support multiple benefits to society from its interacting ecosystems\u2019 (Mastrangelo et al., 2014). Such capacity relies as much upon to landscapes\u2019\u2019 management and local practices (especially in terms of land use, see Crouzat et al., 2015), as upon \u201clandscape features, most notably a mosaic of land uses, scattered tree cover, low-intensity livestock grazing, rich landscape structure, and unfragmented ecosystems, underpin the biodiversity and ecosystem services values\u201d (Plieninger et al., 2021, in the case of the dehesa system). On the other hand, multifunctionality also requires a realistic approach, as suggested by Pedroli et al. (2016), inasmuch as \u201cthe demand for multifunctionality has also overwhelmed agriculture as many of the functions that society expects today from rural areas cannot be provided by a single farm or managed by individual farmers\u201d, whilst \u2013 the same authors argue \u2013 \u201cthe polarising trends affecting European rural landscapes [have led] to a segregation of agricultural production landscapes and high-priority nature reserves\u201d. Similarly, Torquati et al. (2015), analysing \u201cTraditional Cultural Vineyard Landscapes\u201d in Italy in terms of wine farms\u2019 economic performance, suggest that \u201cthe key issue is not the contrast between those who support the costs of landscape preservation (vineyard owners) and those who reap its benefits (the community as a whole), but rather in the way in which the added value resulting from preservation of the landscape is being obtained and distributed\u201d. THE MULTIPLE VALUES OF CULTURAL LANDSCAPES 13 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL Following the brief discussion initiated in par. 3.2, it may be argued that a clear distinction between \u201cchallenges\u201d or \u201cthreats\u201d and \u201cbenefits\u201d is not always easy, both because of the complexity of landscape processes through time, which imply \u201ccontrasts and contingencies\u201d at various scales (Bevan & Conolly, 2013), and because of differing perceptions and potentially conflicting expectations regarding especially, but not exclusively, \u201cproductive functions [and] cultural values, including recreation and conservation values\u201d (Soy-Massoni, 2016b). Some studies thus develop an approach to how stakeholder perceive ecosystem services and biodiversity: for instance Sagie and Orenstein (2022) conclude, in the case of Mount Carmel Biosphere Reserve, that ecosystem services are considered overall \u201cas an empirical tool to influence decision-makers (instrumental), as a support tool to advance plans/actions/policies/initiatives that they are already advancing (strategic) and mostly as an effective rhetorical to raise public awareness (conceptual)\u201d.

This has led not only to a separation between nature and culture in policies, but also between science and humanities in the study and management of natural and cultural values, affecting the conservation of cultural heritage as well as the natural heritage\u201d (UNESCO-SCBD, 2014). Indeed, literature considered in this report generally suggests a sensible gap between landscape management at the local level, and policies which have an impact on both at national and international \u2013 and especially EU \u2013 level. On the one hand landscape management is generally considered as an opportunity for landscapes conservation and/or sustainable development. While as evoked in par. 3.1 it may be framed by specific principles and guidelines, labels and programmes are often presented as best practices that may be replicated elsewhere (Samuels, 2017; Osipova, 2014; Salizzoni, 2016). On the other hand, landscapes may not be sustained by \u201ca set of visions and more concrete objectives for protection and change, a number of strategic projects which are more or less comprehensively described, and a spatial outline to which the objectives and projects refer\u201d, for instance, Pedroli et al. (2016) observe the implementation of such landscape strategies in the two Northern Europe cases they analyse, but not in Portuguese case of Serpa olive groves. Based upon a systematic literature review and following expert discussions, Sayer et al. (2013) develop \u201cten principles for a landscape approach to reconciling agriculture, conservation, and other competing land uses\u201d. Policies evolve as much as landscapes themselves, moreover, several policy sectors affect landscapes in various ways. At the EU level, Pedroli et al. (2016) identify \u201ctwo policy agendas affecting European landscape\u201d: THE SUSTAINABILITY AGENDA has become an important policy agenda involving a large number of high-level policymakers in the public debate. It has grown steadily in terms of the number of issues covered and the significance of the competence. Objectives and regulations are often filtered down through the various levels becoming more and more landscape specific at the low levels. THE MARKET AGENDA, on the other hand, is highly centralised and most policy decisions are now high-level decisions, usually made at the EU level or in countries outside the EU, but in both cases increasingly compliant with WTO regulations. This agenda is characterised by de-regulation and expanding markets, leaving few competences to local or regional bodies. Agricultural and land market policies are now decided at the EU level for most of Europe. Consequently, the integration of environmental and societal concerns into the market policy agenda can only take place at the higher levels even though the European Treaty prescribes that policy integration must be ensured. Thus, highly globalised technologies and market forces are becoming increasingly influential and the local farmer and the local community are losing autonomy. The most relevant feature of the \u201cmarket agenda\u201d is the Common Agricultural Policy, generally considered to have sustained intensification of agriculture in Southern Europe \u2013 the membership process of Croatia and the consequent application of the Policy is thus considered by Kale (2016) as \u201cthe second most important modern motion after post-feudal agrarian reforms\u201d \u2013, contributing also to a failure of the EU biodiversity strategy and of the Natura 2000 scheme (Palac\u00edn & Alonso, 2018), which themselves constitute prominent element THE MULTIPLE VALUES OF CULTURAL LANDSCAPES 15 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL of what Pedroli et al.

Furthermore, Agnoletti and Emanueli (2016) argue that if \u201cpolicies are devoted to the conservation of biodiversity and cultural heritage, [they are] rarely focused on the result of interactions between nature and culture expressed by the rural landscape\u201d. \u201cGreening measures\u201d introduced by the 2014 reform of CAP, which include rules on maintaining permanent grassland, crop diversification and Ecological Focus Areas (EFAs), have instead been acknowledged and their potential highlighted by Tzilivakis et al.

Regarding the broader international level, although it considers the Intergovernmental Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services\u2019 role for heritage rather than for cultural landscapes more specifically, Bridgewater\u2019s (2017) statement that \u201cexamining issues raised in assessments through the prism of heritage can help modify the utilitarian approaches and view of biodiversity and ecosystem services, enriching and humanising the IPBES outputs\u201d is significant. In that way \u2013 writes the same author \u2013 \u201cheritage issues can be effectively portrayed in IPBES outputs, then that process, in turn, will ensure IPBES outcomes reflect, and have positive impacts on, heritage practice and communication\u201d. Focusing instead on heritage professionals\u2019 perspectives on climate change, a similar reflection is proposed by Sesana et al. (2018). Many authors suggest, like Plieninger et al. (2021) about the dehesa system, that \u201cplenty of management and policy responses are available, but [that] there is a need to move from single-topic to cross sectorial, landscape-level approaches (Metzger et al., 2021). The dehesa system depends on measures and grants that fit the complexity of their biodiversity and ecosystem services values. Such policy responses should also take landowner and farmer perceptions, willingness, and capacity to innovate or to adopt measures for dehesa conservation into consideration. At the same time, the dehesa has become important for cultural identification and nature conservation, including the values and demands of a wider, more distant, and more urbanized society\u201d. Local practices, research and policies at regional, national and international levels may still be brought to a closer dialogue, and secure a more decisive role for cultural landscapes at the outset of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. THE MEDITERRANEAN AS A UNIQUE GROUND FOR MAINSTREAMING PRACTICES, RESEARCH AND POLICIES 16 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AT THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL \u201cIf the Mediterranean region is a microcosm of the world\u2019s problems, it also has many models to offer for sus- tainable development and human well-being in a beautiful and biologically diverse environment\u201d (Blondel, 2010). It has been identified as a biodiversity hotspot (Myers et al., 2000) and, as remarked in the Introduction to the Mediterranean strategy for sustainable development 2016\u20132025, \u201cwith its rich history and exceptional natural and cultural landscapes, its coasts accounted for 31 per cent of global tourist arrivals in 2011\u201d (UNEP/MAP, 2016). As illustrated in this report, many publications consider the Mediterranean scale, either as the broader context for case-studies or as the scale for typological or comparison analysis, focused for instance on landscapes characterized by a specific dominant feature like tree-crops (mainly olives, chestnuts, cork oaks and almonds). Indeed, \u201clong-established Mediterranean land management practices have created a socioecological system with an extraordinary wealth of actors, practices, biodiversity, and ecosystem services, a system that has raised European and global conservation interest\u201d (Plieninger et al., 2021). As for policies with a relevant im- pact \u2013 be it intended or not \u2013 on landscapes, they may be developed, implemented and assessed in a coherent way among the EU countries on its northern shore. \u201cThe physical configuration of the Mediterranean structures, the flow of people, plants, animals, objects and ideas in specific directions, with important effects over both the short and long term\u201d. What Bevan and Conolly (2013) write about Antikythera, which \u201csits at one of those geographically nodal points where the resulting con- trasts and contingencies are particularly powerful\u201d, may apply to many other landscapes in the Mediterranean, which benefits for people and the environment outreach its borders. 4.

This manual is about the most common invasive alien species (IAS) in the Eastern Mediter- ranean Sea, mostly originating from the Red Sea, creating socio-economic and ecological impacts on various levels. The manual highlights the current situation of IAS in the East- ern Mediterranean, and mainly focuses on the management measures of IAS, existing legislations and action plans, mit- igation measures and implementation of the controlling pro- cedures with different aspects and practices among various disciplines and across regions. The manual is designed for a varied audience from Marine Protected Area (MPA) managers to local authorities, from scientists to non-governmental or- ganisations that are involved in the in the management of IAS.

But for the first time in geological history, this is because of the activities of a single species inhabiting the world for only the last 300.000 years: Homo sapiens. Biodiversity has various levels, including 8.7 million species (90% of which are still waiting to be discovered), the variety among the genetic pool and how all these organisms inter- act with each other, consequently creating the landscapes and habitats within (Verma, 2016).

Our current state of knowledge suggests that the historical period we are in is another one of these devastating periods of biodiversity loss at all levels (Ghaly, 2022). One of the three major threats impacting biodiversity is the overharvesting of natural resources, such as overfishing or the overexploitation of renewables to the point of diminish- ing returns. Another significant factor is the destruction and fragmentation of certain habitats in which species used to thrive, through urbanisation and mass agricultural defor- estation. Finally, the anthropogenic introductions of new alien species into different parts of the world through com- mercial transportation and recently constructed passage- ways (sometimes intentionally) has always been problematic in many ecosystems. Biological invasions are among the top drivers of biodiversity loss and, on occasions, species ex- tinctions across the world. A 2016 study published in the journal Biological Letters showed that IAS are the second most common threat associated with terrestrial species that have gone completely extinct since 1500 (Bellard et al., 2016). As its name suggests, the Mediterranean Sea (Medi-Terra) has been in between lands, mostly inhabited and civilised for millennia. Increases in recreational and industrial usage, coastal development, pollution and overfishing have been the harshest human activities in the Mediterranean, especially in the eastern basin, where the effects of climate change seem to be more pronounced than elsewhere. Recently, invasive alien species have been recognised as a major threat. The Mediterranean Sea is often regarded by the scientific commu- nity as the world\u2019s most invaded sea (Giakoumi et al., 2019a). IAS are species introduced into ecosystems outside their nat- ural range, causing negative impacts on native biodiversity and major impacts on human health, livelihoods and food security. IAS undermine the progress towards achieving many of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. A further complication is the increasing rate of new introductions and the compounded impacts from IAS by climate change. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 increased the influx of IAS into the Mediterranean. It is estimated that 70-90% of the alien species in the Mediterranean Sea are coming from Suez Canal via increased commercial transportation and by active- ly swimming juveniles and adults or current drifting as an egg or a larva. Currently, based on scientific analysis, 838 alien species exist in the Mediterranean Sea, while it is estimated that the real number is as high as 1000. Among the affected areas are the seas around Turkey with a total of up to 539 IAS (404 species already having an established status). Of these species, 413 were recorded in the Levantine Sea and 253 in the Aegean Sea. Of the total amount of catch in the industrial fisheries of Iskenderun Bay, Turkey, 62% are alien species. Israel reported 452 alien species very recently. In spite of the difficulties to choose the criteria to consider a species as the \u201cworst\u201d alien species, the general consensus is that the algae Caulerpa spp., the lionfish Pterois miles and the pufferfish Lagocephalus sceleratus are among the most harmful and all are well established species in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea (\u00c7inar et al., 2021; Zenetos et al., 2015; Zenetos et al., 2022). IAS are not only an environmental problem, but can also im- pact economy and safety. Thus, a cross-sectoral approach must be taken to address the effects of these species. The approach must include the environment, human health, ag- riculture, fisheries, governmental departments (such as cus- toms and transport), along with key private sector bodies and civil society in general. The most cost-effective measure to address the impacts from IAS is to prevent their intro- duction in the first place. This can be achieved by estab- lishing effective and well-resourced biosecurity measures to manage priority pathways of introduction, supported by early warning systems and rapid removal capacity. In conse- quence, control, containment and \u2013 where feasible \u2013 erad- ication need to be undertaken to mitigate the impacts from established IAS, including those whose impacts are likely to increase due to climate change.

After overexploita- tion, IAS have been identified as the second most prevalent cause of island endemics and mainland species extinction (Bellard et al., 2016), and their ecological consequences can spread across the food web and disrupt ecosystem func- tioning (Gallardo et al., 2016). In addition, invasive species have significant socioeconomic and health consequences (Vil\u00e0 and Hulme, 2017), as well as the potential to deplete ecosystem services (Walsh et al., 2016). As a result, their management is critical for the conservation of biodiversity and human well-being. International institutions have ex- pressly recognised the need to regulate and remove biolog- ical incursions and have established related targets (e.g. the Aichi Target 9 set by the Convention on Biological Diversity). High environmental connectedness through the water medi- um endorses species dispersal in the marine environment, making efforts to manage biological invasions more difficult. The larger the invaded region and the greater the invader\u2019s dis- persal capacity, the more difficult it is to manage the invader\u2019s population (Williams and Grosholz, 2008; Galil et al., 2015). As a result, when deciding how to control a biological invasion, it is critical to consider the size of the invaded area as well as the species\u2019 dispersal capacity. Unless and until solid evidence suggests otherwise, every alien species should be managed as though it is potentially invasive. Once an invasion process has begun and the IAS are in the process of becoming estab- lished, no control of alien species is feasible that would not also harm other components of the biota; therefore, the goal highlighted in the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in art. 8(h), calling for contracting parties \u201cas far as possible Management measures of invasive alien species 2 and as appropriate, (to) prevent the introduction of, control, or eradicate those alien species which threaten ecosystems, habitats, or species\u201d can only be partially met, especially by the eastern Mediterranean countries where the existing inva- sion process is unmatched anywhere else in the world. As long as the Suez Canal remains open, not much can be done to manage invasive alien species in the Eastern Med- iterranean. A noteworthy increase in the number of intro- duced species due to the Suez Canal expansion is a result of sea level change through the canal over time, a decrease in the salinity level of hypersaline lakes (Bitter Lake) and a reduction in the freshwater outflows of the Nile following the construction of the Aswan Dam, which was a freshwater barrier at the entryway of the Mediterranean. Furthermore, global climate change will continue to increase the number of introduced species if aforementioned causes are not ac- curately and carefully monitored and necessary manage- ment measures are not taken (\u00c7inar et al., 2021). A comprehensive approach to invasive species manage- ment should consider the following factors: the expected impacts of these species on native ecosystems, the avail- able technical intervention options, their likelihood of suc- cess and cost, the risks associated with management and the extent of public and stakeholder support for the pro- posed interventions (Hulme, 2006). The goal of this manual is to provide recommendations on how to prioritise man- agement actions for the control of certain marine invasive species with an emphasis on the Eastern Mediterranean. Depending on the status, there are numerous different ways to manage invasive alien species as stated below (Figure 1): 1. Prevention 2. Early warning/Detection 3. Removal 4. Control/Containment 5.

The opening of new communication channels between research- ers and the public and decreasing costs make it easier to ob- tain large data sets. Scientists and experts are able to make efficient use of digital opportunities to collect data sets and manage them with a goal for common understanding. Organ- isations such as IUCN\u2019s Invasive Species Specialist Group are working to collect data on a common platform. There are many web-based mapping systems that document invasive species like EDDMapS and ImapInvasives and enable citizens to participate in scientific studies without years of specialised training by helping to gather bigger, better data sets. Remote sensing technology has also proven to be a pow- erful tool to track biological invasion in recent years (Joshi et al., 2004). Some of its well-documented benefits include multi-band data, multi-time coverage and cost-effectiveness (Van der Meer et al., 2002). Integrated GIS and remote sens- ing are consistently applied to map the distribution of plant and animal species, their ecosystems, landscapes, biocli- matic conditions and factors that facilitate invasions (Stow et al., 2000; Los et al., 2002). Geographic information systems can represent the spread of IAS over time and their distribu- tion in the region in a simple and understandable way. This clearer and more accurate picture helps decision-makers to better understand the complex data gathered to track inva- sive species, their relations with local species and their dis- tribution, behaviours and effects on the region. Better and more comprehensible data fosters more sustainable policies and regulations. Indeed, there are 13 clear and important benefits to GIS and IAS studies, namely; ing the processes and responses occurring at the various scales (Kueffer et al., 2010). Invasive management in general has to transition away from long-term control and toward prevention, eradication and biological control, which can be considerably more efficient and enable for more problems to be addressed for a given budget. It is critical that IAS prevention and management methods take a cross-sec- toral approach. Local volunteer organisations, fishers and wildlife enthusiasts can help monitor the coastal waters and provide additional information to aid in the early detection of new invasive species in some Mediterranean MPAs and other coastal areas. More importantly, the participation of local volunteers can have other benefits, such as fostering a sense of ownership and appreciation for the local marine environment (Cuthbert et al., 2022). 2.1.1 THE ROLE OF GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN MONITORING INVASIVE ALIEN SPECIES Invasive species overtake natural communities, and many native species that cannot cope with how this spread affects their niches have become locally extinct or are in danger of extinction, particularly in island communities (Richardson et al., 2000; Py\u0161ek et al., 2004; Richardson et al., 2011; Essl et al., 2018). With the development of satellite, mapping and photographing technologies, central and local governments can apply the data gathered by Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to infrastructure construction, environmental management, spatial planning, education, health, national security and economic planning to support the agriculture, forestry, tourism and transportation industries.

When prevention, early detec- tion and fast reaction measures are ineffective, eradication may be the best choice for managing established species and permanent control (Wittenberg and Cock 2001). It must be taken into consideration that if alien species are neglect- ed or go unreported until they have established themselves in the local ecosystems, eradication will become difficult, costly or impossible. When a critical species is recognised at an early stage of colonisation and has a limited spatial distribution, eradication of some species may be achieved, whereas a big initial expenditure in eradication or biological control may result in a more cost-effective long-term result. For the management of IAS, many nations have already de- veloped Risk Analysis (RA) and Environmental Impact As- sessment (EIA) methods, which are mandated by specific international instruments. The challenge will be to apply these to IAS prevention, eradication and control (Genove- si and Monaco, 2014). Measures of risk analysis should be used to identify and evaluate the relevant risks of a proposed action involving alien species, as well as to determine the appropriate measures to be implemented. EIA plays an im- portant role in deciding whether or not to carry out specific processes or activities (Shine et al., 2010). It is critical to assess relevant policies, legislation and institu- tions in order to detect conflicts, gaps and inconsistencies, as well as to reinforce or adopt effective national measures for the prevention, eradication and control of alien species. It is advised that priority IAS eradication programs be pro- moted, considering their potential or current impact on bio- diversity, food security and human well-being, and to give priority to crucial regions such as islands, protected areas and key points of entry such as ports. Because the control of hazardous invasive species can generate advantages that are for the public good, it necessitates public investment in prevention, eradication, control, mitigation and adaptation (Shine et al., 2010). GIS is an invaluable tool to fight threats of IAS because it produces more comprehensible results at lower costs (\u00c7a- buk, 2015). Indeed, GIS approaches generate user-friendly and understandable results in many topics and fields that make our daily lives easier and more sustainable (Ko\u00e7ak, 2009). GIS is used in more than 100 disciplines, but its role in the early detection, control and prevention of the spread of IAS is paramount (Bing\u00fcl et al., 2016). 2.2 EARLY DETECTION Early warning and rapid response to bio invasions is a criti- cal pillar of an effective management plan since it is far more operative and cost effective than suppressing IAS once they have established themselves. Early detection of an IAS can mean the difference between being able to achieve viable goals (eradication) and having to resort to a containment strategy that usually necessitates a long-term financial com- mitment. Early detection demands a coordinated structure for surveillance and monitoring operations, identifying invad- ing species, assessing dangers, sharing information, devel- oping warning lists and selecting and enforcing appropri- ate remedies.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "30213280-bc44-412e-b8e3-f933c8797630": {"__data__": {"id_": "30213280-bc44-412e-b8e3-f933c8797630", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/manual-invasive-alien-species-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Manual of invasive alien species in the Eastern Mediterranean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/manual-invasive-alien-species-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b39b54354157d67188cdb1cc202f6cecc977e500c1dd50697dbaca06a6d72cfa"}, "2": {"node_id": "46e06ac0-9802-4d4d-a288-2b252e91a4da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/manual-invasive-alien-species-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "491f22334f710ec2b545bde4b268a30a9aa0172338b32dcd0ab906df8b23fbb4"}}, "hash": "701195b4351d6d5817a7ad02e7380fcf20c5fbfd000b46fc92ac798007c6d8d3", "text": "The public\u2019s support, as well as contingency planning and financial mechanisms, are critical.

Because invasive behaviour for the same species may vary across the region, particular interventions for spe- cific regions should be endorsed. Cooperative monitoring surveys with research or community groups (such as div- ing clubs) could also help to detect new and increasing IAS populations. Marine monitoring is costly and time-consum- ing, but training volunteers to conduct marine surveys can dramatically improve both prevention and early detection of invasive species, while also compensating for the with limit- ed financial support. 2.4.1 MARINE PROTECTED AREAS AND BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) form the cornerstone of marine conservation. They have emerged as a prominent management tool for the conservation and recovery of ma- rine ecosystems and their ecosystem services (Lubchen- co and Grorud-Colvert, 2015; Sala and Giakoumi, 2018). Despite the availability of a large amount of information on MPAs, the effects of protection on marine IAS remain large- ly unknown (Burfeind et al., 2013; Ardura et al., 2016; Giak- oumi and Pey, 2017). Different mechanisms could explain how MPAs can con- trol the presence and reduce the impacts of IAS within their borders. First, vectors of alien species are expected to be fewer in MPAs because many human uses, such as aqua- culture and marine traffic, are forbidden or restricted (Ardura et al., 2016). Secondly, based on the \u2018biotic resistance hy- pothesis\u2019 (i.e. ecosystems with high species richness are more resistant to invaders than those with low biodiversity; Levine and D\u2019Antonio, 1999), the high native species richness within MPAs could prevent the penetration and settlement of alien species. Thirdly, the restoration of top-down regulation processes (e.g. restoration of top predators\u2019 populations) in MPAs could help control the population of some alien species inside MPAs (e.g. Mumby et al., 2011 but see also Hackerott et al., 2013). On the other hand, several mechanisms could support the opposite argument that MPAs favour the spread- ing of alien species. For example, according to the \u2018biotic acceptance hypothesis\u2019, ecosystems can accommodate the establishment of alien species and their coexistence with native species, and based on a rich-get-richer pattern, ar- eas with high native species richness could support high numbers of alien species (Stohlgren et al., 2006; Fridley et al., 2007). Moreover, alien species could thrive well in MPAs, mainly because they would benefit from harvesting bans and restrictions applying within the MPA (Burfeind et al., 2013). Lastly, MPAs may have no effect on alien species as most of them have dispersal mechanisms that expand beyond the MPA boundaries (Burfeind et al., 2013). Assessing the effects of MPAs on invasive species is crucial for the effective management of existing MPAs as well as for the optimal site selection for future MPAs (Giakoumi et al., 2016). If MPAs prove to have no effect or favour the settle- ment and expansion of IAS, then the location of new MPAs in impacted areas should either be avoided (Boudouresque and Verlaque, 2005) or complemented with other manage- ment measures for the mitigation of invasive species\u2019 im- pacts (Thresher and Kuris, 2004; Giakoumi et al., 2019). 2.4 CONTROL After an IAS has become lastingly established or extensive- ly spread, the only steps that may be possible to prevent the species\u2019 further expansion and negative impact on the en- vironment are control approaches. Response and manage- ment control mechanisms for marine species by responsi- ble authorities, on the other hand, are little understood, and measures that work in one region may not work in another. Coordination with many stakeholder groups, as well as ex- pert consultation and assistance, are required to discover cost-effective and realistic solutions to some of these inva- sions. Species that cannot be eradicated, particularly those that have spread widely, should be considered candidates for biological control, genetic techniques or similar means of achieving permanent population or impact reduction (IUCN, 2018).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9ba94d3a-b231-47a0-a128-ba02faab86bd": {"__data__": {"id_": "9ba94d3a-b231-47a0-a128-ba02faab86bd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/manual-invasive-alien-species-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Manual of invasive alien species in the Eastern Mediterranean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/manual-invasive-alien-species-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8b446ec6437710e34d534da3919f04ab4c7255f248b4268cf37342a5c784ea8d"}, "2": {"node_id": "ed60bf2c-017b-434c-b81d-ab6ad39f67be", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/manual-invasive-alien-species-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "642ee696b072f162b490def9ce3a9b9cc1d75bb5e77428f28bdcc60a4880a8a9"}}, "hash": "c77fc8589e8f93665064858af1cc712cb25edb4400a6683c6ca30b1a73348627", "text": "Many ways for controlling IAS are available; these tools can be used individually or in various combinations (Wittenberg and Cock, 2001).

If the target species already has well-stud- ied control agents available, biocontrol can be inexpensive. Consider some of the appropriate targets, and use publicity to inform of the importance of biocontrol by demonstrating accomplishments and sound science. A control project that can successfully be completed (not just with successful control, but also with no negative consequences), has the potential to drastically alter public opinion. If an invasive species has already spread, species-specific biological management may be the only viable option. Eco- nomic assessments of effective biological control programs have revealed a good cost-benefit ratio, despite the fact that some failed attempts had severe environmental con- sequences. Modern biological control safety standards are extremely stringent, requiring great specificity of the agents recommended as well as intensive laboratory and field screening procedures. Biological management is frequently the only long-term self-sustaining method that is also the least intrusive in locations where biodiversity is highly valued (CBD/COP/14/INF/9, 2018). 2/ MANAGEMENT MEASURES OF INVASIVE ALIEN SPECIES | 6 2.7 MITIGATION Where control of an invasive species\u2019 population is too expen- sive or difficult through any of the ways mentioned above, miti- gation of its impacts through methods other than managing the invasive species itself can be considered (IUCN, 2018). Mitiga- tion can reduce or eliminate the chance of a species establish- ing or spreading, as well as minimise or remove the presence of an IAS. Mitigation might take the form of eradication (total elimination of the IAS), containment (keeping the IAS within de- fined borders) or suppression (reducing population levels of the IAS to an acceptable threshold) (Hulme, 2006). The determina- tion of the management goal is a vital initial step in a mitigation program. Creating a platform for IAS mitigation and monitoring on a regional scale through cross-sectoral and interagency re- search and management can be an important tool. 2.8 ADAPTATION As a result, IAS populations are expected to evolve adapta- tions that will lead to exponential growth and further spread in the near future. Adaptation entails changing one\u2019s be- haviour in order to lessen the impact of an invading species. Adaptive management, also known as \u2018learning by doing\u2019, provides an appropriate framework for developing collabora- tive and transdisciplinary approaches aimed at overcoming the difficulties connected with IAS (Allen, 2000; Johnson et al., 2015). Adaptive management entails describing dynamic models of the case-study system that are parameterised with empirical data and recursively updated by monitoring the system\u2019s response to management actions. This technique assists in dealing with uncertainties, quantitatively combines current knowledge, addresses the various characteristics of IAS management and assesses the efficacy of measures. \u2794\ufffd The relevant environmental, social, cultural and economic impacts of IAS, including their spatial and temporal distribution; \u2794\ufffd The spatio-temporal dynamics of the target species, with a focus on understanding and forecasting how dis per sal and population recovery after management shape reinvasion and spread; \u2794\ufffd The relationship between the abundance of the focal IAS and its relevant impacts in the focal areas; \u2794\ufffd Economic methods to estimate both the benefits and costs of interventions to spatially develop and rank prioritisation of cost-effective actions to manage interventions associated with IAS in space and time. 2.5 CONTAINMENT Containment refers to keeping an IAS inside a specific area. Species that cannot be eradicated with the resources avail- able (Cacho and Pheloung, 2007), but have not expanded widely, or that are useful or important to people and hence cannot be destroyed or controlled biologically, should be contained within enclosed areas if possible. A success- ful eradication program frequently necessitates contain- ment intervention. A program of this nature must be sci- ence-based and have a reasonable likelihood of success. It is critical that all key stakeholders participate in the process. The public\u2019s support and acceptance of eradication mea- sures is also critical (McNeely et al., 2001).

Observance and regular monitoring are key components of any sound IAS management program, and such action can result in lower cost and resource use than initiating a long-term control program after an alien spe- cies is established.

Despite this, manag- ers have been hesitant to advocate and create methods for exploitation of IAS in the Mediterranean Sea, often due to a common belief that all IAS have negative consequences based on misconception or misdirection (Figure 2). Before supporting the sustainable exploitation of \u201cquestion- able species\u201d, a complete assessment of IAS consequences on ecosystem services to the Eastern Mediterranean region is required, including impacts on other fisheries. A risk as- sessment has to be applied for the targeted species in order to define if the species is low or high risk based on their impacts on biodiversity, habitat, ecosystems, socio-econo- my and human health. If the targeted species is considered to be low risk, regular monitoring and surveillance protocols can be implemented. If the targeted species is considered to be high risk, the distribution patterns (e.g. locally or widely spread) must be determined in order to choose the removal methods, amount of effort and related cost analysis. If the species can be removed by existing fisheries techniques, they can be promoted in fisheries markets as alternative op- tions to the consumers. If special methods or techniques are required for the removal, certain protocols and regulations can be developed in collaboration with authorities, deci- sion-makers, NGOs, fishers and related stakeholders.

It is known to be one of the most successful and aggressive invading fish species, damaging ecosystems through preda- tion and niche occupation. First recorded in 1985 in Florida (Ruttenberg, 2012), the lionfish extended to the Western Atlan- tic coasts in the 1990s and the rest of the Caribbean during the last 15 years. The most likely vector of introduction is the aquarium trade by intended and/or unintended release, al- though ballast water transportation cannot be ruled out (John- ston and Purkis, 2011). A complete removal of lionfish from in- vaded ecosystems is impossible; however, it is still top priority in terms of ecosystem services recovery (Albins, 2015). The lionfish has been recently established in the Levantine basin, which may unfavourably affect not only the struc- 3.1.1 LIONFISH IN THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN SEA Scientific name: Pterois miles Common name(s): Lionfish, turkey fish. Lionfish is a common name for several species from the teleost fish family of Scorpaenidae. IDENTIFICATION: Pterois miles is a marine, reef-associat- ed Actinopterid fish, living in the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea, south to Port Alfred, South Africa and east to Sumatra, Indonesia. It has 13 dorsal spines, 9-11 dorsal soft rays, 3 anal spines and 6-7 anal soft rays (Eschmeyer, 1986). It is a very attractive reddish to tan or grey-coloured fish with wing-like patterns of stunning fin structures; it is very resilient and tolerant to various water parameters and environmental conditions, and it is spectacularly colourful. Therefore, it is one of the most popular aquarium fish among the hobbyists of the world. However, these properties make this species very dangerous as well: (i) its colour and pattern scheme is a warning that it is highly venomous, to an extent that on rare occasions, it can kill a human with a weak immune system; (ii) its resilience and tolerance make it a very persistent spe- cies which can withstand various and even ever-changing conditions in different ecosystem types; (iii) having a high re- production and feeding rate, it can sweep ecosystems easily particularly in the absence of frequent natural predators or A juvenile lionfish (Photo: Mehmet Fatih Huseyinoglu) tou et al., 2016) raising serious concerns for the potential impacts on the local marine ecosystems and the native spe- cies, given the experience from other regions (Albins and Hixon, 2008). MANAGEMENT STRATEGY: To the best of our knowledge, none of the Eastern Mediterranean countries attempted to eradicate the lionfish during the initial phases of the invasion due to a variety of expected reasons. In fact, eradicating li- onfish (or any other successfully established marine invasive alien species) with currently available tools and technology is almost impossible (C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 2014). Common problems require regional and international cooperation, but many Mediterranean countries face similar constraints in the in- vasive species efforts, such as low public awareness (the situation in Lebanon has been examined by Azzurro and Bariche, 2017), inadequate monitoring capacity, absence of clear and agreed priorities for action, lack of effective emer- gency response measures, outdated or inadequate legisla- tion and poor coordination between government and other stakeholders (Genovesi and Shine, 2004). Acting for invasive alien species through gastronomy is a popular approach both in terrestrial and aquatic ecosys- tems (Nu\u00f1ez et al., 2012). In the case of lionfish, promoting targeted removals for consumption in the context of food/ cooking festivals is extremely attractive and has gained the attention of citizens, especially in the Caribbean and nearby areas (Frazer et al., 2012). Such campaigns, when designed properly, have been proven valuable tools for lowering the ture and function of local ecosystems, but also the econ- omy, fisheries, biodiversity and even human health. So far it is understood that this undesired introduction is probably a recent event, and the current lionfish populations in the Mediterranean are a product of multiple invasion events via the Suez Canal. Its range expansion speed is remarkably high; the species crossed the eastern basin just within two years, reaching Italy and Tunisia.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6748db0e-4baa-4c62-9a91-fd56db1d0293": {"__data__": {"id_": "6748db0e-4baa-4c62-9a91-fd56db1d0293", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/manual-invasive-alien-species-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Manual of invasive alien species in the Eastern Mediterranean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/manual-invasive-alien-species-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c55e9dbf079e6c354966d5c393a4fbbd5c5e46115a9e0320c750c74d1db74929"}, "2": {"node_id": "ff54559e-b244-4f1e-87f2-0e6e7c4ec9e3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/manual-invasive-alien-species-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b3dbfdf59a1c276499dd820be58ad1f0c1acb5440e31d7f0e2840bc0bf4ffc1c"}}, "hash": "7dda9d4749aa3305edb5f85b29dc52a8b66227d518c9452f3324a2b171872079", "text": "The P. miles individual re- corded off the Israeli coast during 1991 (Golani and Sonin, 1992) was an indication of a single species record.

THE STORY OF AN INVASION: THE MARBLED AND THE DUSKY SPINEFOOT IN GREECE Scientific name(s): Siganus luridus and Siganus rivulatus Common name(s): Marbled and the dusky spinefoot One of the most intriguing aspects of ichthyology is com- mon names. Every species has different names in different locations and languages. For the most common species, sometimes these names originate from the ancient times. For others, these are relatively new. In this latter category, one can find IAS that make an appearance in a new area and people (fishers in particular) use their imagination and creativity to find names for them. As an example, the fam- ily Siganidae are called rabbitfishes due to the similarity of their snout with that of rabbits (Froese and Pauly, 2022). In Greece, there are currently two species of Siganidae: Sig- anus rivulatus (Forsskal & Niebuhr, 1775), known as the Mar- bled spinefoot and S. luridus (R\u00fcppell, 1829), known as the Dusky spinefoot.. The first one to arrive in the Greek waters was S. rivulatus, reported in 1925 from the island of Symi (south-east Aegean Sea; Dodecanese Islands) (Zenetos et al., 2020), and due to its resemblance to the native Salpa sarpa (Linnaeus, 1758) salema (salpa in Greek), it was called \u201cagriosalpa\u201d (wild salpa). The second one was first spotted in 1964 in Tilos island (south-east Aegean Sea; Dodecanese Islands) (Kavalakis, 1968), located approximately 35 km west of Symi. Siganus luridus has a dark khaki colour and a roundish shape. An anecdotal version of the story behind its common name says that in the eyes of the Greek fishers it looked very much like the helmets worn by the German soldiers during WWII. Hence, they called it \u201cgermanos\u201d (Ger- man). In the following years, fishers and others started call- ing both species \u201cgermanos\u201d and in order to tell them apart, they used the epithet \u201cwhite\u201d and \u201cblack\u201d, for S. rivulatus and S. luridus respectively. expansion rates of P. miles and P. volitans by turning these unstoppable predators into a delicacy and at the same time enhancing participation and promoting citizen stewardship. The \u201cLionfish Removal and Awareness Day Festival\u201d in Flor- ida is a successful example, in which scuba divers, celeb- rity chefs, conservationists and the general public come together in a festival where everyone can taste a big variety of lionfish dishes, and where the public can learn about the problem and jointly move towards mitigation. Different reci- pes have been developed and a lot of chefs have mastered gourmet lionfish dishes, while the public continues consum- ing the species year-round. Experiences from the West At- lantic invasion was applied for the first time in the Mediterra- nean Sea in Cyprus (Jimenez et al., 2016). A lionfish removal competition, which is held periodically in Cyprus, is becom- ing increasingly common with the participation of interested stakeholders including divers, authorities, NGOs and the local public. With this competition, divers are encouraged to eradicate only lionfish; applying a specific method by pole spear fishing is highly effective.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9ac1bd2b-2f6c-41ba-89ea-702aefa10435": {"__data__": {"id_": "9ac1bd2b-2f6c-41ba-89ea-702aefa10435", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/manual-invasive-alien-species-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Manual of invasive alien species in the Eastern Mediterranean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/manual-invasive-alien-species-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8b90c7412219f396f2103fbe393cf1b36d3b53baa4ade760329e55dc93280056"}, "2": {"node_id": "ba42d6bd-ee22-414c-99d5-4a6a576d4390", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/manual-invasive-alien-species-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "99ea5a75b525d047620deafa251b8efb708eb8ee851cfc37262d208b6079b879"}}, "hash": "100724f4900c62839164838a43e3f1c7a32193c723bd1d3467a67623ba5a6910", "text": "However, it must be taken into consideration that lionfish could soon re-invade; there- fore, coordinated monitoring and further targeted removal events might be necessary. In addition, the fish collected are then cleaned and served to the participants, after being informed about the lionfish. Since the dorsal, anal and pelvic fins have venomous spines, they should be handled very carefully. Thanks to these events, lionfish is now a well de- manded fish in Cyprus. Moreover, jewellery and accessories made from dried fins and spines have been on sale in the western Atlantic for years and now a few countries in the Eastern Mediterranean have also started producing similar garments, such as earrings, pendants and cocktail sticks. It is also proposed that lionfish should be included on the EU list of invasive species of concern (EU Regulation 1143/2014) and regional management actions are needed.

Howev- er, Siganus spp. not only feed on algae, but they graze with very high intensity on underwater vegetation creating barrens (i.e.areas that completely lack algal coverage). Apart from the direct effect on the algal communities, there are several other impacts of spinefoots\u2019 feeding habits, such as alteration of the rocky infralittoral food webs, habitat loss for a wide va- riety of animals, loss of spawning and recruitment grounds for fishes and the extirpation of other fish species (Sala et al., 2011; Giakoumi, 2014; Katsanevakis et al., 2015, 2020). Apart from their impacts on the environment, the spinefoots have significant effects on ecosystem services too. Fishers com- plain about the fact that the spinefoots are traumatogenic, and their sting is a really painful one, though not life-threaten- ing to adult humans, and the swelling caused can last several hours (Galil, 2018). The species use their venomous spines in defence, and one should be careful when fishing and han- dling them. In certain areas of the country, their density is quite high and they are being caught in substantial amounts in fishing nets (Corsini-Foka et al., 2017; Brodersen and Vassi- lopoulou, 2018). In some regions, where the species do not have high commercial value, these high densities are prob- lematic for the fishers as they are being negatively affected by these big catches. Small-scale fishers report that if they catch spinefoots, then the amounts of other species caught are sig- nificantly reduced. Moreover, it is very difficult to disentangle these fishes from their nets (Galanidi Bingkiol, 2019; Galanidi et al., 2019). This has two main negative results. Firstly, the fishers have to cut the meshes of their nets in any attempt to remove the spinefoots caught. This results in destroyed nets that need to be fixed in order to be used again for fishing. In IDENTIFICATION: Both Siganus species have 13-14 dor- sal spines, 10 dorsal soft rays, 7 anal spines and 9 anal soft rays; however, luridus has 13 vertebrae, while rivulatus has 23. Therefore, S. luridus is shorter and stockier than S. rivulatus. The upper body of S. rivulatus is grey, green or brownish in colour and the lower body is iris iridescent silver or golden, with colour patterns extending to the fins. S. luri- dus is silvery to brown and even dark greenish, with regional variation in color (Woodland, 1990). Both species have na- tive ranges in the Western Indian Ocean, several locations in East Africa and the Red Sea (Woodland, 1990). INFORMATION: These two species have entered the Medi- terranean through the Suez Canal and have invaded the entire Eastern and Central Mediterranean with the exception of the northern Aegean Sea. The two spinefoots have been expand- ing in the Greek seas with a rather slow rate until the early 2000s. Since their first appearance in Greek waters, there were only very few new records of them. But in the beginning of the 22nd century, theya population explosion began. They became widespread in the Aegean, and with a time-lag in the Ionian Sea (Figure 3). Siganus luridus expanded faster than S. rivulatus and made its first appearance in the Ionian Sea in 1973, in Oxia island, at the outskirts of Patraikos Gulf (Central Ionian Sea) (Zenetos et al., 2020). On the contrary, it took S. rivulatus 83 years to expand its distribution to the west, with its first record from the Ionian Sea dating to 2008 from Sapientza island, in Messiniakos Gulf (South Ionian Sea) (Bardamaskos et al., 2009).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cf478987-70d3-4c41-a6f8-6a6627af4de7": {"__data__": {"id_": "cf478987-70d3-4c41-a6f8-6a6627af4de7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/manual-invasive-alien-species-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Manual of invasive alien species in the Eastern Mediterranean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/manual-invasive-alien-species-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "15ee5b3f3b10307f255c2d23428f9e7be0329fec40dfe8b9185771d69337a290"}, "2": {"node_id": "9f1cf9ac-0a23-4005-9ba9-7b0a4a402406", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/manual-invasive-alien-species-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c5e942d8a513df883202302320c96409f452e638ad140d24695209e1aa06b094"}}, "hash": "d52547c4e2d9184c504e018a181428012ffdd5718739c7add380e6e142b5eda5", "text": "Today, both species have very well-established populations in the central and southern parts of both the Ae- gean and Ionian Seas (Figure 2), whereas their records in the northern parts of the Greek seas are sporadic (ELNAIS, 2022). 3/ INVASIVE ALIEN SPECIES OF EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN | 14 FIGURE 3.

All the above \u2013 i.e. high catches, increased handling time and damaged nets \u2013 lead to loss of income, and at the same time increase the cost of each fishing operation without the equivalent in financial gain (Galanidi Bingkiol 2019; Galanidi et al., 2019). MANAGEMENT STRATEGY: Both species are edible and very highly esteemed elsewhere, like Cyprus, where they are sold as first quality fishes. Moreover, a recent study has shown that both species, and especially S. rivulatus, are ex- ceptionally rich in omega-6 fatty acids, and especially arachi- donic acid (ARA) (Grigorakis and Kotsiri, 2021; Grigorakis et al., 2022). ARA is an essential fatty acid for the development and good health of the human brain, and hence both spe- cies are high quality food and can be cooked fried or grilled. Unfortunately, Greek consumers in most regions do not in- clude these species in their dietary preference and therefore consumption is rather low. Indeed, the two species are not commercially exploited in most areas of Greece where they are fished as only in a few areas are they considered as commercial. The species are being sold in the Dodecanese Islands (where they are mostly appreciated) and to a less- er extent in Crete and the Cyclades, with a value ranging between \u20ac5-15 per kilo. In the areas where they are con- sumed, there is a developing m\u00e9ti\u00e8r (i.e. fishers know where, when and how to catch them) that could lead to increased income for the fishers. Indeed, in the Dodecanese Islands, people savour their taste and fishers earn good money out of exploiting them. However, as the species have become invasive in other areas of the Greek seas, this local trend should be expanded. And it is generally acknowledged that a well-organised campaign to inform the consumers would increase the commercial exploitation of these two species. Towards that direction, recently the Greek Ministry of Fish- eries funded a project (4ALIEN; www.4alien.gr) that aims to gain knowledge on the spinefoots\u2019 biology, ecology and dis- tribution, to explore ways of raising awareness and getting consumers to know and include them in their list of preferred fishes. In the southern coastline of Turkey, both of the spe- cies are the primary catches of the small-scale fishers and they are also highly preferred by locals. Annual festivals tar- geting spinefoots are being organised in collaboration with fishers, NGOs, local authorities, related stakeholders and the public to promote the fish not just for the locals, but for visitors as well. The price/kg of the species is increased an- nually, consequently increasing the incomes of the fishers. These kinds of festivals should be organised in the Eastern Mediterranean on a regular basis and should be coordinated with other countries. 3/ INVASIVE ALIEN SPECIES OF EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN | 15 3.1.3 GOATFISHES IN THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN Scientific name(s): Upeneus molluccensis, Parupeneus forsskali and Upeneus pori Common name(s): Goldband goatfish, Red Sea goatfish and Por\u2019s goatfish IDENTIFICATION: Upeneus molluccensis is a small fish which can reach to 22.5 cm, but a typical size is around 18 cm (Bilge et al, 2014; Lee, 1974).

Its name derives from its resemblance to a lizard (\u201csauros\u201d in Greek) (Romero, 2002). The spawning season of S. lessepsianus is prolonged and occurs nearly all year round, in the Gulf of Suez with two peaks in December and May (Amin et al., 2007). In the Mediterranean, the spawning season off the coast of Israel lasts from March to December (Golani, 1993), whereas at Iskenderun Bay, Turkey, spawning occurs mainly in two seasons: May-July and September-November (\u0130\u015fmen, 2003). Upeneus pori is another Lessepsian goatfish which can reach up to 19 cm in size. Similar to other goatfish species described above, U. pori also prefers soft bottoms, such as sand and mud. Upeneus pori (Photo:J.E. Randall) INFORMATION: Native species of goatfishes such as Mul- lus surmuletus and M. barbatus have been among the most desired and sought out fish in the Mediterranean Sea (Pav- lov and Emel, 2018). They are commercially important and the two species have been significant game fish in the past (Froese et al., 2022). However, since the mid-20th century, more than a few goatfish species have entered the basin via the Suez Canal to colonise parts of the Eastern Mediterra- nean. The goldband goatfish, Upeneus molluccensis has an Indo-West Pacific distribution from the Red Sea to New Caledonia and north to Japan in its native range (Uiblein and Heemstra, 2010). Upeneus molluccensis, was first reported from the Mediterranean from Palestine (Haas and Streinitz, 1947) and has colonised the eastern Mediterranean since. A more recent goatfish, which is commercialised even wid- er, is a relative, the Red Sea goatfish, Parupeneus forsskali, which also entered via the Suez Canal and established in the Eastern Mediterranean. The first confirmed record in the Mediterranean was from Beirut, although it has been spotted by visual sighting from southeastern Turkey (Bar- iche et al., 2013). Parupeneus forsskali has replaced the na- tive goatfish in many locations and has been an important commercial fish in the eastern basin (Evagelopoulos et al., 2020). Por\u2019s goatfish, Upeneus pori, is another Lessepsian goatfish which has a Western Indian Ocean native distribu- tion, reaching from the Red Sea to Oman, Madagascar and South Africa (Randall, 1995). Despite its first record dating back to 1989 (Ben-Tuvia and Golani, 1989), it is suggested that it has not been established as successful as U. molluc- censis or P. forsskali (Deidun et al., 2018). 3/ INVASIVE ALIEN SPECIES OF EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN | 16 Saurida lessepsianus from Red Sea, Egypt, Suez (Photo: S. Bogorodsky) 3.1.5 RANDALL\u2019S THREADFIN BREAM, NEMIPTERUS RANDALLI Scientific name: Nemipterus randalli Common name: Randall\u2019s threadfin bream IDENTIFICATION: Nemipterus randalli is a small to medi- um-sized, silvery pink-bodied ray-finned fish from the Ne- mipteridae family with a native distribution in the West Indian Ocean. It has a total of 10 dorsal spines, 9 dorsal soft rays, 3 anal spines and 7 anal soft rays. Its pectoral and pelvic fins are very long, reaching to or just beyond the level of origin of the anal fin. The upper lobe of its caudal fin produces into a long, trailing, light red filament (Russell, 1990).

This was confirmed by examination of the speci- men in the Hebrew University Fish Collection, Jerusalem (HUJ 19280) and three others (HUJ 19423, HUJ 19450 and HUJ 19517) collected at a depth of 35\u201350 m off the coast of Israel between Ashdod and Tel Aviv.

There is potential for fishers to become part of the management solution to IAS. In instances where fishing effort can play a role in the manage- ment of IAS that are invasive, for example, a market-based management approach to increase demand for selected IAS is strongly recommended. Like the majority of IAS, the range expansions of goatfish species should be continuously mon- itored based on standardised protocols. 3/ INVASIVE ALIEN SPECIES OF EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN | 17 Nemipterus randalli specimen caught in Gokova Bay, T\u00fcrkiye (Uyan et al., 2019) 3.2.1 NON-INDIGENOUS MARINE MACROFLORA IN LEBANON WITH A SPECIAL FOCUS ON STYPOPODIUM SCHIMPERI The marine flora along the Lebanese coast has been sub- jected to only a limited number of studies. In 1976, a list of the marine macroflora of the Lebanese coast was created (Basson et al., 1976). Subsequently, 190 taxa with six alien species of macrophyta, including cyanobacteria, were list- ed in 1976. The list has grown to 243 marine macrophyta, with 17 recently added IAS (Bitar et al., 2017). Since then, the number of marine macrophyta, including NIS especially with Indo Pacific origin, is still expanding along the Leba- nese coast (Belous and Kanaan, 2015; Kanaan et al., 2015; Badreddine et al., 2018). The marine macroflora present in Lebanon, consisting of a total of 29 species, are represented by three Ochrophyta (Padina boergesenii, Spatoglossum variabile and Stypopo- dium schimperi), 13 Rhodophyta, 12 Chlorophyta and one Streptobionta (Bitar et al., 2017; SPA/RAC-UNEP/MAP, 2021). Among them, 13 species represented by Asparagop- sis taxiformis, Caulerpa taxifolia var. distichophylla, Clado- phora patentiramea, Codium arabicum, Codium parvulum, Galaxaura rugosa, Halophila stipulacea, Hypnea cornuta, Laurencia cf. chondrioides, Lophocladia lallemandii, Sty- popodium schimperi, Ulva lactuca and Womersleyella se- MANAGEMENT STRATEGY: Some invasive fish species which are mistakenly assumed to be of economic impor- tance compete with native species of commercial value to eventually affect them negatively (G\u00fcl\u015fahin and Soykan, 2017; Grabowska et al., 2019). N. randalli is caught and sold as the native common pandora, Pagellus erythrinus, in southern coastal regions of Turkey (Yap\u0131c\u0131, 2017). 22% of total catch by Akyaka Fisheries Cooperative in Turkey, engaged in catching activity in G\u00f6kova Bay, has been re- ported as N. randalli (Uyan, 2017). Like the majority of IAS, the range expansions of N. randalli should be continuously monitored based on standardised protocols. 3.2 NON-EDIBLE AND OTHER IMPORTANT IAS Not all IAS are eligible for consumption or have socio-eco- nomic value.

The invasion begins with spots about 50 cm in diameter in- side the native communities. From a morphological stand- point, S. schimperi\u2019s tails are fan-shaped, similar to the in- digenous peacock P. pavonica. Most individuals range in size from 5 to 15 cm, whereas large individuals measure up to 20 cm. When immersed in seawater, they are distinguised by their luminous, bright turquoise colour. Unlike P. pavoni- ca, S. schimperi does not calcify. Its life cycle resembles that of other Dictyotales members. Along the Lebanese coast, the growth season of S. shim- peri extends from late February to September. The adult members appear between April and May. Large volumes of seaweed debris have been seen on the bottom and along the coast throughout June and July. Populations decline as of the end of August, and the algae become scarce. Finally, it almost vanishes in November (Bitar et al., 2000). Stypopodium is poisonous to many herbivores. A substance called stypodione may be manufactured from Stypopodium.

INVISIBLE STALKERS: FORAMINIFERAN INVASION Foraminifera, which are mostly marine and benthic, are single-celled eukaryotic organisms living at all depths in all oceans. They are highly significant regarding biostratigra- phy, paleobiogeography and paleoclimatology studies and their existence in rock formations gives clues to oil explor- ers by means of estimating the formation mechanisms and chronology of the rocks where the exploration takes place. They feed on algae and diatoms, and they have shells made of various materials and chemical structures, such as exist- ing sand or silt particles, calcite, aragonite, organic com- pounds and even remains of other previous organisms such as protists and echinoids (Langer et al., 2012). Fossilised remains can be found within sediments dating back to the Cambrian era and up to 545 million years old. Currently, more than 50.000 species have been identified, about 80% of which are extinct. Their shells are usually around 1 mm in length and the first known mention of them can be found in Herodotus\u2019 writings (Weinmann et al., 2013). tacea are potentially invasive species and several of them already occupy extensive stretches of the Lebanese coast. It should be emphasised that five IAS, represented by Aspar- agopsis taxiformis, L. Lallemandii, S. schimperi, W. setacea and H. stipulacea are listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s (IUCN) blacklist of invasive species (Otero et al., 2013). Stypopodium schimperi is the most toxic macrophyte spe- cies among the IAS recorded on the Lebanese coast. In ad- dition, S. schimperi is the second most invasive marine mac- rophyte to be identified in Lebanon, after U. lactuca (Bitar et al., 2017). Stypopodium schimperi is a species that lives in tropical and subtropical seas and can be observed annually. The species migrated from the Red Sea via the Suez Canal and arrived in the Mediterranean Sea. Stypopodium schim- peri was first reported on the Syrian coast in 1979, as was S. zonale (Mayhoub, 1989, as Stypopodium fuliginosum). After- wards, the species invaded the Haifa Bay and the neighbor- ing area (Lundberg, 1996, as S. zonale; Hoffman, 2014). Cur- rently, S. schimperi appears to have adapted successfully to the Levantine environment, particularly the Lebanese shore. It has already invaded various coastlines, including Syria, Libya, Egypt, Greece and Turkey (Bitar et al., 2000, 2017). In Leba- non, S. schimperi was first found in May 1991 at Barbara and subsequently, in 1995, at Hannouch (misidentified as S. zo- nale). It has established itself throughout the whole Lebanese coast since 2000, from the sea surface to 45 m deep, dis- placing native benthic communities (RAC/SPA-UNEP/MAP, 2014; SPA/RAC-UN Environment/MAP, 2017, 2018a; SPA/ RAC-UNEP/MAP, 2021). 3/ INVASIVE ALIEN SPECIES OF EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN | 19 Close up of Stypopodium shimperi (Photo: Ali Bedreddine) Apparently, only one specific species, Amphistegina lobifera, causes severe ecological impacts and meets the criteria defi- nition of an invasive alien. This species actively generates car- bonate, and camouflages its way to the new ecosystem that results in decreasing the native habitat and diversity of local species. The proliferation and rates of recently observed range extensions, provide strong support for previous species distri- bution models, and corroborate findings that rising water tem- peratures, global climate change and the extension of climate belts are major drivers fuelling the latitudinal range expansion of larger symbiont-bearing and smaller epiphytic foraminifera (Stulpinaite et al., 2020).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "340b1ea3-b9a6-48fe-a003-51d4218be7a4": {"__data__": {"id_": "340b1ea3-b9a6-48fe-a003-51d4218be7a4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/manual-invasive-alien-species-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Manual of invasive alien species in the Eastern Mediterranean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/manual-invasive-alien-species-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9eb5b0a9e40d956441bb3b3e57a70ac02f83d28c348896606562347e035ec542"}, "2": {"node_id": "ad0c6721-5ecb-417e-bddb-5921fe1ab8b7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/manual-invasive-alien-species-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ec25073ef7db09d57a9945a223f5f47a926feda64567d386fb2a07cb36e57914"}}, "hash": "dae960f8f566863647e511fed88b2238bcdad50450429e35abb44ebbd129f2c7", "text": "Likewise, in the entire Eastern Medi- terranean coast, A. lobifera is the most abundant foraminifer species found in hard substrate, reaching abundances of al- most 180 specimens/g in Israel (Hyams et al., 2002).

Therefore, the origins of the recent foraminifer species in the Eastern Mediterranean can be dated back to the Middle and Upper Pleistocene, or they may also be recent introductions. Their status can be enlightened by more specific research, mainly by genetic analysis (Zenetos et al., 2008). 3/ INVASIVE ALIEN SPECIES OF EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN | 20 Amphisorus hemprichii and Amphistegina lobifera on Halophila stipulacea leaves in Bodrum, T\u00fcrkiye. All three species are IAS. (Photos: Hasan Yokes) A close-up photograph of the beach sand from Rizokarpasso, Cyprus, comprised mainly of Amphistegina lobifera tests. (Photo: Mehmet Baki Yokes) era contents in each sample were counted. The first scouts of this alien species were found at the bottom of the core samples, represented with very few individuals. Unexpect- edly, the size of this alien population had not shown much change for a certain period. However, at the 25th cm from the core surface, a rapid increase in population density was significantly observed. The cause of this abnormal popula- tion expansion remains unknown, but it indicates a certain triggering occurrence during that matching period. In recent surveys in southwest Turkey, the deposition of the tests belonging to two foraminiferan species, Amphi- sorus hemprichii and Amphistegina lobifera, was found to be 2-4.5 cm/year. The local rocky sea bottom thickness is measured around 60-80 cm. Such population density is not observed elsewhere in the Mediterranean. Even though this situation is considered to be beneficial for the sand-dwelling native species, the original native habitat structure in this specific area is rocky. Waves carry foraminifera tests to the shores where they accumulate in small bays, consequently changing gravel shores to sandy beaches. This extensive deposition of tests is creating an immense ecological prob- lem by changing the whole habitat structure, while ultimately altering the species composition of the coastal ecosystem in the long run (Titelboim et al., 2019). The high sea water temperatures observed in this region may suggest that A. lobifera prefers high water temperatures, which may limit its distribution in the Mediterranean. In another study, the oc- currences of living amphisteginids are delimited by the 14\u00b0C Identification of a variety of 44 species and two cryptogenic taxa were revealed by a recent survey and re-evaluation of alien benthic foraminifera that is currently present in the Med- iterranean Sea. This reduces the number of previous record- ings of alien foraminifera and is mainly due to new occur- rence records, new findings in the fossil records, erroneous identifications and evidence predating the presence of alien species prior to the opening of the Suez Canal. The revised list of acknowledged alien species consists of both larger symbiont-bearing and smaller benthic foraminifera, including 16 hyaline-perforate, 3 agglutinated and 25 porcelaneous taxa. The vast majority of alien foraminifera recorded so far have become established in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, primarily along the Levantine coasts (Stulpinaite et al., 2020). A. lobifera is observed almost everywhere on the Aegean and Mediterranean coasts of Turkey, and even in the Sea of Marmara (Meric et al., 2004).

Rocky ecosystems are being converted into sandy ecosys- tems by means of the overpopulation of the dead (and live) tests of these small animals. Existence of such amounts of sand might also create grounds for the angiospermic plant Posidonia oceanica roots to help attach rocks (Badalamen- ti et al., 2015), consequently supporting Posidonia distri- butions to increase on originally rocky areas. Supralittoral regions are similar to this, where the gravel and pebble beaches are converted into whitish sand beaches. Another problem on the estimation of the changes in foraminiferan abundance is the scarcity of studies on foraminiferan com- position prior to the Suez Canal\u2019s opening. As a result, the scientific community might sometimes be unable to deter- mine whether a species is alien or native. Some opinions suggest that foraminifera should even be removed from alien species lists. winter isotherms. According to the laboratory experiments, it is observed that A. lobifera cannot perform any activity in temperatures below 12\u00b0C (Zmiri et al., 1974). However, its presence in the northern Aegean Sea and in the eastern Sea of Marmara shows that this species can adapt to much lower temperatures, and thus may be dispersed to west- ern Mediterranean in time. Records from Malta support the idea that its invasion in the Mediterranean has not yet fin- ished (Yokes et al., 2007). Furthermore, there is an obvious ongoing process of de- struction of the coastal ecosystem along the southwestern coasts of Turkey, where the damage is directly caused by the increased population of the Erythraen foraminifer A. lo- bifera. It has been known that some of the alien species demonstrated unusual population explosions in a very short amount of time, soon after they were first recorded in the Mediterranean in 2004 (Meric et al., 2004). The analysis of the core samples showed that the A. lobifera population has been stable for a certain amount of time, before a rapid expansion occurred. A change in environmental conditions, such as nutrients, temperature or the chemical composition of sea water, could be the reason of this proliferation.

The behaviour of juve- niles gathering in densely packed schools can be assumed as mimicking large animals. Individuals usually reach up to 25 cm in length and can grow to a maximum length of 32 cm.

STRIPED EEL CATFISH, PLOTOSUS LINEATUS IN THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN The eel catfish family Plotosidae consists of 41 species, half of which inhabit freshwater habitats. Plotosus lineatus (Thunberg, 1787) is the only marine Plotosid Lessepsian species that has been considered to arrive to the Mediter- ranean via the Suez Canal. It is a small to medium-sized, scaleless demersal fish with an elongated body that is com- pressed posteriorly. When it comes to physical character- istics, it has a brown body with two slender white stripes that start at the snout and cross above and below the eyes. Additionally, the ventral surface is white with brownish red. Moreover, it has a serpentine body and a tapering tail. This species is distinguished from all other Mediterranean spe- cies by the four pairs of barbells surrounding its mouth (Randall, 1995; Golani, 2002; Golani et al., 2013).In its nat- ural range, P. lineatus is a benthic inshore fish that lives on soft bottoms, rocky reefs and coral reefs.

The reason why P. lineatus is listed as one of the top 100 invasive species in the Mediterranean could be explained by these unfavourable patterns (Streftaris and Zenetos, 2006). P. lineatus should be monitored on a regular basis to act on its adverse effects on the local environment and economy in order to avoid a severe invasion in the Eastern Mediterranean (Ruttenberg et al., 2012; Azzurro and Bariche, 2017). Plotosus lineatus is an extremely venomous species that can cause injuries including swelling, severe pain, low blood pressure, heart failures that may lead to paralysis and even more serious injuries that can be fatal. Stings from Plotosus lineatus may result in death (Nelson et al., 2016), howev- er, no deaths were officially recorded to date in the Levant (Do\u011fdu et al., 2016, Ali, personal communication). The poi- son is injected from the venom glands to the body by the spines located in front of the first dorsal fin and the pectoral fins. Several cases of injury were recorded in Syria, which resulted in need of immediate medical treatment. It is es- sential to emphasise to proceed with caution when deal- ing with individuals of P. lineatus, even after the death of the fish. Plotosus is widely distributed in the Indo-Pacific, generally found in shallow coastal areas, moving towards estuaries, including brackish and freshwater areas in Japan, Samoa and east Africa (Golani et al., 2013). The species was previously investigated in the Red Sea (Goren and Dor, 1994), then recorded in the Great Bitter Lake (Chabanaud, 1932). As being the only representative of Plotosidae in the Red Sea, it finally entered through the Suez Canal into the Mediterranean Sea, where it was first recorded in Israel (Go- lani, 2002). The second well-documented record was tak- en in 2013 off the Egyptian coast of El-Arish (Temraz and Ben Souissi, 2013), while several specimens were captured in 2014 off the Syrian shore (Ali et al., 2015). The species migrated towards northern coastal areas and in 2016 the species was observed in Iskenderun Bay, located in east- ern Turkey (Do\u011fdu et al., 2016), as well as towards western areas, the Tunisian coast being its westernmost extension range in the Mediterranean Sea. Recently, in April 2022, a fisher cought 17 specimens of P. lineatus in Cyprus (Tiralon- go et al., 2022). This catch suggests that Plotosus expan- sion is extending in all areas of the Levantine Sea. Plotosus lineatus was initially discovered on the Syrian shore in 2014, and was documented in 2015. Based on a decade of routine monitoring in Syrian waters, four specimens were captured off the Syrian coast in May 2017. Similar records reported from Lebanon and Israel indicate that the species is now successfully established along the coastlines of the Eastern Mediterranean. This is also consistent with reports from fishers and divers (from the Syrian coast) who have locally seen and located schools of this species (Azzurro and Bariche, 2017). According to local news, Syrian fishers captured 20 specimens of Plotosus lineatus on 7 July 2017 in a single bottom cage in the city of Lattakia by 35\u00b036\u2019N and 35\u00b045\u2019E. The establishment of a viable population confirms a realistic possibility, since this model demonstrates that the species has found acceptable environmental circumstances to reproduce in Syria (Ali et al., 2017). 3/ INVASIVE ALIEN SPECIES OF EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN | 24 Plotosus Lineatus: Head of specimen captured from Syrian coast, showing maxillary barbell (A), mental barbel (B), nasal barbel (C), first dorsal fi spine (D) and pectoral fin spine (E).

Last of all, mollusc shells certainly are facilitating scientists\u2019 detection work. Whereas a living mollusc, like many other invertebrates, may live for a period of months up to a few years, their shells persist on the ocean floor for decades, centuries if not millennia. This durability also implies that shells accumulate in surficial sediments. Therefore, mollusc shells enable overcoming the idiosyncrasies of living popu- lations (some even have boom-and-bust dynamics so that they can be over-abundant one year but totally disappear the following one) and their greater abundance in comparison to living molluscs enhances detection chances (Albano et al., 3.2.4. NON-INDIGENOUS MOLLUSCS IN THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN: CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEIR DETECTION Molluscs were among the earliest invaders detected after the opening of the Suez Canal. This might be because they were indeed among the first to cross the canal and settle in the Mediterranean, or they enjoyed higher detectability due to size of many species and their attractiveness. Additionally, the durability of their shells \u2013 that make them discoverable even after the mollusc dies \u2013 facilitates collection and reporting. Still, when exactly a species successfully entered the Medi- terranean will probably never really be known. It is acknowl- edged that some characteristics of molluscs make them par- ticularly useful targets for studying biological invasions. First, the very early detection of the mussel Brachidontes pharaonis in 1876 or of the pearl oyster Pinctada radiata in 1878, less than ten years after the canal was opened in 1869, suggests that some molluscs were indeed the first to successfully make their way into the Mediterranean (Zenetos et al., 2010, 2012; Galil, 2012). This is not trivial as the length of the canal, slightly less than 200 km, the limited means of dispersion of molluscs (mostly their larvae) and the former high salinity of the Bitter Lakes could have been an unsur- mountable barrier for many organisms. Second, shells have fascinated humankind since immemorial times. Many ear- ly naturalists routinely brought shells back from their exotic voyages and enabled malacologists to witness the biotic enrichment that was happening in the Levantine Sea. Large size and beauty without a doubt facilitated their prompt re- porting. Last, and in contrast to many other marine organ- isms, shells persist long after the mollusc dies. Additionally, the shapes and colours of shells are so informative that in most cases they enable unambiguous species identification. In contrast, many invertebrates like polychaete worms, jelly- fish and sponges have either no skeletal parts that survive their death, or they are too inconspicuous to be easily identi- fied by a general naturalist. Even vertebrates like fishes leave bones, teeth and otoliths that require an expert for identifica- tion, but for molluscs a good field guide and a keen eye for comparing specimens with illustrations may suffice. Consciousness of these very same three features is now helping scientists to improve knowledge on how the Mediter- ranean is being occupied with tropical species. Despite mol- luscs being among the first to enter the basin, they are cer- tainly still coming in and at a high pace (Zenetos et al., 2022).

It is certain that this finding has ecological conse- quences as small-sized fish, which are not normally under such protection, have absolutely increased in population due to the density of D. setosum. D. setosum is mildly to moderately toxic and should be handled with extreme caution. Its venom is injected when the spines enter the body, causing symptoms such as pain and swelling. Moreover, its spines are immensely difficult to remove, as they are easily broken and then disintegrated in the flesh. At the moment, no generally valid control program available for sea urchins exists. Regular monitoring on the population status and range expansion based on standardised proto- cols and also removal of the species at designated locations are being implemented at certain locations in the Eastern Mediterranean countries. These monitoring and removal protocols can be replicated to other regions in the Eastern Mediterranean. Sea urchins are a high-protein food source in many nations, as well as a potential source of biological- ly active compounds that could be employed in medicine (Rahman et al., 2014). Furthermore, sea urchins\u2019 reproduc- tive organs have been a culinary delicacy in many parts of the world since ancient times. Sea urchins are considered a valuable delicacy in Asian and Western Hemisphere coun- tries, and have long been a luxury dish, especially in Japan, where they are known as \u201cuni.\u201d In addition to \u201csushi\u201d being a worldwide known cuisine, using this kind of flavour more in- tensely in the Mediterranean culinary culture may also con- tribute to the control of invasive species. would have a significant effect on the food chain in the eco- system. Even though there is no scientific study on its diet in the Mediterranean yet, it is known as an alga scraping omnivore in its native range. At some localities in the Medi- terranean, D. setosum has also been observed to be found nibbling on dead fish and carcasses. The complex three-dimensional structure of sea urchin spines provides excellent shelter for juvenile fish and in- creases their survival rate. There may be many reasons for such associations, but factors such as the physical pro- tection provided by sea urchins\u2019 spines must be a highly important factor for the host species (Coppard and Camp- bell, 2004).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b07cd290-33a9-4925-8d80-a2d73407d00b": {"__data__": {"id_": "b07cd290-33a9-4925-8d80-a2d73407d00b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/manual-invasive-alien-species-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Manual of invasive alien species in the Eastern Mediterranean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/manual-invasive-alien-species-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9baaf3291789621820671c205cf230ce945737b329456ea40fcaabb3dbc04a8b"}, "2": {"node_id": "8f16e2a1-b8ea-403d-986e-b8d212b265f9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/manual-invasive-alien-species-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c43fa34f20833c8deaae3600d2f3922a567854eac97ca4aec05809340ae82b40"}}, "hash": "b8a03af908b46b2fc43f67f8ad92088c72b26d722addf95c2d452a467bb6a861", "text": "In the Mediterranean, three native sea urchin species (Arbacia lixula, Paracentrotus lividus and Sphaere- chinus granularis) and six cryptobenthic fish species (Aplet- odon incognitus, Lepadogaster candolii, Gobius bucchichi, Millerigobius macrocephalus, Zebrus zebrus and Triptery- gion delaisi) have been associated (Karplus, 2014; Giglio et al., 2018).

Fishers in Cyprus estimate that they started to see L. sceleratus between 2005 and 2008 and by 2010 it was well established and already causing significant economic impacts to fisheries (Snape, 2010). By 2016, it was established in the Ionian Sea, Central Mediter- ranean and in 2017, it was recorded in the Strait of Gibraltar (Azzurro et al., 2020). Today the only regions where it has not been recorded are the northern most areas of the west- ern basin off France and northern Italy, yet it is also present in the northern Black Sea (Ulman et al., 2021). It is likely that it will eventually colonise the entire basin and may spill over into the Atlantic Ocean (Schickele et al., 2021). The most thorough and current review of the L. sceleratus biology and ecology in the Eastern Mediterranean where it is best established, was published recently (Ulman et al., 2021). The study paints a grim picture for the Mediterranean, both in terms of the impact of this species, and its extreme robustness as a population. L. sceleratus is one of the larg- est and most abundant invasive predatory fish in the Med- iterranean obtaining a maximum weight of 7 kg or perhaps more, and is a generalist predator feeding on crustaceans, fish and cephalopods (Ulman et al., 2021). It can tolerate a range of temperatures, a great range of salinities and can proliferate in a wide range of Mediterranean habitat types. 3.2.6. PUFFERFISH LAGOCEPHALUS SCELERATUS AND EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN FISHERIES Lagocephalus sceleratus is a ray-finned fish from the Tet- radontidae family, inhabiting offshore reefs and sandy bot- toms, and caught in great numbers with trammel nets in the eastern Mediterranean. It has a total of 10-13 dorsal soft rays and 8-12 anal soft rays. It is greenish with brown or black spots above, and it has a silver band from mouth to caudal fin. Its belly is white and there is a silver blotch in front of its eye. Its flesh and organs contain tetrodotoxin, which can be fatal on consumption (Masuda et al., 1984). The invasion of the Mediterranean Sea by this species during the last two decades has been the cause of wide- spread concern over fisheries sustainability, human health, and environmental impacts (Ulman et al., 2021). This has prompted great research interest, primarily in the areas of fisheries, ecology, toxicology and food science. Accordingly, the species is far better studied in the Mediterranean region than in its native range across the Pacific and Indian Oceans (Figure 5), with most publications from authors in Turkey and Greece. It is likely that the interest in the species has been because of the major economic and ecological impacts, driving a movement to find solutions to the problems sur- rounding the species colonisation, and a response to this through research. FIGURE 5. Map of the global range of Lagocephalus sceleratus. Note that the species is now reported as far as the westernmost extent of the Medi- te rranean. (IUCN Red List of Threatened Species\u2122, accessed 22 March 2022). sets of trammel nets in Famagusta Bay, Cyprus, and L. scel- eratus still dominated the total landings, representing 30% of the catch, 6% more than the target catch. Fishers have stated that the governmental payment scheme in the Turk- ish Cypriot community has not always had the budget to cope with the number of pufferfish tails returned. Given that this ongoing commercial eradication of pufferfish does not seem to be controlling their numbers effectively, collection and eradication schemes established by local associations and conservation groups to limit the impact of L. sceleratus, will have a negligible impact.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9eb676a8-cf2f-450f-b4ae-aaf7ef99cbe1": {"__data__": {"id_": "9eb676a8-cf2f-450f-b4ae-aaf7ef99cbe1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/manual-invasive-alien-species-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Manual of invasive alien species in the Eastern Mediterranean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/manual-invasive-alien-species-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bf39f95b41f7fba5863248be178b439f9d7cda4070da2d5664b51edc85473c12"}, "2": {"node_id": "f58ef65c-46a5-45d3-bc6c-4df3bfae910b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/manual-invasive-alien-species-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8ca2503282f9f837b18e7f68964112ee15492468dbf78795a9a03e806c50a48f"}}, "hash": "34c2ab56b916890f8b20494fbaae2335138e1332923f52383f53b3a003de3f91", "text": "The species has huge negative impacts on fishers\u2019 livelihoods even with payment schemes, mostly affecting small-scale fisheries communities using set nets and demersal longlines close to shore, which are already suffering economically through lack of management, underinvestment and the im- pacts of continued overfishing (Snape et al., 2018; Ulman et al., 2021).

Their high toxicity and ability to enlarge their bodies through puffing up makes them unattractive prey to Mediterranean predators. After undesirable experience or death, surviving predators quickly learn not to target the species. Only the loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) and the Mediterranean monk seal (Monachus monachus) (personal communication of Robin Snape to Ali Cemal Gucu in Karamanlidis and Den- drinos, 2015) are known to have preyed upon adult L. scel- eratus, while two predatory fish species have been found to prey on juveniles (Ulman et al., 2021). The fact that most of the potential predator populations, such as sharks, ceta- ceans, sea turtles, large predatory fish and seals have de- creased, probably facilitated the expansion of the species. Tetrodotoxin TTX is a potent neurotoxin where the name derives from Tetraodontiformes, an order that includes puff- erfish. TTX concentrations are relatively high in practically all the edible tissues, and are above the lethal human dose (Ulman et al., 2021), totally precluding exploitation of L. scel- eratus as a food commodity even as \u201cfugu\u201d, the Japanese pufferfish-based delicacy. In Cyprus, L. sceleratus associated income losses are through government-led schemes, returning dried tails for a set subsidy. But despite their continued extraction, L. sceleratus still make up a large proportion of the landings.

Approximately 90% of Turkish fishers reported that pufferfish is a major problem, due to its negative impact on biodiversity and on lowering the catch per unit effort. Long-line, setline and gillnet fish- ers participated in the survey and the fishers\u2019 financial loss due to losing hooks and the extra labour time they spend to change the hooks is at a significant level, considering their annual income (\u00dcnal and Bodur, 2017). According to the fishers\u2019 reports, the average annual loss caused by L. sceleratus is approximately \u20ac100 per fisher. The number of by-catch pufferfish on the Levantine coast is higher com- pared to the ones on the Aegean coast. Moreover, in the latter, the most bycatch was found in purse seiners and trawlers, whereas in the former, it was found in gillnets. It is stated by most of the small-scale fishers that pufferfish on the southern coast cause damage to their fishing gear and that these species also damage the target prey they catch (\u00d6ndes et al., 2018). Of the 506 fishers who participated in the research, all confirmed the financial and labour costs due to the issues related to pufferfish during the research conducted between the period 2016 and 2019. Decreased numbers of native species may cause invasive species to fill niches, which over time may cause the ecosystem to face irreversible impacts. There is a strong need to develop and implement a sustainable fisheries management model for this species of pufferfish, particularly in terms of the damage they cause to small-scale fisheries as a result of their spread over time (\u00d6ndes et al., 2018). Besides the economic damage to fishers, despite the on- going awareness efforts, dozens of deaths in the Mediter- ranean have been reported because of the TTX poisoning resulting from the consumption of the species (Ulman et al., 2021). In addition, incidents have been recorded of the spe- cies biting the fingers of bathers, resulting in the loss of dig- its in Turkey (S\u00fcmen and Bilecenoglu, 2019).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "24ecc0fd-148b-423f-9da8-4e9c162e0579": {"__data__": {"id_": "24ecc0fd-148b-423f-9da8-4e9c162e0579", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/manual-invasive-alien-species-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Manual of invasive alien species in the Eastern Mediterranean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/manual-invasive-alien-species-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4f5936c5fdcfbe4b067f972fb446170138d8f4714822665f32bafdd65e5167e4"}, "2": {"node_id": "988dc291-94fe-4acc-8804-fe416a7e4c8f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/manual-invasive-alien-species-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a290d04f222c2e72721460b8f66ffe93f8296affd3d78a0f791ac84b0a44301b"}}, "hash": "9ac3c13abfe7a8c1209866f2b8d7a8f15a8f1ff44620c3a4c9ad199e5cdd6ac8", "text": "Also, a school of large (60-90 cm) pufferfish were seen in Cyprus gathering around in less than 40 cm of water, causing panic and con- cern (Robin Snape, personal observation).

There are small initiatives of making hand- crafted products such as wallets and purses from the skin of this species in some countries. 3/ INVASIVE ALIEN SPECIES OF EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN | 30 Lagocephalus sceleratus dominated landings of a", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "405a655c-3bc8-4d9c-a967-1ce6bb121e9a": {"__data__": {"id_": "405a655c-3bc8-4d9c-a967-1ce6bb121e9a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/manual-invasive-alien-species-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Manual of invasive alien species in the Eastern Mediterranean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/manual-invasive-alien-species-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9d098cae310aa64c8f8a2eae02cf96f1273654bf3a0cc89f8b0bf56b814f633a"}, "3": {"node_id": "793af458-af29-4a74-b4f8-838618032265", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/manual-invasive-alien-species-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4bad7eb50b09fbc18ebc0c71ed7b471ae40f7d0dd65c1b393f50d8a799675da8"}}, "hash": "ddfee88f15dded71f7d39e063289e1346e05d3b001f7cbe65885cc38f9df018a", "text": "small-scale fishing vessel in Famagusta Bay.
