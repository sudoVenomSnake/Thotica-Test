or partly funded with transfers from the centre. There is a tendency for central governments to establish ex ante controls over locally managed but centrally financed public programmes, including safety nets. These ex ante controls may be costly, time-consuming and counter- productive. A potentially more effective way of ensuring that local governments implement centrally funded safety net programmes in line with procedures and policy is to provide ex post performance-based incentives. The best known example of this is Bolsa Familia in Brazil, for which the quality of municipal CCT administration is measured by how well municipalities manage information about beneficiaries (completeness of information, regular updating of information, etc.). Municipalities that perform well are rewarded with additional administrative cost support. Other examples of incentives for local governments to effectively manage safety net programmes are found in OECD countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands.55 In both countries, incentives encourage improvements in moving people off welfare and into the workforce. In developing countries, there are very few examples of the use of such incentives to maintain the quality of safety net programmes implemented by local governments. In some countries, however, pilot efforts are underway to establish incentives for improved management of safety net programmes (see box 16). 54 Andhra Pradesh State in India is an example of institutionalized social audits at the local government level (Centre for Good Governance, 2009). 55 See UNCDF (2010) for Denmark; see World Bank (2009) for the Netherlands. 83 Decentralization, local governance and social safety nets Box 16: Incentivising local level performance in Nepal In Nepal, the Local Governance and Community Development Programme\u2019s Human Development and Social Protection Pilot is an example of building performance incentives into the local-level management of a safety net. The Human Development and Social Protection Pilot is being designed to provide Village Development Committees and local educational management structures with institutional and individual incentives to effectively manage social assistance programmes and improve education sector services, aimed at encouraging families to enrol and keep their children primary schools. These incentives will probably work at several levels: \u2022\ufffd Within pilot Village Development Committees, expanding the existing list of \u2019Minimum Conditions\u2019 to include vital registration functions and good record-keeping on all social security beneficiaries and payments.

A Village Development Committee that is not able to comply with Minimum Conditions is not entitled to a top-up grant56. \u2022\ufffd Providing Village Development Committee-level staff with incentives to perform well. These incentives will be for staff (as a team, but with individuals benefitting directly) rather than the Village Development Committee as an institution.

Moreover, local governments can provide fiscal and other incentives to schools or health centres as a way of improving their service delivery performance. The proposed safety net pilot in Nepal, for example, intends to provide cash transfers to households with children.

Adding value? It is evident that the current interface between safety nets and local governments in low-income, developing countries is relatively \u2018thin\u2019. This is partly because safety net programmes and services remain underdeveloped in general; it is difficult to involve local governments in something that barely exists in many countries. It may also result in part from a generalized mistrust (on the part of both central governments and their development partners) of local governments. But the available evidence from both developing and developed countries suggests that the safety net/local government nexus can (and perhaps should) be stronger. First, there are striking exceptions in some low-income developing countries to the generally thin interface between local government and safety net programmes. Nepal, where Village Development Committees manage the lion\u2019s share of the Government\u2019s non-contributory safety net programmes, is a case in point.58 Another set of significant exceptions (PSNP in Ethiopia, NREGA in India) points to intrinsically strong linkages between local government and workfare programmes. The experiences in Ethiopia, India and Nepal highlight the key role of local governments in developing countries in the delivery of safety net services. Second, the interface between local governments and the delivery of safety net programmes is much stronger in middle-income and high-income countries. Municipalities are deeply involved in one of Latin America\u2019s largest CCT programmes (Bolsa Familia in Brazil), and in practically all OECD countries, local governments are at the heart of the delivery of many safety net benefits. There are, therefore, no intrinsic reasons why local governments in low-income countries should not be more involved in delivering safety nets programmes. Countries will, of course, need to develop or enhance systems, procedures and capacity to further optimize the potential contribution of local level. 58 Why Village Development Committees play such a prominent role in Nepal\u2019s social security system merits further study. 85 Decentralization, local governance and social safety nets 5.6.1. What does local government bring to safety net programmes? There are a number of local government characteristics that are important when considering the role of local government in implementing safety net programmes: \u2022\ufffd Fundamentally, many local governments are formally accountable to their citizens through elections and similar mechanisms. Devolving or delegating responsibilities for the delivery of safety net services (and, indeed, virtually all other public services) to subnational governments is predicated on the extent to which elected local bodies are accountable to citizens. In short, when local politicians fail to deliver, they are voted out; when they succeed in delivering the goods, they are rewarded with election or re-election. These are powerful incentives for performance.59 \u2022\ufffd Local governments (especially lower tier ones) are usually proximate and accessible. Village Development Committees in Nepal and Kebeles in Ethiopia, for example, are often the first element of the state that citizens interact with. \u2022\ufffd To the extent that they are situated at the grassroots level and are in regular contact with local populations, local governments \u2013 especially small, rural local governments \u2013 are likely to have significant knowledge about their jurisdictions and constituencies. \u2022\ufffd Many local governments (e.g. communes in Mali and Senegal, Village Development Committees in Nepal) are already responsible for providing vital registration services, which are critical to cash transfer programmes since they provide the basis on which citizens can enter into safety net programmes. \u2022\ufffd Moreover, most local governments have infrastructure and service delivery mandates. These mandates imply that local governments are often directly responsible for delivering public goods and services; as importantly, local governments also generally have a responsibility for local level coordination of sector and other services, with a mandate to ensure that the supply of public goods and services is geared to meeting local demand (which may be influenced by safety net programmes). \u2022\ufffd Local governments in many countries are well-established and constitute a more or less dense institutional and administrative network.

How do such characteristics of local government translate into value-added with respect to the implementation of safety net programmes? 59 See de Janvry, A., Finan, F. and Sadoulet, S. (2009) for some recent work on the link between local elections and municipal delivery of safety net services in Brazil. 86 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable \u2022\ufffd Better beneficiary selection (and targeting) processes. Due to their proximity, local accountability and vital registration functions, local governments are potentially well placed to facilitate a better targeting and beneficiary selection process for safety net programmes. As discussed in section 4.3.2, under the right circumstances, subnational governments are likely to have access to sound local information about who is eligible for safety net benefits and are easier for citizens to contact and interact with than national agencies. This can potentially reduce inclusion and exclusion errors in safety nets. \u2022\ufffd Better grievance and redress processes. Local governments \u2013 due to their proximity \u2013 can provide a framework for more effective grievance and redress mechanisms. This affects not only safety nets, but also overall issues of accountability and transparency. As discussed in section 4.3.5, easier, less impersonal and less costly citizen access to local governments makes it more likely that local grievance and redress arrangements function effectively. Many of the typical problems (leakage, inclusion/exclusion errors, etc.) associated with the delivery of safety net services can be addressed if grievance/redress mechanisms are robust and operational, and they are more likely to be so when they are proximate and where officials are held accountable to its citizens. \u2022\ufffd More information availability and greater disclosure. Local governments offer significant opportunities for increased availability of information and improved public disclosure about social protection services \u2013 and thus potentially greater transparency and accountability if used effectively. Again, the proximity and familiarity of local governments are key. Just as local government budgets are often published on notice boards, lists of beneficiaries can also be made publicly available, and citizens can learn about safety net services through their regular interactions with local governments. These activities should be complemented by national communications strategies. \u2022\ufffd Monitoring and evaluation. Monitoring of safety net programmes can be strengthened by working through the local government system. Local- level monitoring may be qualitatively better than centrally administered monitoring, if only because local staff and offices may have a greater knowledge of the community and greater incentives to follow up on service delivery performance. It is also likely that the information obtained through monitoring will be acted upon more meaningfully when safety net service delivery is partly a local function. \u2022\ufffd Taking into account local conditions and circumstances. Because of the extent to which they are aware of local conditions and circumstances, local governments offer opportunities for tailoring safety net parameters (e.g. wage levels, cash or in-kind transfers) and outputs (e.g. public infrastructure) to local context (see section 4.2.3). As such, they provide a ready-made 87 Decentralization, local governance and social safety nets institutional framework for ensuring that safety net programmes are adapted to a range of geographical and socio-economic contexts. \u2022\ufffd Linking supply and demand. To the extent that local governments are responsible for providing infrastructure and service delivery services, their active involvement in the implementation of safety net programmes provides an opportunity to link supply and demand. In the specific case of workfare, most local governments already plan and undertake infrastructure development, thus providing a framework within which to establish public works programmes. More fundamentally, local governments can link safety net expenditures to recurrent and capital budget allocations in other sectors, thereby taking a multisectoral approach through which all services are likely to be improved. This is a key advantage in bringing safety net service delivery into the ambit of local government. \u2022\ufffd Experimentation and adaptation. Assuming that delegated or devolved safety net programmes allow a degree of local discretion, local governments provide a natural laboratory for experimentation and innovation through heterogeneous implementation arrangements. When safety net services are delivered through a decentralized framework, national policymakers have the opportunity to see \u2018real-time\u2019 pilots in action and \u2013 where such innovations prove positive \u2013scale them up across national territories. At the same time, local governments will also be in a better position to identify unintended impacts of pilots (or ongoing programmes for that matter) and react to these in a potential more responsive manner. Such local-level piloting is not only useful, it is also inexpensive. \u2022\ufffd Existing arrangements.

That said, the role of other actors (central government, specialist agencies, etc.) remains vital \u2013 local governments may be well suited to ensure certain functions, but badly placed to undertake others. Even if the sometimes normative arguments in favour of greater local government involvement in the delivery of safety net programmes are not be entirely convincing, it remains true that local governments are often already involved. In other words, whether they are intrinsically well suited to certain functions related to the delivery of safety net services, many local governments play a significant role in such services. That being the case, it is important to examine ways in which this de facto local-level involvement can be optimized and enhanced, with a view towards improving performance and service delivery outcomes. 90 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable 5.6.2.

This implies that safety net programmes are likely to result in more cases of grievance and thus require greater capacity for redress. \u2022\ufffd Robust information management and regular monitoring are vital elements of a good safety net programme. \u2022\ufffd By bolstering the demand side for other public services, safety nets can highlight or underline the need for improvements in them. \u2022\ufffd Generally speaking, safety net programmes are (or should be) financed out of intergovernmental fiscal transfers, with central government covering most costs. Given these and other characteristics, in what ways might safety nets add value or contribute to local governance and government? \u2022\ufffd Addressing immediate income and human poverty. Most important, safety nets can provide a mechanism through which local government can directly address income/consumption poverty issues. \u2018Regular\u2019 local government infrastructure and service delivery functions, which focus on the supply side of poverty reduction, cannot directly tackle demand-side issues. There is considerable evidence from Brazil that municipalities have welcomed their very active involvement in the implementation of Bolsa Familia, seen as a way of extending their outreach and as a mechanism for enhancing their capacity to meet the needs of their constituents.60 60 See World Bank (2007b). 91 Decentralization, local governance and social safety nets \u2022\ufffd Strengthening local government capacities. The implementation of safety net programmes can, in and of itself, considerably enhance local government capacities and also strengthen/reinforce existing service delivery functions (such as vital registration). This is especially the case for monitoring and information management, where local governments often perform poorly but are key activities for the delivery of safety net services. \u2022\ufffd Enhancing accountability. To the extent that locally administered safety nets require regular interaction between local governments and their citizens (particularly the poor), they may contribute to enhanced accountability (and better local governance). In addition, the potential for inclusion and/ or exclusion errors in the selection of safety net beneficiaries \u2013 and the need for grievance/redress mechanisms \u2013 may lead to greater interaction between citizens and local governments, with the potential for strengthening downward accountability. \u2022\ufffd Demand for public services. By generating or maintaining demand for other public services, safety net programmes (and especially CCTs) can help local governments and users identify bottlenecks and other problems. In addition, safety net programmes may help local governments meet other sectoral objectives, such as higher school enrolment rates and more frequent use of local health clinics. \u2022\ufffd No added fiscal burden. Under most circumstances, involvement in the implementation of safety net programmes should not result in an increase in the fiscal burden borne by local governments. \u2022\ufffd Operations and maintenance issues. Workfare programmes can potentially help local governments address infrastructure maintenance issues. Maintenance is a perennial problem for many subnational governments. \u2022\ufffd Economic development and growth. Safety net programmes may help people attain a minimum level of income, either through direct employment programmes or through cash transfers, which increases the potential for a larger part of the population to become economically active. This can contribute to the overall development of certain areas. As development levels rise, so will local economic activity. Increased demand for locally provided services and products, sold in local shops and markets, may also strengthen local tax bases. Safety net programmes can make a useful contribution to local governance in general, and to local government service delivery and performance in particular. By taking on responsibilities for the delivery of safety nets, local governments have much to gain and little to lose. 93 Ways forward Ways forward 6.1. Rationale This discussion paper argues that there are good grounds to explore stronger links between safety nets and local governments in developing countries. On the one hand, safety net programmes have much to offer as elements of an overall approach towards poverty reduction. On the other hand, there are functions associated with the delivery of safety net programmes for which local governments are well suited, whether through delegation (with varying degrees of discretion) or very limited devolution. Moreover, in a few countries (such as Nepal), the statutory framework assigns safety net management mandates to local governments, even if those mandates remain unfulfilled or unfunded.

That said, there are significant challenges that need to be addressed in strengthening the role of local government in the delivery of safety net services. These include: \u2022\ufffd Social protection policies or strategies in many developing countries in the Asia-Pacific and Africa regions appear to assign either no role or only a very limited one to local government. Local government legislation and policies in many of the same countries only provide local bodies with a limited mandate, if any, to implement safety net programmes. \u2022\ufffd There is considerable (and sometimes understandable) scepticism on the part of some central governments and development partners about the capacity and aptitude of local governments to deliver services, including safety nets as a tool for poverty reduction. \u2022\ufffd The real risks associated with local government involvement in the delivery of safety net services are not just about \u2018capacity\u2019 issues, but also include aspects such as local-national coordination, corruption, clientelism, financial management, and the like. \u2022\ufffd Even among those development partners who are generally in favour of local government, there is often an unwillingness to see delegation \u2013 which is the most likely way in which safety net functions might be decentralized \u2013 as a form of decentralization. \u2022\ufffd There is a relatively weak empirical and analytical body of knowledge about local government and safety nets in developing countries upon which to build. 94 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable \u2022\ufffd Local governments are sometimes characterized by weak capacity. \u2022\ufffd There is a need to connect social protection initiatives to broader democratic governance agendas that seek to build capable states through effective institutions and systems, while addressing issues of transparency and accountability. Given these considerable challenges, many of which relate to the overall policy environment, what might be the best way forward? The following section trys to answer this question, in terms of concrete actions to be followed up on by both UNCDF and UNDP. . 6.2. Analysis and piloting Three broad types of concrete actions are appropriate for moving a \u2018safety net \u2013 local government\u2019 agenda forward. First, further analysis is required, aimed at strengthening overall understanding of the issues related to local government implementation of safety net programmes. Such analysis might include: \u2022\ufffd Examining some of the experiences up to now: contrasting centralized and decentralized safety nets in different areas, determining how different arrangements were selected, exploring the characteristics these countries share, and identifying best practices. \u2022\ufffd \u2018Unbundling\u2019 the implementation of different types of safety net programme into a series of functions and subfunctions, and then trying to identify which functions or subfunctions are best suited to local governments and which are best suited to other institutions or organizations. \u2022\ufffd Identifying decision-making areas within which it would be appropriate to encourage local discretionary powers, and defining the optimal limits to such local discretionary powers. \u2022\ufffd Improving the understanding of how locally administered safety net programmes are, or could be, financed (and funds disbursed), with the pros and cons of different financing and disbursement options clearly spelt out. \u2022\ufffd Assessing the effectiveness of local-level beneficiary selection and/or targeting mechanisms, and identifying ways of improving these mechanisms so as to minimize both inclusion and exclusion errors. \u2022\ufffd Appraising payment and financial management procedures and processes at the local level, focusing particularly on ways of using the banking system where possible and on how manual (un-banked) payments processes might be made more robust and corruption-proof. 95 Ways forward \u2022\ufffd Further improving the understanding of local government vital registration functions and how these do or should interface with safety net management. \u2022\ufffd Examining current monitoring and evaluation systems and management information systems for safety net programmes and seeing how these might be adapted to (or integrated into) local government functions related to the delivery of safety nets. \u2022\ufffd Identifying an appropriate mix of ex ante and ex post mechanisms through which local government involvement in the implementation of safety net programmes can be adequately controlled/supervised and incentivized. \u2022\ufffd Further exploring linkages between safety net service delivery and other public services such as education, health and public works. \u2022\ufffd Examining the potential of and linkages between cash transfers and market-based financial instruments such as savings, microinsurance, and remittances and payment services. Further analysis can also examine broader delivery systems in terms of capitalizing on transfers to the very poor and \u2019non-bankable\u2019 populations, to extend financial inclusion for broader social protection. \u2022\ufffd The role of political parties, individual politicians, and the introduction of safety nets, focusing on issues like incentives, political discourse and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f304d767-2043-4a88-a7f7-4fe38c11ef9c": {"__data__": {"id_": "f304d767-2043-4a88-a7f7-4fe38c11ef9c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Government and Social Protection: Making Service Delivery Available for the Most Vulnerable", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2d5472a4930bbc04c76690a7ac5bb6992088da684c651062b5e8bc346bee8849"}, "3": {"node_id": "d3bde949-ce2a-4eda-8747-929b1370a3d6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "50e680887d68c26b7fdb2e4107c4da28dfffc19146e522f0e00bfb10a42c3cc4"}}, "hash": "e65eb08e0b17d8b0797396f251a266b9e13729c3769c58b4054ed692c8c4d483", "text": "representation Second, a set of complementary piloting activities is necessary. This would consist of on-the-ground piloting of different types of safety net programmes in which local governments play a more or less active role, with a view to testing potential improvements and appropriate institutional arrangements, and generating evidence-based lessons. Such piloting would focus on the safety nets and functional areas where local governments are assumed to have a comparative advantage. But piloting would also provide opportunities to test optimal arrangements for jointly managed safety nets (with responsibilities shared by several governmental tiers). Any such pilots would need to be carefully designed and monitored so as to ensure that any lessons learned were evidence- based. This would require baselines and robust monitoring and evaluation systems. Care should be taken so external donor funding does not become the driving force behind introducing such schemes and dominate agenda-setting. Third, actions should focus on feeding the lessons learned from analytical and piloting work into policy-level discussions, with a view towards informing national thinking and policies. This would include activities such as informal advocacy, information dissemination and networking. A key objective would be to provide national policymakers with information that allows them to clarify the role of local government in the implementation of safety net programmes and ensure that this is reflected in any national social protection strategies or policies. 96 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable References Ayala, F.

Enhancing Social Protection and Reducing Vulnerability in a Globalizing World: Report of the Secretary-General. New York) The International Labour Organization (ILO) defines \u201csocial protection in a broad sense as covering all safeguards or guarantees against reduction or loss of income in cases of illness, old age, unemployment or other hardship, and including family and ethnic solidarity. This includes protection instruments based on collective or individual savings, private insurance, social insurance, mutual benefit societies, formal sector social security, etc. It generally distinguishes between social security and social assistance. The former are contributory systems through which participants acquire rights to transfers to cover situations of ill-health, accident or disability, unemployment and old age. Social assistance refers to transfers not based on prior contributions but instead financed from the general tax system, to assist low income and vulnerable groups.\u201d (International Labour Organisation, http://www.ilo.org/global/About_ the_ILO/Mainpillars/Socialprotection/lang\u2014en/index.htm) The U.K. Department for International Development (DFID) defines social protection broadly as \u201c[\u2026] a sub-set of public actions carried out by the state or privately that address risk, vulnerability and chronic poverty.\u201d DFID classifies social protection into three key components: social insurance, social assistance and setting and enforcing minimum standards (DFID (2005). \u2018Can Low-Income Countries in Africa Afford Social Transfers\u2019. Social Protection Briefing Note Series no. 2. UK Department for International Development) The Asian Development Bank defines \u201csocial protection [as] [\u2026] policies and programs designed to reduce poverty and vulnerability by promoting efficient labor markets, diminishing people\u2019s exposure to risks, enhancing their capacity to protect themselves against hazards and interruption/loss of income.\u201d ADB sub-divides social protection into five key components: labour market, 105 Annex: Definitions of Social Protection social insurance, social assistance, micro- and area-based schemes and child protection.

A nearly 40- year-old quota-based trade helped small developing countries to establish the industry, expand production and obtain access to major markets. The industry provided jobs to millions, most of them women, and generated foreign currency ea rnings and export revenue, which would not have been possible otherwise. When the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) was fully implemented in January 2005, it was feared that less competitive exporters such as the least developed countries (LDCs) might lose out against global competition. Expected outcomes were factory closures and job losses as well as lower wages and longer working hours that would be required to meet lower prices and shorter lead time. These concerns were not foreign to Asian LDCs, e.g., Bangladesh, Cambodia, Lao PDR and Nepal, where export-oriented garment industry was significant. Trade gains for some LOCs, but .... Contrary to such pessimistic expectations, export data illustrates the growth of ready-made garment (RMG) exports from Bangladesh, Cambodia and Lao PDR. Nepal's RMG exports, which experienced a dip in 2001-2002, returned to a downward trend after the ATC expiry (Table 1). Temporary quantitative restrictions (safeguards) imposed on Chinese products by the United States and EU in late 2005 provided a few years of breathing space for these countries to stay in the competition but fears remain. The EU removed the safeguards at the end of 2007, and the US action will follow in 2008. Moreover, more than 90 percent of the RMG products from these four Asian LDCs are shipped to the United States and the EU. A lack of market diversity makes these countries vulnerable to any changes in trade preferences in the two markets. The RMG share of total exports is considerably large for Bangladesh and Cambodia, 75 and 78 percent respectively in 2006. The share of RMG in total exports dropped in Lao PDR due to the good performance of non-RMG export sectors, e.g., minerals and mineral fuels. On the other hand, the RMG share of total exports in Nepal, which was more than 30 percent in 1993-1994 fiscal year (SAWTEE and AAN 2007), declined as RMG exports fell. Any shocks to the RMG industry could potentially affect the development process of these LDCs, especially Bangladesh and Cambodia. www.undprcc.lk 1 Looking beyond Export Gains Issue 1 May 2008 Table 1: RMG Exports, US and EU market and RMG Human development linkages Share of Total Exe0rts.

About 82 percent of the former workers surveyed did not find an alternative job immediately after leaving the RMG industry; 29 percent remained unemployed for 1 -2 years.

Lower educational attainment by women, lack of skill s (in both RMG and other sectors), and economic and social discrimination against women in the society may explain the gender gap. Among RMG workers currently working, the majority did not have a contract at the time of the survey. This makes workers more vu lnerable to downturn of the production cycle and creates job insecurity. Income Sixty-four percent of the former RMG workers surveyed in Nepal claimed a fall in income after leaving the RMG industry. The level of income is not sufficient for most of the current RMG workers to meet their basic needs even in countries with a rapid growth of RMG exports. The basic sa lary for RMG workers was fixed at US$45 per month as minimum wage in Cambodia and about US$26 per month in Lao PDR at the time of survey in 2006 (Table 2). With overtime pay and other benefits, the average monthly salary for the Cambodian RMG workers was US$73 and US$41 for Lao workers. About 90 percent of Cambodian and 56 percent of Nepali workers surveyed responded that their basic sa lary wa s not sufficient for their daily needs. Moreover, high inflation triggered by price hikes of petroleum and staple food contributed to deterioration in their rea l wages. Overall, the majority of workers surveyed were satisfied w ith their current jobs but a significant share of workers complained about their low wage. Bangladesh's legal minimum wage was probably the lowest in the region, about US$16 per month, as it had not changed since 1994. The wage commission recommended raising the minimum wage to about US$24 in 2007. As for Cambodia, the minimum wage was increased to US$50 per month in 2007 and recently a US$6 allowance raise was instituted to compliment monthly salary (lLO and BFC 2008). Although legal wage hikes is a welcomed trend, the wage hikes barely offset the inflation shocks. The survey found RMG workers spend average 50-60 percent of their income on the basic necessities; food, housing, and clothing. Remittance accounts for 10-20 percent of their income. In order to cope w ith real wage loss, the former RMG workers in Nepal cut their savings, expenditures in entertainment and remittances. Some limit their spending on food. Without an appropriate compensation mechanism, lower consumption of food worsens worker's health whereas lower amounts of remittances are likely to bring deterioration in human development, especially among rural populations. Further deterioration in real wages put both workers' and their family members' well-being at risk.

With these conditions, many workers reported problems of back pain and eye-sight strain. Access to health care services is a big issue in developing countries because universal health care is rare among developing countries. Many firms have First Aid or small clinics in the factories, but most workers must pay for serious injuries caused during the shifts, with potential huge costs, especially if they do not have medical insurance or other social benefits to cover them. In Lao PDR, all factories surveyed claimed that they covered 100 percent of the medical expenses for initial treatments. However, in case of long-term ----------------------- www.undprcc.lk 3 Looking beyond Export Gains Issue 1 May 2008 work-related injuries, the financial burden for treatment fell under t he social security scheme. In the case of Lao PDR, the RMG firm's contribution to workers' social security has increased by 16 percent from 2004 to 2005; yet only 73 percent of RMG factories surveyed are participating in social welfare benefit progra ms for their employees. Cases of the RMG industry mentioned above are relatively organized. Given the barriers for women to enter the labour force, including their respo nsibilit ies at home and in society which is shaped by the gender division of labour, informal wage employment is dominated by women. Since labour protections such as minimum wage legislation often do not apply to informal workers, the negative impacts of the ATC expiry - e.g., the low wages vis-a-vis inflation rates ~ will more severely affect informal workers in the region. Implication of the removal of safeguards on China The socio-economic conditions of Bangladesh, Ca mbodia and Lao PDR did not deteriorate much as expected, partly due to the safeguards which were imposed on Chinese T&C products in late 2005. Yet, this is a temporary quantitative restriction mechanism. The EU removed it at the end of 2007, and the United States is planning the same at the end of this year. When the safeguards on China are completely removed, there would be undisputed conseq uences on the four Asian LDCs as well as other developing countries. Simulation assumes a scenario of no quantitative restriction on T&C export. The results are devastating. Bangladesh is likely to suffer the most in absolute term s. The export of RMG from Bangladesh to the US and EU markets will decline by US$21 S million and US$ 1 78 million respectively. This will lead to a welfare loss of US$486 million. For Cambodia, the RMG export loss was estimated to US$90 million in the US market and to US$21 million in the EU market, result ing in the welfare loss of US$94 million. Export loss for Lao PDR was estimated to US$30 million in the EU market where 90 percent of the Lao RMG prod ucts were sold. Welfare loss was also severe with estimation of US$37 million. With a full remova l of the safeguards on Chinese products, Nepal wou ld lose US$ 14 million and US$6 million in the US and EU market respectively. The country's welfare loss was also hig h at US$2S million. As a result of these losses, workers in the four countries will face wage cuts and job losses. Policy options for Asian LOCs So what can these Asian LDCs do to overcome the challenges in the post-ATC era? There are a number of demand- and supply-side constraints that these LDCs have in common. Overcoming the constra ints will be critica l to remain in global competit ion so as to keep employment and the level of labour compensation high. Demand for duty-free quota-free market access The US tariffs on T&C products appear to be the most severe constraint for t he Asian LDCs.

Average tariffs on T&C exports ranging from 15 to 20 percent apply to Cambodia.

As for Nepal, among selected top apparel items exported to the United States, the highest applied rate is 19.7 percent, with a simple average across all prod ucts of 1 1.3 percent. ----------------------- www.undprcc.lk 4 Looking beyond Export Gains Issue 1 May 2008 At the sixth Ministerial Conference of the WTO in Hong Kong in December 2005, developed Members agreed to provide duty-free quota-free (DFQF) market access to 97 percent of the products originating from the LDCs. However, there are concerns that such provision would not help the LDCs much because their exports to the US market are heavily concentrated in T&C products, which may be excluded from the 'covered list'as the importing countries have the discretion to exclude 3 percent of the import tariff lines from such treatment. Therefore, DFQF market access for the LDCs in developed countries, especia lly in the US market, is crucial. Estimated gains for Bangladesh, Cambodia, Lao PDR and Nepal under the scenario of a full DFQF market access in the United States are increased exports by US$559 million, US$626 million, US$6.3 million and US$5.9 million respectively. The export gains for Lao PDR and Nepal are sma ller than the others due to their small market shares; however, they are sizeable in terms of percentage share in their total exports. Export growth wi ll provide additional employment in the RMG industry. For Bangladesh, by assuming that 70 percent of the increased export will be in woven RMG products, an expo rt growth will create 180,000 new jobs. Similarly, an additional 77,000 people will be absorbed by the RMG industry in Cambodia, representing 29 percent of total employment in the industry in 2005. Additionally, around 69,000 indirect jobs will be created in the supporting industries. As for Lao PDR, the number of RMG workers could rise to 35,280, representing a 31 percent increase over the number of workers in 2005. Demand for the EU Flexible Rules of Origin When it comes to the EU market, the four LDCs remain strong as the EU has offered preferential treatment to them under the Everything But Arms (EBA) initiative. However, to qualify for the EU treatment, LDCs have to comply with the rules of origin (ROO) by meeting criteria that at least two stages of production process take place in the exporting countries. In all the four countries domestic supply capacity of fabrics and other accessories are still low. Therefore, obtaining preferential treatment from the EU is rather difficult. The situation could get worse since the safeguards on China's T&C products have been lifted and as ROO will continue to act as a binding constraint on the expansion of the LDC exports due to lack of backward linkage. The simulation estimated that full relaxation of ROO by the EU, even though this might not be realistic scenario, could increase RMG exports of Cambodia and Nepal by US$36 million and US$24.5 million respectively. A more rea listic alternative is to req uest the EU to simplify its ROO that is similar to Canada ROO, which requires a 25 percent domestic value addition by LDCs to gain zero-tariff access. Another unique feature of Canada ROO is an extremely liberal accumulation mechanism, which allows the LDCs to source raw materials from Canada or any other developing country. Relaxation of ROO criteria would benefit Asian LDCs a great deal and give another stimulus to their RMG sector in the post-ATC yea rs. Overcoming supply-side constraints Long lead time is troublesome for the Asian LDCs.

Unreliability of the services provided is another setback for the Asian LDCs. Bureaucracy in export processing and inefficient custom services result in unofficial fees and high cost. Increased public investment and private sector participation can help address this constraint. Easy access to finance is necessary to enable T&C firms to undertake productive investments for initiating or expanding a business. Effective government policies, including the easing of restrictions on the provision of formal credit, need to be in place to facilitate better access to ca pital and technology. Shortage of a ski lled workforce is perceived to be a major constraint on the production of high value-added RMG products in these countries. This wou ld bring about low productivity for the industry, which is a crucial element of competitiveness. Significant parts of RMGs from these LDCs comprise very low domestic va lue addition due to lack of backward linkages and skilled workers. Most workers in this sector are illiterate or only with primary or seconda ry education. Public investment in basic education as well as vocational training is another important tool to boost the high productivity in the industry. RMG industry is important in all four Asian LDCs for export earnings, economic growth, and employment generation. The countries need to diversify their products to higher value added products as well as markets to reduce vulnerability to changes in export volume of RMG products. Appropriate strategies with maximum support from the governments and private sector participation are important to mitigate the negative impacts of any external shock to the sector and enhance competitiveness of the industry and labour productivities for sustainable human development.

ADDRESSING INEQUALITIES The Heart of the Post-2015 Development Agenda and the Future We Want for All Global Thematic Consultation LOOKING BEYOND INCOME INEQUALITY Taimur Khilji United Nations Development Programme November, 2012 1 Abstract Income Inequality is often framed as an income problem, and for good reason; the commonly used measure-the gini coefficient-is income based. The way the issue of inequality is framed determines the scope of the solutions proposed. By viewing inequality through the narrow lens of income, we merely address visible manifestations of a potentially deeper societal issue. The symptom (differences in income) is articulated as the main policy problem, while the underlying causes of inequality are left unresolved. For a sustainable solution, we need to carefully analyze the prevalent value system of a society, and see whether it encourages a sense of equality between individuals. If not, what can we do about it through public policy? The paper therefore focuses on between-group inequalities based ethnicity, caste, and gender drawing on research conducted during 2008-2011. About the author Taimur Khilji works as a policy specialist at UNDP\u2019s Asia Pacific Regional Centre in Bangkok, Thailand. His area of work covers social and economic inequalities, hunger and food security, and social protection. He has a BA in philosophy and mathematics from Williams College and Oxford University, and a post graduate degree in economics from the New School. 2 The Asian Context If we don\u2019t change our direction, we are likely to end up where we are headed. Chinese Proverb The word \u2018Asia\u2019 is a European construct, and perhaps a misplaced one, as it encompasses the most diverse of all continents. In terms of language, religion, history, culture, geography, and endowment of natural resources, there are wide variations across countries. China, the world\u2019s most populated country, has had continuous self-government stretching back more than 4,000 years, whereas Timor-Leste has been independent for just a decade. Indonesia comprises over 17,000 islands, consists of hundreds of distinct ethnic groups, and at the same time is the world\u2019s largest Muslim country. Nepal, a landlocked country, has eight of the ten tallest mountains within its territory including the tallest, Mount Everest. On the other hand, Maldives, one of the least populated countries, boasts the lowest maximum elevation in the world at 2.4 metres above sea level. This diversity, apparent both across and within countries, is also reflected in how countries have made economic progress. The region still includes 13 Least Developed Countries (LDCs), including Bangladesh, which has a population of over 150 million. India, the world\u2019s largest democracy and also one of the largest economies in terms of total GDP, is a country with the largest number of poor and hungry. In fact, the majority of poor in Asia-Pacific now reside in Middle Income Countries (MICs). And although China has embraced globalization and the market economy, it is still a communist state. A salient social feature, which gets seldom reported, is that the majority of countries in Asia-Pacific are battling conflict and armed resistance within their borders. These facts sit uncomfortably alongside the standard development narrative, which, while noting growing levels of income inequality in Asia-Pacific, gives greater prominence to the region\u2019s unprecedented economic performance over the last quarter of a century. Inequality in the context of Development While a growing level of inequality is a widely accepted development concern, it continues to be approached through an economic lens. As a result, \u2018solutions\u2019 to reduce inequality suffer from a strong economic bias as well. For example, the commonly used measure for inequality\u2014 the Gini coefficient\u2014is income based. And the oft-proposed solutions rely on \u2018redistributing\u2019 a form of income (i.e. national revenue) through targeted public spending to achieve greater income equality. The common set of public policy interventions tend to focus on increasing the earning potential of low income households by allocating resources towards 1) improving the 3 conditions where the poor live (i.e. rural areas and urban slums); 2) transforming the factors of production they possess (i.e. unskilled labor); and 3) ensuring access to good and services they consume (i.e.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a6dca3b1-0f1b-4735-98c1-91e4063ffdc0": {"__data__": {"id_": "a6dca3b1-0f1b-4735-98c1-91e4063ffdc0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/looking-beyond-income-inequality", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Looking Beyond Income Inequality", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/looking-beyond-income-inequality", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "98168c038b930d26efb2eed82be2a16d920061a3c79268ecba57b304c0e61016"}, "2": {"node_id": "9a3a950d-0222-420b-8255-5faabebce8b5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/looking-beyond-income-inequality", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2e4c367c36d6af9829635ac16376cc0d60e603ebe2263fef1c0370d9f27879f1"}}, "hash": "295555b231a39572d7eabc920bb08d1f7bc23472ed5438e1f0275dfa59c26fc6", "text": "food, healthcare, education, etc.). All these solutions share a common thread: they either require or rely on income. As overall income level came to singularly define the level of development, inequality has been primarily assessed for its instrumental value.

This is also true of how gender inequality gets treated. Development literature continues to put forward the instrumental case for gender equality, emphasizing gender equality as being good for economic growth, rather than stating its intrinsic value from the outset.1 This framing can be captured another way as well; (in)equality has come to be assessed for its value as a means to economic growth rather than as an end in itself. However, framing the issue in such a way allows for a questionable assumption to be smuggled through: certain (indeterminate) levels of inequality may not pose a problem and in fact may be beneficial for economic growth. The inequality debate tends to be cast in terms of efficiency vs. equity, where inequality is to be tolerated and indeed accepted as a trade-off to efficiency and economic growth. Posner (2007) has argued, \u2018income inequality is not bad in general when it does not involve any reduction in the incomes of a substantial fraction of the population.\u2019 His rationale is quite simple: in the event that incomes of the bottom quintile increase by two percent while incomes of those in the top quintile increase by ten percent, everyone is better off even though inequality has increased. Thus conceived, the end\u2014achieving sustained and efficient economic growth\u2014has come to justify the means, and there is little, if any, room left to consider the moral and ethical basis for equality. This manner of thinking is pervasive primarily because our development taxonomy is firmly underpinned by level of income, and we have come to believe the quicker we achieve a higher level of income, the better. As higher GDP is still the established end to achieve, and while accepted country classifications are still based on level of income (i.e. LICs, LDCs, MICs, etc.), the philosophical and ethical underpinnings of equality, which view equality as a worthwhile goal in itself, has limited space in current development discourse. In fact, much of the development discourse can be characterized as a discussion broadly about means rather than one on ends (Marglin, 2010). Contested issues tend to be confined to identifying efficient and effective means to achieve higher levels of overall income. Arguably, the narrow focus and widespread consensus on achieving a higher level of income has hampered alternative approaches from being conceived. 1 Read Naila Kabeer (2005), UNDP (2010), The Commission on Growth and Development (2010) 4 One criticism of adopting such a narrow focus is that it tends to overlook the multidimensionality of inequality\u2014the way in which inequalities actually manifest themselves in society. Non-income based social exclusions, for example, persist and crosscut each other, interacting with other social aspects to reinforce systematic and cumulative disadvantage over generations (Stewart 2002). Marginalization of certain groups in society based on creed, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender can lead to longstanding grievances among the excluded group. Not only do significant differences in income and consumption emerge between excluded and non-excluded groups, but inequalities also surface in a number of other areas including health, education, citizenship rights, mobility, social capital, and social relations. It is critical to realize that groups facing discrimination often do so across a range of areas in the public and private sphere affecting their overall well-being. Moreover, marginalization is not limited to the developing world, but is a feature of the developed world as well. Despite the civil right movement of the 1960s, discrimination against African Americans in the United States continues to persist, revealing itself in stark wage gaps between white and black males, in the prison system, and as inequalities in health and education outcomes (Mckinsey and Company, 2009; Williams & Collins, 1995). And despite the passing the 19th Amendment to the US Constitution in 1920, which granted women the right to vote, women as a group continue to face discrimination in the work place, earning measurably less than men for similar work 90 years later (Getz, 2010). It is therefore worth expanding the scope of \u2018development\u2019 to also look at the non-income aspects of inequality that often lead to the more visible and measurable form of income inequality. Not only are social, cultural, and political inequalities bad from an instrumental point of view (as historically marginalized groups, for instance, are not able to meaningfully contribute and participate in the growth and decision making processes as a result) but, more importantly, such inequalities are unjust and morally wrong. Is the current Inclusive Growth narrative sufficient to address Inequality?

However, \uf0b7 Asia is still home to the largest number of poor and hungry\u2014about two-third\u2019s of the global total (World Bank 2012); \uf0b7 the majority of the poor reside in rural areas and rely on agriculture, although increasingly urban poverty is on the rise (Asian Development Bank 2007); and \uf0b7 the manufacturing and services sectors are capital intensive and labour shedding, whereas agriculture is relatively more labour intensive, although those employed in agriculture tend to be underemployed. Therefore, what is needed is \uf0b7 \u2018inclusive growth\u2019strategies with a focus on employment, especially tapping into growth sectors that are relatively labour intensive; \uf0b7 a renewed focus on agriculture and the rural sector (i.e. increased investment and improved technology yielding increases in income); and \uf0b7 improved access to basic goods and services including food, education, health, and financial services for the poor. Finally, increased government spending should be met through improved domestic tax revenue collection. While the inclusive growth narrative is appealing and easily comprehensible, there are five critical flaws with this dominant narrative. First, the narrative presents a general and simplified analysis on growth, inequality, and poverty, which culminates in a standardized and formulaic set of solutions meant to be applied across the board, from Papua New Guinea to China. Country differences in history, religion, culture and culture, governance and institutional structure, geography, and ethnic diversity are generally neglected, or are presented as inconsequential. 6 Second, the solutions often come in the form of directives that are almost always antithetical in composition; that is, countries need more inclusive growth (because there is a lack of it); growth needs to be broad-based (because it is not broad-based); and there needs to be a focus on (a) productive employment (because the poor are unproductive), (b) increasing incomes of the poor (because they do not earn enough), and (c) creating equal opportunity for all (because there isn\u2019t equal opportunity). Finally, the benefits of growth need to be shared more equally through various channels (because benefits of growth aren\u2019t shared widely, i.e. there is rising inequality). The logic of such arguments tends to be circular and tautological. Third, there is little or no discussion about the failures of the market system in addressing the basic needs of the poor, and how it inherently preserves a certain form of inequality. That is, the poor are unlikely to be employed in any \u2018competitive\u2019 job due to their lack of skills, productive capacity, and lack of social capital at any given time. The market includes and excludes based on achieving greater overall efficiency. Fourth, the inclusive growth narrative neglects the political economy dimension of development. As the narrative simplifies the issue (i.e. income inequality) and standardizes the solutions (i.e. inclusive growth), the difficult and intractable issues related to the social and political conditions under which economies are organized and have to operate, and the implications these conditions have in terms of development outcomes, is not given due attention. Taking into account the political economy dimension would require a nuanced and considered approach, where a closer look at the governance dimension would be desirable. On- the-ground conditions and context matter, and should influence the specific measures and solutions. Finally, the current narrative, for the most part, attempts to address only income inequality. Income inequality tends to be an outcome of other forms of inequality; for example persistent exclusion of certain groups (based on caste, ethnicity, religion, etc.) from the economic, social and political processes tend to widen income disparities (Stewart 2002, Stewart and Brown 2006).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2d5ad953-0bfd-4200-9d35-02b737503f31": {"__data__": {"id_": "2d5ad953-0bfd-4200-9d35-02b737503f31", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/looking-beyond-income-inequality", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Looking Beyond Income Inequality", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/looking-beyond-income-inequality", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9666d96161de216406328d8291c7e7e3980a91c9831553c9f03e22a43fbb4203"}, "2": {"node_id": "5cfa0a71-0944-42be-92a8-4936ff99b82a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/looking-beyond-income-inequality", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7725c5b6f092055903151cc6de28ea75d612af903658fbc8db706a54ee22dd4a"}}, "hash": "e998eaa4f00fc71ac4ad59ca763b93ec0e79566ceab5c140d5d3ff892ccab7b7", "text": "Looking beyond Income Simon Kuznets, who famously argued that income inequality is a common feature of a developing country, also noted that \u201cit is only through contact that recognition and tension are created,[\u2026] the tension created by the observation of the much greater wealth of other communities may have only increased\u201d (Kuznets 1965).

The social landscape of cities, in both developed and developed countries, is characterized by deprivation existing in close proximity with immense wealth. Few opportunities and persistent discrimination on the one hand, and limitless choice and ample freedom on the other, form the basis of large differentials in health, education and income across social groups. The people living in the projects of New York City, the favelas of Rio, and the vast network of slums in Bombay bear witness to the ever-increasing affluence that surrounds them. But what drives these inequalities? Addressing this requires going beyond differentials in income and wealth and looking at broader structural elements that are often difficult to measure and assess. We can certainly probe through asking the right sort of questions: do all ethnic groups have status, rights and are they recognized? Is a democratic set-up able to guard against the persistent marginalization of minority groups? What are the dominant values of the society in question? Does it promote empathy, co-operation, and religious and social diversity? How are immigrants treated? Some of these questions may help us identify causes of inequities that continue to fracture society. Curiously, there is a dearth of studies that analyse the nature and causes of non-income inequalities and their potential adverse consequences to development (Stewart, 2002). Tracking non-income development outcomes such as education, health, and gender equality are likely to fall within the domain of specialized UN agencies (UNICEF, WHO, and UNWOMEN, respectively). Depending on the level of disaggregation, data on these non-income dimensions can uncover inequalities that may be the result of persistent marginalization and stigmatization of certain groups based on religion, gender, location, caste and ethnicity. Behavioural patterns that erode trust between communities, break down channels of communication, and reinforce dominant negative sterotypes can lead to systemic exclusionary practices and measures, the extent of which are partially revealed through development deficits across a range of socio- economic outcomes/indicators (UNDP 2009; Gunewardena, 2009; Stewart, 2002). More extreme cases of persistent inequalities may lead to social unrest and political instability (Tadjoeddin 2007; Sriskandarajah 2005; Posner 2007; Mancini 2005). While several countries in Asia have taken steps to collect quantitative and qualitative data on such inequalities, there is much left to be desired in terms of data collection and monitoring. Assessing inequalities across social groups is a politically sensitive and charged issue. Fundamentally questioning the status quo, especially with the objective of tacking inequalities, is not in the interest of elected offcials as it may draw support away and weaken the vote bank. Weak democracies with fragile institutions are especially susceptible to look the other way. Even mature democracies are finding it difficult to tackle inequality. 8 Examples of group-based Inequalities The country examples that follow are meant to illustrate how inequalities manifest themselves. The list is not intended to be comprehensive, nor is it intended to reflect inequality in all its forms. By showing certain group-based inequalities, we should hopefully begin to uncover some of the structural and underlying causes that lead to the more visible and measurable forms of inequality. This exercise should help to carve out a space for approaching inequalities through a broader lens that goes the traditional and conventional income-based approach. Nepal Nepal has over 100 caste, ethnic and religious groups, and about the same number of spoken languages. Historically, indigenous and religious groups have faced various forms of cultural discrimination (language-, religion-, and citizenship-related) while the Dalits have faced caste- based discrimination (UNDP Nepal, 2009). Caste-based discrimination stems from the hierarchies stipulated by the Muluki Ain (the national code of 1854) that characterized the Dalit as an \u201cuntouchable\u201d (UNDP Nepal, 2009). In fact, the Muluki Ain was instrumental in organizing society by rank, with Brahmans and Dalits occupying the top and bottom rungs of the social ladder. Subsequent State provisions and interventions that further cemented social divisions included the 1960 Panchayat system, which declared Nepal Hindu Kingdom\u201d and Nepali or Khas \u201cthe only official language\u201d (UNDP Nepal, 2009), thus neglecting the diversity in religions practiced and language spoken.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b4cf4e7b-8646-4e4d-8a45-bd24e41a56cb": {"__data__": {"id_": "b4cf4e7b-8646-4e4d-8a45-bd24e41a56cb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/looking-beyond-income-inequality", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Looking Beyond Income Inequality", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/looking-beyond-income-inequality", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "271218927f3ce0dd0b3c5a26ff4130ae49d6aea66b4f90f1f3ee3ff36ae39f5b"}, "2": {"node_id": "1b0ce1fe-2984-4f72-a624-01d6b92152d8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/looking-beyond-income-inequality", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e1ef59a9a99a373cbeec68d06812737c820ea67d0cd83699864c85239f296c06"}}, "hash": "a8480511f49754b6ea317fea542556371e0a7da94db5a25cc078d9c4730ff7ea", "text": "To get a handle of the scope and depth of discrimination faced, there was a survey conducted (2002) that outlined 205 existing practices of caste-based discrimination (UNDP Nepal, 2009).

The 2009 Human Development Report on Nepal estimated the Human Development Index (HDI) for major ethnic and religious groups in Nepal. It found that HDI varies more widely by caste and ethnicity than by geographical location. The Dalits had the lowest HDI, and among the Dalits, the Madhesi Dalits had the lowest HDI (0.383), followed by the Muslims (0.4). On the other end of the spectrum, the Madhesi Brahman had the highest HDI (0.625), followed by the Newars (0.616). The HDI for Nepal stood at 0.509. Not surprisingly, poverty incidence also seems to be most acute among the Dalit and Muslim populations at 45.5 and 41.3 per cent, respectively, and least among the the Brahmin/Chettri groups at 18.6 per 9 cent (Sharma 2009). Poverty reduction efforts also reflect a bias along ethnic and religious lines; poverty incidence among Muslims reduced by a mere two percentage points, from 43.7 to 41.3 per cent over the period, 1995/96- 2003/04, while among the Brahmin/Chettri poverty incidence reduced from 34.1 to 18.4 per cent over the same period (Government of Nepal 2005). In terms of political representation, as late as 1999, Muslims had just 2 seats in Parliament, while the Dalits had no representation although they collectively accounted for alomost 17 percent of the total population.3 The Dalits did however gain representation in the parliament after the most recent elections, as of June, 2012, the parliament had been dissolved. India The Indian Government\u2019s Sachar Commission Report (2006) sought to study the Social, Economic and Educational Status of the Muslim Community of India. It also looked at how other minorities in India were fairing from a social, economic and political standpoint. The commission found that the literacy rate for Muslims (2001) was far below the national average, and the disparity between Muslims vis-\u00e0-vis average literacy level was higher in urban areas vis- \u00e0-vis rural areas. Moreover, 25 percent of Muslim children in the 6-14 age group either never went to school or dropped out at some stage. In terms of employment, Muslims had a considerably lower representation in government jobs, including those in the public sector undertakings compared to other Socio-Religious Categories (SRCs). In fact, the unemployment rate among Muslim graduates is the highest among all SRCs, poor as well as non-poor. With regard to matriculation, graduation and employment in the formal sector all Other Backward Castes (OBCs) lag behind the all-India average. In West Bengal and Kerala, where almost 25 percent of the population is Muslim, Muslims\u2019 share in government jobs is just 4.2 and 10.4 percent, respectively. In terms of health, a Muslim child has a significantly greater risk of being underweight or stunted than is the case with other Socio-Religious Categories: the risk of malnutrition is also \u2018slightly higher\u2019 for Muslim children than for \u2018Other Hindu\u2019 children. In terms of access to services, many areas of Muslim concentration have been marked by banks as \u2018negative\u2019 or \u2018red\u2019 zones where giving loans is not advisable. In terms of poverty, the Scheduled Castes (SCs) and the Scheduled Tribes (STs) together are the poorest groups with a Head Count Ratio (HCR) of 35 percent, followed by Muslims who record the second highest incidence of poverty with 31 percent of people below the poverty line. The Hindu-General category was the least poor category with a HCR of only 8.7 percent while OBCs hold the intermediary level with 3 The Muslims make up 4.3 percent of the total population.

Furthermore, a larger proportion of the Muslim households in urban areas are in the less than Rs.500 expenditure bracket.

Another curious trend, noted by Stewart and Brown (2006), is the high degree of inequality in agricultural holdings among the outer islands5. The transmigration programme in Indonesia, which relocated hundreds of thousands of families from over-populated Java and Bali to the more sparsely populated outer islands, resulted in an unequal distribution in land holdings in favor of the migranting Java/Bali transmigrants. They note that \u201cbased on 1990 census data [\u2026] larger land holdings were concentrated among Java/Bali-born agriculturalists. Overall, the interpolated median landholding of Java/Bali-born agriculturalists in the outer islands was 1.17 hectares, some 44% higher than that of local-born agriculturalists, at 0.82 hectares.\u201d Moreover, Mishra (2009) also highlights the highly skewed assest distribution by pointing out that the \u201cMarket capitalization in the hands of the top ten families accounted for as much as 57.7 percent of the total in Indonesia compared to 46 percent in Thailand, 24.8 percent in Malaysia,18.4 percent in Taiwan and around 2.4 percent in Japan (based on Claessens, Djankov and Lang (1999)).\u201d 4 In some cases (e.g. Fak-Fak, in Papua), the GDP per capita was 16 fold higher than the national average, but the household purchasing power was lower than the national average. 5 That is, all of Indonesia except Java and Bali. 11 Sri Lanka While the 25-year ethnic conflict between the Tamil Tigers and Sri Lankan military may have ended in 2010, reconciliation between the two main ethnic groups is yet to materialize. Disparities in development outcomes between the Tamil minority (approximately 18 percent of the population) and the Sinhalese majority (70 percent of the population) are wide, and point to long-standing discrimination and marginalization experienced by the Tamil minority. Tamil marginalization permeated every sphere of life, including the economic, social, political and the cultural. The Tamil minority has been systematically marginalized, leading to sustained development deficits. The marginalization began with the introduction of 1956 Official Language Act, which instituted Sinhala as the official language of the country. This action was followed by sweeping education reforms biased toward the Sinhalese. Politically, the two main Sinhalese came to dominate completely, which led to economic development and investment concentrated in Sinhalese-dominated areas (Sriskandarajah 2005). While outcome level data vis-\u00e0-vis education, health, wage levels in the north and east of the country (Tamil-majority areas) has been unavailable since the civil conflict started in 1985, some insights can be gleaned using proxies. Gunewardena (2009) notes that labour force data reveals \u201cSinhala-favouring wage gaps throughout the wage distribution\u201d. In addition to differences in resource access and outcome between ethnic groups, Tamil men in the public sector were underpaid by as much as 28 percent, and in the private sector by 9-14 percent, compared to their Sinhalese counterparts with similar education and experience (Gunewardena, 2008). Moreover, based on 2003-4 data, nothern and eastern parts of the country were estimated to have absolute and relative poverty rates just above or similar to the poorest provinces in the rest of the country. Similarly, the limited data on education reveals that barely 18 percent of the population in the eastern part of the country has had secondary level schooling, compared to the national average of 25 percent. In the western part of the country, which includes Colombo, the percentage jumps to 35 percent (Department of Census and Statistics, 2008).

With regard to inequalities, the real challenge is to take bold measures that tackle the structural and underlying causes of persistent inequalities. This requires us to go beyond measurement and analyses, to grasp the social dynamics, history, cultural practices and other dominant factors that are likely to influence persistent discrimination and exclusion in a society\u2014an essential task if we are to tackle inequalities in a fundamental and comprehensive way. With slight modifications, the three dimensions of sustainable development\u2014economic, social and environmental\u2014as put forth in the Rio+20 Global Forum outcome document (United Nations, 2012) can be used as a starting point for categorizing different types of inequalities. It would be worth adding the political dimension as critical to achieving sustainable development, for it is in the political and governance spheres where public policy is crafted, negotiated, approved and finally implemented. It is also an area where inequalities are endemic as minorities tend to be underrepresented and political power concentrated among a select few. Inequalities related to, and emerging due to, environmental factors can be subsumed under the social, economic, and political dimensions. Therefore, to avoid redundancy, income and non- income based-inequalities can be categorized along economic, social and political dimensions (Figure 1). Economic inequalities are income- and assest-based and include inequality in access to or ownership of a variety of assets as well as opportunities for their use (i.e. employment), and current resources that flow from these assests (i.e. income). Social inequalities look at disparities as to how practices and beliefs of different ethnic and religious groups are treated, as well as related inequalities in access to a variety of services. Outcome indicators such as, maternal mortality, literacy, and life expectancy, also fall under the social dimension, while political inequalities consider the distribution of political power and opportunities.7 7 This categorization to a large extent follows Stewart (2002). 13 Figure 1: Categorization of different types of Inequlaities Not only do inequalities cut across several development areas, inequalities in one area influence outcomes in another. For instance, political power affects economic and social dimensions and also vice versa; in most societies, the rich tend to influence political outcomes that favour them. Human and social capital affects employment opportunities and therefore ability to earn a living. Marginalization of groups (based on creed, ethnicity, race, gender, etc.) can limit employment opportunities, political participation and representation. Focusing simply on economic or income inequality gives us partial access to a much wider societal issue that needs to be tackled in a more comprehensive manner. For example, while greater fiscal spending may ameliorate the plight of the Dalits in Nepal and provide them with better access to essential goods and services, it is unlikely to put a stop to the discrimination they face from society at large. In fact, discriminatory practices against them may even intensify based on the perception that the Dalits are being given preferential treatment by the state. The sort of interventions required to change behaviour patterns, perceptions and norms are not dependent on targeted government spending, but come down to a seemingly unlikely set of factors, including provisions to recognise status, citizenship rights, providing opportunities, building trust between groups, and, more generally, between the government and the public.

The paths to it are not found, but made. Peter Ellyard (Australian physicist) The country examples discussed earlier in this short paper emphasize how inequalities manifest themselves in a particular social milieu. Nonetheless, one can draw out common themes and concepts across the set of countries, which may be generalizable to others: \u2018marginalization,\u2019 \u2018discrimination,\u2019 \u2018low social status,\u2019 \u2018lack of education,\u2019 \u2018lack of opportunities,\u2019 etc. However, each of these concepts tends to display a degree of heterogeneity, specific to place, history, culture, and political structure.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f1007eb-a3d3-447c-a8dd-a2b89a528c3d": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f1007eb-a3d3-447c-a8dd-a2b89a528c3d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/looking-beyond-income-inequality", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Looking Beyond Income Inequality", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/looking-beyond-income-inequality", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4a4f391654a48d436b0cc0b63d028af1a0e795446b688a0f7f041ea536a58729"}, "2": {"node_id": "3268724d-836f-4953-8a1c-4163d90c0549", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/looking-beyond-income-inequality", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "160d8394814eb6ca57eb81510a07352e927e4f9bf9a08cbd4c845546a0cf5eb8"}}, "hash": "58d65d44ffa8e718ea7f8ed85ac8065d8a54db78a30bad0d68e6ce5c402d8f95", "text": "For example, members of an ethnic group in Nepal may face discrimination due to the color of their skin, others on the basis of creed, and yet others may encounter hostility simply because they are migrants.

The focus on specificity vis-\u00e0-vis the form inequality takes requires that a comprehensive understanding of history and political economy of the country in question, leading to identification of important group distinctions and characteristics. Given that such an approach assesses how the state relates to certain groups, and also explores the social and economic interactions between groups, it is worth emphasizing the cross-disciplinary nature of the exercise. Anthropology, sociology, politics, law, economics, psychology and history all have a role in comprehending inequalities and adequately addressing them. Therefore, it would be prudent to assess and address inequalities in a cross-disciplinary manner. This also has implications for how development agencies function; it would be useful to pool our human resources, bringing together experts from different fields of knowledge to analyze and address the issue. In terms of policy solutions, inequality and poverty have historically been grouped together, which has led to the development of a common set of policies. Addressing inequality demands a structural change in policy thinking and design, from devising ways to reduce absolute poverty to addressing differences in levels 8 (in access to services, political power and 8 Narrowing differences can sometimes lead to waste. Consider the case where A has good healthcare, while B doesn\u2019t. If we cannot improve the level of healthcare for B (for some reason), then one option is to reduce the quality of healthcare A receives such that conditions between A and B tend towards greater equality. In such cases, it is always better to improve conditions for B and therefore it is more useful in terms of policy to focus on narrowing differences with relation to services such as health, education through improving the overall level of the worse off population such that, over time, differences narrow between them and the better off. However, in terms 15 representation, status and recognition, etc.). This signifies a shift from viewing inequality as part and parcel of a static income problem to treating it as a dynamic issue. Poverty, and by association inequality, has traditionally been viewed in absolute terms, where the focus has been on reducing the number of poor. Inequality, however, requires focusing on difference in levels between individuals and across groups in society. It requires looking at society at large and identifying the sources that lead to vastly different social, political and economic outcomes. In a rapidly globalized and connected world, mechanisms that perpetuate inequality are also cross-border and international. Trade policy decisions taken in Geneva can have dire effects on the farmers in Orissa. Monetary quantitative easing in the United States can appreciate the value of other currencies, in effect increasing the prices of staple commodities in local markets in developing countries. Unfettered speculation with food commodities such as soybeans, corn and wheat arguably contribute to global rise in the prices of these commodities (Food Watch 2011). With communication, information and knowledge sharing having become a virtual enterprise; the digital divide between those with web access and those without is widening, leading to unequal access to opprtunities, goods, services and even political voice9. The flipside of greater connectivity is that greviances and feelings of despondency can be compounded through instant transmission across the world, in effect quickly mobilizing local communities and groups at a global scale. Similarly, the transmission channels that perpetuate and also reinforce inequalities are cross-border and global in nature. To address inequities would require broad coalitions and partnerships and more responsive global governance mechanisms. The current global governance system is percieved as fragmented and ineffective. There is an opportunity to strengthen global mechanisms to be more organized, coordinated and responsive. Focused and specific network-based approaches focusing on values and norms through dialogue, such as N-Peace10\u2014a multi-country initiative bringing together women leaders across countries in Asia Pacific to prevent conflict and build peace through dialogue\u2014are yeilding results. As the earlier country illustrations showed, inequalities emerge in a social and cultural milieu accepting of inequality; sometimes discriminatory practices against groups is consciously promoted through the state apparatus with public constent. Addressing deeply imbeded forms of discrimination in a sustained manner requires that the multi-lateral system work, along with local partners, with the norms and values of societies, so as to ecourage behaviourial shifts that of political representation, status and recognition it is reasonable to narrow differences by taking away from the better off group. 9 Several governments, in both developing and developed countries carry out feedback surveys on the worldwide web. For example, In India, the national economic and developing planning process was open to the public through the web (see http://12thplan.gov.in/).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5950e81-19b2-4df0-9ee5-f529aba0ae32": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5950e81-19b2-4df0-9ee5-f529aba0ae32", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/looking-beyond-income-inequality", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Looking Beyond Income Inequality", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/looking-beyond-income-inequality", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4ee87fa10f9247c4b8f201316f2e93441c7389c89833a39feee3e262b37e3c9f"}, "3": {"node_id": "e2a43e41-2496-445e-8dd5-0a7d67c15e0e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/looking-beyond-income-inequality", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a5a24d864634313c90e925c0b0c09910da51207ca0b914b60c0e417535a4f718"}}, "hash": "782dda6554ef1b4d80d66637a68fb41d98026434d7632ec19c6b27aab7f2ff00", "text": "10 For more information of N-Peace, please go to www.n-peace.net/ 16 lead to more equal outcomes over time. Along with longer term goals such as environmental sustainability, addressing the underlying structural causes of inequality should also be a priority. Shifting away from the standard economic assumptions of scarcity of resources, efficiency, and maximizing individual interest and utility, to a more cooperative and public oriented approach is likely to help redefine the political and social space and discourse, making gross inequities less tolerable. Overcoming longstanding inequalities in education, health and access to other services is not an issue of lack of resources per se, as is commonly cited, but more a reflection of the pervailing set of priorities.11 Finally, commited leadership is needed to overcome some of the underlying causes of persisent inequality. As is usually the case, it is the minority groups, even in largely democratic set ups, that bear the brunt of continued discrimination and marginalization. Bold actions, challenging the status quo and pervailing social practices, would be required. Governance sturctures would need to be reassesed and altered to cater to the neglected groups. Affirmative action policies, of the sort promoted in Malaysia, United States, and India would need to underpin a renewed social compact between the government and those governed. So what is needed is nothing less than a shift in how we approach inequalities. A shift away from addresing the outcomes and symptoms of inequalities (i.e. income inequality) to addressing the structural and root causes (patterns of behaviour). Unless a post 2015 development agenda pays attention to the underlying behavioural issues, inequalities are likely to persist. Both reason and emotion will be needed for this endevour. (Approximately 6,000 words) 11 Often military budgets account for large fractions of the total budget in many developing countries. A shift in priorities by setting aside additional budget towards educating and providing health services to the neglected population would go a long way in narrowing disparities. 17 REFERENCES Asian Development Bank.

The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) provided generous funding to enable the consultations to be carried out and the strategy to be prepared, and the grant support of Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Umwelt, Naturschutz und Reaktorsicherheit (BMU) underpinned the development of information materials on mangroves and other coastal ecosystems which were used in consultations. Acknowledgement is also due to the country offices of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Thailand, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) country offices in India, Indonesia and Maldives, and the Coordinator of the Disaster Management Branch of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in Indonesia, for their assistance in arranging country dialogue meetings. UNEP\u2019s Disaster Management Branch volunteered a technical expert as a member of the drafting team who prepared this strategy. The United Nations Office of the Special Envoy for Tsunami Recovery facilitated the initial presentation of the Mangroves for the Future initiative in April 2006 and the roundtable meeting at which it was presented to donors in September 2006. Last but not least, thanks should be expressed to the many individuals, organisations and government agencies who gave of their time so freely to share information and ideas on the needs for coastal ecosystem management and sustainable development in Indian Ocean countries. SUMMARY: Mangroves for the Future Mangroves for the Future is a partnership-led initiative aimed at promoting investment and action in ecosystem conservation for sustainable coastal development. The Initiative is founded on a vision for a more healthy, prosperous and secure future for all Indian Ocean coastal communities, where all ecosystems are conserved and managed sustainably. Conserving ecosystems as essential development \u201cinfrastructure\u201d Mangroves for the Future promotes investment in natural ecosystems as essential \u201cinfrastructure\u201d for coastal development \u2014 in other words, as a vital part of the stock of assets, facilities and services that are needed for the economy and society to function properly. In order to ensure ecosystem productivity and continued support to human development, they need to be maintained and improved to meet both today\u2019s needs as well as future demands and pressures just like any other component of infrastructure. Degrading this valuable stock of natural capital puts a serious strain on the economy and society, at local, national, regional and even global levels \u2014 as has become all too apparent in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "18d1f120-3d1f-44cb-96e8-783c62420bad": {"__data__": {"id_": "18d1f120-3d1f-44cb-96e8-783c62420bad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mangroves-future", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Mangroves for the Future", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mangroves-future", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3f6c718a9991f972081f236234d97f03662a6191a878d9479540a761701e44cb"}, "2": {"node_id": "9669e682-6ebb-4fdd-a64d-5a0319ae826d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mangroves-future", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "76be1a36896f60fef5c99f5c037bf433edba46b005b200323c60e7d3f4bfbf19"}}, "hash": "29c901ef6e7608f4f7ec6b09548426b2cf4d4c20dc96581efddfb28e28bc963f", "text": "The Initiative uses mangroves as the flagship species but works in all types of natural coastal ecosystems.

Mangroves for the Future targets countries that are recovering from the Indian Ocean tsunami. Its \u201cfocal countries\u201d are among the worst-affected by the 2004 tsunami: India, Indonesia, Maldives, Seychelles, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. The Initiative will also open a dialogue to share information and experiences with other tsunami-affected countries in the region that face critical ecosystems and livelihood issues, including Bangladesh, Kenya, Malaysia, and Tanzania. Additional countries within the Asia Indian Ocean region will also at a later stage be brought into these dialogues, such as Cambodia, China, Pakistan, the Philippines and Vietnam. An ocean-wide approach will be promoted to coastal management. Shared objectives and common actions Mangroves for the Future has two objectives \u2022 to strengthen the environmental sustainability of coastal development, and \u2022 to promote the investment of funds and effort in coastal ecosystem management for sustainable development. The initiative seeks to effect demonstrable changes and results across four key areas of influence: regional cooperation, national programme support, private sector engagement and community action using a strategy of generating knowledge, empowering institutions and people to use that knowledge, and thereby promoting good governance in coastal areas (see Figure 1.). Mobilising resources to foster regional action At the regional level, implementation of the initiative will be overseen by a Regional Steering Committee co-chaired by IUCN \u2013 The World Conservation Union and the United Nations i Development Programme (UNDP), which will include representation from national governments, UN agencies and non-governmental organisations. At the national level, Mangroves for the Future will be coordinated and steered through strengthening the existing mechanisms for coastal management which bring together different agencies, sectors and civil society groups. Action at the local level will be implemented through a series of individual actions that are linked by a common goal and strategy, but are spread out geographically, temporally, and in terms of management and implementation responsibility. Many different agencies and organisations will take the lead in implementing these actions. conserve and restore coastal ecosystems as key assets which support human well-being and security in the Indian Ocean Region conserve and restore coastal ecosystems as key assets which support human well-being and security in the Indian Ocean Region strengthen the environmental sustainability of coastal development strengthen the environmental sustainability of coastal development promote the investment of funds and effort in coastal ecosystem management promote the investment of funds and effort in coastal ecosystem management RESULTS RESULTS Regional Cooperation Regional Cooperation National Programmes National Programmes Private sector engagement Private sector engagement Community Action Community Action ACTIONS ACTIONS Building Knowledge Building Knowledge Strengthening Empowerment Strengthening Empowerment Enhancing Governance Enhancing Governance OBJECTIVES OBJECTIVES GOAL GOAL Figure 1. Mangroves for the Future \u2013 Initiative Outline Building a collaborative platform to enhance sustainable coastal development The initiative builds on the long history of coastal management interventions in the region, as well as from recent lessons learned during the course of post-tsunami reconstruction. This strategy has been developed based on needs and priorities identified during consultations with more than 200 people from over 160 institutions involved in coastal management in Indian Ocean countries, at local, national, regional and global levels. Mangroves for the Future establishes a collaborative platform among the many different agencies, sectors and countries who are addressing coastal ecosystem and livelihood issues, to work towards a common goal. Promoting investment in ecosystem conservation for coastal development Immediately after the tsunami, the region saw an unprecedented injection of investment and development projects in coastal areas, prompted by the urgent need to rebuild settlements and ii infrastructure, and restore livelihoods. Many of these activities are now winding down \u2014 often without having achieved their intended goals, and having raised serious concerns about long- term impacts. Mangroves for the Future aims to address the need for better regional and national coordination as well as the need for sustained investment in coastal ecosystem management for sustainable development. The estimated funding requirements of Mangroves for the Future for 2007-2012 are USUS$62 million. iii THE SITUATION: Ecosystems and livelihoods in Indian Ocean countries The links between ecosystem services and human well-being Ecosystem health and human livelihoods are intimately interrelated. Coastal ecosystems underpin human well-being (including the basic material needs for a good life, health, good social relations, security, and freedom of choice and action) through providing provisioning, supporting, regulating and cultural services (Figure 2). Many types of coastal ecosystems provide these benefits, including mangroves and other coastal forests and wetlands, estuaries, lagoons, sandy beaches, sand dunes, coral reefs and seagrass communities.

Mangroves, for instance, provide a home to many commercially important species, such as finfish, crustaceans and molluscs, and yield an array of products such as food fish, timber, fuel wood and medicines. Most people are well aware of the importance of resource-based industries such as fisheries and tourism to coastal economies. There is perhaps less comprehension of just how important these goods and raw materials are in terms of their multiplier effects at national and local levels. In the Seychelles, for example, coastal and marine biodiversity contributes a quarter of all employment opportunities, one third of government revenues, and two thirds of foreign exchange earnings1. In parts of Indonesia, traditional use of mangrove products contributes up to a half of income among the poorest households2, and in southern Thailand is thought to generate products worth almost a quarter of per capita GDP among coastal villages3. What is much more poorly understood is the enormous contribution that coastal ecosystems make in safeguarding production and consumption, reducing vulnerability, strengthening resilience, and mitigating disasters \u2014 their supporting and regulating roles. Mangroves and other ecosystems also protect against extreme weather events; they act as barriers or buffers which moderate the action of waves and consequently limit both coastal erosion and storm damage; they function as sponges to minimise the impact of floods; they trap and retain 1 sediments that are carried in by rivers and floodwaters; and they trap carbon and other minerals and convert these to useful nutrients. Their role as a carbon sink is a service of particular global importance \u2014 mangroves and their soils are the second largest repository of terrestrial sequestered carbon after tropical forests. These services have an immense economic value. Large-scale fisheries, tourism, mining and shipping industries generate high levels of income, employment and foreign exchange earnings, and some of the region\u2019s major centres of commerce and industry are located on the coast. The coastal regions of Sri Lanka, for example, encompass 22% of total land area, 32% of the country's population, 65% of urbanised areas, and contain 4 out of the 6 cities; over 80% of tourist hotel rooms, and two thirds of all industrial production in the country4. Many households in Indian Ocean countries, particularly the poor, depend on the natural resource base for their day-to-day survival. Fishing provides a basic source of food and income for 13 million people, and various other marine and coastal species are also exploited both for subsistence and for commercial purposes. Plant and animal products provide important sources of food, energy, building materials, medicines and livestock fodder at the household level. In Indian Ocean countries, the coastal environment is the cornerstone of an extensive tourist industry that was devastated by the tsunami. For example marine and coastal tourism, the largest industry in the Maldives, directly accounts for 20% of GDP and its wider effects help produce 74% of national income5. Tourism contributes more than 60% of foreign exchange receipts, over 90% of government tax revenue comes from import duties and tourism-related taxes, and almost 40% of the workforce is employed in the industry. As a result of the tsunami, 2005 visitor exports were expected to fall 29.9% from pre-Tsunami growth forecasts, while government expenditures and capital investment are expected to increase 6.6% and 14.6% respectively \u2014 the bottom-line impact was predicted at a loss of 30% or USUS$55 million in tourism industry contribution to 2005 GDP and 10,440 jobs6. In addition, the benefits of mangroves for shoreline protection and storm damage control have been estimated to run into tens of thousands of dollars per km2 in Sri Lanka7 and Malaysia8. Studies carried out in Vietnam show that the net present value of mangroves in protecting", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a1a6d012-a05a-44d6-9a3c-7f2fcfdc8714": {"__data__": {"id_": "a1a6d012-a05a-44d6-9a3c-7f2fcfdc8714", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mangroves-future", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Mangroves for the Future", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mangroves-future", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e97ec52b4fb448e1f7d2979e0b667bfcc71c8a08ca7779d108ef69af18657649"}, "3": {"node_id": "2fc5ab0d-9b29-446c-8a1b-e86c07fa51cf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mangroves-future", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6b6214a5d4e808c2571b7c1578d350fdc70fdd87d84f12d068e5b70e427418fd"}}, "hash": "7f03ebd13be25003582bece708fa3f5e7b8ac33c7b568992ae7fe1fb6f9c1010", "text": "against extreme weather events lies at around USUS$5,000 per square kilometre9. In Sri Lanka, costs and damages arising from the degradation of coastal wetlands rise to hundreds of thousands of dollars per hectare in terms of lost water purification and flood attenuation services10. Ecosystems need to be maintained in a good state \u2014 and even improved \u2014 if they are to continue to provide these essential services to humankind.. Mangroves and other coastal forests and wetlands, estuaries, lagoons, sandy beaches, sand dunes, coral reefs and seagrass communities have all been under threat for decades from ill-planned and unsustainable development activities, and these pressures continue to escalate and intensify in Indian Ocean countries \u2014 with devastating impacts on the region\u2019s rich, productive and fragile natural ecosystems. The 2004 tsunami and its tragic consequences drew attention to the vulnerability of tropical coastal ecosystems, and the dangers of undermining the services they provide to humans 2 The state of coastal ecosystems and ecosystem services The countries participating in Mangroves for the Future have a combined coastline length exceeding 140,000 km, and a territorial sea area of almost 4 million km2 (Box 1). They encompass some of the most extensive, and biodiverse, tropical coastal and marine ecosystems in the world, containing more than 65,000 km2 of mangroves11 (more than a third of the world\u2019s total) and just under 80,000 km2 of coral reefs12 (30% of total). Indonesia alone has up to a quarter of the world\u2019s mangroves13. To the south east, the seas hold some of the highest coral reef biodiversity in the world, with Thailand and Indonesia forming major centres of diversity. To the centre and north, the massive arc of reefs comprising Lakshadweep, the Maldives and the Chagos Archipelago, has some of the world\u2019s largest atoll structures and together with Sri Lanka, has been identified as one of ten global priority areas for coral reef conservation14. More than 50 of a total of 70 known mangrove species are present, almost 6,000 fish species have been documented, and there are known to be at least 80 species of hard corals15. In the Maldives alone a staggering 1,200 fish species have been recorded to date. In the Western Indian Ocean, the mainland coast of East Africa and islands of the Western Indian Ocean also have extensive reefs. These highly productive ecosystems provide a habitat for many rare, endangered and important species. In India, for example, mangrove ecosystems are known to host almost 4,000 species of fauna and flora16. Box 1.

These rich and fragile ecosystems are under serious threat, and show steep downward trends in terms of area, species diversity and general integrity. In tropical countries, rates of loss of mangrove forest exceed those of reefs and rainforests17. Between 1980 and 2000, 28% of the total area of mangroves in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India and Thailand was lost18.

In addition to habitat loss and degradation noted above, causes of coastal ecosystem changes include pollution; resource overexploitation; invasive species, and climate change. 3 A critical transboundary pollution issue concerns the suspended solids generated by large-scale land-use changes, including infrastructure development, deforestation and agriculture. Marine litter is also a growing problem, polluting the coast as well as adversely affecting submerged species and habitats, and undermining ecosystem functioning. Fish catch has escalated rapidly in recent years across the Indian Ocean region, and fisheries are generally considered over- exploited. Over-fishing is primarily caused by the excessive fishing effort of industrial fishing fleets, but small-scale fishers also overexploit near-shore fish stocks. An increasing number of fishers throughout Asia are using destructive fishing methods to supply the global aquarium trade, and to meet the growing and lucrative export market for live seafood in China and other parts of Asia21. There are already indication that the growing impacts of climate change are being felt across the Indian Ocean region, especially the island states. A recent publication reports that as a result of climate change, sea level changes could lead to the additional loss of mangrove area22. In addition, the effects of climate change are likely to cascade into those of the other drivers of ecosystem loss, compounding the result. In certain locations, particularly near the epicentre of the earthquake, the Indian Ocean tsunami caused immediate and extensive damage to coastal and marine ecosystems. In many cases natural ecosystems acted as buffers which took the major force of the waves themselves, or were affected by the silt loads and rubble carried by the wave. Mangroves and other ecosystems became further threatened, and degraded, as post-tsunami reconstruction took place. Land in coastal areas is scarce and under heavy demand, and in several areas mangroves and other natural ecosystems have been destroyed or degraded as infrastructure and settlements were rehabilitated and relocated, often in an unplanned or poorly planned manner. 1,000 2,000 3,000 4,000 0 0 4,000 8,000 12,000 14,000 10,000 6,000 2,000 500 1,500 2,500 3,500 4,500 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 Within own EEZ Other EEZ High Seas Territories EE Figure 3. Fish catches by SAARC and ASEAN countries (tonnes) Source: UBC Sea Around Us project The state of livelihoods and human well-being The coasts of Indian Ocean countries host a striking concentration of human settlement and economic activity. Of a total population of just under two billion people in the countries participating in Mangroves for the Future, almost 40% \u2014 more than 625 million \u2014 live within 100 km of the coast (Box 2). Coastal settlements are diverse in socio-economic terms, ranging from large cities to remote villages, and contain a wide array of ethnic groups, economic activities, land and resource use patterns. They typically make a significant contribution to regional, national and local economies. The human population in the region has been rising rapidly. Rates of population growth are particularly high in coastal areas. At the same time coastal zones are becoming increasingly urbanised, reflecting intensifying levels of industry and commerce, and witnessing high rates of immigration from rural parts of the coast and from inland areas. Development patterns and trends are extremely unequal in Indian Ocean countries. GINI index 4 measures (indicating the distribution of income or consumption among individuals) all fall below 50%, and according to UNDP\u2019s Human Development Index all of the Asian countries participating in Mangroves for the Future are classified in the medium human development category, while the two mainland African countries fall within the low human development bracket (Figure 4) . While some sectors of the coastal population enjoy a high standard of living, the incidence of poverty remains high. Large stretches of the coastline are relatively isolated from mainstream economic activity, infrastructure and services, and the livelihoods of many residents are subsistence-based. National poverty estimates in the participating countries suggest that as many as 230 million people are living in coastal areas on less than the equivalent of USUS$1 per day. These poor people often reside in marginal areas, where health conditions and sanitation facilities are bad, and access to safe drinking water and other essential services is unreliable. Box 2.

Although some progress has undoubtedly been made over the last decades in improving basic welfare (at least in South and Southeast Asian countries), progress towards the Millennium Development Goals, agreed by governments in 2000, has been patchy (Table 1). There is ample evidence that many coastal residents still face glaring inequities in terms of their access to income, employment and the basic services required for an adequate standard of life.

Source: UN (2005) Vulnerability and resilience after the tsunami It is against this backdrop of widespread poverty and high dependence on a fragile coastal resource base that the earthquake and subsequent tsunamis of 26 December 2004 took place. Some quarter of a million people lost their lives, and almost 1.75 million were displaced. More than 1.8 million people\u2019s homes were destroyed, between five and six million needed food, water and medical supplies, and it is estimated that the livelihoods of one million people were eliminated23. For the five countries worst affected by the tsunami \u2014 India, Indonesia, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand \u2014 the cost of tsunami-related damages and losses is estimated at almost US$10 billion24 (Box 3).

Tsunami Evaluation Coalition, London The Indian Ocean tsunami was an extreme event, which had devastating consequences. It however demonstrates the vulnerability of the Indian Ocean\u2019s coastal populations to both natural and man-made disasters and hazards. History shows that the countries participating in Mangroves for the Future face recurrent risks from natural forces (such as cyclones, typhoons, 6 earthquakes, fires, tidal surges and floods) and as a result of human-induced disasters and shocks (such as climate change, oil spills, marine pollution and coastal erosion). A recent study shows that disasters have risen in frequency from fewer than 100 in 1975 to more than 400 in 2005. Though the number of earthquakes has remained relatively constant, the number severe weather events and flooding has risen sharply. Approximately 2.6 billion people were affected by disasters over the past 10 years, compared to 1.6 billion in the previous decade25. Tropical storms are forecast to become even more frequent and intense26, and sea levels and surface temperatures are both rising27. Seismological and geological evidence shows that the fault off the coast of Sumatra and Java is likely to experience further earthquakes in the relatively near future28. All of these forces will have major impacts on coastal ecosystems and communities in Indian Ocean countries. The majority of coastal dwellers remain extremely vulnerable to such events. As was illustrated so graphically in the case of the 2004 tsunami, pre-existing economic, social, political and environmental vulnerabilities compound and exacerbate the impact of disasters, prolong their effects, and undermine the capacity of people to survive and recover from disasters. In particular, poorer groups, women and children tend to suffer disproportionate effects from disasters. Vulnerability is created by factors including poverty, weak governance, political instability, unsustainable livelihoods, conflict and environmental degradation. These factors also determine the extent to which people can protect themselves and recover. In addition to the worrying trends in these root causes of vulnerability among the countries participating in Mangroves for the Future, recent studies29 suggest that since the 2004 tsunami local preparedness for disaster has not been enhanced, and little progress has been made in reducing the longer-term vulnerability of coastal populations. High density and poorly planned developments and infrastructure located in close proximity to the shoreline typically suffered greater impacts as a result of the tsunami and other disasters. The poor, living in already marginalised conditions, lacking a robust livelihood base, and having weak access to basic services, tend to be hit especially hard by \u2014 and find it particularly hard to recover from \u2014 such shocks and disruptions. A general consensus has emerged, post-tsunami, that unless development and reconstruction efforts address the broader \u2014 and continuing \u2014 conditions of poverty and needs for continuing development support, coastal populations will remain weak, and the long-term returns from this huge inflow of funding for post-tsunami reconstruction may fail to reach their targets and full potential. After the tsunami, despite the massive efforts to reconstruct and rebuild affected communities and infrastructure, a large proportion of the coastal population in South and Southeast Asia and the Western Indian Ocean regions remain highly vulnerable and ill- equipped to withstand the effects of further shocks and disasters. Mechanisms for coastal management Government approaches to integrated coastal management For countries participating in Mangroves for the Future, the overall mandate for directing, regulating and coordinating both development and conservation activities in coastal areas lies with national government, often implemented through a decentralised administrative structure. A complex institutional, legal and policy framework guides activities in coastal zones, with specific instruments directing the various ministries and line agencies (at both national and sub-national levels) who have jurisdiction over different sectors, resources or activities (for example agriculture, water, fisheries, aquaculture, urban, forests, tourism and wildlife). In many cases this gives rise to competing, and even conflicting, mandates and goals in coastal management. In order to minimise competition and conflict, and to introduce some form of coordination between the actions of different sectors and managing authorities, most governments have adopted an integrated approach to coastal management (Table 2). An umbrella institution, 7 policy and legislation which is specifically concerned with coastal areas has often been established. The large number of sectors involved in the coastal zone however means that institutional arrangements for integrated and effective management are often difficult and in many countries are still at an experimental stage, with regular restructuring taking place.

Sri Lanka has one of the most long-established integrated coastal management planning, legal and institutional frameworks in the region. India is currently 8 revising coastal zone legislation, with a view to determining coastal area according to a vulnerability line, and to promoting a more participatory approach to decision making and planning. Both Indonesia and Thailand are in the process of developing institutional and legal frameworks for integrated coastal management. In the Seychelles, a coastal zone management unit was created in the Department of Environment in 2002 to implement and coordinate coastal zone management activities. In 2006, this unit was upgraded to the Environmental Engineering Section, tasked with addressing the main issues with coastal degradation and better management of the coastal environment, including addressing post-tsunami rehabilitation and restoration. As yet, the Maldives has no single agency responsible for coastal management, and there is no co-ordinating body. Regional cooperation The countries of the Indian Ocean are inextricably linked to each other by the fluid nature of the marine environment, both physically and ecologically. Coastal conservation and development activities that take place in one country have direct effects on the status of ecosystems and livelihoods in neighbouring countries. In addition to the national coastal zone management frameworks which govern policy, planning and practice in each country, a number of inter- governmental bodies and agreements link the efforts of different countries and provide for regional collaboration in coastal management.

Actions by non-governmental organisations and international agencies A large number of bilateral and multilateral international agencies provide funding to, and in many cases exert a strong influence over, coastal zone development processes in Indian Ocean countries. This ranges from grant and loan support to infrastructure and large-scale developments (the Asian Development Bank, World Bank and various bilateral donors are particularly active in this area), through initiatives aimed at strengthening agriculture, fisheries and poverty reduction initiatives (for example from UNDP, IFAD and FAO), to activities concerned with disaster preparedness and risk reduction (such as by the member organisations of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Disaster Reduction). Numerous national NGOs and Community Based Organisations are involved throughout the region in coastal management, providing a long-term source of capacity and support for ecosystem conservation and sustainable livelihood development. In many cases they play an important role in helping to address the gaps in capacity, coordination and participation which exist in the public sector. Various international non-governmental organisations also support coastal management in the region. For many decades, projects and programmes have been implemented to support the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources (for example by Conservation International, Fauna and Flora International, The Nature Conservancy, Wetlands International (leading the Green Coast Initiative), WWF, and by the World Conservation Union (IUCN)), as well as to strengthen sustainable livelihood development in coastal areas (such as through the work of CARE International, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and Oxfam). Post-tsunami challenges in coastal management After the 2004 tsunami, many of the actors in coastal management quickly became involved in the reconstruction process, in many cases re-orienting their long-term programmes of work to meet immediate needs. They were joined by various organisations which were new to the region or to coastal management issues, or which had been formed specifically in response to the tsunami and to the large inflow of funding associated with it. Approximately US$14 billion was given in international aid to the post-tsunami reconstruction effort, plus significant cash and in-kind contributions from the national governments of affected countries, NGOs and members of the general public31. 9 Table 3.

A recent review32 has, for example, registered more than 60 projects and agencies dealing with post-tsunami mangrove restoration activities. Due to the immediate needs of post-tsunami reconstruction, many of these efforts at environmental restoration and rehabilitation were guided by a short-term planning perspective. Currently, many remain incomplete, unfinished, or have failed to achieve their intended impacts. The valuable work and progress in incorporating environmental concerns into coastal planning and development, that had been sparked off by the immediate needs of post-tsunami reconstruction, may be lost \u2014 while the pressures and threats that they addressed would continue unabated.. There have been concerns about both the immediate and continuing impacts of some of the activities undertaken as part of the post-tsunami recovery effort. As well as leading to short-term distortions in employment, price and market conditions, major apprehensions have been raised about the targeting and sustainability of some of the relief provided \u2014 and the extent to which it will actually lead to long-term improvements in the welfare of coastal populations. There is widespread criticism that governments and international agencies failed to ensure that funding was needs-based, that significant imbalances exist in the allocation and distribution of funds to affected communities, and that certain \u201clivelihood support\u201d activities may have been misplaced. In many cases, reconstruction efforts were also carried out without due attention to environmental issues. Ecosystem issues that were targeted in the aftermath of the tsunami \u2014 such as restoring sustainable livelihoods, reducing pressures on the natural resource base, and minimising the negative environmental impacts of settlement and infrastructure \u2014 are long-term in nature. They existed before the tsunami, intensified during the course of post-tsunami reconstruction, and will continue well into the future. At the same time, problems in capacity, coordination and information-sharing which were faced in the course of addressing post-tsunami environmental concerns are indicative of broader constraints to integrated coastal management. 11 THE NEED: Investment in coastal ecosystem conservation Identifying priorities through consultation Particularly since the 1980s, much attention has been paid to the management of coastal development in Indian Ocean countries. There is a long history of efforts, by various countries and agencies, to address the needs and tensions which arise in the course of managing and using the region\u2019s coastal resources. The December 2004 tsunami, and the subsequent reconstruction process, brought many of these issues in coastal management to the foreground. The demand for an initiative such as Mangroves for the Future emerged one year after the tsunami. Over the course of 2005 the region had seen an unprecedented injection of investment and projects into coastal areas, prompted by the urgent need to rebuild settlements and infrastructure, and restore livelihoods. At the same time, there was a greatly increased recognition of the importance of natural ecosystems in coastal areas. New partnerships were formed to deal with environmental aspects of post-tsunami reconstruction, and fresh programmes of work were initiated. As the post-tsunami reconstruction effort winds down, coordination between the actors involved in environmental aspects of coastal zone management remains weak. There is little sharing of lessons learned or insights gained into coastal management (including lessons learned before the tsunami, as well as in the course of the reconstruction process), and there is scant evidence that funds (including the massive injection of resources for post-tsunami reconstruction) are being directed to where they are most needed, and can have the most positive impact. An initial meeting to communicate these regional messages and needs to senior decision- makers, donors and international agencies was convened jointly by IUCN and the UN Office of the Special Envoy for Tsunami Recovery on April 24 2006, in New York. About 25 representatives from the governments of tsunami-affected countries and from international agencies endorsed the initiative, and expressed their eagerness to participate and collaborate in its further development. Having received this high-level support, between May and August 2006 a process of detailed consultation and dialogue was conducted to develop the Initiative. Mangroves for the Future was designed in consultation with the many different agencies, sector and countries engaged in coastal management and post-tsunami reconstruction. It aims to build a common platform for action. IUCN and UNDP, as two institutions who have long been working in the region, are bringing together different stakeholders in the development and conservation arena to facilitate a process of turning the needs into a concrete strategy and plan for action.

This dialogue identified ongoing programmes of work, experiences and lessons learned, perceptions of needs and priorities for coastal ecosystem and livelihood support, and specific interests in participating in Mangroves for the Future. These consultations resulted in the development of this strategy. Issues and challenges to be addressed The regional consultation and dialogue, and the review of the status and trends in ecosystems, livelihoods and coastal management in Indian Ocean countries, highlight a situation of high human dependence on a rich natural resource base. Yet, despite comprehensive institutional, policy and legal frameworks for coastal management and development in many countries, these benefits are being threatened by growing social, economic and political pressures. Human needs and aspirations continue to intensify, and coastal areas are increasingly subject to national, regional and even global demands on resources. 12 A development imperative which largely bypasses environmental concerns, combined with weak governance and widespread poverty, has resulted in ecosystem loss and degradation \u2014 which in turn has undermined economic and social stability, and increased the vulnerability of coastal populations. The tsunami did not create these problems, but brought them sharply into focus. Long-term action is needed to address and overcome the high incidence of poverty and livelihood insecurity in coastal areas, as well as the threats to coastal ecosystems, which include: \u2022 Unsustainable development processes and policies (at local, national and global levels) causing conversion, degradation and depletion of the natural environment. \u2022 Poor coordination, overlapping jurisdictions and often conflicting interests in coastal management, resulting in development processes which impact negatively on ecosystems and livelihoods, and accord a low priority to ecosystem conservation policies and budgets. \u2022 Weak governance at the national level, resulting in a failure to enforce or implement environmental policies and laws effectively. \u2022 Unequal participation and benefit among civil society groups in coastal conservation and development decision-making causing increasing inequity among coastal populations. \u2022 Inadequate regional collaboration in environmental matters, resulting in a lack of effective action to address common concerns and sensitive issues, or to promote joint action on matters of shared interest. \u2022 Gaps in capacity, knowledge and empowerment among coastal ecosystem managers and users, resulting in conservation and development efforts which fail to maximise positive social, economic and ecological impacts. Sharing responsibility for the state of coastal ecosystems and livelihoods in Indian Ocean countries Mangroves for the Future is founded on a regional approach, strengthening efforts at sustainable coastal management across countries, sectors, agencies and levels of scale. It also provides an important mechanism for supporting the implementation of activities to assist countries to meet their national commitments to coastal ecosystem conservation and livelihood development. The initiative however recognises that many of the threats and issues concerning Indian Ocean ecosystems and livelihoods are not just local, national or regional in terms of their causes and effects, but also arise from (and impact on) global processes and actions. The pressures and unsustainable demands on coastal resources and ecosystems are in part driven by markets and mandates which originate outside the region. These threats arise from forces such as consumer demands for particular products and services, unsustainable and inequitable patterns of trade and investment, industrial and commercial development, and climate change. There are considerable global benefits from ensuring that coastal areas are conserved and managed sustainably. The natural resource base in Indian Ocean countries underpins substantial commerce and exports which benefit the international economy and residents of other countries: for example through fisheries production and tourism activities. The region\u2019s biodiversity is of global significance, and includes large and relatively pristine ecosystems, rare, endangered and threatened species. Their degradation is an issue of global concern: both in terms of the loss of valuable natural resources (which in some cases are found nowhere else on earth), and also due to increased vulnerability, disasters and shocks which are also felt by the international community. Global responsibilities and obligations to conserve coastal ecosystems and strengthen sustainable livelihoods in Indian Ocean countries are reflected in the multilateral agreements 13 and targets that governments across the world have committed themselves to achieving. Instruments such as the 2000 Millennium Development Goals, 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity (and the 2010 Biodiversity Target), 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and 2005 Hyogo Framework for Action all require parties to take action, and make investments, in conserving ecosystems, supporting livelihoods, and reducing risk and vulnerability across the globe. These shared interests and responsibilities for addressing threats to coastal ecosystems and livelihoods in Indian Ocean countries requires a commitment at all levels \u2014 including from the international community.

The region saw an unprecedented injection of investment and projects into coastal areas, prompted by the urgent need to rebuild settlements and infrastructure, and restore livelihoods. Despite the generosity of these contributions, concerns still remain about their long- term impacts and effectiveness, and about the adequacy of investment in ecosystem management. Many of these activities are now winding down \u2014 often without having achieved their intended goals, and having raised serious concern about long-term impacts. The need, and responsibility, to invest in coastal ecosystems as development \u201cinfrastructure\u201d continues far beyond the aftermath of the tsunami. It requires a long-term perspective, and commitment, at the global level. Mangroves for the Future provides a mechanism to sustain the investments in coastal management that are so urgently needed in Indian Ocean countries, and to fulfil global commitments to supporting sustainable, equitable and beneficial development in the region. The initiative aims to match funding and other resources to the locations, actions and agencies where they are needed most, and can have the most positive impact and effectiveness. Applying a new paradigm: ecosystems as essential \u201cinfrastructure\u201d for coastal development Successfully addressing these challenges requires a new approach \u2013 one that brings conservation actions effectively into development agendas, and that engages all sectors in coastal ecosystem management. Although the links between ecosystem services and human wellbeing are becoming more widely understood, there remain wide gaps in understanding between \u201cconservation\u201d and \u201cdevelopment\u201d sectors. Given the long history of interventions in the region\u2019s coastal areas, it is clear that any new initiative has to be founded on an innovative approach which will build, and improve, on those actions that had gone before. For these reasons, and in the light of recent experiences that have emerged in the context of post-tsunami reconstruction, Mangroves for the Future adopts a new paradigm for conservation that recognises ecosystem services as an essential, and productive, part of coastal development \u201cinfrastructure\u201d. Box 4. Defining coastal ecosystems and livelihoods Infrastructure is the stock of facilities, services and equipment that are needed for the economy and society to function properly. The coastal zone is defined as both the area of the land subject to marine influences, and the area of the sea subject to land influences. This includes the sea and sea-bed, the beach and inter-tidal zone, and the land above the high-tide line. Coastal ecosystems are taken to include mangroves and other coastal forests and wetlands, estuaries, lagoons, sandy beaches, sand dunes, coral reefs and seagrass communities. Ecosystem services are the benefits people obtain from ecosystems. As defined by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, these include provisioning services (such as food, water, timber, and fibres), regulating services (that affect climate, floods, disease, wastes, and water quality), cultural services (that provide recreational, aesthetic, and spiritual benefits), and supporting services (such as soil formation, photosynthesis, and nutrient cycling). Coastal communities are those people who live in close proximity to the coastline, and who depend on its resources for their livelihoods; they include rural and urban dwellers, and range from subsistence producers to large industries. Livelihoods are understood as the capabilities, assets and activities required for a means of living among coastal communities. They are considered to be sustainable when they can cope with and recover from stresses and shocks and maintain and enhance their capabilities and assets, both now and in the future, while not undermining the natural resource base. Infrastructure is \u201cthe stock of facilities, 14 services and equipment that are needed for the economy and society to function properly\u201d. Traditionally, it has been seen only as man-made capital, such as roads, buildings, bridges, ports, water supplies and so on. This conceptualisation is however fundamentally incomplete, because it ignores natural ecosystems, and underestimates the vital role they play in underpinning and enabling economic and social activity. It also overlooks the human, social and financial capital that is required to sustain them (and which they, in turn, sustain). Mangroves for the Future sees ecosystems as assets which yield a flow of services that are required for the economy and society to function properly. In order to ensure their productivity and continued support to human development, they need to be maintained and improved to meet both today\u2019s needs as well as intensifying demands and pressures in the future \u2014 just like any other component of infrastructure. Running down this valuable stock of natural capital puts a serious strain on economy and society, as has become all too apparent in the aftermath of the tsunami", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c7f50bf1-9ec6-46f2-a5b6-a2d1784dc383": {"__data__": {"id_": "c7f50bf1-9ec6-46f2-a5b6-a2d1784dc383", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mangroves-future", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Mangroves for the Future", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mangroves-future", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "31a266350a3167c5853da6ee53695c63f4c1de018904f1e4735be1d1b5623188"}}, "hash": "31a266350a3167c5853da6ee53695c63f4c1de018904f1e4735be1d1b5623188", "text": "Mangroves for the Future, by including ecosystems as part of development infrastructure, will promote \u201cenvironmental mainstreaming\u201d. This will necessitate changes in behaviour among all actors in coastal management, from both \u201cconservation\u201d and \u201cdevelopment\u201d sectors. Neither a strictly preservationist approach, nor one which treats the environment as a stock of free resources which can be used indiscriminately and degraded at no cost, will achieve long term improvements in coastal ecosystems and livelihoods, or reduce vulnerability. This new paradigm will be promoted in light of what has already been undertaken in the region in the realm of coastal zone management. Mangroves for the Future learns from the past and builds on a long history of policies, partnerships and actions to address ecosystem and livelihoods issues in coastal areas of Indian Ocean countries, both before and after the 2004 tsunami disaster. These valuable lessons and experiences have consciously been incorporated into this new initiative, which attempts to add value to existing activities and to introduce new dimensions and ways of working into coastal zone management in the region. Most basically, Mangroves for the Future aims to improve the way in which all sectors carry out their business in coastal areas. 15 THE RESPONSE: Mangroves for the Future The initiative Mangroves for the Future is an initiative that brings together different countries, sectors, agencies and organisations to address the critical state of coastal ecosystems and livelihoods in Indian Ocean countries. It promotes investments and actions to conserve natural ecosystems as essential \u201cinfrastructure\u201d for coastal development. Mangroves for the Future targets countries that are recovering from the Indian Ocean tsunami. Its \u201cfocal countries\u201d are some of the worst-affected nations: India, Indonesia, Maldives, Seychelles, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. The initiative will also initiate a dialogue and sharing of information and experiences with other tsunami-affected countries in the region that face critical ecosystems and livelihood issues, including Bangladesh, Kenya, Malaysia, and Tanzania. Additional countries within the Indian Ocean region will also at a later stage be brought into these dialogues, such as Cambodia, China, Pakistan, the Philippines and Vietnam. Lessons learned will be shared, and an ocean-wide approach will be promoted, with these \u201cregional dialogue\u201d countries. The initiative is entitled \u201cMangroves for the Future\u201d because it addresses the need to conserve coastal ecosystems in order to secure the well-being of generations to come, as well as to meet current needs. Although mangroves have been selected as the flagship, the initiative will work in all types of natural coastal ecosystems. While the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami has provided both a stimulus and momentum for joint action, there is clearly a need to look to the future and to influence long-term coastal development and conservation processes. As many post-tsunami reconstruction activities wind down, Mangroves for the Future aims to reorient the current focus of coastal development and conservation business from disaster response to one which targets long-term trends and threats in coastal areas. The initiative therefore intends to maintain the momentum of the valuable and productive partnerships, investments and actions that emerged post-tsunami, and which already existed pre-tsunami, with a view to supporting long-term sustainable coastal development. By adopting a novel approach (investing in coastal ecosystems as development \u201cinfrastructure\u201d), and a more inclusive level of partnership (one that links different countries, sectors, agencies and stakeholder groups), the initiative intends to improve substantially the way in which coastal conservation and development business is carried out. Mangroves for the Future responds to the critical state of coastal ecosystems and livelihoods in Indian Ocean countries, and builds a collaborative platform to work towards reducing vulnerability, increasing resilience and sustaining future coastal development processes in the region. The initiative aims to improve on past development and conservation actions, and to build better actions for the future. Mangroves for the Future specifies additional actions, and seeks funding, to maximise the impact of past investments in ecosystem and livelihoods, and to continue and improve this work in the future. By establishing a regional platform of collaboration, the initiative will link the multiple players who are working on coastal conservation and development in Indian Ocean countries, encouraging and enabling them to network and share best practices and lessons learned, and to act together to ensure the long-term security and wellbeing of the region\u2019s populations. We intend that Mangroves for the Future will make a substantial contribution to long-term sustainable development processes across tsunami-affected countries. 16 Goal and objectives Mangroves for the Future is based on a vision of a more healthy, prosperous and secure future for all sections of coastal populations in Indian Ocean countries, where all ecosystems are conserved and managed sustainably.

Mangroves for the Future has two objectives: to strengthen the environmental sustainability of coastal development, and to promote the investment of funds and effort in coastal ecosystem management. Both objectives contribute towards the conservation and restoration of coastal ecosystem as an essential part of coastal development infrastructure. The first works at the level of the direct actions and interventions that are required to manage coastal ecosystems sustainably, equitably and effectively. It involves ensuring that coastal conservation and development business are implemented better. The second objective works to strengthen the broader frameworks that influence people\u2019s investments and actions, and which enable or hinder environmentally sustainable coastal development. Together, these objectives tackle both the direct and the underlying causes of ecosystem degradation, unsustainable livelihoods and persistent vulnerability in coastal areas. Towards this goal and objectives Mangroves for the Future intends to undertake actions organised around three cross-cutting themes (Knowledge, Empowerment and Governance), which will achieve results through effecting demonstrable changes across four key areas of influence (Regional, National, Private Sector and Community) (see Figure 1). Influencing Change Mangroves for the Future intends to effect demonstrable changes and results across four key areas: Regional cooperation, Strengthening regional dialogue, action and collaboration in the conservation and restoration of coastal ecosystems for long-term human well-being and security. National programme support, Influencing, supporting and strengthening national actions and support mechanisms that are required to achieve the conservation and restoration of coastal ecosystems for long- term human well-being and security. Private sector engagement Engaging with business, commerce and industry to maximize their positive influence on the conservation and restoration of coastal ecosystems for long-term human well-being and security. It will also seek to minimise the private sector\u2019s negative environmental footprint. Community action. Promoting coastal residents\u2019 support for, participation in, and benefit from, the conservation and restoration of coastal ecosystems for long-term human well-being and security. The role of women requires particular emphasis, especially in South Asia where progress on MDG 3 (Gender Equity) has been slow. 17 Together these represent the levels of scale, and involve the main stakeholder groups, where support and action is required to address the current and future threats to ecosystems and livelihoods, and to conserve and restore coastal ecosystems for long-term human well-being and security.

Building knowledge, strengthening empowerment, enhancing governance Mangroves for the Future is founded on a strategy of making knowledge available, empowering institutions and people to use that knowledge, and thereby enabling them to participate more effectively in decision-making and in promoting good governance in coastal areas. Building Knowledge The knowledge required to influence long-term coastal development and conservation processes comes from many different sources, and in a variety of forms: it consists of traditional practices and know-how as well as \u201cmodern\u201d science and management approaches. 1.

Develop sustainable financial mechanisms for coastal ecosystem and livelihood activities Enhancing Governance Governance is seen as more than just being the responsibility of national governments: it is understood to require active partnerships among all sections of civil society. Poor governance at any level, or among any group, will undermine results. 11. Establish effective, participatory national ICM programmes 12. Support land use planning which recognises both ecosystem and community needs, and is based on the effective enforcement of environmental regulations 13. Establish national systems of effectively managed coastal and marine protected areas that contribute to a regional network 14. Use ecological and socio-economic impact assessment and adaptive management 15. Promote environmentally sustainable business practices . A wide range of actions is required to move towards the common goal and objectives that are outlined in this strategy, and to generate the intended results. The consultation and dialogue that informed the development of Mangroves for the Future has identified a number of Programmes of Work which will conserve and restore coastal ecosystems as key assets which support human well-being and security in the Indian Ocean Region, through strengthening the environmental sustainability of coastal development and increasing the investment of funds and effort in coastal ecosystem management. Programmes of Work will be implemented through a series of individual projects that are linked by a common goal and strategy, but are spread out geographically, temporally, and in terms of management and implementation responsibility. They include the continuation of activities which are already underway (including those initiated post-tsunami) as well as new activities to fill identified gaps. These actions cross-cut countries, sectors and implementing agencies, and are organised around the key themes which are vital to effecting concrete changes in the environmental sustainability of coastal development, and the investment of funds and effort in coastal ecosystem management: building knowledge and capacity, strengthening empowerment, and enhancing governance. They aim to support and strengthen knowledge, empowerment and governance at all four areas of influence: regional cooperation, national programme support, private sector engagement and community action. 19 THE FRAMEWORK FOR IMPLEMENTATION: partnership and financing Implementation through partnership Mangroves for the Future is designed to provide a platform for collaboration among stakeholders at regional, national and local community levels to facilitate the integration, coordination and sustainability of interventions to support long-term coastal ecosystem management and livelihood improvements. One of the most commonly expressed needs during the country consultations was the need for regional coordination and knowledge sharing with respect to conservation and development interventions in coastal areas, especially in the post-tsunami context. Mangroves for the Future attempts to establish lasting partnerships that will contribute to the effective integration of environment and development agendas regionally and, above all, nationally to ensure environment issues are taken into account in the mainstream of development planning and programmes. Rather than responding to symptoms or mitigating impacts, the initiative aspires to engage stakeholders in government, non-government and private sectors as well as local communities in addressing the key drivers behind environmental degradation along the coastlines of the Indian Ocean region. The work of Mangroves for the Future will be implemented through a series of individual projects that are linked by a common goal and strategy, but undertaken by a wide range of agencies and groups, working alone or in partnership with others. Mechanisms will be set in place at both national and regional levels to ensure coordination of the efforts of these different partners within the framework of Mangroves for the Future. There will be promotion of dialogue, collaboration, sharing of information and lessons learned at all levels. Coordinating national and regional efforts A Regional Steering Committee will oversee the implementation of Mangroves for the Future. Governments of the six focal countries of Mangroves for the Future (India, Indonesia, Maldives, Seychelles, Sri Lanka and Thailand) will be represented on the Committee, which will be co- chaired by IUCN and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fdf59d48-eaf4-4f44-ba27-3880d8b7e64a": {"__data__": {"id_": "fdf59d48-eaf4-4f44-ba27-3880d8b7e64a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mangroves-future", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Mangroves for the Future", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mangroves-future", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "35b19a76819de79cbaddcfb923f06b19eb9a9578ad47bb86be7033373d99c6dc"}}, "hash": "35b19a76819de79cbaddcfb923f06b19eb9a9578ad47bb86be7033373d99c6dc", "text": "UNDP. It will also bring in other UN Agencies and non-governmental organisations with a regional mandate that have experience in dealing with coastal ecosystem and livelihood issues. UNEP, CARE International and Wetlands International have committed to be a part of this governance structure, and invitations have also been extended to FAO and WWF. The primary role of the Regional Steering Committee will be to: \u2022 Provide strategic oversight and guidance to the implementation of Mangroves for the Future. \u2022 Mobilise resources for Mangroves for the Future and facilitate allocation of resources to areas of greatest need. \u2022 Promote regionally harmonised monitoring and management of coastal ecosystems. \u2022 Promote regional dialogues, dissemination, exchanges and sharing of lessons learned about coastal ecosystems and livelihoods. \u2022 Support national capacity building. Initially, IUCN and UNDP Regional Offices in Bangkok will act as a secretariat to the Regional Steering Committee. Activities will include the facilitation of an initial, detailed in-country needs assessment and development of work programmes, the provision and synthesis of information for the Regional Steering Committee, and the development monitoring and learning processes for Mangroves for the Future interventions. The Secretariat will also function as the communications node for the Initiative. 20 At the national level, Mangroves for the Future will be coordinated and steered through strengthening the existing mechanisms for coastal management which bring together different agencies, sectors and civil society groups. Financing mechanisms The unprecedented mobilisation of efforts and funds in support of post-tsunami recovery and restoration was the largest and most immediate response to a natural disaster ever recorded. Much of this funding was not earmarked for a specific sector or agency. The massive injection of funding however quickly exceeded the absorptive capacity of recipients in tsunami-affected countries, and in many case there was no proper plan to utilise the donations received. This resulted in inefficiencies, inadequate monitoring, poor end-user traceability and an inability of both governments and international agencies to ensure funding was needs-based33. Today, a high proportion of the commitments made in the aftermath of the tsunami remain unspent. Overall, of the US$14.5 billion pledged by the international community, only US$8.25 billion (57%) has been committed and just US$4.25 billion (29%) disbursed as of mid 200634. Of the projects registered for Indonesia, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand, less than 18% of the total funds committed had been spent by August 2006, 18 months after the tsunami35. Perhaps more importantly, only a fraction of 1% of funding was allocated to addressing environmental concerns in these four tsunami-affected countries. As a collaborative platform, the Mangroves for the Future Regional Steering Committee will seek to develop sustainable financing mechanisms to support long term coastal ecosystem management in the Indian Ocean Region. As part of its programme of work, Mangroves for the Future will also guide the allocation of financial resources to the areas of greatest need. To achieve this, the Steering Committee may explore options including development of trust fund(s) and acting as a \u201cmatchmaker\u201d to assist the donor community in making environmentally sustainable investments in coastal development that actively involving a wide range of stakeholders in implementation. In addition, Mangroves for the Future will include parallel financed programmes and projects that will operate as stand-alone activities, but that will support the overall objectives and long-term strategy of Mangroves for the Future. Phased approach Mangroves for the Future adopts a phased approach, first of all undertaking the immediate actions that are needed to prepare for and set in place a regional initiative of this magnitude and level of collaboration, and then moving into a full implementation phase to commence the long- term programmes of work that will be implemented by partners in the initiative. Roll-out preparatory phase An initial one year roll-out or preparatory phase will start in January 2007. This will include a detailed in-country needs assessment in the six focal countries of Mangroves for the Future, to further elaborate priority areas and activities, develop regional and country implementation structures, refine Programmes of Work, and consolidate lessons learned from both post-tsunami efforts and previous activities in coastal zone management. This preparatory phase will also conduct a feasibility study for the establishment of a regional trust fund as a sustainable financing and grant disbursement mechanism and match funding pledges to the different agencies and actions involved in Mangroves for the Future. During this period, collaboration partnerships will be signed with parallel funded projects and programmes. The indicative budget for this preparatory phase of the core component is USUS$2 million. 21 Full implementation phase The first programming cycle of Mangroves for the Future will run between 2008 and 2012.

This regional programme is a coordinated approach to support primary prevention of gender-based violence in Asia and the Pacific with the deeper involvement of boys and men. The long term goal of this programme is to reduce the prevalence of gender-based violence in the Asia-Pacific region through behaviour and attitudinal change among boys and men, increased institutional capacity to involve boys and men in gender based violence prevention and through and facilitating policy enhancements. Gender-based violence is rooted in a complex set of issues that require multiple responses at different levels \u2013 with individuals, communities, institutions and in the larger policy environment. Coordination of regional programmatic and policy recommendations of the four UN organisations and their partners will ensure new UN activities are strategically situated within the existing spectrum of work on prevention and that duplication of UN activities is avoided. One goal of this interagency collaboration is to produce a holistic, evidence-based set of policy recommendations for more effective GBV prevention. Endorsement of these policy recommendations by leading UN agencies will deepen our collaboration with partners in government across the region to implement policy enhancements for effective violence prevention. Purpose of this discussion paper \uf0b7 To propose a comprehensive framework for developing policies that respond to gender-based violence \uf0b7 To identify the importance of engaging and targeting men and boys as partners in developing and implementing policies on the prevention of gender-based violence \uf0b7 To recommend a set of policy interventions on engaging men for policy change on gender-based violence 1 Introduction 1.1 Meanings of gender-based violence The many forms of violence perpetrated by men continue to define the world in which we live.

The United Nations has developed several definitions for gender-based violence over the past two decades (see the box).

This paper will use the term \u201cgender-based violence\u201d in this more inclusive sense of referring to violence that is in some direct way concerned with expressing and maintaining the unequal power relations of oppressive gender orders. This includes not only violence against women, but also violence against men, boys and transgender individuals who challenge gender and heterosexual norms through their feminine appearance and/or sexual desire for other men. It also includes sexual violence against children, whose bodies, like women\u201fs, are subject to the control of men, whether in the home or within institutions. Male violence is not only focused on maintaining men\u201fs power over women, but also hierarchies of power among men, following a gender logic of domination and subordination.

As such violence is based on socially ascribed differences, gender-based violence includes, but it is not limited to sexual violence.

Men\u201fs vulnerability to forced sex is associated with specific groups of men and boys (those who occupy subordinate positions in relation to other men), specific contexts (conflict situations) and specific settings (all-male institutions such as prisons and the military). WHO, in its landmark report on violence and health, reported that \u201cmost experts believe that official statistics vastly under-represent the number of male rape victims\u201d and \u201cthat males may be even less likely than female victims to report an assault to the authorities.\u201d1 Nowhere is this clearer than in the violence experienced by men whose sexual practices (men who have sex with men) and/or whose gender identities (such as transgender men) are a threat to the dominant norms of heterosexuality.

These practices are based on a view of social life as being naturally and necessarily hierarchical in which the \u201eweak\u201f (women, children) must submit to, and exist for the benefit of, the \u201estrong\u201f (men, adults). Although taboos against the sexual abuse of children (depending on the definition of the latter) exist in most societies, the ideology of male supremacy finds expression in the ways that adults act out their entitlement to pleasure, and expectations of being in control, by sexually abusing children. If gender-based violence is any form of violence that is used to establish, enforce and/or perpetuate unequal gender power relations, it is also clear that such power relations are also shaped by other axes of oppression, whether based on class, caste, age, sexuality and/or race/ethnicity. As noted anti-violence activist, Oswaldo Montoya, has emphasised with regard to Nicaragua but whose observations have more general application.2 Violence in couple relationships is a problem of power and control. It is maintained by the social structures of oppression in which we live\u2014based \u2026 on gender, class, age, and race inequalities. A national history of wars and a culture of settling conflict through force also maintain it. Both men and women learned and practice this logic of human relations based on power and control over others; however, for men the exercise of this power-over-others model becomes almost an obligatory criterion to our male gender identity. 1 WHO, World Report on Violence and Health, Geneva: World Health Organisation, 2002 2 Montoya, O.T.

It is useful to think of public policy, not as a singular practice or process, but rather as a \u201cset of laws, regulatory measures, course of action, and funding priorities concerning a given topic promulgated by a governmental entity\u201d.3 This definition speaks to the diverse forms that policy can take, namely:4 \uf0b7 Legislation enacted by Parliament \uf0b7 Regulations, promulgated by Ministers, who are empowered by law to do so \uf0b7 Municipal bye-laws \uf0b7 Binding and actionable unless unconstitutional or ultra vires \uf0b7 Statements of policy for discussion or consultation that usually precede the passage of legislation \uf0b7 Strategic plans - long term planning frameworks for setting out policy objectives consistent with overall mission including implementation \uf0b7 Guidelines and handbooks - issued for the purpose of clarifying legal provisions indicating how an entity should interpret and implement those provisions \uf0b7 Programs - specific forms of implementation of a policy \uf0b7 Budgets - that set out the finances relating to policy implementation As can be seen from the above, there are a whole range of plans, laws and guides that can be considered policy. Policies articulate the State\u201fs position on various topics and create the normative framework based on which the State functions. Progressive policies serve to create an enabling environment to achieve the goals of development projects and programmes. For example, progressive anti-trafficking policies will recognise that along with stringent penalties for traffickers, interventions that economically empower communities and reduce their vulnerability to trafficking need to be considered. Such policies facilitate the work of government and civil society projects and programmes working on trafficking by allowing them to take a more comprehensive approach and providing them with the legitimacy and support to back up their approaches. 3 Kilpatrick [date?], cited by Redpath in \u201cPolicy approaches to working with men to improve men\u201fs health and achieve gender equality: A report by the National Department of Health of South Africa, 2007\u201d 4 Redpath in \u201cPolicy approaches to working with men to improve men\u201fs health and achieve gender equality: A report by the National Department of Health of South Africa, 2007\u201d Policies to combat trafficking \u2013 Nepal The range of policy action that can be used to address violence is evident in the case of efforts by Nepal to combat trafficking.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f4b0213d-52e5-48ba-ac1b-c47d69d9778b": {"__data__": {"id_": "f4b0213d-52e5-48ba-ac1b-c47d69d9778b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/men-and-prevention-gender-based-violence", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Men and the Prevention of Gender based Violence", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/men-and-prevention-gender-based-violence", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4f0d37db1ad40a54de10706bc2cc9e3733ac1d5d415205ae4842f619782fbbae"}, "2": {"node_id": "db49c13e-b5b3-490b-b98f-6b0e62874786", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/men-and-prevention-gender-based-violence", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4105345c1ef41d6553c5970938dd0a2cd28fc6b003c68de0bd105798fecc2a2e"}}, "hash": "4120fe5cd54f61a86252e5c59caeaec86f598c39b8c52848fb61b7661f8bbe77", "text": "Such policy action includes: \u2022 Country Code (Mulki Ain) 2020 \u2022 Trafficking in Persons (Punishment and Control) Act 1986 \u2022 Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2007 \u2022 Child Labour (Prohibition) Act 1999 \u2022 Children Act 1991 \u2022 Interim Constitution 2007 - Right to freedom; Right to equality; Right to work and social security; Women\u2018s rights; Children\u2018s right against all kind of exploitation; Right against Slavery; Right against forced labour; and Right to privacy. \u2022 9th Development", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9adbad70-6a36-45a8-a6d7-fe222d74a53a": {"__data__": {"id_": "9adbad70-6a36-45a8-a6d7-fe222d74a53a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/men-and-prevention-gender-based-violence", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Men and the Prevention of Gender based Violence", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/men-and-prevention-gender-based-violence", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6d10a2cc359e5ec4e9514b248635b1ca094379820b81d13c519ffb150f8b3407"}}, "hash": "6d10a2cc359e5ec4e9514b248635b1ca094379820b81d13c519ffb150f8b3407", "text": "plan (1997) - Gender equality and empowerment of women \u2022 10th Development plan (2002-2007) \u2022 National Committee on trafficking of Women under chairmanship of Minister for Women and Children. \u2022 National Strategic Plan (from presentation on \u2015Response to Trafficking Issue in Nepal,\u2016 Prem Chandra Rai, Pacific Law Associate, Nepal) 7 1.3 Conceptual framework for policy change on gender-based violence This paper proposes a framework that can be usefully applied across the different forms of policy that will be required to prevent gender-based violence. The framework recognises that there are several layers of intervention with men when trying to develop policies that support the prevention of gender-based violence. The overall goal of changing values and norms to bring about larger social change is a long term process which focuses on targeting men of all ages to rethink ideas of masculinity and stereotypical gender norms. At another level, interventions that seek to empower groups so that they are able to demand their rights are crucial in an effort to resist gender stereotypes, hold policy makers accountable for implementing laws and to ensure economic independence to reduce vulnerabilities. Finally, as a first step in creating policy change, the national legal framework will need to be aligned with international human rights standards protecting women and men from gender-based violence. Thus, the framework emphasises three domains of policy action on: \uf023 Sanctions and Protections - seeking to change the legal framework to ensure that measures are put in place specifically to address gender-based violence, i.e. protections put in place to prevent gender-based violence and sanctions/punitive measures against perpetrators of gender-based violence. \uf023 Rights and Empowerment \u2013 recognising that to reduce gender-based violence, it is necessary to understand and deal with its structural causes through addressing social and economic as well as legal and political rights. \uf023 Norms and Values \u2013 seeking to build on the first two domains and promote a deeper gender transformation by addressing the the oppressive norms and values that underlie gender-based violence. To bring about changes in each of these domains, a two-fold approach can be adopted, which often go hand-in-hand to ensure that comprehensive policy change is achieved: \uf023 Internal Advocacy - It is critical to work within policy/legislative processes to end impunity and change the conditions that allow violence to continue. This approach focuses on internal buy-in by policy makers to an agenda of gender-based violence prevention and gender transformation. It is important to target appropriate constituencies within the state machinery so that momentum and opportunities for policy change are created from within. Promoting gender sensitivity of male-dominated institutions and developing political will to create, enact and implement laws and policies is one way of bringing about policy change. Engaging men in policy change Policy action in different domains may require engaging different constituencies of men - the category of \u2015men\u2016 with regard to policy action on preventing gender-based violence should not be regarded as singular or homogenous. Part of the challenge with engaging men in policy action for preventing gender-based violence is engaging with male-dominated policy machineries and processes that are themselves implicated in the production of such violence, which implies a need for a critical engagement with such machineries and processes. In general, there are two distinct ways in which the above policy interventions target men and boys: \u2022 Men and boys are targeted by the policy interventions so that there is a change in their attitudes and perceptions. For example, education policies are made more gender sensitive so that men and boys are able to challenge traditional gender norms and are exposed to alternative versions of masculinity. \u2022 Male policy makers are targeted to ensure policy changes to transform gender norms and prevent gender-based violence are put in place. For example, male policy makers are encouraged to create and pass legislation that protect against gender-based violence. \uf023 External Pressure - There are limits to which internal advocacy can bring about policy change, especially in cases where the State is complicit in condoning or actively encouraging violence and oppressive gender orders. In such cases, the State and policy makers of the State need to be held accountable by external parties such as civil society groups which can pressure policy makers and state institutions to change. External pressure to bring about policy change is imperative. Struggles for social justice in relation to violence have always been political struggles. Individuals and broad based coalitions within civil society have worked to demand the establishment and enforcement of a national normative framework that protects citizens from gender-based violence.

Even in cases where the overall legislative framework for the country may be progressive, it is necessary to have independent monitoring mechanisms so that laws are enforced in an equitable manner. For example, while progressive legislation may be passed by the State, certain areas/groups may face a suspension in their ability to exercise their rights due to reasons such as \u201estate/national security\u201f or \u201eanti-terrorism\u201f, excluding them from the protection of the State guaranteed to other citizens. The current discourse on \u201ethe war on terror\u201f, \u201estate security\u201f and \u201enational unity\u201f serves as propaganda for the State to justify escalation of violence in many of the internal conflicts in South Asia. In such cases external pressure is necessary to ensure that the State recognises the gendered nature of conflict where certain groups of men and women may suffer violence perpetrated by representatives of the State. External pressure, for example, through the media and other monitoring groups can play a role in keeping the propaganda in check as well as reporting on and documenting cases of gender-based violence. The constant monitoring of State activities exerts pressure on the government to adopt policies that encourage the armed forces to be more gender sensitive and prevent the occurrence of gender- based violence. Norms and Values (Transforming gender norms) Sanctions and Protections (Laws specific to GBV) Comprehensive policy change can be brought about through interventions that cut across all the different levels. These interventions produce results across varying timelines: short term changes through changes in laws, medium term changes by empowering people to assert their rights and demand their claims, and long term changes that seek to transform societal norms by changing attitudes and behaviour patterns.

The 1980s and 1990s saw a wave of legal reforms relating to physical and sexual abuse by an intimate partner. In the past 10 years, for example, 24 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have passed specific legislation on domestic violence. The most common reforms involve criminalising physical, sexual and psychological abuse by intimate partners, either through new laws on domestic violence or by amending existing penal codes.5 An international legal framework provides a basis from which countries can draw on to establish their own national legal frameworks to address gender-based violence. Since the adoption and in-country ratification of CEDAW (which has been ratified by all South Asian countries) and subsequent consent to the commitments made at the 1983 United Nations General Assembly Declaration Against Violence Against Women (Vienna Declaration), the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (Cairo), and the Platform for Action adopted by the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women, all the countries of the region have not only acknowledged issue of violence against women but also have made some legal and policy changes to deal with the. A list of some of these laws in different countries of the South Asia region includes: \uf0b7 Domestic violence legislation (India, Sri Lanka, draft legislation in Nepal and Pakistan) \uf0b7 Re-defining rape and sexual harassment (Nepal, Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan) \uf0b7 Laws against trafficking (Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal) \uf0b7 Specific acts \u2013 acid throwing (Bangladesh), dowry-related harassment (India) \uf0b7 Reproductive violence \u2013 sex-selective abortions (India) Annex I lists legislative and policy action on violence against women by country in the South Asia region.6 The contrast with the lack of progress that has been made in legislative and policy responses to gender-based violence against men is stark. Not only do men lack the protection of the law with respect to sexual violence against them; some groups of men are a target of criminal sanctions for their sexual behaviour. Most countries maintain laws that prohibit or regulate sexual activity between consenting adults of the same sex. These are often called sodomy laws, which are still in existence in at least 70 states worldwide. The act of sodomy is described and criminalised in Section 377 of the Bangladesh and Indian penal codes, which:7 [G]ives the police the wide discretion to target MSM with blackmail, extortion and physical abuse.

The yet deeper problem, however, concerns enforcement and the male-dominated institutions charged with translating progressive laws and policies into action. Progress made at the policy level is all too often inadequately matched in enforcement of protections for women against male violence. In some cases, law enforcement agencies continue to be perpetrators of violence against women and marginalised men. 2.2.1 Denial and minimisation Denial and minimisation remain among the most common impediments to the effective implementation of sanctions and protections. The realities of gender-based violence continue to be denied; that it is a phenomenon that traverses the continuum of private to public space, manifests across the life-course of those it targets, is perpetrated institutionally as well as individually and, to a greater or lesser extent, is normal and not exceptional. Not only is such violence a fact of daily life for its targets; it is normalised to the extent that there is a degree of acceptability of, complicity with and, in the case of violence against men who have sex with men, encouragement of such violence.9 Even if there is tacit acknowledgement of the problem at the governmental level, there are enough vocal opponents to stall effective policy making. This is exemplified in the case of legislative efforts in Pakistan to address sexual violence. The Hudood Ordinances (enforcing religious laws against sexual violence) received widespread criticism when they were introduced in 1979, but pressure from religious groups delayed their repeal until 2006. However, despite repealing the Hudood Ordinances and the adoption of more progressive legislation by passing the Protection of Women (Criminal Laws Amendment) Act in December 1, 2006, Pakistan has once again stalled in the process of adopting legislation on intimate violence. Resistance from religious groups have made it difficult to push the bill forward, hence undermining all the work of women\u201fs and men\u201fs groups to bring about more explicit laws on such violence. Many countries deny the reality of men\u201fs experience of sexual violence by excluding it from sexual violence legislation. Denial is also an important barrier for providing protection against child sexual abuse. Most countries of the region do not have specific laws to protect children from sexual abuse. Sri Lanka10 is an exception and one state in India, Goa, has also created a special child protection legislation.11 A bill known as Offences Against Children (Prevention) Bill is however being discussed in India which will deal with the issue of Child Sex Abuse.

A critique of the domestic violence laws of Malaysia and Singapore notes the failure to recognise domestic violence as a crime and to extend protection beyond marital couples.12 Marital rape is often not included within the ambit of rape (e.g. India, Pakistan but not Nepal). Sexual harassment and physical, sexual and psychological abuse of women detainees in police custody has been widely reported across the region, yet rarely does legislation on violence against women offer any protection against such institutionalised violence (e.g. the Maldives13). 2.2.3 Lack of implementation of existing laws Male-dominated criminal justice systems fail to respond adequately to violence against women. In Sri Lanka, the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act was passed in 2005 but its implementation has been impeded by a lack of judicial and police training, trained support staff and shelters. It has been noted that \u201cthe reality is that the majority of Magistrates are unaware of the new law on domestic violence.\u201d14 In Bangladesh, It is has also been noted that the Acid Control Act and the Acid Crime Control Act of 2002 has resulted in too few prosecutions. While the number of acid crimes has decreased slightly, acid is still readily purchased from those who use it for industrial purposes. Additionally, bribery of police officers and victims families is also noted as possible reasons for the low levels of prosecution. The stringent penalties for acid attacks including large fines, life imprisonment and death penalty may also have had the unintentional effect of lowering the rate of conviction due to the unwillingness of judges to mete out such sentences.15 2.2.4 Resistance from men Opposition to legislation on violence against women by male \u201especial interest\u201f groups is a new and emerging phenomenon across the Asia-Pacifc region. In India, the visibility of these groups started with the protest against the newly introduced Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code (introduced in 1983 in response to dowry murders) which deals with cruelty within marriage. Initially there were isolated protests, and men\u201fs groups organised to provide legal support to the \u201ewronged\u201f men, however in 2000 the Delhi police prepared a report stating widespread misuse of the law to harass men (husbands). Later a commission set up to review the criminal justice system (Malimath Committee 2003) also made similar observations. This pattern of protests snowballing into policy level rethinking is also becoming evident in relation with the domestic violence law in India. The law was passed in late 2005, and rules made a year later. However within a year there were many groups (many existing only in cyberspace16) raising their voice of 12 Amrithalingam K ( 2003) A Feminist Critique of Domestic Violence Laws in Singapore and Malaysia , Asia Research Institute, Working Paper Series No 6 13 Wijekoon, Tharamuni (2006), Sexual violence against women in detention in the Maldives, Raaje Foundation. 14 Commentary by Shyamala Gomez of COHRE \u2013 Center on Housing and Eviction Rights \u2013 AG doc 15 Acid Survivors Foundation - http://www.acidsurvivors.org/statistics.html 16 see www.saveindianfamily.org, www.indianhusbands.blogspot.com, www.498a.org protest. According to information received in early March 2008,17 Ministry of Women and Child Development is already planning to organise meetings to review the provisions of the law. Resistance from men to progressive changes in laws in often portrayed as defending culture, traditions and religion. Often there is a strong reaction to challenges to the status quo which threatens existing power balances. Establishing sanctions and protections on gender-based violence often disrupts existing patriarchal systems and unequal gender relations and produces a vocal resistance to establishing such laws. For example, the Maldives currently has a draft Penal Code proposed in Parliament which includes sections which directly address cases of rape, sexual assault, sexual exploitation and child sexual abuse. However, there is little political will to revise the pre-existing Penal Code due to fear of controversy and the resistance from conservative groups. 17 personal communication received by author (A.Das) from sources close to the ministry 13 2.2.5 Institutionalised violence Institutionalised violence, often perpetrated by those responsible for implementing sanctions against violence, remains one of the greatest challenges facing an effective policy response to gender-based violence.

Commercial sex workers who have been detained, whether they are men or women, are at a higher risk of being sexually harassed by the police. As has been noted:18 The western definition of domestic violence does not fit into the reality of women's lives in the context of India. [...] For many groups of women such as poor or tribal or lower caste women, violence is also perpetrated by the upper caste/class men, the state, police and landlord. This is often manifested as physical violence, sexual harassment, rape and mass rape on Adivasi women (tribal group), Dalit women (the word chosen by the anti-caste untouchable movement to describe themselves, a reclaiming of name) and working-class women in their homes, in their villages and in their communities. Research into the human rights violations experienced by men who have sex with men in six cities in South Asia found that 70% of the respondents reported facing harassment by the police. Such harassment ranged from extortion on threat of imprisonment, prolonged blackmail, beatings and restriction of movement in public places.19 WHO reports that tens of thousands of women each year are subjected to sexual violence in health care settings, including sexual harassment by providers, genital mutilation, forced gynaecological examinations and obligatory inspections of virginity. While instances of forced sterilisation have reduced over the years, especially in India, the phenomenon has not yet completely disappeared. Coercive population control laws continue to exist in many states in India and the validity of these have been reinforced by the Supreme Court.20 A new but similar phenomenon that is emerging is the compulsion for institutional delivery that has been introduced in India. Women belonging to lower social classes (previously referred to as \u201cuntouchables\u201d) are being denied appropriate care in government clinics and hospitals leading to death, near-misses as well as debilitation.21 Violence against women in the workplace remains a significant and under-recognised problem. One study of girls working in carpet factories in Nepal found that they were at high risk of abuse, including sexual and verbal 18 Rani Jha 1998 \u2013 AG has reference 19 NFI: From the Front Line report 20 Pandey S et al ( 2006) Coercion vs Empowerment, SLIC, New Delhi (?) 21 A number of local newspaper articles have appeared on this issue and this was also discussed in a civil society engagment with the UN Special Rapporteur on Right to Health in Delhi on December 1, 2007. For a report of the meeting see : http://www.chsj.org/modules/download_gallery/dlc.php?file=105 State-sponsored violence The links between state-sponsored fundamentalism, state-centred militarism and gender-based violence are increasingly being acknowledged. For example, the violence against Muslim communities in Gujarat in 2002 included organised rapes and sexual assaults, of extreme brutality, by groups of Hindu men on Muslim women. It has been noted that: Gujarat in 2002 brought to the fore state collusion\u2014with its police, bureaucracy, judiciary, legislative, and executive branches party to, involved in, and complicit with the perpetration of violence. The state\u2019s direct responsibility for such carnage, and for its perpetuation of a genocidal culture, is a starting point, perhaps, for a fuller accounting of the south Asian state\u2019s regularized and cumulative violence against women.

In Nepal, for example, even though a separate article protecting women\u201fs fundamental rights has been introduced in the interim constitution, a number of bills for the protection of women have been framed but have not been legislated into policy because of political unrest.23 The Domestic Violence (Crime and Punishment) Bill was registered in parliament in Nepal on February 2002, but due to the dissolution of parliament in May 2002, the bill remains in draft form until parliament is re-instated.

Violent ideologies and practices of masculinity are enmeshed with militarism and militarisation, with the result that men\u201fs violence against women often becomes a tool to control, intimidate and harass civilian populations during conflict. Violence against women has become an integral and complex part of these conflicts. Not only are women caught up in the fighting as \u201ecivilian\u201f victims; their bodies have become \u201ebattlegrounds\u201f for nationalist, ethnic and communalist struggles, notably in the use of sexual violence to humiliate and subjugate the enemy, as in the \u201clicense to rape\u201d given to military and paramilitary forces.24 22 Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre - June 2006 study by Terre des Hommes 23 The Mainstreaming Gender Equity Program (MGEP) of UNDP had facilitated the formulation of new laws like Women such as Domestic violence prevention and control Bill, Gender Equality Bill, Sexual Harassment Bill, Amendment Bill to Public Offences Crime and Punishment Act to criminalize Witch Hunting Practices, 11th Amendment of Civil Code see - http://www.undp.org.np/closed/gender/projects/mgep/index.php# accessed 28.11.2007 24 Bego na Aretxaga. 2003. \u201cMaddening States\u201d. Annual Review of Anthropology. vol. 32 pp. 393-410 15 2.3 Meeting the Challenge: Men\u2019s Roles 2.3.1 Legislation Men have critical roles to play in developing and amending legislation so that it provides adequate sanctions and protection on gender-based violence. Coalitions between men\u201fs groups, survivors of gender-based violence, and women\u201fs rights organisations, together with practitioners who apply and enforce the law, are needed so that pressure is exerted to adopt the necessary laws. Policy-makers within the legislative machineries (mostly male) also need to ally with coalitions on preventing gender-based violence in order to bring about a change in the legislative framework. For example, while many non-governmental groups lobbied for passing the Domestic Violence Act in Sri Lanka, the bill had initially met resistance in Parliament \u201con the ground that it would bring private issues of the family into the public domain. The bill was also criticised as an attempt to destroy the family and to introduce alien \u201eWestern\u201f values [...].\u201d25 It was only with the support of the Ministry of Women\u201fs Affairs and the Ministry of Justice in an evidence-based lobbying campaign that the law was eventually passed in 2005. While progress has been made with respect to legislating for some forms of violence against women, the criminalisation of sex between men remains largely unaddressed, and certainly is rarely framed as an issue of gender-based violence. Given the links between violence against women and violence against some groups of MSM, it is important that men\u201fs organisations take on the issue of challenging homophobic legislation. 2.3.2 Implementation Problems with implementation are perhaps the greatest obstacle to effective sanctions and protections. The institutions responsible for such implementation, especially the police and the judiciary, are male-dominated, and there is a growing recognition of the need for gender work with these institutions to improve their implementation of gender-based violence policy. As Bhutan\u201fs CEDAW report notes, \u201cAmong key issues are the positive duty of police to protect women from domestic violence; to prevent re-victimisation; 25 Goonesekere, Savitri, Gender Equality: Current Issues of Concern for Sri Lanka and South Asia, Gender Network News, September 2006, Asian Development Bank. Domestic Violence Bill Campaign Recognising the need for domestic violence legislation, the Lawyers Collective, made up of human rights activists, professional lawyers and law students, began the campaign for a law on domestic violence in the mid-90s. In particular they were concerned that there was no law in place to protect women in need of immediate, emergency relief due to domestic violence. They sought legislation that could provide a means through which women could seek a remedy in cases where they faced violence in the hands of their partners, husbands or their husbands family. The first draft of such a law was created in 1998 by the the Women\u2018s Rights Initiative of the Lawyers Collective.

Even with the Protection of Women (Criminal Laws Amendment) Act (2006), protection for women who have been raped in Pakistan has not been forthcoming because of the lack of awareness about the law on the part of police officers. But beyond this, it is clear that there is a need to develop the understanding of and commitment to gender issues within such institutions, and especially their male staff. Implementation of laws on gender-based violence is enhanced by mandatory and systematic gender-sensitivity training of law enforcement officials, prosecutors and judges and by protocols and guidelines on the appropriate application of the law, and there are a growing number of examples of this work (see the box). Vigorous arrest and prosecution policies make a statement to society as a whole that violence against women is a serious crime that is not condoned by the authorities. However, the majority of reported cases of violence against women are not prosecuted and of those that are, many do not result in a conviction. For example, in Bangladesh, conviction rates for trafficking are extraordinarily low (in 2000, only 3 convictions) despite its widespread nature.27 Even when perpetrators are convicted, they often receive sentences that are not commensurate with the gravity of the crime. Appropriate sentencing can be achieved through the introduction of minimum sentences for certain offences and monitoring of sentencing practices. Several countries, such as Sri Lanka, have instituted minimum prison sentences for rape and aggravated rape:28 After sustained pressure from NGOs, the Sri Lankan government has amended the country's penal laws, increasing the punishment for child abuse. Rape now carries a minimum jail term of nine years and a fine. Rape with injury and violence carries a stiffer punishment. Another aspect of effective implementation is education on the provisions of legislation and policy for those who seek its protections. Awareness 27 United States Department of State. 2001.

Gender sensitivity training for men The Centre for Women\u2018s and Children\u2018s Studies in Bangladesh developed a training manual for police officers that reflects the needs of survivors and defines the role of law enforcement in combating domestic, sexual and dowry-related violence, trafficking and acid throwing. The Indian women\u2018s NGO Sakshi has trained members of the judiciary on gender issues using interactive dialogue, small group problem-solving, visits to shelters and meetings with NGOs to give judges a better understanding of women\u2018s experiences. Training of police or of judiciary on new law or on dealing with VAW has now become common practice at least in India. Courts in Nepal and India are now paying increasing attention to decisions that respect women\u2018s rights, in part through the efforts of the Asia Pacific Advisory Forum on Equality Education for Judges, a UNIFEM-backed initiative. Training for judges uses CEDAW as a guide to increase their understanding of women\u2018s human rights. In Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka, legislative reviews have helped strengthen efforts to staunch trafficking in women, in part by defining gaps in the implementation of laws. Nepal has already tabled a stronger bill in Parliament, and its Supreme Court has knocked down a provision fostering discrimination against sex workers. Rozan, an NGO in Pakistan working with men and women on gender-based violence, has specific programmes working with male police officers to increase their sensitisation of gender-based violence including rape, honour killings, and domestic violence. By partnering with the National Police Academy, Rozan is able to work with the police to ensure that they are aware of gender-based violence issues, laws and able to provide the necessary support, referral and conduct complete investigations on behalf of those suffering from violence. about rights as protected by the constitution and national laws is a crucial aspect of empowerment.

An inspiring example is offered by the Indian group Men\u201fs Action for Stopping for Violence Against Women (MASVAW), who in collaboration with women\u201fs rights organisations, co-ordinated the 2007 Ab To Jaago! (Wake Up Now!) Campaign in 41 districts across Uttar Pradesh, providing rights-based education to urban and rural communities about the provisions of the 2005 Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, and holding tribunals to gather information about problems with implementation so as to pressure the Government to address such problems.29 More generally, men\u201fs influential positions within society and specific communities can make them powerful advocates for policy change and legislative implementation. Their roles as politicians, civil servants, judiciary, police, institutional managers (workplace, schools, health care, prisons, militaries), community leaders and religious leaders make them crucial allies in ensuring progressive policies on gender-based violence. For example, the White Ribbon Campaign in Bangladesh gathered thousands of men on International Women\u201fs Day in 2006 to show solidarity in condemning women\u201fs repression particularly related to acid violence. Men\u201fs rallies were organised in five districts where they publicly displayed posters, banners and badges calling an end to violence against women.30 2.3.3 Monitoring and review Monitoring and evaluating laws is necessary to ensure continuing effective application through such mechanisms as ombudspersons, national rapporteurs, observatories and gender equality machinery. Periodic review and reform of laws is also necessary so that legislation is kept updated taking account of the evolving knowledge-base on violence against women and the ways to address it, developments in international human rights law and insights gained through application, monitoring and evaluation. In India, a year after the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act was passed, the Lawyer\u201fs Collective was involved in reviewing the law and its implementation and produced a publication that evaluated the effectiveness of the law in its first year. Media can also play a significant role in monitoring the implementation of laws. For example, in Bangladesh Maitur Rahaman the editor of the daily Prothom Alo was instrumental in mobilising support for victims of acid attacks and also lobbied for laws against acid attacks and sale of acid and continues and continuously writes on the issue of acid violence. Rahaman used his newspaper to raise awareness and garner support on the issue. For his work on behalf of acid attack victims, he received the Magsaysay award in 2005.31 There are isolated examples of the involvement of men\u201fs groups allying with women\u201fs groups in monitoring legislation. MASVAW, for example, has established groups of men who seek out justice on behalf of those who have faced gender-based violence. In this manner, they support the survivors in accessing justice and also monitor the work of the police and judiciary to ensure that justice is delivered (see the case study at the end of this section). 2.3.4 Protection of victims\u2019 rights Women victims of violence frequently do not seek justice because of feelings of shame and fear of persecution by the criminal justice system. Safeguarding the rights of victims and creating a system that respects the privacy, dignity and autonomy of all victims is essential in order to 29 http://dvactupcampaign2007.blogspot.com/2007/12/lucknow.html accessed on January 20, 2008, cited in WHO policy report 30 Acid Survivors Foundation - http://www.acidsurvivors.org/statistics.html 31 The Daily Star, \u201cBangladesh:Maitur Rahaman gets Magsaysay Award\u201d, 2 August 2005. 19 create an environment where women are willing to report violence committed against them. A number of countries have endeavoured to meet such objectives by providing greater legal protection for victims of rape, including through laws that prevent the introduction of unrelated evidence about a victim\u201fs sexual behaviour in order to protect victims of rape from abusive cross-examination. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (2005) in India aims to facilitate women\u201fs reporting of domestic violence cases and supports them through the legal process. The law ensures that Protection Officers assist women in reporting crimes. The admirable intention of this legislation has been compromised by inadequate funding for and training of such Protection Officers, echoing the implementation issues discussed above. 2.3.5 Addressing sexual harassment in the workplace In South Asia, women are increasingly leaving the home to join the workforce as garment workers in Bangladesh, in carpet factories in Nepal, in tea plantations in Sri Lanka, call center operators in India, etc.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cfe5c8a3-31fd-4a47-94b0-51d285892f0f": {"__data__": {"id_": "cfe5c8a3-31fd-4a47-94b0-51d285892f0f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/men-and-prevention-gender-based-violence", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Men and the Prevention of Gender based Violence", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/men-and-prevention-gender-based-violence", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6b12f277c112c8521a9ab071a75e82925b9d3c0a2e89b1a259ad7efb1f04880c"}, "2": {"node_id": "b7caac65-267b-4ed3-9a06-fa4106a39fa1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/men-and-prevention-gender-based-violence", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a7519ed15684c646932ff3a18021ea05f5aa25fbd5402d7e8ffe92fe8a1da774"}}, "hash": "ea5426969abe1144c034bcf74c562322d03d0f46c84ff0ad00af4aa395b1d940", "text": "With increased opportunities for economic gain, they also face new threats of gender-based violence whether within the home where their partners may feel threatened by their new roles or at the workplace where they may face sexual harassment and abuse in the hands of their male colleagues or supervisors.

Additionally, gender sensitive training and awareness on laws on sexual harassment for managers should be encouraged. This can be complimented with awareness programmes for workers who should know the laws and policies within organisations and where to seek support when they face gender-based violence within the workplace. Labour unions, and their male-dominated leadership, have a crucial role to play in pushing for such legislative and policy action. 2.3.6 Addressing violence by the Police There are a growing number of examples of gender sensitivity training for police services, as discussed in sub-section 2.3.2. This training aims to improve the police response to survivors of violence, to reduce the level of violence committed against women in custody by the police and armed forces and to promote internal reform within the police facilitating an increase in the recruitment of women, awareness regarding sexual harassment, and reforms to police operational and accountability systems. But experience suggests that tackling the problem of institutionalised gender-based violence within police services requires more than training. Monitoring and accountability mechanisms and procedures are needed to ensure that policies addressing such violence are implemented and that perpetrators are sanctioned. Such mechanisms and procedures require high-level backing and adequate funding in order to be effective. It is important to remember that men also suffer in the hands of the police. In particular, men who challenge the traditional gender roles are targeted. In Nepal, there has been documentation of on going harassment by the police of transgender men where the men are attacked by the police because they identify themselves as women.32 Local and international human rights groups have been vocal in condemning the violence. For example, the Blue Diamond Society (BDS) in Nepal documents human rights violations against sexual minorities, works to negotiate with the police when faced with cases of arbitrary detention and harassment, holds regular meetings to discuss violence by the police on sexual minorities, and works to sensitise the police and government officials on the rights of sexual minorities raising awareness on sexual orientation, gender identity, human rights abuses and sexual health.33 32 Human Rights Watch, Nepal: Police on \u201eSexual Cleansing\u201f Drive \u2013 Transgender People Routinely Subjected to Physical and Sexual Abuse, 13 January 2005. 33 Open Society Institute, Blue Diamond Society, September 2007. 2.3.7 Addressing violence by the Armed Forces There is a long history of association between military institutions and gender-based violence. Only recently has the use of rape as a weapon of war been recognised by the international community. Men and women who suffer gender-based violence in times of conflict often face serious hurdles when trying to ensure that the perpetrators of violence are held accountable. In Nepal, for example, despite calls from the UN for a war crimes tribunal, as of yet there has been no progress towards establishing such a tribunal to address cases of violation of rights including gender based violence.34 Establishing mechanisms to ensure gender-based violence is not ignored in the aftermath of conflict can be a means to ensure that the violations that occurred in times of conflict are not simply ignored or forgotten. Commissions such as the Human Rights Commission and special Truth Commissions can play a critical role in investigating and gathering evidence on cases of gender-based violence. Additionally, the justice system can be supported to ensure that perpetrators of violence are held accountable. Policies and institutions in post-conflict situations need to be particularly focused to respond to the violations that occurred during the conflict and work towards ensuring that those that have faced violations are empowered to access justice. It is also important to challenge the suspension of constitutional protections in military-controlled areas, such as the Indian Armed Forces Act and its granting of special powers and suspension of human rights and constitutional protections in designated areas. While women\u201fs rights groups have been vocal in campaigning against such legislation, not least because of the impunity it creates for acts of violence perpetrated by military personnel, men\u201fs violence prevention organisations and initiatives have been slow to lend their support to this campaigning. 34 BBC News, \u201cUN urges War Crimes Trials in Nepal\u201d, 24 January 2007. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6294869.stm 21 3 Rights and Empowerment 3.1 Situation Overview Women\u201fs movements across the world, including the Asia-Pacifc region, have linked their struggles for rights and empowerment with campaigns against violence, both inside and outside the home and perpetrated by state and non-state violators because of this understanding of the inter-dependence of violence and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2c8be9ff-aa63-4d22-a064-7fe58bbbccef": {"__data__": {"id_": "2c8be9ff-aa63-4d22-a064-7fe58bbbccef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/men-and-prevention-gender-based-violence", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Men and the Prevention of Gender based Violence", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/men-and-prevention-gender-based-violence", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "508cba933595ea49b4df6411862ecc0ac8ccece95ddacb7f911480982ae2567a"}, "3": {"node_id": "97e4fb58-c591-4f1d-b8c7-e16d4dd20a5b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/men-and-prevention-gender-based-violence", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b7ca9fae872e25bdf2d0634e0394785873a0028ca1883ac379f1fee497050405"}}, "hash": "93952d7bec3223623e0f3f444f9b0d693a882f992557b985dbd367623e0bcfe4", "text": "oppression. Such movements have always been clear that violence against women is a constitutive element of patriarchy and also reflects and reinforces other oppressive economic and social hierarchies (based on class, caste, communalism, race/ethnicity, sexuality and age). Research in the Asia-Pacifc region points to the significance of property rights in reducing women\u201fs vulnerability to violence, especially when accompanied by strong bonds with a woman's natal family, support from her community and social circles, and regular employment by her husband.35 In Kerala, India, a survey found that 49% of women without property reported physical violence, compared to only 7% of women who owned assets.36 The protective effect of economic assets such as property highlights the importance of working to promote women\u201fs human rights and economic empowerment as a key policy area for violence prevention. It also highlights the significance of understanding and addressing the structural determinants of women\u201fs differing vulnerability to violence; that while all women are subject to the fear and fact of men\u201fs violence, some women are marked as more violable than others as a result of other social inequalities, based on class, caste, religion, age, sexuality and/or \u201erace\u201f and ethnicity. Similarly, the gender-based violence that targets men who have sex with men is intimately connected to issues of rights and empowerment. The fact that such men\u201fs sexual practices and identities are proscribed by law in countries across the region is, in itself, a violation of their basic rights. By being placed outside the law in this way, such men become \u201efree\u201f targets for violence with impunity, as they can have little or no recourse to the law for protection, especially when the perpetrators of such violence are often the police themselves. However, it is also true that some groups of men who have sex with men are much more vulnerable to violence than others. A study of MSM in India and Bangladesh found that most of the men were from economically disempowered backgrounds where the median monthly income of individual was less than US$70. The study found that feminised males often have to face economic and educational consequences of their femininity, where their advancement was often impeded due to harassment and discrimination. Little specific research exists to shed light on the structural determinants of child sexual abuse, especially in countries of the global South, but there is enough anecdotal evidence from programmes working on such abuse to suggest that there are a complex set of interactions between global inequality and poverty, the global lack of protection for the rights of children, the organised global and local sex trafficking industries and intra-familial and community-based sexual abuse. A study of global prostitution noted the cycles of prostitution, subsequent violence, risk of HIV and other diseases, poor mental and physical health outcomes, homelessness and poverty that are set into motion when child sexual abuse is perpetrated.37 35 Property Ownership and Inheritance Rights of Women for Social Protection \u2013 The South Asia Experience: ICRW 2006 36 UN Millennium Project. 2005a.

As has been emphasised, it is important to work on the \u201cstructural conditions that perpetuate violence at the interpersonal and even societal level.\u201d39 3.2.1 Profound economic and social change Changes in the global economy, often referred to as globalisation, are re-shaping social and economic relations in profound ways.

One overview of the research on this phenomenon has concluded that the entry of young unmarried women into paid work has, for many of them, afforded greater economic and social autonomy.41 At the same time, neo-liberalism\u201fs assault on the development strategy of import replacement industrialisation in the global South has fuelled high rates of unemployment for working-class youth. As has been observed: \u201cIn third-world cities there has been a de-institutionalisation of economic life that has left very large numbers of young men in precarious conditions.\u201d42 On the other hand, the available evidence also suggests that many of the new jobs for women are in inherently exploitative sectors (unorganised manufacturing, home-based work, entertainment), creating a new \u201eunderclass\u201f of women workers being created in export industries. The corporatisation of agriculture, monetisation of natural resources and conversion of agricultural land to industrial use have had devastating effects in terms of the impoverishment of rural communities, with women being especially hard hit. Reports from organisations supporting female migrants, for example in the service sector and the trade in nannies and maids, suggest that these domestic workers face sexual harassment and violence, which largely goes unreported because of fears over loss of employment. Female cross-border traders also report high levels of sexual harassment and exploitation at the hands of immigration and customs of\ufb01cials.43 These social and economic changes present both opportunities and challenges for policy action on gender-based violence in the domain of empowerment and rights. With increasing economic opportunity for at least some women has come increased pressure for legal and policy affirmation of women\u201fs interests leading to changes in laws and policies and enactment of new laws and polices that protect and promote women\u201fs rights. The picture, however, is very mixed, 39 Cited in Flood Mexico: (MICHALSKI, J., 2004.

Experiences from micro-credit programmes suggest that when such programmes appear to be empowering women to such an extent that a threat is posed to male privilege, then a violent backlash is possible. Research in Bangladesh found that:44 \u2015Micro-credit programmes have a varied effect on men\u2018s violence against women. They can reduce women\u2018s vulnerability to men\u2018s violence by strengthening their economic roles and making their lives more public. When women challenge gender norms, however, they sometimes provoke violence in their husbands.\u2016 This threat has been linked to specific acts of men\u201fs violence as a backlash against these challenges to structures and notions of male authority, and more generally to a re-emergence of \u201efamily\u201f values, \u201ematernalism\u201f and \u201cback to the kitchen\u201d ideologies enforced with violence. 3.2.3 Challenge of cross-gender alliance The social and economic changes described above are threatening male privilege in ways that not only prompt male backlash but that also weaken alliances between women and men around shared class interests.

As a recent WHO publication on the policy implications of engaging men in work for gender equality has noted:45 To date very little of the gender work done with men has focused on men\u2018s potential role in supporting policy initiatives championed by women\u2018s rights organisations. For instance, in South Africa very few of the initiatives working with men for gender equality participated in efforts to ensure passage of long overdue amendments to sexual offences legislation or to support amendments to termination of pregnancy policies. Whether as community members, community leaders or policy-makers, it is important that men be mobilised around an agenda of women\u201fs social and economic empowerment. For organisations working with men on masculinity and gender equality, this implies a need to build closer relationships with women\u201fs rights organisations and coalitions and be more committed to their role as allies in supporting the empowerment agendas of women\u201fs movements. More broadly, such a mobilisation of men implies a need to organise more explicitly around shared economic interests among women and men within poor and marginalised communities, by integrating gender justice issues within a broader social justice agenda. 3.3.2 Address the rights of men who have sex with men Little has been done with regard to the rights and empowerment of men who have sex with men. Governmental policies for combating HIV/AIDS are often in conflict with the penal laws and the actions of local law enforcement agents. On the one hand the government recognises the need to address the HIV/AIDS concerns of male-to-male sexual behaviours, but on the other, the continuation of the criminalisation of such behaviours often leads to threats of blackmail, sexual abuse, and violence, if not arrest. It discourages those in need of information and services to seek the same. In addition to this, programme staff and target populations are vulnerable to local police excesses and abuse without adequate ways and means of addressing such abuses. Organising to challenge these abuses and promote the human rights of men who have sex with men has been, and continues to be, done by men within a range of direct service and legal advocacy organisations serving the needs of MSM communities, primarily in major urban areas. But rarely, if ever, have the rights and empowerment of men who have sex with men been an issue on the agenda of organisations seeking to engage men, who are assumed to be heterosexual in their practice and identity, in preventing gender-based violence. 45 WHO/Sonke policy paper reference 4 Norms and Values 4.1 Situation Overview Legal protections and economic and social rights reflect and express social norms and values. As history shows, policy efforts to improve legal protections for women and to empower them economically have begun to shift attitudes toward and ideas about gender equality in ways that are challenging deeply set patriarchal norms and values in most societies. At the same time, this domain of norms and values has become a site of resistance to the progress toward gender equality, through appeals to culture and tradition that are said to be under threat from \u201eforeign\u201f ideas and practices. As such, the domain of norms and values is an important target for policy action to address the cultural conditions that allow gender-based violence to continue. In addition to policy work on legal protections and economic empowerment, which will itself influence these conditions, there is a distinctive area of policy activity that can address norms and values through attending to the social institutions that reproduce them, such as the family, the school and the media. In particular, it is important to address the norms and values of masculinity and femininity that underpin patriarchal social relations and its gender-based violence.

A recent meta-analysis found that sexual violence was most strongly associated with hostile, patriarchal, and hypermasculine forms of masculine ideology.49 The connections between gender norms and men\u201fs gender-based violence are forged through norms of male power and control. Men\u201fs violence is instrumental in securing male power. Research on the links between masculinity and domestic violence in India found that: [P]hysical violence is seen as a resource to fulfill the responsibility of maintaining social order and attests to its instrumental nature. Higher rates of physical violence reported by both scheduled (lower) caste (SC) men in Punjab and by upper castes in Tamil Nadu may be indicative of fear of loss of resources and personal and group status and power. At the same time, for dalit youth in Tamil Nadu, violence itself is a resource to acquire social and political power. The same study also found that men\u201fs sexual violence was connected to notions and norms of men\u201fs sexual entitlement to sexual access to and pleasure from women: Sexual violence, on the other hand, may be more an expression of the fundamental right to a woman\u2018s body and to maintaining an intimate relationship. In the Indian context, a further complexity to men\u2018s beliefs is the importance of the ability to sexually satisfy as a crucial marker of masculinity. Anxiety about pleasuring the wife or not being able to satisfy her may result in asserting control and power over the woman\u2018s sexuality. Romancing and seduction that often involves force and competing with other men also 46 Based on \u201cVIOLENCE PREVENTION WITH MEN: STRATEGIES AND CHALLENGES\u201d; Dr Michael Flood Mexico presentation 47 Flood mexico (Davis and Liddell 2002; De Judicibus and McCabe 2001; National Crime Prevention 2001, pp. 89-90; Pavlou and Knowles 2001; Truman et al. 1996; Wade and Brittan-Powell 2001; White and Kurpius 2002) 48 Flood mexico (Berkel et al. 2004; Good et al. 1995; Simonson and Subich 1999) 49 Flood mexico (Murnen et al. 2002) 27 underscores this need to possess and control women. Sexual violence thus maybe closely correlated to men\u2018s understanding of power and control as relational concepts. Social norms in many societies hold women\u201fs bodies and behaviours as the bearers of the honour of the family and community. In honour cultures, \u201cmale honour is seen in terms of status, dominance, and reputation, and based on men\u201fs ability to enforce their will on others, command deferential treatment, and protect family and possessions\u201d.50 Such cultures are often marked by strong gender ideologies that emphasise female \u201epurity\u201f and male virility and sexual freedom.51 With regard to issues of honour and shame and men\u201fs violence, recent work in South Asia has highlighted the importance of understanding the positioning of women as the bearers of the honour of the community, whether it be local, communal and/or national. Writing of men\u201fs violence against women in South Asia, Banerjee et al comment that:52 Women experience violence and commoditisation as the gendered property of their community, and repositories of its honour, both within their own communities as well as from men of other communities. The strong identification of women with their community (as property and as signifier) makes them vulnerable to violence, especially at times of social instability, and cultural and moral anxiety. Nor should these gender norms that sanction men\u201fs violent policing of women\u201fs behaviour in the service of family and community honour be taken to be timeless. A significant element of the rise of militant Hindu and Islamic fundamentalist communalism/nationalism within the South Asian region has been a patriarchal gender ideology that equates the vitality of the nation/religious community with the militant virility of the male, and the confinement of the female to the private sphere.53 The consequences of this gender ideology in the Asia-Pacifc region, and the community norms governing the behaviour of women through which it is expressed, have been severe indeed.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "db798777-209a-4973-83a7-f53c7d32d64b": {"__data__": {"id_": "db798777-209a-4973-83a7-f53c7d32d64b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/men-and-prevention-gender-based-violence", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Men and the Prevention of Gender based Violence", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/men-and-prevention-gender-based-violence", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f11aeef2b9834b77b47c3f7b7b5b2bf83b4bf25d706d3c5b402465c6d084fe42"}, "2": {"node_id": "118c24c0-435d-479b-a8b9-126c3bd655e2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/men-and-prevention-gender-based-violence", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "db0f0422f1eed790f3ee48ba007e9519ecd0a36bba0c41d078d066352b15d505"}}, "hash": "483e6295a050ffbf8b0580b9f4e2b2983c2069a2e91c90ef8519ea88dc405528", "text": "Violence based on patriarchal right wing ideologies (see box) serve as a reminder that the cultural is not somehow separable from the politic 50 Vandello and Cohen 2003, p. 998 - see Flood Mexico 51 Flood Mexico 52 Engendering Violence: Boundaries,Histories,and the Everyday.

Some of these are mentioned below: \u2022 \u2017Sati\u2018 or forcing women to get \u2017immolated\u2018 on the funeral pyre of their husbands \u2022 Bride burning for dowry is common \u2022 \u2017Punishing\u2018 women engaged in social change activities by rape \u2013 Bhanwri Devi case in Rajasthan; or cutting the hands of as in Madhya Pradesh in 2006 or stripping and parading of a dalit (lower caste) woman elected village chief for raising the National Flag on Independence day \u2022 Hanging, punishing and disgracing couples who marry across caste and/or religion \u2022 Strong opposition including vandalism on the occasion of Valentine\u2018s Day, which is seen as a western ploy to dilute the moral values \u2022 A steep decline in the sex ratio of the girl child has emerged in the last twenty years especially in urban and middle-class settings due to sex-selection and selective elimination of the female foetus \u2022 Large scale use of sexual violence during ethnic conflict as in the Gujarat riots of 2002 4.2 Policy Challenges 4.2.1 Resurgence of patriarchalism A policy framework for engaging men in the prevention of gender-based violence must be articulated and implemented in relation to the specific contexts shaping this violence, and women\u201fs and men\u201fs lives more generally.54 Recent feminist analyses of these contexts, and the patriarchal ideologies and practices with which they are enmeshed, are useful in this regard.55 Such analyses, in the Asia-Pacifc region in particular, draw attention to ongoing conflicts within and across borders and the growing militarism associated with this and the emergence of religious fundamentalism and its backlash against secular discourses of human rights and gender equality. The mobilisation of patriarchal ideology that has been used in the service of this militarisation has, in some contexts, been linked with the growing political influence of religious fundamentalism, notably the Hindu nationalism of the BJP in India and the resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan. In both cases, profoundly oppressive gender ideologies and practices have been at the heart of the fundamentalist calls to \u201epurify\u201f the Nation. Taliban-sponsored violence against women is well documented, but the extent and brutality of such violence in state-backed communalist violence against Muslim communities in India (notably in Gujarat) is less well known outside the region. 4.2.2 Fatherhood and patriarchalism Globally, the most well-documented policy effort to shift attitudes and practice with regard to gender roles and norms has been in the area of men\u201fs involvement in parenting. But in the context of resurgent patriarchalism described above, it is important to distinguish the different ideological agendas at work in the growing discourse on fatherhood. In relation to the goal of preventing gender-based violence, the challenge confronting policy efforts to promote men\u201fs involvement as fathers is to ground such efforts in a commitment to gender equity. This commitment is needed in order to resist the anti-feminist politics that fatherhood policy can invoke, when it focuses on restoring men to their \u201erightful\u201f place as the head of the family, problematising women-headed households and insisting that boys need fathers in order to be \u201enormal\u201f men. 4.2.3 Globalisation and gender norms Globalisation is shaping social norms and values in complex ways. Its impacts on regional, national and local economies are affecting long-held beliefs about and practices of productive and reproductive labour, as discussed in the previous section. The shrinking of the world made possible by developments in telecommunications and transportation is allowing new forms of transnational feminist organising to push for policy on gender equality and gender-based violence. Within the Asia-Pacifc region, the increase in availability and use of television, radios, mobile phones has been critical to the communication revolution that has affected urban and rural areas.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7bbd7120-ab2e-4a98-8d96-ab7136beb80c": {"__data__": {"id_": "7bbd7120-ab2e-4a98-8d96-ab7136beb80c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/men-and-prevention-gender-based-violence", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Men and the Prevention of Gender based Violence", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/men-and-prevention-gender-based-violence", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0980769d775170429a019b8b6f60ed8a13335860c829ddcb88fe81089bcd1d28"}, "2": {"node_id": "d68b7d89-fbe1-42c9-80c7-cb8303ceea7d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/men-and-prevention-gender-based-violence", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b5f36ac9d14b95ac44243f9ac258b971f40763576e410aa645719f4f4f3cfa72"}}, "hash": "36d14fd200391b1253ed6849cacbc57bf04272040b2b6001667a04a74aad1855", "text": "This has led to an exposure to new values, new behaviours and new aspirations, sometimes based on aggressive consumerist advertising as well as media content from all 54 See From: Political and legal framework regarding MSM in South Asia, Arvind Narrain, Brototi Dutta, Alternative Law Forum, India, A background paper produced for the Risks and Responsibilities: Male Sexual Health and HIV in Asia and the Pacific International Consultation held in New Delhi, India 23-26 September 2006 55 Based on presentation by Kalyani Menon-Sen 29 around the world.

A small example of this is that most viewed television serials in India are those that reinforce traditional patriarchal values and norms/ stereotypes. The media throughout the region needs to be questioned on its portrayal of gender roles. Sexist imagery and representation of dominating masculinity (e.g. in tobacco or alcohol advertising) needs to be addressed through the development of regulating guidelines, as does censorship of work that challenges gender stereotypes which often occurs in the name of protecting cultural/traditional values. 4.2.4 Gender analysis missing or lacking At the same time, public policy in many societies continues to take little account of gender. Even when gender is addressed, analysis is usually confined to the impacts of gender inequalities on women, with little said about the work that is needed with men to address such inequalities, or how gender shapes men\u201fs lives as well (see box). It is important to emphasise that the gender- blindness of public policy has historically privileged men, as a recent paper by WHO notes:56 [M]en have been treated as generic and ungendered representatives of all humanity. This gender-blind treatment has perpetuated masculine norms and gender inequalities. In redressing this, and making public policy gender- sensitive to address the norms and values that oppress women, there has been a tendency to frame this in terms of policy\u201fs responsiveness to gender difference, rather than attend to the ways in which many forms of public policy produce gender. As a study of policy in ten European countries found, notions of masculinity and femininity, as well as the gender practices that enact them, are shaped by law and policy regarding home and family, work, social exclusion, and violence.57 Institutions and states actively participate in the production of unequal gender relations. Thus, one of the key tasks of gender-sensitive policy-making is to recognise the gendered character and impacts of all policies. Attending to the involvement of policy in constructing gender norms and values highlights the challenge of addressing the gender regimes of policy-making processes and machineries. Not only do men predominate in policy-making settings, but such settings are characterised by 56 WHO policy paper 57 Hearn et al. Health Policy in India There is little mention of gender, let alone men, in policies related to health, women\u2018s empowerment or youth. The National Health Policy 2002 makes no mention of men, male or gender. The National Population Policy 2000 mentions gender thrice once in the context of gender inequalities and there is a section on serving under-served populations which refers to mens role in planned parenthood. However the RCH2 project which provides the budgetary outlays for implementing this policy makes provisions for men only under contraception and to the extent of 0.15% of the overall reproductive and child health budget. The National Rural Health Mission ( 2005), the current vehicle for providing health care services has only one reference to gender in the context of the gender imbalance in population (declining sex ratio) and there is no reference to men\u2018s involvement. The RCH2 ( 2005 \u2013 2010) me has a section devoted to gender however as mentioned below the provisions for men\u2018s involvement is a meager 0.15% and restricted to contraception. The National AIDS Control Organisation website has a section on FAQs but the word gender does not occur even once and the words men and male occur only in the context of men as agents for spreading the infection or as users of condoms. A leading national website of young people\u2018s sexual and reproductive health and rights provides information on a number of issues but this is not done in a sex segregated manner, assuming perhaps that the needs of girls and boys are similar and/or common. institutional gender regimes that comprise gendered constructions of occupational positions, hierarchies, and tasks, as well as formal and informal male networks and daily strategies which subordinate and exclude women.58 58 Flood, M., and B.

The importance of men\u201fs organisations working in solidarity as allies to women\u201fs rights organisations was emphasised by the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women Expert Group Meeting on \u201cThe Role of Men and Boys in Achieving Gender Equality\u201d held in 2003, which recommended network and alliance building on", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "077440b5-da43-4eea-b3bb-7367afed911b": {"__data__": {"id_": "077440b5-da43-4eea-b3bb-7367afed911b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/men-and-prevention-gender-based-violence", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Men and the Prevention of Gender based Violence", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/men-and-prevention-gender-based-violence", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b4cc53669eff94e6c8c268a11c6ddcf4e728c90457c9782c54db99a99aa83229"}, "3": {"node_id": "acc5b7a4-4ba3-420b-b79c-a0f27adb05b6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/men-and-prevention-gender-based-violence", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bf046b8617cf536d489490fa91d06d566cacbdd37a592293befdb011ceeb2f0a"}}, "hash": "fe0b15bf93ccb381c12c671e751d6f14f1465afb8b1198216d062764dd35010f", "text": "gender-based violence, including efforts to:59 \uf023 Support networking of non-governmental organisations that work with men to end gender-based violence; \uf023 Support partnerships and alliance building between women\u201fs organisations and men\u201fs organisations working to end violence and/or promoting human rights; \uf023 Support strengthened networking among different organisations working with men nationally, regionally and globally; \uf023 Create local, national, regional, and global resource centres for materials on gender-based violence, particularly on materials on men and masculinity; \uf023 Support learning and sharing of experiences among organisations working with men and violence against women (including through internet dialogues). 4.3.2 Focus on gender regimes of policy-making processes and machineries Effective policy action on norms and values also requires that attention be given to the gender regimes of the institutional processes and mechanisms responsible for policy development. This implies a need for both internal advocacy and capacity building around gender awareness and external monitoring and pressure to hold institutions accountable for instituting policies to address patriarchal gender regimes, including policies on discrimination and harassment. A recent study of the institutional dynamics by which gendered policy action is produced, looking at different Australian bureaucracies, found that no one condition is sufficient to advance gender equality in policy-making processes, but that a combination of conditions is required, including:60 \uf023 approximate parity in women\u201fs and men\u201fs participation at all levels; \uf023 an integrated approach to policy making such that mainstream policy is developed co-extensively with gender-specific policy and vice- versa; \uf023 participation by community-based, feminist advocacy groups throughout the process; \uf023 engagement throughout of gender equity/feminist policy machinery in both generic and gender-specific policy processes; \uf023 active and unequivocal support for the advancement of gender equality and women\u201fs interests in policy making by the most senior figures involved, both in elected and appointed positions; \uf023 adoption of feminist understandings of the problem of gender inequality as acceptable conceptual currency in the formulation of policy, both mainstream and gender-specific. 59 United Nations Division for the Advancement of Women with The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, The International Labour Organization, and The United Nations Development Programme, United Nations Commission on the Status of Women Expert Group Meeting on \u201cThe Role of Men and Boys in Achieving Gender Equality\u201d , Brazil,12 January 2004. 60 Schofield, T., and S. Goodwin. (2005) Gender politics and public policy making: Prospects for advancing gender equality. Policy and Society, 25(4): 25-44. 4.3.3 Gender equitable parenting As already noted, fatherhood has become an important site for policy action to engage men in efforts to challenge patriarchal norms and values. This emphasis on fatherhood has been energised by evidence about the beneficial effects of engaging men as parents and of a more equitable division of parenting labour in the home.61 While there has been an overall strengthening of patriarchal values in South Asia, small stories of change can also be found. At the individual/ family level men\u201fs involvement in the household domain including childcare has increased, even though it may be for purely practical reasons. Nuclearisation of families have made relationships with spouse/partner more turbulent but at the same time more intimate and reciprocal. Images about the caring partner/father and the sharer of household chores are being used occasionally in advertising. While instances of expressed incompatibility and divorce are becoming common within marital partnerships; instances of mutuality, explicit caring and sharing are also visible. There are occasional references to sharing and caring as aspects of \u201epositive masculinity\u201f in the media. Below are some policy and programme recommendations on men\u201fs involvement in parenting and household labour more generally from the UN Expert Group Meeting referred to above: \uf0b7 Use financial and social policy to improve the balance between work and family life, and encourage men to make an equal contribution to domestic work \uf0b7 Expand paternal leave provisions \uf0b7 Create disincentives for employers to demand overtime work \uf0b7 Create a legal structure for permanent part-time work and incentives for men to use it \uf0b7 Develop aspects of family law that enable men to be active partners in the lives of children and dependents;

The UN Secretary General\u201fs report on violence against women notes that:62 The formal education system can be used as a key site for raising awareness about violence against women and challenging and eradicating gender stereotypes. Promising practices in this area include eliminating gender-based stereotypes in educational curricula; providing gender- sensitivity training for teachers; creating a school environment that rejects violence; and offering specialised courses on human rights, including women\u2018s rights. In the Asia-Pacifc region, pilot educational and youth development initiatives with boys and young men on gender equity and violence prevention have been developed. But, in India at least, the growing influence of religious fundamentalism has meant, in the last year or so, that education school curricula have been withdrawn from a large number of states across the country. In one state, in response to inter-faith marriages, a group of men have started a campaign to save the \u201eHindu Girl\u201f. Men\u201fs identity in India is strongly related to religion, caste and community and these are been aggressive asserted in the recent past- much to the detriment of women and gender equality. Below are some policy and programme recommendations on youth development from the UN Expert Group Meeting referred to above: \uf0b7 Carry out critical reviews of curricula, including at the pre-school, primary and secondary level, to include ways of promoting gender equality that engage boys as well as girls \uf0b7 Develop training for teachers, administrative staff and other groups dealing with children and youth (for example, health and social service professionals and police), to promote ways to engage boys and young men in gender equality - this should include sessions in which adult staff examine their own views about gender equality and assumptions about boys and male youth \uf0b7 Value, in school reform efforts, gender equality as an educational outcome which is as important as basic literacy and numeracy \uf0b7 Include messages and activities targeting boys and young men and promoting gender equality within existing sexuality education, HIV/AIDS prevention education and family life education curricula \uf0b7 Use existing programmes with well-developed curricula and group education processes, which have been evaluated and are successful in leading to attitude change, to engage boys in gender equality. Partnerships between Governments and non-governmental organisations should be encouraged to make such curricula and strategies widely available \uf0b7 Engage sports groups in the public and private sector, to promote gender equality among boys and men. This should draw on existing experiences to engage boys through football coaches in Latin America, and \u201clocker room\u201d projects used in some countries 62 ref 35 4.3.5 Sexual and reproductive health and rights Internationally, there has been a growing policy emphasis on male involvement in sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR). At least some of this work has been explicitly about gender equity, and challenging the oppressive gender norms that are so enmeshed with sexual/reproductive practices and cultures in many societies. In the Asia-Pacifc region, there is some notional acceptance of men\u201fs involvement in family planning programmes but often this is restricted to an emphasis on male sterilisation.

Policies that seek to transform norms and values can be influenced through the development of media messaging and guidelines to shape gender norms towards gender equity, especially by targeting men. The UN Expert Group Meeting on \u201cThe Role of Men and Boys in Achieving Gender Equality\u201d, referred to above, noted the importance of work with the media when it recommended actions to: \uf0b7 Strengthen use of mass media campaigns (using television, music videos, billboards and other), for positive, non-violent messages about manhood, including participation in domestic and household tasks and caregiving, and respect for women \uf0b7 Promote the engagement of young people in action for gender equality.

The definition of domestic violence - Definition of Domestic violence as all a \u201call acts of omission and commission that result in injury or harm or threats to cause injury or harm, as well as harassment to meet unlawful demands (such as dowry). Injury may be physical or mental in nature. Conduct includes physical abuse, verbal and emotional abuse, sexual abuse and economic abuse. In arriving at a conclusion that an act of domestic violence has been committed, the overall facts and circumstances are to be considered. 2. Definition of domestic relationship - The term \u201edomestic relationship\u201f has been broadly defined to include all women who \u201elive or have lived together in a shared household\u201f with the respondent and are related to the respondent by consanguinity, marriage, or through a relationship in the nature of marriage, adoption or are family members living together as a joint family. \u201eRespondent\u201f has been defined to include adult male perpetrators of violence and in cases of married women (or women living in the nature of marriages); relatives of the husband or the male partner. 3. Rights recognized under the PWDVA - The PWDVA recognizes a woman\u201fs right to live in a violence free home. The right to reside has been given statutory recognition under the law. This guards against the illegal dispossession of women from the shared household. A woman who has faced domestic violence from the respondent is entitled to reliefs under this law. 4. Remedies provided for in the law are a. Protection Order (Section 18) b. Residence order (Section 19) c. Monetary relief (Section 20) d. Custody order (Section 21) e .

To provide a technical input to the knowledge sharing, UNDP commissioned seven case studies on existing national funds in the fields of environment, conservation, energy, climate change and development. Thispaper reports the lessons learned extracted from the establishment and management of the Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation (BTFEC), which is one of seven national funds across the Asia-Pacific region selected as acase study.1 The BTFEC is selected to provide an interesting case for countries in Asia-Pacific because of the following characteristics: 1. The ability to manage a full-scale endowment fund.In 2011, the total investment managed by the BTFEC was US$ 42.3 million, which was growing from US$ 21 millionwhen it was first established in 1992. The fund, whichis currently invested in the capital market both in the US as well as in Bhutan, generates interests or dividendsto provide grants for eligible environmental conservation projects in Bhutan. In FY 2011, the total revenue (from both dividend/interest and net capital gain) generated from the endowment fund was US$ 2.2 million. 2. The transformation of the BTFEC to be fully Bhutanese. In 2001, the high-level management board became fully Bhutanese. During the initiation of the BTFEC, the fund was a collaborative venture between the Royal Government of Bhutan, United Nations Development Program (UNDP), and World Wildlife Fund (WWF). While WWF obtained a seat in the management board, UNDP served as an ex-officio member without a voting power. The transition process to be fully Bhutanese in the management board took five years. As of today, the asset management committee and the secretariat of the BTFEC are also managed entirely by Bhutanese individuals. 3. The granting mechanism guided by five-year frameworks of strategic funding priorities. Grants are awarded to eligible Bhutanese individuals and institutions based on the program focuses set in the five-year strategic frameworks. This approach ensures a more targeted granting program to achieve the environmental conservationobjectives of Bhutan.

The BTFEC has then moved away from assuming government\u2019s budgetary responsibility by financing the recurrent cost of governments programs to providing resources to set up conservation infrastructure.3According to the existing Strategic Plan, the BTFEC provides grants, including for public awareness and education, rural community development, climate change adaptation, and integrated water resources management. In the first few years after the establishment of the BTFEC, the income generated from the endowment fund were reinvested back to add up to the endowment fund.Therefore, the amount available to provide grants for conservation project was initially rather limited.4This trend however has started to change over the past few years. The total grants provided to beneficiaries in 2009-2010 were US$ 369,721 and increased to US$ 813,459 in 2010-2011 (Table 1). As a comparison, the government spending in 2009-2010 particularly on biodiversity conservation was Nu 215 million (approximately US$ 3.9 million). While the national budget focuses mainly for salaries and wages of civil servant, the BTFEC providesfinancial support for government agencies, local non-government organizations, grassroots communities and qualified Bhutanese individuals in the field of environmental conservation. The legal status The trust fund is governed by the Royal Charter of the Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation 1996, which provides the governing principle for the BTFEC. The Charter governs the management of the Trust Fund and investments/programs to befunded by the fund for the promotion of social welfare through environmental conservation in Bhutan. The Charter also mandates the Government to maintain Bhutan\u2019s forest cover at 60 percent of the country\u2019s area as the protected areas. The rules and regulations governing the day-to-day operations of the fund are detailed in the Operation Manual issued in 2009. Although established by a government regulation, the BTFEC is considered as an independent grant maker guided by strategic funding framework. Five out of six members sitting in the Management Board are representative from the government with one member from civil society. The Director and the secretariat staff are non civil service positions. 2Namgyal, ST, 2001, Future Directions for the Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation, Journal of Bhutan Studies, Vol. 3, No. 1. 3Ditto 4 The grant making was also rather limited because of lack of proposal writing capacity and also BTFEC was a new establishment and during that period the Secretariat was in process of developing its first five-year strategic plan. 5 Case Study Report: Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation The model: different types of funds The BTFEC currently manages an endowment fund, where the principal capital is kept in perpetuity and not consumed, while only the income from the investment is used to provide grants. An endowment fund appears to be quite useful for small and aid-dependence countries to ensure a sustainable financing mechanism to contribute in providing a certain public service. During the establishment of the BTFEC, donationsof in total US$21 millionwere raised. The main donors included the Global Environment Facility, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland.As of the first quarter of 2011, the trust fund\u2019s asset was US$44.0 million (with the total endowment fund of US$ 42.3 million). This increase is possible because the incomes generated from the endowment were reinvested back to add up to the endowment fund. The total annual income from interests and dividend in 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 were US$ 418,211 and US$ 625,927 respectively. In 2010-2011, the net capital gain reached US$ 1.4 million.

The BTFEC has started to bring part of the endowment fund back to Bhutan to be invested in the country itself. Investments in Bhutan currently provide a greater potential to generate higher interests compared to investments in developed countries. Initially the BTFEC brought back US$ 1 million. Now, the investment within the country has reached US$ 6 million, which is invested in three commercial banks, one insurance company and one trading company. Governing body and beneficiaries The governing structure of the BTFEC consists of a Management Board, a secretariat led by a director, and an Asset Management Committee, with the following roles and responsibilities: 1. A Management Board, consisting of six members, has all powers of the management of the Trust Fund. The members of the board consist of: the Minister of Agriculture and Forests as the Chairman of the Board, the Secretary of National Environmental Commission, the Director of National Budget, the Head of Policy and Planning of the Ministry of Works and Human Settlement, the Executive Director of Royal society for Protection of Nature (a local NGO), the Director of Cabinet Secretariat, and finally the Director of the BTFEC as the ex-officio Member Secretary of the Board. The Board will select the Chairman from among the members of the government and shall appoint the Director and the Investment Managers to manage the investments based on the investment guidelines. At present, the Asset Management Committee (AMC) functions as an Investment Manager, although the BTFEC can have an Investment Manager in addition to the AMC. 2. A Director carries out the day-to-day management of the BTFEC in accordance with the powers and duties established by the Board. The Director will be the Chief Executive Officer of the Fund and will directly report to the Management Board. The Director will implement the Board\u2019s decisions and oversee the day-to-day activities of the Fund. The Director will be supported by a full time secretariat 3. An Asset Management Committeeconsists of the Ministry of Finance, Druk Holdings and Investments (DHI), National Pension Funds, Royal Monetary Authority, and an individual consultant from the US. The committee has investment authority and responsibilities for general investment matters. Government agencies, local not-for-profit non-government organizations, grassroots communities and qualified Bhutanese individuals are eligible to receive financial support from the BTFEC. Annually, the BTFEC has approximately US$ 1.5 million to give away as grants, which can be accessed through two funding windows: large scale projects with a ceiling up to Nu. 13 million (or $300,000) and discretionary grants with ceiling up to Nu. 400,000 (or $10,000). While the discretionary grants are awarded on rolling basis, all large- scale grants have to follow the funding cycle, where the deadlines for proposal submissions are on 31 May and 31 December.

If it is found that laxity of supervision facilitated the fraud, the supervising officer at fault shall also be penalized. \u2022 On completion of investigations in a reported case of loss, the Treasurer/director shall issue a sanction order for affecting the write off and/or consequent recovery of cost, if any. If the amount of loss in cash or stock is replenished immediately on reporting or on completion of investigations, no write off shall be effected. - Audit \u2013 the Royal Charter has also mandated internal audit, which should be conducted by qualified auditors recognized by the Board. The annual audit is usually conducted by a qualified auditor of the Royal Audit Authority of Bhutan. The findings of the audit are made public on request, while the audited financial reports are uploaded in the BTFEC website. Finally, the Director prepares financial statement and work progress reports of the Trust Fund every year within six months of the end of the financial year and submit to the Board and distribute to donors upon review and approval of the Board. The establishment process of the BTFEC The BTFEC was created for sustainable financing for conservation under the leadership of farsighted monarch, his Majesty the Fourth King of Bhutan. It was first established in 1991 as a joint collaboration between the Royal Government of Bhutan, WWF-US and the UNDP. The driving force behind the establishment of BTFEC was the state policy to maintain 60 percent of the total land in Bhutan for conservation for all times to come and to ensure operationalization of all protected areas. Setting up an endowment fund was expected to ensure sustainable financing of conservation. At the time of the establishment, there was a trend of establishing an endowment fund for conservation worldwide. The establishment of BTFEC was made possible because of strong political will, institutional support and the wise leadership. 8 Case Study Report: Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation Due to a strong political push from the government, there were no significant transaction costs identified during the establishment of the BTFEC. The BTFEC staff recalled that the political process during the establishment of the fund was rather smooth and swift. It was however pointed out that the BTFEC had to pay management fees to UNDP as the fund manager soon after the establishment of the fund. Assistance was required at the beginning of the management of the BTFEC since the trust fund office was only started with a very small team consisting of a director and very limited staff.However, the management fees paid to UNDP as the fund manager was considered costly. Between 1993 and 1996, there was limited spending (grants provided to beneficiaries) but the focus was mainly on increasing the capacity, strengthening its institution and the capital for the endowment fund. The scaling up of the BTFEC granting programs only occurred after ten years of the implementation. This decision has actually contributed to building the capacity of the BTFEC and the government prior to providing grants to beneficiaries. The management of the BTFEC Granting Program As of 2011, the trust fund has generated $29.30 million of revenue and provided grants to 109 individuals and institutions.

The BTFEC works closely with grant seekers and facilitatesthe preparation of grant proposals. Grant seekers are advised to write a brief letter of inquiryto determine if the fund presents interests and permits consideration of request. The letter should include: purpose, problems to be addressed, information about organization, budget and duration estimation, and contact information. After receiving the letter, the BTFEC may ask the grant seeker to submit a formal proposal, which must address one of the fund\u2019s strategic funding objectives. During eachcall for proposal, around 8-15 proposals are received andusually only 5-6 proposals are approved (mainly from government agencies). The quality of the proposals is often not technical and financially sound, even those received from government agencies, while very limited proposals are received from local communities. The BTFEC has attempted to encourage local NGOs and community groups to submit proposals by providing training and simplifying the application procedure. To ensure grants are reaching the targeted beneficiaries particularly at the local level, two types of granting mechanisms are implemented: - Grant applicants from government (or established) institutions, which usually propose for larger and complex projects. For these applications, a higher standard in the screening process is applied. - While for local communities, a lower (simplified) standard is applied in screening the projects, where intervention from the fund management is required to provide support to project proponents. Proposals received directly from grassroots communities are preferred. When submitted by government and NGOs, proposals that enhance community involvement in conservation will be prioritized. Co-financing is desired, but the fund its support should not replace other donor funding. The maximum size of individual grants is Nu. 13 million (US$ 300,000), and individual grants can have a maximum duration of three years. Discretionary small grants not exceeding Nu. 400,000 (approximately US$ 10,000) per grant are also 9 Case Study Report: Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation available. The BTFEC can provide up to six small grants operational at one time or a maximum total budget of Nu.2.4 million per annum. The monitoring and evaluation The BTFEC implements both technical and financial monitoring. The financial monitoring includes scrutinizing the disbursement and the utility of the finances of the projects, while the technical monitoring require the assessment of impacts of the projects. Grantees should submit progress reports, both financial and technical, on a quarterly and semi-annual to the BTFEC followed by yearly comprehensive technical and financial report at the end of the fiscal year. At the end of the fiscal year, grantees should also submit financial and technical reports to the BTFEC. The Trust Fund carries out regular supervision through field visits. The Secretariat keeps the Board informed on the progress of its activities through quarterly and half-yearly progress reports. At the end of fiscal year the BTFEC will put into the public domain an annual report covering technical progress and consolidated audited financial statements. Each grant will be evaluated through mid-term evaluation and implementation completion reporting and the results will be published. The BTFEC realizes that there is room for improvement particularly related to the monitoring and evaluation of projects. Currently, the BTFEC can only measure the results of project implementation through written reports provided every quarter by project implementers. A completion report, which is required at the end of a project, also provides information related to both the finances and the results of the projects. The existing monitoring system relies mainly on the written reports submitted by project implementers. Only when the management suspects any irregularity or violation, an officer will then clarify and verify the matter on the ground. This monitoring system is regarded as not ideal as it relies only on written reports, yet it is the most reasonable system since currently the BTFEC manages around 25 projects during a year. Resource Mobilization The growing of the endowment fund over time was possible due to the decisions made to initially reinvest the dividends and interests generated to add up the endowment fund. The BTFEC applies a fixed annual spending ceiling that outlines both an operational spending target and a portion of annual revenues to be reinvested to increase the capital base. The latter is particularly essential since the trust fund has", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "19eb9dd6-6ce8-47a0-bc47-144c11252343": {"__data__": {"id_": "19eb9dd6-6ce8-47a0-bc47-144c11252343", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-bhutan-trust-fund-environmental-conservation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National Climate Fund Case Study Report: Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-bhutan-trust-fund-environmental-conservation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "84523e068979049f59279a07c128487e309a1d94c2773e70966917a625028dd3"}}, "hash": "84523e068979049f59279a07c128487e309a1d94c2773e70966917a625028dd3", "text": "not pursued any major fundraising since it became fully operational with $21 million in 1996.The preliminary estimates indicate that the trust fund endowment would need more than $50 million before its revenues could feasibly maintain a public grant-making window for environmental conservation in Bhutan.6However, with the current situation in the world of financial investments, there is no guarantee for performance related to the rates of return. The BTFEC is now seeking the opportunities of involving local industries and Bhutanese people in resource mobilization. The BTFEC is currently also accessing a World BankGEF project (US$ 4.08 million) for the northern area of Bhutan. A series of fund raising events are conducted and a fundraising expert has been hired. 6Namgyal, ST, 2001, Future Directions for the Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation, Journal of Bhutan Studies, Vol. 3, No. 1. 10 Case Study Report: Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation Lessons-learned Managing financial risks related to the endowment fund The BTFEC has been very aggressive in pursuing its investment portfolio. Yet it has been very prudent in mitigating the financial risks of its investment. Capital markets are the most unpredictable avenues of investment, with high uncertainty involved related to the amount of revenues that will be generated. The investment manager is expected to play a crucial role to ensure steady revenues for future strategic plans and reinvestment into the endowment. However, the BTFEC exposure to global equities (currently permitted up to 70 percent of the portfolio) could possibly be an area of concern, although fund management's credible risk diversification strategies.7 Several strategies that can be applied to mitigate the financial risks of the endowment fund are: 1. Theoretically, investors should identify their tolerance for market risk and then build a portfolio of different investment holdings that maximizes the expected rate of return given that level of risk (i.e., diversification). Investors can then decide on how much and where to allocate resources in order to maximize returns. Obviously every investment, whether private or public, carries different size, timing, and risk characteristics that must be taken into consideration. 2. The BTFEC focuses mainly on the consistency of the total return of the endowment fund over an extended period of time rather than the fluctuating returns that may occur over shorter interim periods. To achieve this objective, it is crucial to have a prudent manager with professional skills in investments as the investment manager. 3. To remain competitive, the trust fund is also regularizing periodic and independent evaluations of the performance of both the investment portfolio and its fund manager. Becominga fully Bhutanese managed Trust Fund Similar to many national funds that are established with external support, the BTFEC was initially managed by an international agency. The intention to move to be a fully Bhutanese trust fund has been mentioned and instructed by the Royal Charter.As stipulated by the Charter, all six members of the Management Board should be representatives from revelant agencies in Bhutan after five years of the issuance of the Charter in 1996. This transformation was also followed by the nationalization of the Asset Management Committee. In 1996, the trust fund's board contracted investment management to a professional investment manager based in the United States, while UNDP was serving as a fund manager. After around 6-7 years, the BTFEC decided to manage the fund by itself to reduce overhead costs and low performance of the manager in question and was replaced by individual investment advisor. This arrangement lasted for another 5-6 years, when the BTFEC then decided to establish its own Asset Management Committee (AMC), consisting of Bhutanese individuals from relevant institutions and an individual from the US. The BTFEC has been successful in moving towards to be a fully Bhutanese trust fund. The process has been gradual. Particularly for the Management Board, it became fully Bhutanese in 2001, which was 5 years after the implementation of the Charter or almost 9 years after the establishment of the BTFEC.The transformation process can only be made possible due to the following enabling situations: 1. Capacity \u2013 the increase of capacity obviously is one of the success factors enabling the transformation to a fully Bhutanese trust fund. In the first ten years of the establishment, the BTFEC has focused mainly on building the capacity, strengthening the 7Ditto 11 Case Study Report: Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation institution and increasing the total endowment fund. Once the capacity is ready, the BTFEC then moved to strengthen its granting portfolio. The decision to strengthen its capacity during the first ten years has been proven fruitful as the BTFEC has now become a strong national", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c62c21a-d806-41eb-a416-d8ede5a8b6f7": {"__data__": {"id_": "8c62c21a-d806-41eb-a416-d8ede5a8b6f7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-bhutan-trust-fund-environmental-conservation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National Climate Fund Case Study Report: Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-bhutan-trust-fund-environmental-conservation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "937acf7c54bd3e719503aa0ccca98557ec9f12d34d027b04330482ddd1c813d9"}}, "hash": "937acf7c54bd3e719503aa0ccca98557ec9f12d34d027b04330482ddd1c813d9", "text": "institution with grant-making capacity to support biodiversity conservation in Bhutan. 2. Political will and minimizing cost\u2013 Although the process of moving to be a fully Bhutanese trust fund took place gradually, the transformation itself (particularly for the nationalization of the Management Board) has been instructed by the Royal Charter. The transformation of the AMC to be fully Bhutanese also occurred following the assessments conducted related to the costs of hiring international fund manager and investment managers. The main driver of the transformation of the AMC was mainly to minimize the management costs of the BTFEC. The granting mechanism guided by a five year strategic plan The BTFEC annual grant making has been guided by five-years strategic plans. The strategic plans of the BTFEC are formulated to coincide with the government development plan. The strategic plans in five-year cycles present a cohesive well-grounded funding strategy to ensure the most effective utilization of trust fund resources. They also serve as an excellent indicator of efficient strategic planning,which allows for a more transparent process of project selection and, most importantly, ensures that the fund contributes to the achievement of environmental conservation in the country. Having the granting program guided by the strategic plans prevents the overlap between projects particularly those funded by government and those supported by external support. Strategic plans guiding the BTFEC granting program have also provided a room for measuring impacts of the Trust Fund. The BTFEC can include measurable targets and goals to be achieved within a period of time in the strategic plans. Having these quantifiedtargets will allow for a concrete impact evaluation framework to be put in place to assess the impact of its grants. The monitoring and evaluation of the BTFEC can also move towards establishing key performance indicators of each projects to have quantitative criteria to assess the performance of grant projects and to base future interventions. 12 Case Study Report: Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation Authors: Silvia Irawan, Pema Choenphyel, Chukey Wangchuk, Singye Dorji, Alex Heikens Cover Photo: Department of Tourism (Tourism Council of Bhutan) Acknowledgements: the authors would like to express their gratitude to representatives from government, development partners and grantees of the fund sharing their views and experiences with the Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation.

To provide a technical input to the knowledge sharing, UNDP commissioned seven case studies on existing national funds in the fields of environment, conservation, energy, climate change and development. This paper reports the lessons learned extracted from the establishment and management of the Cambodia Climate Change Alliance (CCCA) Trust Fund, which is one of seven national funds across the Asia-Pacific region selected as a case study.1 This report provides the summary of the overall design of the CCCA Trust Fund and a short description about the process of the establishment and the management of the CCCA Trust Fund. A brief analysis of the lessons-learned from the establishment and management of the CCCA Trust Fund are then presented. A desk review was conducted to examine documents related to the CCCA Trust Fund. The Secretariat of the CCCA Trust Fund, Dr. Tin Ponlok, also provided inputs to the paper. The design of the CCCA Trust Fund at a glance In 2006, the government of Cambodia established the National Climate Change Committee (NCCC), consisting of 20 ministries and agencies as a coordinating and policy support entity for all aspects of climate change. To strengthen the capacity of the NCCC and to enable line ministries and CSOs to implement priority climate change actions, the CCCA program was established in 2010. The CCCA aims to support the development of technical and institutional capacity at national and sub-national levels to address current and future climate related challenges. One of the efforts pursued by the CCCA is securing external funding for selected priority interventions through a multi-donor CCCA Trust Fund. The CCCA includes a unified engagement point for development partners and a multi-donor finance facility to provide resources for climate change capacity building at national and local levels. Funding of the CCCA program is provided through a trust fund called the Cambodia Climate Change Alliance Trust Fund (CCCA Trust Fund). Development partners are invited to make contributions to the fund in the form of pooled and non-targeted resources on basis of contractual agreements between each donor and UNDP. The legal status The CCCA Trust Fund is a multi-donor trust fund, which was established by the CCCA donors and government to apply a more coherent approach to climate change support for Cambodia. The Trust Fund is administered by UNDP and the operation of the trust fund is therefore implemented according to UNDP rules and procedures. The operational and administrative specificities of the framework for the CCCA Trust Fund are detailed in the CCCA Trust Fund Operational Manual. Each donor of the CCCA Trust Fund enters into a contractual agreement with UNDP for the administration of its funds. All donors have agreed on a program document and on a general Statement of Cooperation (SoC) to support Cambodia to address the challenges of Climate Change. The SoC details key principles of cooperation and harmonization that recognize the need to consult and cooperate in an open transparent manner in order to eliminate duplication of efforts, coordinate policies and procedures. 1 National funds selected for the case study analysis are: Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation, China CMD Fund, Cambodia Climate Change Alliance Trust Fund, Thailand Energy Conservation Promotion Fund, Lao Environmental Protection Fund, Micronesian Conservation Trust and Tuvalu Trust Fund.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7eb89ae0-bb85-4649-9631-ade44900b6d7": {"__data__": {"id_": "7eb89ae0-bb85-4649-9631-ade44900b6d7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-cambodia-climate-change-alliance-trust-fund", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National Climate Fund Case Study Report: Cambodia Climate Change Alliance Trust Fund", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-cambodia-climate-change-alliance-trust-fund", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "26643c361d6269cc27bc49538021a336558f7fa57f47d79c58e011d761827218"}, "2": {"node_id": "af006a27-30a9-4a3e-91cd-53b2a6d1cb9c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-cambodia-climate-change-alliance-trust-fund", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "90266d4a99df73d9d695d9a3579cda9932022ab8cef963451ea65fcbc8bd9c8a"}}, "hash": "ba0818363c1d86de579a7746901c409e1396611c0f810364b47efa1aad36adb2", "text": "http://www.snap-undp.org/elibrary/default.aspx 4 Case Study Report: Cambodia Climate Change Alliance Trust Fund Donor contributions to the Trust Fund are pooled and not earmarked in anyway.

The CCCA programme also has a full-time international Technical Specialist Climate Change to provide substantive support and advice. The model of the CCCA Trust Fund The CCCA Trust Fund is a sinking fund, where all the funds committed will have been disbursed by the end of the agreed project timeframe. The initial design was for the duration of 3 years (2010-2012) and approximately US$ 8.9 million was committed for that period (Table 1). Recently the CCCA programme and thus its TF have been extended to 2014, with additional donor commitments being made (details to be finalized). Table 1.

The CCCA program supports capacity building and institutional strengthening which are implemented by a grant facility. Initially grant components are focused on building resilience to climate change in coastal areas, and strengthening climate change awareness, and education as well as public information. Grants are provided to deliver five main outputs as agreed in the existing project document, including: \u2022 Result 1: Improved capacity to coordinate national policy making, capacity development, outreach/advocacy efforts, and to monitor the implementation of national climate change strategy, policy and plans. \u2022 Result 2: Improved access to updated climate change information, knowledge and learning opportunities at all levels. \u2022 Result 3: Strengthened capacity within the NCCC to mobilize and to effectively administer climate change funds and to prepare for a nationally owned trust fund. \u2022 Result 4: Increased resilience of coastal communities and ecosystems to climate change through adaptation planning, demonstrated targeted local interventions and provision of practical learning experience in adaptation planning to the NCCC. \u2022 Result 5: Strengthened capacity in government agencies and civil society organizations for developing and implementing climate change response initiatives in line with agreed national climate change priorities, independently or in partnerships, through access to new financial and technical resources. The grants approved by the Programme Support Board will be executed by relevant key line ministries, agencies and civil society organization, with technical support provided by international development partners as required. The grants provided for adaptation in coastal areas (Result 4) will be implemented by DHI Water Environment Health (formerly known as Danish Hydraulic Institute).

The present is for three years but the Program is planned for a long-term commitment by the government and donors. The Management of the CCCA Trust Fund Project Cycle The CCCA Trust Fund finances climate change projects that respond to key priorities defined in the CCCA Programme Document, the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) Update 2009-2013, the National Adaptation Programme of Action to Climate Change (NAPA), and other relevant official documents. The Trust Fund Secretariat presents to the PSB, on an annual basis, resources required for grants in the form of Annual Work Plan, based on the funds available in the Trust Fund and the potential supplies and demands identified as well as the implementation capacity for the Trust Fund Secretariat. The CCCA Trust Fund applies \u2018\u2019calls for proposals\u2019\u2019 as a method of soliciting grant proposals from eligible parties. The Trust Fund Secretariat designs a call for proposals document and obtains an approval of the PSB on the scope and target amount before launching it in national newspapers. The Trust Fund Secretariat develops CCCA Grants Application Guidelines, which will inform the parties interested in accessing CCCA Trust Fund on specific requirements and conditions as per UNDP rules and regulations. The Guidelines also provides templates for preparing a concept note/full proposal. The Trust Fund Secretariat may design a call for proposals, which targets only a particular group of applicants (e.g. Government institutions only) or specific geographical area/priority sector depending on the demands.The maximum value of CCCA grants approved is US$300,000 per project (US$150,000 in case of NGO applicants). The CCCA Trust Fund, in principle, appraises grant proposals in two-step process: Concept Note and Full Project Proposal appraisals. \u2022 Concept Note Appraisal. Applicants are given 3-5 weeks (depending on the nature of the call) to prepare concept notes in accordance with the templates provided in the Grants Application Guidelines. Preparation time for concept note development may be adjusted depending on the capacities of targeted applicant groups or complexity of the call for proposals. Concept notes first undergo administrative screening by the Trust Fund Secretariat for eligibility compliance and documentation completeness. The Trust Fund Secretariat engages services of independent experts, on contract with UNDP, to conduct technical appraisal of concept notes that have passed the administrative screening, using the evaluation criteria provided by the Trust Fund Secretariat. Upon conclusion of expert appraisal, the Trust Fund Secretariat will convene the CCTT meeting where the independent expert representative will present results and findings from the technical appraisal to the CCTT members and issues are debated.

UNDP will require a quarterly workplan and a fund request form from each grantee before disbursing the first installment. Templates for these forms will be provided to grantees as soon as the PSB makes decision on project proposals. UNDP will also conduct a brief capacity assessment of the grantees using UNDP standard checklists. Subsequent disbursement of funds is triggered by submission of quarterly report and workplan to the Trust Fund Secretariat, which will certify these documents and transmit them to UNDP to disburse the funds. Monitoring and Evaluation The CCCA Program with the Trust Fund Secretariat will be monitored in accordance with UNDP\u2019s rules and procedures, and in line with the provisions in the Statement of Cooperation among Development Partners. Monitoring progress will be based on the indicators in a log frame stated in the project document signed at the beginning of the program. The Head of the Trust Fund Secretariat will provide quarterly progress reports which after endorsement by the PSB is submitted to the Chair of the NCCC and the development partners. The Annual report will summarize the progress of implementation for the full year till December 31 and be sub mitted by the UNDP Country Office, following UNDP\u2019s quality assurance procedures to each partner donor. Grantees of the CCCA Trust Fund (Government agencies and civil society organizations) will submit quarterly narrative and financial progress reports to the TF Secretariat. These reports will be consolidated by the TF Secretariat and presented to the next PSB meeting, following UNDP quality assurance. A Joint Programme Review will take place annually. The purpose of the Joint Reviews is to assess progress and ensure that the program remains focused and in line with agreements between the government and development partners. The deliberations during the Annual Review will be based on the Annual Report. The Annual Review is concluded with formal minutes agreed between government and the development partners. Lessons learned The CCCA Trust Fund is one of the national climate funds that were established to pool external resources to finance climate actions in developing countries. Other similar trust funds for climate change include: Indonesia Climate Change Trust Fund (ICCTF), Bangladesh Climate Resilience Trust Fund and Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund. These funds were established as an immediate attempt to access climate finance to finance the implementation climate actions, therefore, their objectives focus mostly on pooling financial resources provided by development partners and channeling them to intended beneficiaries including government agencies, NGOs, universities and local communities. These funds are managed as sinking funds, where all committed funds should be disbursed within an agreed time frame. A sinking fund is relatively easy to set up especially when an international development partner will serve as the TF manager. However, impacts and outreach are likely limited because of the lack of innovative sources of funding tapped into, and the single financial instrument (grant modality) being applied. Therefore, the sustainability of the fund beyond the agreed project timeframe is in question. Especially for such sinking funds, it is important to realize their function in time and their limitations. Most of these newly established national climate funds assign multilateral agencies as the fund managers or administrators. The CCCA Trust Fund is administered by UNDP, which is similar to the ICCTF, while the World Bank is currently managing the Bangladesh Climate Resilience Trust Fund. Assigning multilateral agencies in managing the funds can be considered an immediate stepping-stone where a country can start receiving financial resources, which will be", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f0d99abc-83b6-49a5-a18a-7949ccee7c85": {"__data__": {"id_": "f0d99abc-83b6-49a5-a18a-7949ccee7c85", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-cambodia-climate-change-alliance-trust-fund", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National Climate Fund Case Study Report: Cambodia Climate Change Alliance Trust Fund", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-cambodia-climate-change-alliance-trust-fund", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2192c57196532fb184148a0b21fdbf64394c54c8e3c4beb3868a3c2d1679e133"}}, "hash": "2192c57196532fb184148a0b21fdbf64394c54c8e3c4beb3868a3c2d1679e133", "text": "managed according to internationally accepted standards. At the same time, country public finance systems and capacity need to be further developed over time, which should result in a gradual increase in the use of country systems to access and manage international public climate finance. 8 Case Study Report: Cambodia Climate Change Alliance Trust Fund The CCCA Trust Fund, for instance, aims to develop the capacity of the government so that the management of the fund can be transferred to a country system after three years of the establishment. Transferring the management of a fund into a country system requires an agreed timeframe and a strong political commitment. The nationalization process of a trust fund can be learned from the Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation (BTFEC), a trust fund established to support conservation in Bhutan. The BTEFC was nationalized after five years of the establishment of the fund. This process was made possible because the Royal Charter, which governs the management of the fund, clearly instructed that the process of nationalization of the BTFEC should be completed in five years after the establishment.

To provide a technical input to the knowledge sharing, UNDP commissioned seven case studies on existing national funds in the fields of environment, conservation, energy, climate change and development. This paper reports the lessons learned extracted from the establishment and management of the China Clean Development Mechanism Fund (CCDMF), which is one of seven national funds across the Asia-Pacific region selected as a case study.1 The CCDMF is selected to provide an interesting case for countries in Asia-Pacific due to the following characteristics: 1. The role of the CCDMF within the overall climate finance architecture in China \u2013 As of the end of 2011, the CCDMF managed RMB 10 billion with the granting and investment portfolio of approximately RMB 285 million (US$ 4.5 million) and RMB 1.6 billion (US$ 253 million) respectively. Considering the amount of resources invested in energy efficiency, renewable energy and environmental protection by the Chinese central government (around RMB 170 billion in 2012),2the CCDMF should play a strategic role in overall climate finance in China to be of added value. The CCDMF is currently focusing on leveraging private sector engagement and supporting policy research and capacity building in addressing climate change in China. 2. The source of capital \u2013 The source of capital of the CCDMF, which is injected regularly by government levies collected from CDM projects, is a unique example of an innovative source of revenue for financing climate actions. The collection of the levies from CDM projects was mainly driven by the intention of the government to prevent industries from producing excessive HFC (to generate certified emission reductions), particularly considering the magnitude of CDM HFC-23 projects in China. The revenues collected are specifically earmarked to finance climate actions in the country. 3. Innovative programs funded by the CCDMF to leverage more resources - The revenue collected by the CCDMF is used mostly to finance investment programs to leverage additional resources from the private sector and to test out innovative financial and economic instruments to support actions to address climate change. Another endeavor is conducted together with commercial banks through a wealth management program to promote investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy. This report provides the summary of the overall design of the CCDMF and a short description about the process of the establishment and the management of the CCDMF.

Of particular importance is the magnitude of CDM HFC-23 projects in China, hosting 11 out of 19 CDM HFC-23 projects worldwide. Certified Emission Reductions acquired by phasing out HFC-23, whose Global Warming Potential (GWP) is 11,700, are therefore significant. To avoid industries benefiting excessively from phasing out HFC-23, the government is applying levies to CDM HFC projects in China and also other types of CDM projects with a lesser extent. Channeling revenues collected from CDM projects through the traditional budget system would make it difficult to track the use of the revenues, as they would become part of the overall state budget. There were concerns that this could become subject to international criticism of using CDM projects to generate state revenues. The idea of the establishment of the CCDMF therefore came up following the meeting between Ministry of Finance, National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ministry of Science and Technology. Managing the revenues collected from CDM projects through the CCDMF is a way to ensure that the government allocates the collected levies to address climate change issues in the country. The CCDMF serves specific purposes in the overall climate finance architecture in China. The CCDMF specifically provides support for policy studies and leverage private sector contributions and investments in climate mitigation and adaptation projects in China. Three main strategic focuses of the CCDMF in supporting climate actions in China are: 1. Providing immediate supports for line ministries to conduct policy studies, international negotiation, capacity building and public awareness. The CCDMF provides specific support through its granting program for line ministries to carry out the aforementioned activities, which are considered as immediate actions to be implemented to address climate change. 2. Piloting innovative economic and financial instruments to reduce risks and remove market barriers in climate investments. The Ministry of Finance is then expected to allocate state budget to support the application of cost effective instruments that have been proven well functioning to address climate change at the national level. 3. Exploring and developing new models for bridging between public and private actors to leverage more capital support for China\u2019s efforts in combating and adapting to climate change. The fund positions itself as a policy institution that integrates government and market functions and pursues direct cooperation with business partners in the market to address issues of climate change. The legal status The CCDMF is a public institution that is affiliated with the Ministry of Finance. The CCDMF Management Center, which is running the day-to-day activities related to the collection, management and use of the CDM fund, is subject to the supervision of the Ministry of Finance. The Board of CCDMF is an interministerial body, which reviews the strategic planning and the regulation of the fund. (See discussion on the governing body of the CCDMF in detail in the next section). 5 Case Study Report: China Clean Development Mechanism Fund As a public fund, the CCDMF adopts market-oriented operation model and cooperates closely with companies and commercial financial institutions. As an innovative climate financing mechanism, the China CDM Fund will combine government fund, international assistance and social funding and serve as a platform for financing, action, cooperation and information gathering and exchange. The model: a revolving fund The CCDMF is a revolving fund that receives regular capital injection from levies collected by the government on CDM projects in China. Other possible sources of revenues are donations from international and domestic institutions, fiscal allocation and operating revenue of the fund. As of now, the revenues mostly come from the levies on CDM projects, which are totaling approximately RMB 10 Billion as of the end of 2011 from a total of 800 CDM projects currently receiving certified emission reductions (CERs). The rates of levies applied to CDM projects in China are: - 65 percent of levy on CER transfer benefit from HFC projects - 30 percent of levy on CER transfer benefit from nitrous oxide (N2O) projects related to adipic acid production - 10 percent of levy on CER transfer benefit from N2O projects related to the production of nitric acid - 5 percent of levy on CER transfer benefit from perfluorocarbons (PFC) projects - 2 percent of levy on CER transfer benefit from other CDM projects. To understand the composition of the revenue from the government levies of CDM projects, out of the total RMB 10 billion (US$ 1.5 billion) of the levies collected by the end", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c8db6e77-51af-4db1-9e1d-b137afbe5eb7": {"__data__": {"id_": "c8db6e77-51af-4db1-9e1d-b137afbe5eb7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-china-clean-development-mechanism-fund", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National Climate Fund Case Study Report: China Clean Development Mechanism Fund", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-china-clean-development-mechanism-fund", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "69b8c8a68f0a90dbc67677b10b88134ba2c718adf47c6e835a56bf24a0b7b3f2"}, "3": {"node_id": "7a23c53c-253a-4b64-8cac-d23721a8cd30", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-china-clean-development-mechanism-fund", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6c4afb1528a9ac01d2e48b11bf3edb0ad190149c41359a1c18115a546271565d"}}, "hash": "eefbb86e34b68754d210fff67ab62d154e8ee7acd3a972ded5c931d7b8283b6c", "text": "of 2011, the HFC and the N2O projects made up the highest portion of the collected revenue, which was 89.2 percent and 9.3 percent respectively. The remaining CDM projects only contributed to around 1.5 percent to the overall revenue. Using a portion of the total revenues collected, the CCDMF implements investment projects to support industrial activities to pursue climate mitigation projects. The investment projects include approaches such as equity investment, entrusted loans, financing guarantees and other government-approved approaches. The return of the investments then allows the CCDMF to provide grants and finance climate-related efforts in China, particularly for line ministries dealing directly with the issues of climate change. Grant projects cannot be financed by the CCDMF main capital. Various programs currently implemented by the CCDMF can be summarized below (Figure 1): 1. Grant Projects \u2013 in 2008, the CCDMF launched its first 14 grant projects, totaling of RMB 25 million (US$ 3.9 million). The projects mainly focus on policy studies, research and public campaign on climate change. In 2011, another 125 grant projects were prepared for launching, with a total amount of RMB 260 million (US$ 41 million). The projects will formulate climate action plans and compilation of GHG inventories in all provinces in China as well as to develop carbon trade pilots in five provinces and others. 2. Investment projects \u2013 directly working with Chinese enterprises, as of the end of 2011, the CCDMF has provided concessional loans for 32 projects to reduce emissions in 14cities and provinces in China. From these projects, the CCDMF have leveraged RMB 9.5 billion (US$ 1.5 billion) from the total investment made by the CCDMF of RMB 1.6 billion (US$ 253 million). 3. Wealth Management \u2013 for the surplus capital, the CCDMF pursue risk-free wealth management such as making deposits in commercial banks. The CCDMF is not allowed to invest in stocks, stock-investing mutual funds, real estate, futures and other financial derivatives. Another form of wealth management activity pursued by the CCDMF is a contract-based cooperation model with commercial banks where it can leverage contributions from commercial banks for energy conservation and emission reduction projects. The CCDMF is working with the China Zheshang Bank and Industrial Bank respectively in the area of wealth management for clean development, which attract 100 percent additional commercial capital to support China\u2019s climate efforts. 6 Case Study Report: China Clean Development Mechanism Fund The CCDMF currently has a rough planning for the portion of financial resources allocated for grants, investments and those r cash.

However, projects with the total value of lower than RMB 70 million will be approved by the CCDMF. The CCDMF has more decision power for reviewing and approving investment projects, since the investment projects usually face more financial risks, therefore, expertise in project selection of investment projects is required to mitigate such risks. The CCDMF needs to ensure the money put into the investment projects is recovered and if possible with some interests. The establishment process of the CCDMF3 The process of the establishment of the CCDMF was started in 2005 following to the decision that the revenues from the CERs generated by CDM projects in China should be shared between the government and project implementers. Following after the announcement on the percentages of levies to be collected on CDM projects in September 2005, the Ministry of Finance then took the lead in the preparation work for establishing the CCDMF, which was also joined by the NDRC, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Science and Technology. The preparation took over a year with a joint effort of several ministries. Technical assistance was also provided by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help the CCDMF design the governance structure, compiling the basic regulations, improving management capability and others. In May 2006, a joint application for establishing the CCDMF and its Management Center was submitted jointly by the Ministry of Finance, the NDRC, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Science and Technology to the State Council. In August 2006, an official approval was signed by principal leaders. In March 2007, the Management Center of the CCDMF was registered at State Administration of Public Institution Registration. Soon after, the CCDMF officially opened its exclusive account. During the first meeting of the China CDM Board in 2007, the work on formulating rules and regulations of the CCDMF was officially launched. In the same month, the fund started its business operation and received its first national revenue inflow. In October 2008, ADB funded another technical assistance project for capacity building, including formulating rules, regulations and administrative 3 The facts presented in this Section draws heavily from an ADB report on the CCDMF (2012) 8 Case Study Report: China Clean Development Mechanism Fund manuals, designing and building IT systems, training staff, carrying out publicity activities at home and abroad and others. In the same year, the Board of China CDM Fund approved the first batch of 14 grant projects. The establishment process of the CCDMF took 3 years from the initiation of the idea to the launch of the first batch of grant projects. The up-scaling of the CCDMF portfolio accelerated following the issuance of the Measures for Management of China Clean Development Mechanism Fund in 2010, which is approximately five years following the formulation of the idea of establishing the CCDMF. The Measures, which was promulgated by the decree of seven ministries sitting in the Management Board, regulates an overall business blueprint for the fund including the administrative organizations and its responsibilities, fund raising, and fund utilization. The management of the CCDMF Grant projects The CCDMF currently applies a top-down approach in the selection of grant projects. To date, the calls for proposals have been limited to institutions affiliated to line ministries currently sitting in the Management Board. The government aims to balance transparency and efficiency in screening project proposals to be funded by the CCDMF. The existing approach is considered efficient because these ministries have the mandate to deal with climate change issues and are considered as the most knowledgeable to develop climate related projects. The CCDMF realized that the granting mechanism has just newly established and improvement is required, however, the CCDMF may not go for a public-wide call for proposals in the future, instead a guideline will be develop for screening proposals submitted by line ministries. The guideline, which will be developed in consultation with line ministries, will identify the priorities to be supported by the CCDMF. The size of grant projects ranges between RMB 200,000 to RMB 6 million. Projects usually have a duration of one to two years.

Following the satisfactory acceptance of the reports and the monitoring results, the second payment will then be disbursed. During the closing of the project, the NDRC will also check the results achieved, while the CCDMF will conduct financial audit. If all is found satisfactory, the final payment of 20 percent will be released. The grant projects mostly aim to support research and policy studies. These are therefore relatively simple in terms of project implementation since these normally do not involve complex and/or large scale procurement of goods and equipment. Project outputs are to be completed within the time frame agreed upon with the respective line ministries. 9 Case Study Report: China Clean Development Mechanism Fund Investment projects The CCDMF currently implements and explores three main programs for its investment projects, including: Concessional loans. In cooperation with local governments, commercial banks and large scale state-owned enterprises, the Management Center provides eligible companies with concessional loans with a rate lower than the interest rate of the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBC). The CCDMF has launched the concessional lending model in cooperation with local governments in 14 cities and provinces including Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Hunan, Fujian, Jiangsu, Shangdong and Jiangxi, and after coming into production, the projects are estimated to reduce emission of greenhouse gases by 10 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) annually. The transfer of money for concessional loans will be made 100 percent upon the signing. The CCDMF will make timely and accurate statements about the financial status, the results of capital utilization, and return on assets of investment projects according to the general accounting principles. The project implementer should use the capital based on the content, the purpose, and the timetable of the project set in the contract. At the end of the project, the center will assess the project\u2019s capital utilization, return of capital and project performance, and submit the assessment to relevant administrative authorities and the Board of the CCDMF. Equity investment. Equity investment is money that is invested in a firm by owing common stock (ordinary shares). Investors recover its money only when they sell their shareholdings to other investors, or when the assets of the firm are liquidated and proceeds distributed among them after satisfying the firm\u2019s obligations.4 The CCDMF is one of the largest shareholders of the Shanghai Environment and Energy Exchange. This marks the start of the CCDMF\u2019s equity investment, as well as its participation in domestic carbon market planning and development. Risk guarantee, the Management Center is currently exploring business model for financing guarantee together with professional guarantee agencies. For instance, the CCDMF is currently examining a Partial Risk Guarantee (PRG) for specific investments in energy efficiency (together with International Finance Corporation and ADB). PRGs usually cover private lenders against the risk of failing to perform its obligations with respect to a project. PRGs ensure payment in the case of default resulting from the nonperformance of contractual obligations. PRGs typically cover outstanding principal and accrued interest of a debt tranche in full. Payment is made only if the debt service default is caused by risks specified under the guarantee.5 The monitoring and evaluation The recipients of grant projects should implement the projects in accordance to the contract and to guidance from the NDRC, the Management Center and the respective line ministry. These institutions will be responsible for supervising and inspecting the project implementation. All grant projects should submit two reports (mid-term and final reports). Payment will then be made subject to clearance of the submitted reports. For investment projects, the Department of investment within the CCDMF will monitor the investment projects. Every year, local governments will send a report covering both the financial and technical performance of the projects. Irregularities in the implementation process will be penalized and punished by the NDRC and the Ministry of Finance pursuant to relevant regulations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b9dc2fd1-c3ee-405a-a991-4e0d1ec25c35": {"__data__": {"id_": "b9dc2fd1-c3ee-405a-a991-4e0d1ec25c35", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-china-clean-development-mechanism-fund", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National Climate Fund Case Study Report: China Clean Development Mechanism Fund", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-china-clean-development-mechanism-fund", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca99a708a3b47238454d3facd9f61ae9cc4f09ae5a744fa559a384c0cc557a67"}, "2": {"node_id": "9ff264b2-6223-49d4-ab29-309b3d113a77", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-china-clean-development-mechanism-fund", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b195752720695d95f4840eddb1d51be24dff98ca0e1c87845623b1f143feaa1f"}}, "hash": "1ed433b5e62c819ae4357645d01156d18d21785b2ad6c03e7fffc777a5e70919", "text": "4 Source: http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/equity-investment.html 5See more examples of the Partial Risk Guarantee on: http://web.worldbank.org/external/default/main?theSitePK=3985219&pagePK=64143534&contentMDK=20260268&menuPK=64143504&piPK=6414 3448 10 Case Study Report: China Clean Development Mechanism Fund A database for all project outputs is maintained.

More importantly, the Fund has implemented several investment projects to generate contributions from the private sector and to test financial and economic instruments to ensure cost- effective approaches to address issues of climate change in China. The CCDMF focuses particularly on leveraging private sector engagement to finance climate actions by bridging between the government and the market. This focus will ensure the CCDMF to play a long-term role in the China\u2019s climate finance because national budget support cannot cover all the cost of green and low carbon development both in short term and long term, therefore various financial sources, especially those from the private sector, are required. The CCDMF therefore plays the functions of: (1) creating new efficient financing instruments/approaches for the government, which could be followed by public budget in order to enhance its efficiency; (2) attracting financial sources from private sectors to be involved in green and low carbon activities. The source of capital The case of the CCDMF provides an example of innovative sources of capital to finance climate actions and investments in a country. The levies collected from CDM projects in China was mainly driven by the government\u2019s intention to regulate CDM projects so that industries are not encouraged to produce more waste in order to obtain more CERs. By applying the levies particularly on the HFC and N2O projects, the government aims to regulate the behavior of relevant industries and at the same time it generates revenues for the government that can be further allocate to address climate change. Applying the same principle can also help other countries to identify the potential sources of capital for financing climate actions. The source of capital for a national fund needs to be sustainable at least to cover the operational costs of a fund. If the magnitude of resources collected is not as significant as what is needed to address climate change, the fund can focus specifically on leveraging contributions from the private sector or other potential sources. To further increase the amount of capital, the CCDMF allocates most of its resources investment projects, while grant projects are financed only by the interests generated from the CCDMF operations. This approach ensures that the total amount of capital will not be depleted. Innovative programs The CCDMF has been very active in exploring potential financial or economic instruments to find cost-effective programs in climate actions. As previously mentioned, several instruments are currently implemented and explored are: concessional loans, equity investment and financial risk guarantee. The application of these instruments is important not only to leverage more resources but also to change behaviors of particular stakeholders. - Concessional loans and equity. By providing a seed money (in the form of a soft loan) for a project proposed by a Chinese enterprise, the CCDMF can leverage larger contribution from the company for specific projects addressing climate change in 11 Case Study Report: China Clean Development Mechanism Fund China. For instance, by providing RMB 50 million to a company (assuming 20% of the total capital for the energy efficiency project), the project can leverage additional RMB 200 million (the remaining 80% of the capital) from the company. - Financial risk guarantee. The fund covers creditors for specified risks arising of a particular project. One possible form is loss- sharing agreement between the fund and a bank or a firm in which the CCDMF will reimburse it for a portion of the principal losses incurred in a portfolio of eligible assets. This will help firms to lessen the burden that may generate from the risks of pursuing projects in climate mitigation and adaptation. The uses of these different programmatic instruments will depend entirely on the intended beneficiaries. While the above instruments are useful to engage the private sector in financing climate change actions, there is also a need to provide financial assistance for stakeholders at the community level to address climate change, which may require a different approach. Therefore, a national fund for climate change should be innovative in developing instruments to be financed considering specific characteristics of beneficiaries.

To provide a technical input to the knowledge sharing, UNDP commissioned seven case studies on existing national funds in the fields of environment, conservation, energy, climate change and development. Thispaper reports the lessons learned extracted from the establishment and management of the Lao Environmental Protection Fund (EPF), which is one of seven national funds across the Asia-Pacific region selected as a case study.1 The EPF is selected to provide an interesting case for countries in Asia-Pacific due to the following characteristics: 1. The existing structure of the EPF that managesboth endowment and sinking funds. The EPF received a US$ 5.7 million loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which is then invested as an endowment fund to generate interests to finance the operation costs of the EPF. The World Bank also provided US$ 7 million for a grantproject that is managed as a sinking fund, where the entire amount of the grant will be disbursed to intended beneficiaries within a certain period of time. The existing structure of the fund allows the EPF to receive and manage different types of financial resources (both in the form of an endowment and a sinking fund) for environmental protection in Laos. 2. The capacity to meet international standards in financial integrity and social environment safeguards.Having the experience to manage a grant project financed by the World Bank, the EPF has proven its capacity to meet the World Bank\u2019s standards in financial integrity and social environment safeguards. With the established system and the capacity of staff to administer a fund according to theinternational standards, the EPF can serve as an intermediary to channel financial resources provided by development partners to intended beneficiaries in Lao PDR. 3. The provision of reaching local beneficiaries to provide financial support in environmental protection. Specific windowswere created under the EPF where priorities of granting programs are set, including providing financial assistance to beneficiaries at the local level. The uptake of grants provided for local beneficiaries (including NGOs and local governments) hasbeen significantdue to continuous support provided by the EPF for beneficiaries to access grants through training, assistance in developing project proposal and simplification of reporting mechanisms. This report provides the summary of the overall design of the EPF and ashort description about the process of the establishment and the management of the EPF. A brief analysis of the lessons-learned from the establishment and management of the EPF are then presented.The case study analysis involved: literature review to set the scope of the study and in-depth interviews with relevant stakeholders: 1) the Fund Manager and Staff from the EPF; 2) board members: the Ministry of Finance (Deputy Director General, International Cooperation), and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (Director General, Department of Environmental Quality and Pollution Control); 3) development partners: ADB and the World Bank; and 4) beneficiaries: representatives from National University of Lao, Khammuane Province, Wildlife Conservation Society, and the Biodiversity Association.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01a95a29-411d-4b22-94c1-75ac21680215": {"__data__": {"id_": "01a95a29-411d-4b22-94c1-75ac21680215", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-environmental-protection-fund-lao-pdr", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National Climate Fund Case Study Report: Environmental Protection Fund in Lao PDR", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-environmental-protection-fund-lao-pdr", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "266acbd0faff3700cd68ece373c8d7b1fbc44a9a7c9320502c09934ef12400ed"}, "2": {"node_id": "01538399-c164-412b-87ee-a2f4b31f58a4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-environmental-protection-fund-lao-pdr", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "980fd83ce5062d41426400e38f5a6acb73fd9e31e8bfedeec1e19e46a5f70843"}}, "hash": "780c90c4e3cc255952736b7704fb51c8e225276a7f9b698db36b72b6cd66ed6d", "text": "Prior to finalization, the report has been reviewed by the EPF team and the UNDP Lao Country Office. 1 National funds selected for the case study analysis are: Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation, China CMD Fund, Cambodia Climate Change Alliance Trust Fund, Thailand Energy Conservation Promotion Fund, Lao Environmental Protection Fund, Micronesian Conservation Trust and Tuvalu Trust Fund: http://www.snap-undp.org/elibrary/default.aspx 4 Case Study Report: Lao Environmental Protection Fund", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "31caf2f3-921d-48c9-b7e4-ac2f6ccacd6f": {"__data__": {"id_": "31caf2f3-921d-48c9-b7e4-ac2f6ccacd6f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-environmental-protection-fund-lao-pdr", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National Climate Fund Case Study Report: Environmental Protection Fund in Lao PDR", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-environmental-protection-fund-lao-pdr", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e6b231722806cca2863119044b5a5fb3d82088a3e0ca752b836e7851d42fbcc9"}, "3": {"node_id": "e52df4cd-9375-4d86-ad75-5ae2ea7d6316", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-environmental-protection-fund-lao-pdr", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d557e2108eef0b29f725c1e007d8e783a3d1d3786ebde573d33f642243dab2c9"}}, "hash": "4538eece19a7034095fd476e6d6d942d318e632215aa57a2bec1edf2c513b511", "text": "The design of the EPF at a glance The role of the EPF in financing environmental protection in Lao PDR The assessment of the role of the EPF in overall environmental finance in Lao PDR has been constrained by lack of quantitative data on government spending in environment protection.It is therefore problematic to understand the magnitude of financial resources managed by the EPF compared to the overall spending on environmental protection in the country. The latest available data on the spending in environment in 2005 showed that the annual public environment expenditure was LAK 19 billion (approximately US$ 2.4 million). As a comparison, the total grants provided to beneficiaries by the EPF in 2006-2010 were US$ 3.4 million.This comparison, however, should be conducted with caution as the figure of total public environment expenditure may have changed in the recent years. During interviews with the stakeholders, it was mentioned that the government budget has mainly been used to finance government administrative costs including civil service wages. This means that the investment and capital spending in environment are mainly financed by external sources. The role of the EPF is very specific and unique as it provides direct financial assistance to local stakeholders, including local governments, NGOs, universities, and local communities, in biodiversity conservation, pollution control, water resources management and sustainable land resources management. Throughout the interviews with stakeholder in Lao PDR, this specific role has been highly appreciated as the EPF\u2019s main contribution to environmental management in the country. The legal status The EPF has been established as an autonomous organization, both financially and administratively, operating under the laws in Lao PDR. The EPF was established through the issuance of Prime Ministers Decree 146 in2005 aiming at strengthening environmental protection, sustainable natural resources management, biodiversity conservation and community development in Lao PDR. Under the existing legal status, the EPF can absorb all kinds of contributions from donors and the private sector, although it cannot access a direct fiscal transfer from line ministries due to its off-budget nature.The EPF is also not under the government monitoring system and procedures. The rules and standards of the EPF\u2019s fund management are regulated by the EPF Charter and its Operations Manual. The fund is currently housed within the Prime MinisterOffice. The Deputy Prime Minister, who is the Chairman of the Board of Directors (BoD), takes lead of the overall fund, while the Director of the Executive Office (EO) has the authority to sign-off for all expenditure items for which the Chairman of the BoDhas approved. All expenditures are made in line with the Operations Manual and audit requirements. Regular sixmonthly plans and reports are submitted to the BoD for records and approval (See the Governing Body and Beneficiaries section for details on the roles of the BoDand the Director of the EO). The EPF model According to the EPF Decree, the five main sources of income for the EPF are: national and international endowment funds; national taxes or levies from environment and natural resources; contributions by development projects; contributions by business and private sector and interests generated by EPF capital. The EPF is also authorized to receive transfers from revenues that may be generated from environmental and natural resources fees, such as wastewater discharge fees, pollution fees, and eco-tourism surcharges.As of today, the main sources of EPF income are contributions from development partners and businesses as well as the interests generated from the endowment fund.Income sources of the EPF are shown in Table 1. 5 Case Study Report: Lao Environmental Protection Fund Table 1 EPF income 2006-10 Sources of income US$ LAK (million)2 Grant 7,023,000 56,184 World Bank sinking fund 7,000,000 56,000 UNESCO sinking fund 23,000 184 ADB endowment fund 5,798,194 46,386 Contributions from businesses 265,878 2,127 Interest from the capital 896,756 7,174 Total 13,983,828 111,871 The EPF is currently managing two different types of funds: endowment and sinking funds.

The EPF has not hired a fund manager due to the limited value of the endowment fund. Only when the endowment fund exceeds US$ 10 million,it is regarded justified for the EPF to hire a fund manager so that the minimum return can offset the overhead costs of hiring the manager. The EPF currently manages a sinking fund, which is funded by a US$ 7 million grant from the World Bank Environment and Social (LENS) Project. The grant should be channeled to intended beneficiaries, including government agencies, NGOs and communities, for:mainstreaming environmental and social safeguards in infrastructure development, strengthening biodiversity conservation in Central Laos, and increasing the publics knowledge of and support for environmental management. To manage this grant project, the EPF created two specific windows to channel the grants to intended beneficiaries, which will be discussed in detail below. Three possible instruments that can be used by the EPF to providefinancial support in the field of environmental protection in Lao PDR are non-refundable grants, loans with low interest for environment management (i.e. wastewater treatment, recycling process) and subsidies.As of now, the EPF has only channelled financial resources through grants underfive windows that were created to set the scope of priorities areas to be financed. The windows are: \u2022 Window 1: Policy implementation and capacity enhancement (PICE). \u2022 Window 2: Biodiversity and community investment (CBI). \u2022 Window 3: Pollution Control. \u2022 Window 4: Water Resources Management. \u2022 Window 5: Sustainable Land Resources Management. The first two windows (PICE and CBI) were created to channel the World Bank grant to intended beneficiaries, while the other three windows are financed by the interests generated from the endowment fund (Figure 1). In 2006-2010, projects implemented under the 2Note: US$ 1 = LAK 8,000 6 Case Study Report: Lao Environmental Protection CBI and PICE windows were 105 and 47 projects respectively with the total amount of approximately US$ 3 million,representing per cent of the total grant.

Fiduciary standard Three main elements of the fiduciary standards set by the EPF Operations Manual are discussed below,including those related to financial management, procurement and audit. Financial management - The EO applies a basic computerized accounting system with chart of accounts to provide sufficient financial information for managing and monitoring project activities by windows, projects or components, procurement categories and clients. The accounting system is in compliant with government structures but also capable to produce financial monitoring reports, annual financial statements and statutory requirements in a format agreed and acceptable to the Board of Directors and respective donors. Procurement -the procurement guidelines and procedures included in the Operations Manualare customized from the government procurement regulations and were tailored to fit both Government Procedures and Donor requirements. The following standards and procedures applied for the EPF procurement: \u2022 EPF-level Procurement: All procurement for the operation and management of the Executive Office of the EPF follows standard Government procurement procedures to be conducted by the Procurement Officer of the Executive Office. \u2022 Project Level Procurement: All principal procurement for all projects is conducted by the Executive Office. If considered appropriate, procurement activities are delegated to implementing partners according to the project agreement. \u2022 Community Participation in Procurement: Based on the proposals and budgets prepared with the assistance by the EPF staff and local governments, the most efficient procurement process is determined considering the capacity and capability of the villagers. \u2022 Procurement under Specialized Financing Windows: If requested by a donor agencysupporting a special financing window, different procurement methods haveto be agreed between the EPF and the donor agency. The procedures will be formulated in a separate document to be approved by the EPF BoD. Audit \u2013 the EPF has to go through an annual independent financial auditof the finances, financial administration, and operations of the EPF. The Executive Office ishiring an independent external auditing firm to prepare the audit, in accordance with generally accepted international auditing practices and standards. The audit includes a review of all EPF bank accounts, a review of the internal accounting and operations of the specialized financing windows administered by the Executive Office, a review of the investment activities undertaken by the asset manager of the EPF and others. 8 Case Study Report: Lao Environmental Protection Fund The establishment process of the EPF The establishment of the EPF was initiated as one of the conditions of the ADB Environment and Social Program (ESP) program loan (US$ 20 million) to the Government of Lao PDR. The program loan, which waswasapproved in 2001, aimed to support the policy reform agenda of the Government of Lao PDR for improved environmental management and social safeguards in the energy and transport sectors. Twenty conditions were set for the release of the loan tranches, including: strengthening national policy and the regulation framework for environmental and social safeguards and enhancing policy implementation measures and capacity of the provinces and sectors in environmental management. The condition for the third (final) tranche included the establishment of a national environment fund, which should materializeafter 36 months of the loan utilization. The government was required to establish the fund through the issuance of the prime minister\u2019s decree, the appointment of members of board of directors and the director of the executive office, and the approval of fund charter (including the authorization to set up bank accounts locally and overseas and the authorization to invest the funds by the BoD). In June 2005, the EPF was established by the issuance of Prime Ministers Decree 146. In November 2005, the Prime Minister issued the Decree 72/PM appointing the EPF board of directors, whilein January 2006 the EPF board adopted and approved the EPF charter.The establishment of the EPF was considered very prompt due to the government\u2019s commitment in meeting the conditions set by the development partners.

The management of the EPF Granting Program In 2006-2010, the EPF has received more than 400 proposals and provided grants to 202 proposals submitted by the central and local agencies, the mass organizations and civil society, community based organizations and others. The grants were provided under the five windows,amounting of US$ 3.4 million with the average total value of around US$ 28,000 per project. The allocation of grants under the EPF is guided by Five-Year Strategic Programs, which provide direction, focus, and priority to the allocation of the resources of the EPF. The Five-Year Strategic Program identifies key priority activities in the fields of: environmental protection, natural resources and biodiversity conservation, and pollution control. The Executive Director, with support of the BoD and the EO staff,is responsible for the preparation of the Five-Year Strategic Program. The program should also support key priorities identified in the National Strategy on Environment to the Years 2020 and Action Plan for the Years 2006-2010, the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, the Forestry Strategy and Action Plan, and other strategic programs. Moreover, annual planning documents also provide a direction for the allocation of the financial resources. The annual plan of action,which details the Five-Year Strategic Program,is approved by the BoD on an annual basis for each calendar year. Project proposals submitted by local governments should be developed based on provincial priorities and also aligned with the objectives of the EPF. The proposal can only be prepared following the approval of the concept note by local authorities. All project applications can be submitted to the Executive Office anytime.Prior to the submission of project applications, an initial discussion is usually conducted with all potential applicants, and the EPF will provide assistance in developing a proposal particularly when the capacity is found lacking. Small project proposals of up to LAK500million (or US$ 60,000) can be submitted in Lao with a standard application form, which is around five to six pages in length.Upon the submission of proposals, the Executive Director will reviewand decideupon within one month. Projects larger than LAK500million (or US$ 60,000) would require a more extensive proposal to be submitted in English.The Executive Office will follow a defined and transparent process for evaluating and selecting proposals using a standard formof proposal evaluation and assessment. See Figure 2 for the project selection process. 9 Case Study Report: Lao Environmental Protection Fund There has been no public-wide call for all proposals (including for grants financed by the World Bank), instead potential applicants are invited to submit project proposals depending on the availability of fund for a specific window. The reason of no public advertisement or call for proposal is due to the limitation of financial resources available to provide grants, particularly under the windows financed by the interests of the endowment fund. In practice, fund awarding is based on the proposal\u2019s expected outputs. However in 2012 the Director has decided to distribute equally the total fund allocated for the current fiscal year, which is decided by the BoD, to all provinces in Lao PDR. Provinces will implement the project for one year and then the EPF will assess the outcome of the projects. This approach is pursued with the intention to invest in developing the capacity of provincial governments in managing projects in the field of environmental protection. This approach focuses on assessing the results of project implementation, where the subsequent allocation of resources can be based on the performance of the provinces. Figure 2. The Sub-Project Application Process Source: EPF, 2011 10 Case Study Report: Lao Environmental Protection Fund The monitoring and evaluation EPF has developed its own information and database system to monitor the technical and financial implementation of all its funded projects and activities. Details on the M&E procedures are well defined in the Operations Manual. The Executive Office should prepare quarterly reports(within 30 days of the end of the quarter) and an annual financial report(within 3 months of the end of the period). The financial year of the EPF begins on October 1t and ends on September 30 of the following year All reports should be approved by the Board prior to the submission to the government, donor organizations and other stakeholders. The annual report will include at least: the status and activities of the EPF, the list of all projects and activities that have received EPF financial support, the financial status of the EPF. This report should be made available in the press media, the electronic media (radio and television), and in the Environment Newsletter of the Science, Technology and Environment Agency.

Since the capacity to write a progress report is still low amongst local stakeholders, the EPF arranges a stakeholder meeting periodically at the provincial level, where all beneficiaries receiving funds from the EPF will be invited. In the meeting, which is usually chaired by the Vice Governor, all beneficiaries will verbally report the progress of their projects. A representative from the EPF will then prepare a minutes of meeting where details of the verbal discussion will be noted down. Following the meeting, the minutes will be circulatedto all beneficiaries for them to agree on what is written, including the progress of the projects and their future action plans. Based on the agreed minutes, the EPF will conduct regular monitoring of project implementation. The EPF also has a number of facilitators working at the provincial level to oversee the technical progress of project implementation. Social and environment safeguard In the Operations Manual of the EPF, social and environment safeguard has been elaborated thoroughly. Procedures to ensure compliance with environmental and social safeguards regulations have been described in the EPF Environmental and Social Safeguard Framework (ESSF), which will be applied to all projects.The objective of the ESSF is to ensure that projects are designed to be beneficial to the environment and that negative environmental and social effects are minimized or avoided. The ESSF will also identify any negative effects and appropriate mitigation measures to be implemented as part of the project.In the case that possible environmental and social impacts are expected, a proper assessment will be conducted, according to the EPF Safeguard Framework and Lao PDR regulations. Lessons learned Different types of funds The case of the EPF has proven that it is beneficial to create a structure of a national fundthat can accommodate different types of funds. Due to its reliance on external support, the structure of the EPF allows it to serve as an institution that provides financial service particularly for donor agencies to delivertheir financial assistance to support environmental protection in Lao PDR. Many donors would prefer to channel their financial assistance in the form of a sinking fund, where the amount of resources should be spent entirely at the end of the project. Under the existing structure, the EPF can directly receive the financial assistance by a creating of a specific window under which the money can be managed according to rules and standards required by donors. 11 Case Study Report: Lao Environmental Protection Fund An endowment fund was created to ensure sustainable income to finance the operations of the EPF, which is crucial particularly when a sustainable source of capital has not been identified. The sense of sustainability for a national fund, beyond and above a particular project duration, is imperative to reduce the turn over rate of staff (particularly those who are non civil servants) and also to increase confidence of donor agencies in providing contributions to the fund. The sense of sustainability will also allow for capacity building as it requires time for a fund to be mature and well-functioning. Specifically in the case of the EPF, the EO and the BoD need to identify a sustainable source of revenue to ensure, otherwise it is crucial to increase the total amount of the endowment fund to generate sufficient interests to finance the operation costs and providing grants for environmental related projects. Meeting standards in financial integrity and social environment safeguard The EPF has established the necessary institutional structure and developed the capacity of human resources to manage a fund according to international standardsin financial integrity as well as social and environment safeguard.Institutionally, the inclusion of detailed procedures of financial management and social environment safeguard both in the EPF Charter and in the Operations Manual has provided a strong basis for effective management and implementation of the fund.Particularly for grants financed by the World Bank, the EPF manages the fund according to the Bank\u2019s standards, while government standardsare applied to other windows currently financed by the interests from the endowment fund. However, given the portion of the World Bank grant is currently around 90 per cent, most of the grants have therefore been managed by the EPF according to the World Bank\u2019s standards. Since all these procedures have been established in the Manual, staff are therefore obliged to implement them in their day-to-day project management activities. The capacity of the staff has been developed over time to implement these standards. However, there has been a concern about the high turn over rate of staff in the Executive Office of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4fa82d39-a68e-457f-9215-e1f89a13e82b": {"__data__": {"id_": "4fa82d39-a68e-457f-9215-e1f89a13e82b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-environmental-protection-fund-lao-pdr", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National Climate Fund Case Study Report: Environmental Protection Fund in Lao PDR", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-environmental-protection-fund-lao-pdr", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7721a148a6d7698a6b96718320646587057fe91890f90f5d654e6c9bacc839fb"}}, "hash": "7721a148a6d7698a6b96718320646587057fe91890f90f5d654e6c9bacc839fb", "text": "the EPF, which will eventually affect the capacity of the office to manage the fund. However, with the established system in place, building the capacity of human resources would be faster compared to the process of establishing a system from scratch. Reaching local beneficiaries The EPF has received acknowledgement by stakeholders interviewed in this study for its success to channel financial assistance for local stakeholders in the field of environmental protection. The success of the inclusion of local stakeholders to access grants provided by the EPF is due to a continuous support provided by the EO in the form of training, assistance in developing project proposals and simplification of the reporting mechanism. A number of clauses in the Operations Manual have also provided specific attention favoring local communities. For community grants, training on procurement procedures will be provided to communities and the procurement process will be determined considering the capacity and capability of the villagers. In the implementation of grant projects, the community will be the owner of the project and will make any decision related to the projects. In order to simplify the reporting mechanism for projects at the community level, the community will discuss the completion and closure through a community \u201caccountability meeting\u201d. Furthermore, a community account can also be opened at a district bank where the payment for expenses will be disbursed.The EPF can also support local communities in setting up the necessary accounting and financial management procedures for handling grants received from the EPF. 12 Case Study Report: Lao Environmental Protection Fund Authors: Silvia Irawan, Soukata Vichit, Bounphama Phothisane, Douang Lopaying, Singha Ounniyom, Alex Heikens Cover Photo: Lien Heikens.

To provide a technical input to the knowledge sharing, UNDP commissioned seven case studies on existing national funds in the fields of environment, conservation, energy, climate change and development. This paper reports the lessons learned extracted from the establishment and management of the Thailand Energy Conservation Promotion Fund (ENCON), which is one of seven national funds across the Asia-Pacific region selected as a case study.1 The ENCON fund is selected to provide an interesting case for countries in Asia-Pacific due to the following characteristics: 1. The source of the ENCON fund comes mainly from government levies collected by the government on petroleum products to finance the promotion of renewable energy and energy efficiency in the country. Through the collection of levies, the government can influence the use of fossil-fuel products by increasing market prices and at the same time earmarking the revenues collected to provide sustainable financing for renewable energy and energy efficiency in Thailand. The idea of collecting levies on the basis of the polluter pay\u2019s principle can be an example for countries in Asia-Pacific to explore possible sources of revenue to finance climate related activities. 2. Using a wide range of innovative financial instruments, the ENCON fund has attracted the engagement of the private sector, particularly businesses and commercial banks, in financing the promotion of renewable energy and energy efficiency. A wide range of programs funded by the ENCON fund include: the Thailand Energy Efficiency Revolving Fund, the ESCO venture capital, tax incentives, and investment grants. The programs financed by the ENCON fund are currently managed by different fund managers, where project selection criteria and implementation procedures of each program are designed specifically according to the targeted beneficiaries. 3. The utilization of the ENCON fund is based on the Five-Year Energy Conservation Program, which is a rolling plan where programs/projects under the ENCON program and the expenditure estimation will be reviewed and adjusted each year. The Conservation Programs include quantitative targets in renewable energy and energy conservation that will be achieved in a five- year period. Such programs enable for monitoring and evaluation of the performance achieved by activities/programs financed by the ENCON fund. This report first summarizes the design of the ENCON fund and provides a short description of the establishment and the management of the fund. A brief analysis of the lessons learned from the establishment and management of the ENCON fund are then presented. The case study analysis involved: literature review to set the scope of the study and in-depth interviews with relevant stakeholders: 1) Government Representatives (from the Department of Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency and the Energy Policy and Planning Office), 2) Program Manager and staff (Energy for Environment Foundation), and 3) other relevant stakeholders (Thailand Greenhouse Gas Organization and Office for Natural Resources and Environment Planning). Prior to finalization, the report has been reviewed by the ENCON team and the UNDP Thailand Country Office.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b6c597da-b790-4247-ad10-053818fde34c": {"__data__": {"id_": "b6c597da-b790-4247-ad10-053818fde34c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-thailand-energy-conservation-fund", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National Climate Fund Case Study Report: Thailand Energy Conservation Fund", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-thailand-energy-conservation-fund", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2df572d9697d2b898cdfbcc1187d88400eeeb05084602e13fdf64b4fd83961bc"}, "2": {"node_id": "1d6e4e2e-ff6a-47dd-8a52-b6675a354804", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-thailand-energy-conservation-fund", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "49b11909058479f0c9b1574d1603541eb111328aa57786f6b6ecf6f9d615bd5c"}}, "hash": "ae4172e7d73f11d2911ffd410d3485daaaee472c0ffedac605a3ba11bdde465b", "text": "1 National funds selected for the case study analysis are: Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation, China CMD Fund, Cambodia Climate Change Alliance Trust Fund, Thailand Energy Conservation Promotion Fund, Lao Environmental Protection Fund, Micronesian Conservation Trust and Tuvalu Trust Fund. http://www.snap-undp.org/elibrary/default.aspx 4 Case Study Report: Thailand Energy Conservation Fund The role of the ENCON fund in the energy sector in Thailand The ENCON", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "811f0ccc-d42f-4516-9383-068afb987ffc": {"__data__": {"id_": "811f0ccc-d42f-4516-9383-068afb987ffc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-thailand-energy-conservation-fund", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National Climate Fund Case Study Report: Thailand Energy Conservation Fund", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-thailand-energy-conservation-fund", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c7d89257a6c3135b29fa48e14ef830897343664ed8e5336d2867f2990dd19ca7"}, "3": {"node_id": "46c12ef5-5b34-4bb7-946e-0cb202be2a85", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-thailand-energy-conservation-fund", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8b69fe561a3c21036cbab8a0d8affa2b47b9f3489d445b0df3ea2202fc4222c9"}}, "hash": "1a1d210e8307b7b933afe915e653fccee4e87e3c5ef40e2f8978fb45d0a4e55e", "text": "fund is one of the biggest non-budgetary funds (in terms of its annual budget) for the promotion of renewable energy and energy conservation in Asia-Pacific. The fund provides financial assistance for a wide range of renewable energy and energy efficiency programs and projects in Thailand. Extra-budgetary funds are common in Thailand as the World Bank reports that around ninety-five revolving funds have been established to finance specific purposes such as education and health as of May 2009.2 Extra budgetary funds in Thailand are usually managed by dedicated government agencies and in many cases they are financed by specific taxes or levies collected by the government. The extra-budgetary funds in Thailand are often created by the government to support implementation of a particular law. The ENCON fund was created to provide financial support to implement the Energy Conservation Promotion Act 1992 that mandates the promotion of energy conservation activities in factories and commercial/service buildings.3 Under this Act, the ENCON Fund was established to provide financial support to different actors that wish to implement measures to increase efficiency in energy utilization. The ENCON fund is therefore the \u201cpull\u201d factor for the implementation of the ENCON Act. The ENCON Act stipulates the use of the ENCON fund. Designated factories/buildings, manufacturers or distributors of energy-efficient equipment/materials contributing to energy conservation or persons interested in energy conservation implementation can apply for grants or subsidies from the ENCON Fund. The annual amount of budget received and managed under the ENCON fund is around THB 7 billion (USD 225 million).4 This amount is significantly higher than the total government budget allocation for renewable energy and energy efficiency annually. For instance, in 2011, the amount of government budget allocated to renewable energy and energy efficiency totaled around THB 2 billion. The ENCON fund has therefore provided financial incentives for government and particularly non-government actors to invest in energy conservation and renewable energy promotion in Thailand. The design of the ENCON fund at a Glance The legal status The ENCON fund is an extra-budgetary fund that was established by the ENCON Act 1992 as previously discussed. The management of the ENCON fund is outside the government budget system, although the governing body of the fund consists mainly of relevant government agencies. The overall management of the ENCON fund is under the responsibility of the ENCON Fund Committee along with the guidance of the National Energy Policy Council (NEPC), while the members of the Committee are the Deputy Prime Minister (Vice Chair) and Ministers of Finance, Energy, Transport, Commerce, Industry, Agriculture, Science and Technology and others. The Committee that is responsible for the allocation of the ENCON fund also consists of representatives from relevant government agencies. The implementation of the ENCON Fund is mainly under the Ministry of Energy, which consists of the Department of Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency (DEDE) and the Energy Policy and Planning Office (EPPO). The EPPO, which is the Secretariat to the NEPC and the ENCON Fund Committee, is currently responsible for the day-to-day implementation of the ENCON fund, particularly for the 2 Public Expenditure Review: The Kingdom of Thailand, the World Bank, 2009. 3 Another example is the Environment Fund was also created to provide financial support for the Enhancement and Conservation of National Environmental Quality Act of 1992 4 An exchange rate of $US1 = THB 31.1 has been used throughout this report 5 Case Study Report: Thailand Energy Conservation Fund implementation of grant investment projects allocated to government agencies, NGOs and universities for the promotion of renewable energy and energy efficiency. The model of the ENCON Fund The source of capital of the ENCON fund comes mostly from the imposed levies on petroleum products in Thailand. The levies collected from the petroleum products range between THB 0.07 \u2013 0.25 per liter. The Prime Minister prescribes the rate of the imposed levies taking into consideration the recommendation of the National Energy Policy Council. There are other potential sources of capital for the ENCON Fund as prescribed by the Law, including: 1) surcharges for use of electricity (collected from designated factories/buildings that violate or fail to comply with the Ministerial Regulations); 2) subsidies from the government; 3) money or property received from the private sector, both local and abroad; and 4) interests and other benefits incurred from the ENCON Fund.

Phase 3 of the Energy Conservation Program has recently been completed, while Phase 4 (2012-2016) was approved by the ENCON Fund Committee on 1 March 2012 (during the writing of this report it is still pending the Cabinet\u2019s endorsement). Phase 3 of the ENCON Program focused on three main areas: 1. Renewable/alternative energy utilization aimed to increase the share of renewable/alternative energy in 2011 to 15.6 percent of the final energy demand, supplanting about 10,961 ktoe of commercial energy use.5 The promotion of renewable energy utilization focused on activities such as the promotion of biofuels and renewable energy utilization for power and heat generation, policy studies, technology research and public awareness campaigns to create correct understanding of renewable energy use. 2. Energy Efficiency Improvement targeted to increase energy efficiency and hence reduce commercial energy consumption by 10.8 percent, equivalent to 7,820 ktoe, by 2011. The program involved research and development and support to bring about efficient use of energy in the industrial, transportation as well as household sectors. 3. Strategic Management Program focused on policy research and studies to provide recommendations for decision-making pertaining to the improvement of the Renewable Energy Development Program or the Energy Efficiency Improvement Program. The program also supported monitoring and management of the overall ENCON fund to ensure efficient and effective implementation of the ENCON Program. The ENCON fund provides working capital, grants and subsidies for investment in energy conservation programs in both public and private sectors. From the total budget received and managed by the ENCON fund (THB 7 billion annually), around two thirds of the total revenue is managed by EPPO, while DEDE is responsible for managing the remaining one third of the revenue (Figure 1). The EPPO then provides grants to government agencies, universities and NGOs for hundreds of investment projects, and also implements a program known as the Demand Side Management (DSM) Bidding to encourage business operators to invest in higher energy efficiency machines/equipment. Moreover, DEDE also implements a wide range of financial instruments, such as the Thailand Energy Efficiency Revolving Fund, the ESCO venture capital, tax incentives and other related projects, to promote energy conservation and increase the share of renewable energy in the total energy mix in the country. Each of the programs financed by the ENCON fund is detailed below: 5 ktoe: thousand ton oil equivalent 6 Case Study Report: Thailand Energy Conservation Fund 1. Thailand Energy Efficiency Revolving Fund (the Revolving Fund) is a simple soft loan, providing capital investment with a maximum interest rate of 4 percent for a maximum loan period of 7 years. Nine commercial banks have participated as the implementing partners of the Revolving Fund scheme. The scheme is monitored by DEDE. 2. Demand Side Management (DSM) Bidding provides subsidies through a bidding mechanism to encourage business operators to invest in higher energy efficiency machines/equipment to achieve energy savings higher than the subsidy ratio. Subsidies are provided based on actual units of energy savings achieved in a year. With the bidding mechanism, companies requesting for the lowest weighted subsidy rate will be subsidized first. This scheme is monitored by EPPO. 3. ESCO Venture Capital Fund aims to invest jointly with private operators (i.e. Energy Service Companies \u2013 ESCOs, project developers) in energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. The scheme was specifically created to target small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and small renewable energy and energy efficiency projects that have a good potential in energy saving but facing a problem with project financing for investment. The program was established by DEDE in 2008. Two fund managers from non-profit organizations were assigned to implement the program, namely the Energy for Environment Foundation (E for E) and the Energy Conservation Foundation of Thailand (ECFT). 4. Tax incentives. The government introduced tax incentives via the Board of Investment (BOI) to encourage energy efficiency improvements. Corporate tax deductions are made available to encourage operators to invest in energy efficient equipment/machinery. DEDE monitors the implementation of this scheme. Another tax incentive scheme is in the form of 25 percent of tax deductible expenditure from the purchasing of energy efficiency equipment. This program is in cooperation with the Revenue Department.

The NEPC has the following mandate: i) to propose energy conservation promotion policies, goals, and measures to the cabinet; ii) to issue guidelines, criteria, conditions, and priorities for the disbursement from the ENCON fund; and iii) to determine contribution rates to be imposed on petroleum products for the ENCON fund. ENCON Fund Committee is chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister and EPPO serves as the secretariat of the Committee. The mandate of the Committee includes: i) to propose energy conservation promotion policies, goals and measures to NEPC; ii) to propose to NEPC guidelines, criteria, conditions, and priorities for the disbursement from the ENCON fund; iii) to prescribe regulations on the criteria and procedures for applications, grant allocations or subsidies from the ENCON fund; iv) to allocate appropriations from the ENCON fund; and v) to propose to NEPC contribution rates to be imposed on petroleum products for the ENCON fund. According to the ENCON Act, the ENCON Fund Committee can appoint Sub-Committees to assist with the tasks of the ENCON Fund Committee, particularly in screening projects/proposals as well as monitoring and evaluation. Each of the programs currently financed by the ENCON fund applies specific criteria in project selection and implementation procedures. Particularly for grant projects currently managed by EPPO, the project cycle is rather similar to the state budget process. Line ministries are invited to submit project proposals and the screening process usually takes approximately four months. The process is undertaken by EPPO, while the final decision will be made by the ENCON Fund Committee. The Establishment Process of the ENCON fund The issuance of the ENCON Act in March 1992 was driven by the government\u2019s commitment to meet targets set in the Seventh National Economic and Social Development plan (1992 - 1996) to reduce the annual growth rate of energy consumption in Thailand. As previously discussed, the ENCON Fund was then established to provide financial support to the implementation of the Act. Soon after the issuance of the Act, the ENCON fund received THB 1.5 billion from the Petroleum Fund as the initial capital in August 1992. A few months after the receipt of the initial capital, the NEPC started imposing a levy on domestic gasoline, kerosene, diesel and fuel oil to raise revenues for the ENCON fund. In August 1994, the NEPC gave consent to the establishment of the Energy Conservation Program (ENCON Program) and set guidelines, criteria, conditions and priorities for the allocation of the ENCON Fund to support the implementation of the ENCON Act. The ENCON fund started providing financial assistance for the promotion of energy conservation in Thailand since 1995. From the issuance of the Act to the establishment of operational guidelines of the ENCON fund, the process only took two years to complete. The fund was fully operational a year after the issuance of the guidelines, or around three years after the issuance of the ENCON Act. The quick process of establishing the ENCON fund was only possible due to the strong commitment of the government, which was legalized by the ENCON Act. The amount of time and resources invested during the political process of issuing the ENCON Act is however unavailable. However, it is clear that strong political will is an important aspect when establishing a national fund. 8 Case Study Report: Thailand Energy Conservation Fund The Management of the ENCON fund Innovative financial instruments After two decades, the ENCON fund has financed a wide range of programs to support the promotion of energy conservation and renewable/alternative energy. The ENCON fund currently provides grants for various investment projects, particularly for government agencies and line ministries to support energy conservation promotion. Financial instruments, such as soft loans and subsidies, have also been introduced under several different programs as previously discussed to promote investments in and operations of energy conservation and renewable energy programs. In late 2002, DEDE introduced the Revolving Fund Program that is implemented jointly with commercial banks to provide soft loans for energy efficiency improvement and renewable energy development and utilization. Following a review of program implementation, it was found that the main participants of this program were large companies. Following this realization, the DEDE created in 2008 the ESCO fund scheme to target potential investors for small projects in energy efficiency improvement and renewable energy development, mostly to be implemented by small and medium enterprises.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9d851937-12b6-493b-8e04-0d3270905591": {"__data__": {"id_": "9d851937-12b6-493b-8e04-0d3270905591", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-thailand-energy-conservation-fund", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National Climate Fund Case Study Report: Thailand Energy Conservation Fund", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-thailand-energy-conservation-fund", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9fc3c41a74aba48a8cdafcfed72cfd749dabeb5f36d6c7707c9b5686c3c52ba6"}, "2": {"node_id": "f4adeffa-a944-466f-a5e3-46f3ac4c4aac", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-thailand-energy-conservation-fund", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c2a62a942fa71592297809dfdf721741d629c242a3d118eac845cc3967e355bc"}}, "hash": "1ceb49130ac11d808e752cb9b31d42648667bd63e13f5f3a8b17382073cf26dc", "text": "For this purpose, two fund managers from non-profit organizations (NGOs) were appointed directly to manage the scheme.

As different programs target different beneficiaries, each instrument is managed by a different fund manager. Each program also applies specific criteria for the selection of projects to be financed and also carries different procedures for project implementation. In this case study report, specific attention is provided to the management of the ESCO Venture Fund. An in-depth interview was conducted with the Energy for Environment Foundation to understand the management of the ESCO Fund, which is reported in the next section below. ESCO Venture Capital Fund: the story from Energy for Environment The Energy for Environment Foundation (E for E) is currently designated to manage a portion of the ESCO Venture Capital fund, while another portion is entrusted to the Energy Conservation Foundation of Thailand. During the first phase of the ESCO fund implementation (October 2008 to September 2010), E for E and the Energy Conservation Foundation of Thailand were responsible for managing THB 250 million (USD 8 million) respectively. The total amount of funds managed by E for E was increased to THB 300 million (out of THB 500 million) during the second phase (October 2010 to September 2012). The main objectives of the ESCO fund particularly during the second phase of the implementation are to stimulate more than THB 1,250 million (USD 40 million) investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency and to encourage more than 10 ktoe annual energy savings or valuing THB 250 million per year. The target is to be achieved by implementing several sub-programs, including: 1. Equity Investment. The ESCO Fund will make equity investments in energy efficiency or renewable energy projects. Investment criteria applied are: i) size of equity investment: 10-50 percent of total investment cost but limited to THB 50 million per project; ii) investment period of 5-7 years; and iii) exit method of selling back the shares to the entrepreneur, or find new strategic partners. 2. ESCO Venture Capital. The scheme will partner with Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) to raise capital for investments in energy saving projects of the ESCO. Investment criteria applied are: i) size of equity investment is 30 percent of registered capital but limited to THB 50 million per project; ii) investment period of 5-7 years; iii) exit method of selling back the shares to the entrepreneur, or find new strategic partners and; iv) board seat is required in the company. 9 Case Study Report: Thailand Energy Conservation Fund 3. Equipment Leasing. The leasing criteria include: i) 100 percent of equipment cost but limited to THB 10 million per project; ii) repayment duration of 5 years; and iii) interest rate of 4 percent per annum. 4. Carbon Credit Facility. The ESCO Fund will support project owners in developing CDM documents, Project Idea Note (PIN) and Project Design Document (PDD), and help to bundle small projects so that buyers are willing to purchase the carbon credits from the projects. 5. Credit Guarantee Facility. The Fund will cooperate with financial institutions or credit guarantee agencies to assist entrepreneurs in accessing long-term loans from banks by providing a credit guarantee depending on the project risk and limited to THB 10 million at a low premium rate. 6. Technical Assistance. The ESCO fund will provide financial support for technical assistance, e.g. energy audit, feasibility study. The support is limited to THB 100,000 per project and this support must be reimbursed to the ESCO Fund unless the proposed technical solutions have been implemented. The intended beneficiaries of these sub-programs are potential entrepreneurs from industrial sectors or Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) with potential energy efficiency or renewable energy projects resulting in lower energy consumption, increased energy efficiency, fuel switching, or renewable energy businesses. As the main purpose of the ESCO fund program is to reach potential investors, including small and medium enterprises to be involved in energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, the involvement of non-profit organizations, such as E for E, has proven effective. E for E, for instance, provides assistance to potential beneficiaries to access the fund, including technical assistance for project development and implementation. A marketing and public relations plan is also developed by E for E to disseminate information about the ESCO fund to potential beneficiaries, including through seminars and published information in media. This effort has increased the uptake of the ESCO fund by eligible small and medium enterprises. The success of the ESCO fund, particularly the portion managed by E for E, relies on a thorough screening process of project selection. E for E has invested more time and resources at the beginning of the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b0e64c8-5eb1-45df-ae94-c7117f48e4a0": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b0e64c8-5eb1-45df-ae94-c7117f48e4a0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-thailand-energy-conservation-fund", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National Climate Fund Case Study Report: Thailand Energy Conservation Fund", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-thailand-energy-conservation-fund", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c09d3f5c289b7db35ff9f0daead63a834b654f0a20372f21b0a384d38c852d32"}, "3": {"node_id": "9a70c1b6-0811-4d0c-a49a-fcf0de6816b3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-thailand-energy-conservation-fund", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1e32095626cd2ef37e0460542b39477767eaedf8012638cfafbe5e2dbd756d95"}}, "hash": "3ffe531cee7f929a5242f3d2f93cb968818ce46d1e202c79f2a01efc84684e0e", "text": "project cycle to carefully screen all proposals received.

Project cycle of the ESCO fund Source: E for E (2012) Monitoring and evaluation system Monitoring and evaluation systems to measure the impacts of the ENCON fund also vary between programs implemented. Generally, the monitoring and evaluation of government policies in the energy sector has benefited from robust basic energy data that are published on a regular basis. DEDE maintains the relevant time series energy data and the data for the latest 5-10 years, which are published in statistical books including \u201cThailand Energy Situation\u201d, \u201cOil and Thailand\u201d and \u201cElectric Power in Thailand\u201d. Particularly for the Revolving Fund, DEDE uses a range of Key Performance Indicators (KPI) to monitor the performance of the Fund.

This is different from common practices in many countries where governments apply environmental taxes to generate revenues, which are usually not directly earmarked for financing policies or activities in addressing environmental degradation. The taxes are usually collected as general government revenue and later are allocated to various ministries according to the government\u2019s priorities determined by the planning process in the country. This approach has the risk that the collected revenues are not allocated to address environmental problems, because environment is often given low priority. The lesson from the ENCON fund provides an example for countries to identify potential sources to generate revenues for financing climate actions at the national and local levels. Revenues can be collected from industries and sectors that are the main emitters of greenhouse gasses. The revenues can then be allocated or earmarked for activities that are related to mitigating or adapting to the impacts of climate change at the national and local levels. To manage the collected revenues, a national fund can be considered to ensure that the fund is specifically earmarked for addressing climate change.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9a70c1b6-0811-4d0c-a49a-fcf0de6816b3": {"__data__": {"id_": "9a70c1b6-0811-4d0c-a49a-fcf0de6816b3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-thailand-energy-conservation-fund", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National Climate Fund Case Study Report: Thailand Energy Conservation Fund", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-thailand-energy-conservation-fund", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c09d3f5c289b7db35ff9f0daead63a834b654f0a20372f21b0a384d38c852d32"}, "2": {"node_id": "3b0e64c8-5eb1-45df-ae94-c7117f48e4a0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-thailand-energy-conservation-fund", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3ffe531cee7f929a5242f3d2f93cb968818ce46d1e202c79f2a01efc84684e0e"}}, "hash": "1e32095626cd2ef37e0460542b39477767eaedf8012638cfafbe5e2dbd756d95", "text": "Innovative programmatic instruments The ENCON fund has received much attention at the international level particularly given its success in financing the promotion of energy efficiency and the increased renewable energy share in the total energy mix in Thailand.

Therefore, it would likely be more effective to create programs where fund managers are hired to implement the programs, particularly when the scale of the fund is as large as the ENCON fund. This arrangement would also allow DEDE and EPPO to focus mainly on monitoring and evaluation of the performance and results of the programs, instead of on the implementation of administrative activities. 12 Case Study Report: Thailand Energy Conservation Fund Three other important lessons can be learned from the management of the ENCON fund, including: 1. Creating specific programmatic instruments to target particular beneficiaries. When developing an instrument/program to be financed, it is crucial to ask: \u201cwho are the intended beneficiaries?\u201d Since different beneficiaries will have specific characteristics and behaviors, there is no universal solution (or program) that can be developed to change the behaviors of all actors in the promotion of energy efficiency and renewable energy utilization. This is particularly true of the case of managing climate finance to mitigate and adapt to climate change: the number of stakeholders is very large and their capacities differ greatly. Furthermore, the type of activities under adaptation and mitigation will be far more diverse than \u2018only\u2019 renewable energy and energy efficiency activities as is currently supported by the ENCON fund. 2. Assessing the effectiveness of strategy/program implementation regularly and revising the strategy/program as necessary. It is imperative to conduct a thorough assessment of the effectiveness of programs financed by a national fund from time to time. Based on such assessment, an existing program may need to be revised or a new program should be created considering the changing socio-economic and political situation in a country. In the case of the ENCON fund, the Revolving Fund was first introduced in 2002. Following a review conducted by DEDE, it was found that the main beneficiary of the program were large emterprises. Based on this review, a discussion was started within DEDE where a specific program targeting SMEs was considered necessary. In 2008, the ESCO fund was introduced specifically targeting SMEs. The procedures and criteria of the ESCO fund were developed considering the characteristics of the SMEs. As a result, non-profit organizations were appointed as the fund managers. 3. Hiring a fund manager to manage a portion of the fund for a specific purpose. To implement the Revolving Fund, the DEDE has been working with commercial banks to provide soft loans for businesses. Having commercial banks manage the Revolving Fund will be beneficial for the program due to the capacity of commercial banks in managing loans and dealing with lenders. The program can also create awareness for commercial banks about the importance of providing loans for energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives. In contrast, two fund managers from non-profit organizations have been appointed to manage the ESCO fund. As previously discussed, the fund managers have been proactive in working with SMEs and helping them to access the ESCO fund. Strong guidance by Energy Conservation Programs The implementation of a national fund should be guided by well-defined policy objectives. In the case of the ENCON fund, specific objectives and quantitative targets to be achieved within a period of time are set in the ENCON program. Phase 3 of the ENCON program (2008-2011), for instance, aimed to increase energy efficiency by 10.8 percent from business as usual and increase the share of renewable energy development to 15.5 percent of the total energy consumption. The evaluation of the performance in Phase 3 is underway during the writing of this report. The specific targets set by the ENCON program ensure that the ENCON fund is managed strategically according to the government priorities on renewable energy and energy efficiency. Setting specific policy objectives and targets enables the monitoring and evaluation of the performance of the fund. The effectiveness of the fund can then be monitored and evaluated based on the performance since there is a clear link between the amount of resources spent with the achievement of policy targets and performance indicators. 13 Case Study Report: Thailand Energy Conservation Fund Authors: Silvia Irawan, Alex Heikens Cover Photo: Doungjun Roongruang Acknowledgements: the authors would like to express their gratitude to representatives from the ENCON Fund, government, development partners and grantees of the fund sharing their contributions, comments, views and experiences with the ENCON Fund Disclaimer: The views expressed in this publication are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of the United Nations, including UNDP, or its member states.

In the growing lit- erature of climate change, \u201cclimate finance\u201d refers to fi- nancial resources required to cover the costs of climate actions and investments2. Climate finance is complex because of the diversity of sources of funds, agents and channels to distribute the funds to intended ben- eficiaries at different levels and scales. The expected scale of climate finance is also significant. Developed countries have committed to mobilize new and addi- tional resources for climate investments. It has been agreed at COP 15 in Copenhagen that as much as US$ 30 billion for 2010-2012 and US$ 100 billion by 2020 is to be mobilized to assist developing countries to cover the costs of climate mitigation and adaptation. The committed resources, however, are much lower than the estimated amount required to finance mitigation and adaptation actions. Estimates vary from around US $140-175 billion and $70-100 billion per year for the period of 2010-2050.3 Uncertainties remain on how the funds will be raised, managed and disbursed. One of the mechanisms to manage and channel inter- national finance is the recently created Green Climate Fund (GCF).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee16f31a-c853-49c6-83fb-fd6f68051a36": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee16f31a-c853-49c6-83fb-fd6f68051a36", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-funds-learning-experience-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National Climate Funds: Learning from the experience of Asia-Pacific countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-funds-learning-experience-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d9c4d577e9ec7ef72817ec948fe6951d0eb8680797c383bad7bc4da420e606ad"}, "2": {"node_id": "c9e055a0-0999-4d81-80e2-4205f41abd76", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-funds-learning-experience-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3df178531cbae13b0dd7fc1f372a5864b0bfda5c7c90b54340113cd67970555f"}}, "hash": "c6120781de9bb1595bd0b0539b45f0cb15f0274b74203551324f77903bbf4041", "text": "The GCF is expected to support projects, programs, policies, readiness and other activities in de- veloping countries.

In Asia-Pacific, some countries have established na- tional funds to access and manage climate finance (Box 1). The UNDP Guidebook on National Climate Funds 5 defines National Climate Funds (NCFs) as a mechanism that supports countries to direct finance towards cli- mate change projects and programs. This paper looks at NCFs in Asia-Pacific that manage climate finance outside government budget (extra-budgetary)6, apply certain accounting standards, and may have their own governance structures and independent legal status. National funds for accessing and managing climate fi- nance, however, must be carefully tailored to national circumstances. As can be seen from existing funds in the Asia-Pacific, the establishment of national funds requires time and investment in building human and institutional capacity to manage a fund effectively and transparently. Establishing extra-budgetary funds to manage financial resources for specific purposes (such as environment, health, education and development in general) is not new. In middle-income countries, extra-budgetary funds (Box 2) are commonly estab- lished to earmark government budgets to finance spe- cific purposes such as education and health. In Thai- land, for instance, around ninety-five revolving funds were established to finance specific purposes as of 4 Vandeweerd V, Glemarec Y, Billett S (2012) Readiness for Climate Finance - A framework for understanding what it means to be ready to use climate finance.UNDP Discussion Paper. 5 This paper makes a number of references to the \u201cGuidebook for the De- sign and Establishment of National Funds to Achieve Climate Change Priori- ties\u201d, which will be referred to as the \u201cNCF Guidebook\u201d henceforth. It can be ac- cessed at http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/Environment%20 and%20Energy/Climate%20Change/Capacity%20Development/Blending_ Climate_Finance_Through_National_Climate_Funds.pdf 6 The term \u2018extra-budgetary fund\u2019, however, is not well-defined, and covers a variety of institutional arrangements. An extra-budgetary fund can be defined as government transactions that are not included in the annual national bud- get (appropriations) law and may not be subject to the same level of scrutiny or accounting standards as the government budget (which could be higher or lower than government account standards). 5 National Climate Funds May 2009.7 These funds are usually managed by dedi- cated government agencies and in many cases they are financed by specific taxes or levies collected by the government. In low-income and least developed countries, extra-budgetary funds can present ben- efits such as receiving external finance and generat- ing additional incomes, including from interest and dividends from investing the capital in financial mar- kets. In the Pacific, trust funds serve a wide range of purposes that support development. The Kiribati Rev- enue Equalization Reserve Fund (established in 1956), for instance, was capitalized using tax revenue from 7 World Bank (2009) Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability, the Kingdom of Thailand. phosphate mining. The objective of the trust fund was to balance the government future recurrent bud- get, in anticipation of phosphate exhaustion.8 Decision-makers who are considering or establish- ing national climate funds can learn from the rich body of knowledge and experiences of Asia-Pacific countries on extra-budgetary funds for environ- ment, climate, energy and development. To facili- tate this knowledge sharing, this paper synthesizes the long-standing experiences of Asia-Pacific countries in the establishment and management of national funds, and builds on the UNDP Guidebook for the Design and Establishment of National Funds. The paper synthesizes findings of the research conducted through literature review,9 an e-discussion on NCFs, a case study analysis of seven funds in Asia-Pacific, and a regional clinic on the design and management of NCFs (See the \u201cMethod- ology\u201d section).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6b76f1bf-a4e6-4b41-ab10-e4140ca46b9d": {"__data__": {"id_": "6b76f1bf-a4e6-4b41-ab10-e4140ca46b9d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-funds-learning-experience-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National Climate Funds: Learning from the experience of Asia-Pacific countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-funds-learning-experience-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "31948baf75f3b8295781542200b3b2fcc0f9f5c5297760daee4015494cbdf030"}, "2": {"node_id": "57bf1e60-3019-4823-838a-359070825ec6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-funds-learning-experience-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a7475168bc65d776dc73d19a3a2e0e6209146a68595decfb3e25fbeb1f32cc71"}}, "hash": "0b9cf31f2f4b9630b7b10e0f65af3612f7d11c2731ffdfe65a12a0f567a97d29", "text": "The objective of this discussion paper is twofold: first, it provides a clear overview of the keyissues faced when 8 See ADB (2005) Trust Funds in the Pacific: Their Role and Future, ADB, Manila. 9 Two main reports provide a comprehensive background about national climate funds, namely: 1) reports produced by Conservation Finance Alliance, which have comprehensively documented the experiences of conservation trust funds established following the Convention of Biological Diversity in 1992 and; 2) a report by ADB (2005) that reviews comprehensively all public trust funds and their specific roles in the Pacific.

Both Trust Funds are multi-donor trust funds, with UNDP as the interim trustee. Bangladesh established two climate funds: Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience Fund, which is managed by the World Bank, and Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund managed directly by the Government of Bangladesh. The Philippines is currently establishing the Peoples Survival Fund (PSF), which aims to finance adaptation programs and projects that are directly supportive of the objectives enumerated in the Climate Change Action Plans of local government units and communities. The design of the PSF is currently being developed. Several countries are also considering about creating a specific window within their existing national funds for environment or biodiversity conservation to address the issues of climate change. For instance, there is an on-going discussion to create a specific window for climate change under the Lao Environmental Protection Fund, while the Micronesian Conservation Trust has applied to be accredited to serve as the National Implementing Entity for the Adaptation Fund in FSM. Box 2. Extra-budgetary funds from the Public Finance Perspective In the Public Finance Literature, three commonly quoted purposes of extra-budgetary funds are: 1. Special funds (earmarking) \u2013 established for specified purposes and financed from special taxes or other earmarked revenue required usually by law such as social security fund, environment fund, and others. 2. Development funds (pool external resources) \u2013 funds established to support development programs usually using donor contributions and sometimes internal sources 3. Investment funds \u2013 funds established with specific investment objectives and component of stocks, bonds or other financial assets. 6 National Climate Funds designing, establishing and managing extra-budget- ary national climate funds in Asia-Pacific. Second, it offers some practical examples from countries\u2019 expe- riences in Asia-Pacific. It should be noted that experi- ences of other regions with national climate funds may differ to those presented in this paper. However, it is beyond the scope of this paper to make a comparison with other regions. The paper starts with presenting different modalities, which countries can consider for accessing and managing climate finance. The Method- ology section then outlines the activities undertaken to gather necessary information and the analysis con- ducted for writing this paper. The findings are classi- fied into three phases: decision making, designing and managing NCFs. To assist decision makers to make an informed decision, a set of feasibility criteria is then proposed for assessing whether an NCF is a feasible option for a country. Finally, important design and management features of NCFs are presented, before lessons-learned and experiences from the Asia-Pacific region are synthesized. 7 National Climate Funds Positioning NCFs within the overall national climate finance Prior to making a decision about the establish- ment of an NCF, countries should first assess the overall climate finance landscape.10 Climate finance has many sources, including: government budget (a portion of government taxes or levies), international donors, lending agencies and interest and dividends. There are also a wide range of modalities available to access and manage climate finance, including: formal government budget systems, national (or regional and international) funds (within or outside state ad- ministration), and project-based approaches. While developing countries have a common position regard- ing the need to move away from managing climate finance through individual stand-alone projects, de- bates about whether to manage (international and domestic) climate finance through formal budget processes and/or national climate funds remain. Some commonly mentioned advantages and concerns re- garding these modalities as briefly indicated below, with some more details provided in Annex 1. It needs to be recognized that opinions and experiences differ amongst practitioners in the region.

Furthermore, the formal budget pro- cesses engages all government agencies led by Min- istry of Finance, and involves parliament. The formal budget system disperses large volumes of finance, and in principle it can be used to \u201ctop-up\u201d sector spending to support \u201cmainstreaming\u201d of climate. On the other hand, there are also potential concerns with climate finance in the formal budget system. For example, the formal budget process includes negotiations across the whole of the government and climate change is only one of many issues to be discussed and budgeted. Due to competing demands, there is thus no guaran- tee that sufficient financial resources will be allocated for climate change. Furthermore, whilst the formal budget system may be able to disburse large amounts of finance, there are commonly concerns about the quality of such expenditures. 11 Allen and Radev (2010) Extrabudgetary Funds, OECD, Paris. 12 Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR) studies con- ducted in five countries including Bangladesh, Cambodia, Nepal, Thailand and Samoa: http://www.climatefinance-developmenteffectiveness.org 8 National Climate Funds The lesson learned is that countries will continue to explore and develop a combination of modalities and that emphasis should be on ensuring comple- mentarity of these modalities and using the limited resources in the most effective and efficient man- ner. Regardless of the modality employed, accessing and managing international public climate finance poses specific challenges, including: \u2022\ufffd \ufffdOngoing climate change negotiations under the United Nations Framework of Climate Change Con- vention (UNFCCC). Issues to be addressed include how and when climate finance committed under the framework will flow from developed to develop- ing countries. \u2022\ufffd \ufffdUncertainty of the modalities and absence of op- erational guidelines under the Green Climate Fund (GCF). Of particular interest in this context is the question of the scale and type of finance support that GCF will be able to provide to countries, what modalities countries can use to access it, and the cri- teria that countries / agencies would need to meet to do so. \u2022\ufffd \ufffdLack of specificity of the impacts of climate change on some sectors and geographies. Decision-makers may be reluctant and/or not have the political will to put in place necessary climate policies, strategies and actions because of uncertainty associated with the direct effects of climate change on livelihoods, health and living conditions. \u2022\ufffd \ufffdInvolvement of private actors. Addressing the challenges of climate change will not only require cross-sectoral coordination between government agencies but also the involvement of private actors. An important role (amongst others) is that limited public finance should be used to leverage private in- vestments and drive transformational change in the behavior of different actors. This needs to be done through a combination of actions, depending on the country specific needs, such as issuing/adjust- ing public policies, regulations and providing the right set of incentives 9 National Climate Funds Research methodology To achieve this paper\u2019s objective, thorough research on the establishment and the management of national cli- mate funds was carried out, involving three main activ- ities: an e-discussion, a case study analysis focusing on seven national funds in the region, and a regional clinic on national climate funds. In each of the three activi- ties, thorough discussions with relevant stakeholders (incl. fund managers, government officials, represen- tatives from civil society and development partners) have been pursued to identify main considerations that decision-makers should be mindful about when deciding about the establishment and the design of an NCF as well as when managing an NCF. The e-discussion on national climate funds was launched by UNDP on 27 February 2012 and carried out for 10 weeks.

The case study analy- sis involved in-depth discussions with fund managers, beneficiaries, and government officials involved in the selected national funds. A case study report has been produced for each national fund and can be accessed on http://www.snap-undp.org/elibrary/byfocus.aspx? Area=Energy. The regional clinic on the design and management of NCFs was jointly organized by the UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre and the USAID/RDMA-funded ADAPT Asia-Pacific project, and took place on 6-8 September. A total of 65 participants consisting of fund managers, experts and government officials from 20 countries and representatives from DFID, USAID, AusAID, SIDA, World Bank, ADB, SPREP, PIFs, UNDP and GIZ had dis- cussions on the feasibility, design and management aspects of NCFs. The workshop was effective in shar- ing experiences, insights and views on NCFs, learn- ing from the experiences from existing national funds throughout the Asia-Pacific region, enriched with contributions from government officials and devel- opment partners. Workshop proceedings can be ac- cessed on http://www.snap-undp.org/elibrary/byfo- cus.aspx?Area=Energy. The discussions with stakeholders generated a wealth of information which have been gathered and ana- lyzed. The discussions were structured according to three different phases: decision-making for establish- ing and NCF, designing of and NCF, and managing of an NCF. Practical solutions are also offered based on the synthesis of lesson-learned from countries\u2019 expe- riences with National Funds in the Asia-Pacific region. In the decision-making phase, this paper suggests fea- sibility criteria to assess whether an NCF is a feasible option for a country. Once a country has decided to establish an NCF, decision-makers will need to select the NCF design features. Various design features of na- tional funds available in Asia-Pacific countries are listed to provide a comprehensive picture of a wide range of options for NCF design features. Finally, informed by experienced fund managers, important management features are presented. 10 National Climate Funds Table 1: Funds selected for the case study analysis Name of fund Year of Establishment Objectives Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation 1991 Supporting environmental conservation in Bhutan by providing grants for government agencies, local non-governmental organizations, grassroots communities and qualified Bhutanese individuals for conservation projects.

Strategic role. The most important step when making a decision about the establishment of NCFs is to define its policy objectives within the overall climate finance archi- tecture in a country. An NCF should be strategically de- signed, aiming to fulfill an important role that achieves climate and development objectives that cannot or less effectively be achieved through other modalities. One possible strategic role is leveraging private and public investments and drive transformational change towards low-carbon and climate resilient development.

The fund is capitalized mostly by levies collected from CDM projects in China. Al- though the fund manages only a small portion of finan- cial resources (US$ 1.6 billion) compared to government budgets allocated for energy efficiency, renewable en- ergy and environmental protection (US$ 26.9 billion), it aims to have significant impact on policy and research. The CCDM Fund is established specifically to play strategic roles, including: 1) Financing immediate actions required to ad- dress the challenges of climate change, such as policy studies, public awareness, and interna- tional negotiations; 2) Testing or piloting financial/economic instru- ments to develop cost-effective measures for climate mitiga\u00action and adaptation in China. The latter includes innovative approaches to leverage private sector investments. In the case of the Pacific Strategic role Effectiveness Capacity Financial sustainablility Political feasibility where private investments is generally regarded as less realistic, a strategic role of a national fund could be to mobilize international public finance to drive transfor- mational change or as a means of \u201cparking funds\u201d to then be implemented based on the absorptive capac- ity of the country. Another strategic role of a NCF could be to specifically reach out to marginalized and vulner- able groups at the community level. Political feasibility. Establishing an NCF requires time and resources to gain political support. When a law (or act) is required for the establishment (and/or capitaliza- tion) of a fund, support from parliament may be neces- sary depending on the political and legal systems in a country. Although the process of gaining the political support may take longer, a fund that is established by a law (or act) will most likely be more sustainable. For example, the Thailand Energy Conservation Fund and the Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation that were established in 1990s through a Law and a Royal Decree respectively. In addition, once a law is is- sued, the process of getting the fund operational can be accelerated based on the strong legal basis. Early experiences in Asia-Pacific countries show that expand- ing existing national funds (mostly environment funds) to access and manage climate finance will also require political negotiations. However, such a process could be less intense and time consuming than establishing a new national fund. For instance, the MCT and the Lao Figure 1: 12 National Climate Funds EPF are currently considering expanding their scope by including climate change into their existing funds. Institutional and human resource capacity. The time required for a fund to be fully operational and ready to disburse money to the intended beneficiaries is dependent on the institutional and human resource capacity within a country. After a fund is officially es- tablished, an operation manual should be developed to detail specific rules and regulations for the imple- mentation and management of the fund. This can be based on manuals for existing funds or built off of government systems. Sufficient capacity to manage the fund effectively and transparently according to the established rules and regulations is therefore required. Depending on the existing capacity, the process of getting a fund to be fully operational can take several years. For instance, in the case of BTFEC, the fund fo- cused mainly on building the human and institutional capacity in the first 10 years, while the CCDMF took five years before up-scaling the total grant projects from 14 projects to 125 projects. Time and cost effectiveness. Establishing and getting a national fund operational takes time and resources. As discussed above, the process starts with political negotiations, building sufficient capacity and making sure the design elements are in place (which will be discussed in the next section). Political negotiations will involve time and efforts; and when capacity is lack- ing, investments in capacity development is neces- sary. The establishment process, from the negotiation process to getting a fund ready to disburse money to beneficiaries, may take 2-3 years. For example, for the TTF, the Government of Tuvalu had developed the con- cept of a \u201cReserve Fund\u201d in 1984 and the agreement establishing the TTF was signed on 16 June 1987. In many cases, to overcome the issue of low capacity at the country level, a national fund can hire a service provider or a fund manager. This arrangement can be a temporary solution to allow the fund to be operational relatively fast taking into account this may incur higher costs. Managing a national fund on day-to-day basis will entail overhead costs, including staff salaries and other administrative costs which need to be covered. For example, MCT charges around 16 percent for a management fee of grants received from development", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "768c3fc5-8ab0-4532-9742-308f5a50eb21": {"__data__": {"id_": "768c3fc5-8ab0-4532-9742-308f5a50eb21", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-funds-learning-experience-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National Climate Funds: Learning from the experience of Asia-Pacific countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-funds-learning-experience-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7a94490f0c40df1a7b9a3a11715737b3088c9946604c44107fa6d4c94d1af031"}, "3": {"node_id": "afe7ad9a-dc04-45d2-84cb-b781e3ad9abe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-funds-learning-experience-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dc910b92ed42e025d411e7016f1ac57820a4172a69531a16484e5d7b42b48bfe"}}, "hash": "800e24f67ecd144cbd3c8ef889cc2d979310b73b30f70c36066f562aca54e0ac", "text": "partners, while KEHATI (a national fund for biodiversity conservation in Indonesia) its overhead costs for the period 2008 - 2011 were around 14.7 percent. Financial sustainability \u2013 Many national climate funds are established to initially manage a one-time contri- bution from donors which should be disbursed to in- tended beneficiaries within a specific time frame. Of- ten, newly established funds do not have sustainable sources of finance to replenish its capital regularly. When financial resources are running out, these funds will be closed. Considering the amount of resources and time that are required for the establishment of NCFs, countries should be mindful about establish- ing a fund without a long-term and strong strategy on resource mobilization. An example of a fund found to be sustainable is the TTF which is an endowment fund useful for long-term planning and can earn investment income (capital appreciation and dividends); while the linked revolving fund provides more flexibility when a distribution from the main trust fund is paid. In ad- dition to the capital appreciation, there have been AUD$38.6 million in additional contributions. In the pe- riod since the Fund began to 30 June 2007, AUD$65.7 million has been made available to the Government and the current value of the fund is a maintained value of AUD$127 million as at March 2012. 13 National Climate Funds Design Features of National Funds A fund, defined as a sum of money set aside for a spe- cific purpose, is different than a trust fund. Both terms, however, are often used interchangeably. The \u201ctrust\u201d component of a trust fund is a legal arrangement wherein one party, the trustor, gives control of assets to another party, the trustee, to be administered on behalf of a third party, the beneficiary. In public trust funds the trustors, trustees and beneficiaries can be individuals, groups of individuals, institutions or gov- ernments. Public trust funds, therefore, are \u201cthose es- tablished for public purposes by, with, or through gov- ernments by some form of enacting legislation (local, national, or international), which forms the trust, sets out its legal terms, and assigns respective rights and responsibilities to different parties\u201d13. Under this defini- tion, most extra-budgetary funds can be classified as trust funds, since they are established by law, managed by trustees, and channeling funds to beneficiaries. However, in literature, public trust funds usually refer to a specific type of fund, similar to a private trust fund, which preserves capital while income from that capital available to designated persons or purposes. \u201cNational funds\u201d is a general term used in this report to refer to all types of funds established at the national level. The next section provides detailed explanation of different types of funds. National climate funds can vary considerably in terms of objectives, legal status, type of fund, trustee arrangements, capitalization and beneficiaries. This section discusses design features of national climate funds and provides concrete examples from seven na- tional funds that are analyzed in the case study analysis. Different types of funds There are three main types of national funds: endow- ment, revolving and sinking funds. The types of na- 13 ADB (2005) Trust Funds in the Pacific: Their Role and Future, ADB, Manila. tional funds will determine the capitalization process and the structure of the governing body. Sinking fund. A sinking fund consumes the principle capital and investment income (if the fund is invested) over a fixed time period. This type of fund should be regarded as a short-term initiative and not sustainable in the long run because the capital of the fund will be disbursed entirely within a fixed period of time. An example of a sinking fund is a multi-donor trust fund, where it pools financial resources committed by various donors and channels them to intended beneficiaries through one gateway to ensure better aid coordination. The Cambodia Climate Change Alliance (CCCA) Trust Fund and Indonesia Climate Change Trust Fund are an example of a multi-donor trust fund for climate change. Revolving fund. Revolving funds are those in which the principle capital and the investment income (if the fund is invested) are consumed entirely but a re- plenishment source (a tax or external source) exists and contributes regularly to the funds. The principal capital can be further invested in various types of risk- free financial instruments (such as in commercial bank deposits) to generate additional income (i.e.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "afe7ad9a-dc04-45d2-84cb-b781e3ad9abe": {"__data__": {"id_": "afe7ad9a-dc04-45d2-84cb-b781e3ad9abe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-funds-learning-experience-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National Climate Funds: Learning from the experience of Asia-Pacific countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-funds-learning-experience-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7a94490f0c40df1a7b9a3a11715737b3088c9946604c44107fa6d4c94d1af031"}, "2": {"node_id": "768c3fc5-8ab0-4532-9742-308f5a50eb21", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-funds-learning-experience-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "800e24f67ecd144cbd3c8ef889cc2d979310b73b30f70c36066f562aca54e0ac"}}, "hash": "dc910b92ed42e025d411e7016f1ac57820a4172a69531a16484e5d7b42b48bfe", "text": "the CCDM fund) or not invested further (i.e. the ENCON fund).

As there is no regular source to replenish the capital, therefore, an endowment fund depends on the interests or dividends generated from the investments and/or additional funds mobilizing by fund managers (i.e. the BTFEC and the TTF). In many countries, it is common to find a combination of two types of funds in one institution, including: \u2022\ufffd \ufffdAn endowment fund and a sinking fund (i.e. the MCT and the EPF). One of the reasons for combining an endowment fund and sinking fund is that many national funds in least developed countries (LDCs) depend on external sources and many times such funds come in the form of time-bound and ear- marked grants. An initial endowment fund would at least help to cover the core administrative costs 14 National Climate Funds to ensure sustainability of a fund, while the sinking fund can receive and disburse the time-bound and earmarked grants when these come in. \u2022\ufffd \ufffdAn endowment fund and a revolving fund (i.e. the TTF). The TTF is an endowment fund, which makes dis- tributions to a revolving fund. These two funds draw on the comparative advantages of both types of funds, for instance, an endowment fund is useful for long-term planning and can earn investment income (capital ap- preciation and dividends); while a revolving fund pro- vides more flexibility to distribute incomes generated from the main trust fund (or the endowment fund). Sources of capital can come from international (bilat- eral and multilateral) and domestic sources including government budget, private sector (i.e. the EPF re- ceives contributions from private companies) and indi- viduals. The capitalization process can be built up over a certain period of time, or provided at the beginning (establishment) of funds, or a mix of the two options. Table 2 shows different sources of capital of the seven national funds mentioned before. Government budget. For a revolving fund, the capital can come from a portion of government taxes or lev- ies (i.e. on petroleum products in Thailand or on CDM projects in China) and loans. The ENCON fund and the CCDM fund provide examples for countries on how to identify potential sources of revenue for financing cli- mate actions. Revenues can be collected from indus- tries and sectors that are the main emitters of green- house gasses. The collected revenues can further be earmarked for activities that directly contribute to low carbon and climate- resilient development at the na- tional and local levels. External sources. The sources of finance can also be mobilized through development partners and vertical global funds. Dividends and interests from investments. For an endowment fund, the initial capital can be invested in a financial market in instruments such as stocks and bonds with a greater risk involved or in bank deposits and other less risky instruments.

In the case of the CCDM fund and the ENCON fund, public fi- nance is used to leverage private sector finance for en- ergy efficiency and climate mitigation projects. Under both funds, a contract-based cooperation model with commercial banks is implemented, where the fund functions as seed capital to leverage private investment in bankable projects for energy conservation and green- house gas emission reductions. Legal Arrangements The establishment of a national fund requires a legal ba- sis. The legal status of a national fund can be stipulated by a national act or law, which usually includes the gov- erning principles of the fund (i.e. the BTFEC, the ENCON Fund, and the EPF). The governing principles are then detailed in an operation manual that will guide the fi- nancial and administration management of the fund as well as the fiduciary standards. Based on their legal ar- rangements, national funds can be classified as follows: A fund that is an extension of government adminis- tration. The management of such a fund is mandated to a government agency (which is usually stipulated by a government regulation such as an act or a law). For instance, the secretariat of the ENCON Fund is cur- rently within a relevant government agency (Energy Policy and Planning Office). The management of the fund is in compliance with the state financial man- agement standards. The audit process, for instance, is conducted by the central government and is similar to the audit process for other government agencies in the country. This type of fund usually does not have com- mercial banking capacity. Hence, if any, soft loans and other financial instruments financed by such a fund are outsourced to commercial banks. A fund that is managed by an independent body and established by a law (or a government regula- tion). The case of the BTFEC is an example of this type of fund. The trust fund is governed by the Royal Char- ter of the Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation 1996, which provides the governing principles for the BTFEC. The rules and regulations governing the day- to-day operations of the fund are detailed in the Op- eration Manual issued in 2009. Although established by the Royal Charter, the BTFEC is considered as an independent grant maker guided by strategic funding framework. The Director and the secretariat staff are non-civil service positions. A fund that takes the form of a private corpora- tion or a non-profit organization. The MCT can be classified as this type of fund. The MCT was granted a Non-Profit Corporation Charter by the President of the Federated States of Micronesia in November 2002. Subsequently, the MCT obtained its registration as a nonprofit corporation in the Federated States of Mi- cronesia, through a Registry Certificate issued by the Federated States of Micronesia Registrar of Corpora- tions. The MCT adheres to policies and standards set out in its Articles of Incorporation, By-Laws and Opera- tion Manual as duly adopted and approved under the laws of the Federated States of Micronesia. A multi-donor trust fund that operates like a pro- gram/project implemented by a multilateral agency. The implementation of a multi-donor trust fund (MDTF) is usually according to the rules and procedures of the host agency. For instance, the CCCA Trust Fund is man- aged according to the project implementation proce- dures of UNDP as the fund administrator. Each donor of the CCCA Trust Fund enters into a contractual agree- ment with UNDP.

They are usually representing development partners or do- nors providing financial support to a fund. Examples include the Boards of Trustees of the MCT, the Board of Directors for the TTF and the CCCA Trust Fund. Executive Office.15 An executive office is a daily admin- istrative body that is responsible for the administration and financial management under the guidance of a Board of Trustee. A Director is usually assigned to man- age the executive office of a national fund. Depending on the legal status of a fund, staff of an executive office can be government officials or non-civil servants, al- though in most cases, it is the latter. In the case of multi- donor trust funds, such as the CCCA Trust Fund, the sec- retariat staff and a trust fund manager are hired directly by UNDP as the host agency. 14 Alternative names include Board of Directors, Board, Management Board, or Programme Support Board; for funds with a multilateral agency as trustee such as in Cambodia, the terminology Steering Committee is commonly used. 15 Alternative names include a Secretariat or a Management Center. Technical Committee. A technical committee is not necessary a permanent structure within the governing structure of a national fund. In most cases, the tech- nical committee is only formed at the beginning of a project cycle to review and evaluate project proposals and provide recommendations to the Board whether a proposal can be awarded or declined funding. Techni- cal experts serving as members of a technical commit- tee are often involved for a certain period of time to render the services required. Investment Committee. An investment committee is primarily responsible for overseeing the management of financial assets and formulating investment policies. The committee provides recommendations for general investment matters to the Board who will then make final decisions. An investment committee is a crucial body in the management of endowment funds (for in- stance the BTFEC), while for other types of funds, an investment committee can be embedded in an execu- tive office (i.e. the CCDM fund). A fund can also hire a service provider (an investment firm) to help manage its financial assets (i.e. the TTF). Beneficiaries In the case of public (trust) funds, beneficiaries are in- dividuals/groups, who are eligible to receive benefits from the fund (income or principle capital). The benefi- ciaries of national funds for climate change can include civil society, non-governmental organizations, local communities, sector ministries, local governments, and private actors. One of the advantages of NCFs is its ability to reach to stakeholders outside the govern- ment system, particularly considering the crucial roles of private actors and local communities in the efforts of addressing challenges of climate change. NCFs need to create specific instruments or programs targeting different stakeholders to achieve the policy objectives of the fund. Discussion on how to reach beneficiaries efficiently will be discussed in the next section of the Management of NCFs. 17 National Climate Funds Management features of NCFs The management features of NCFs focus mainly on reaching intended beneficiaries and ensuring trans- parency, effectiveness and results-based implemen- tation. Intended beneficiaries and programs to be fi- nanced by a national fund should be considered when developing the design features of NCFs. An operation- al manual usually includes a detailed description of the programs financed by the NCF and guidance on how intended beneficiaries can participate in the programs. Programs financed by an NCF should be refined over time considering the changing socioeconomic and po- litical circumstances, and Operation Manuals regularly reviewed and updated as necessary. Project cycle: transparency and efficiency Different programs apply different procedures, rules and project selection criteria. For grant projects, proj- ect cycles are commonly started by a call for propos- als.

Projects that meet requirements are forwarded to a techni- cal committee for their reviews and comments. Their comments are compiled and shared to the Board of Trustees to help the board make final approval or dis- approval of projects. Once the projects are approved, executive staff carry out a due diligence exercise to make sure the project proponent can manage the proj- ect funds with prudence. For loan projects, the implementation can be out- sourced to commercial banks, development banks or financial institutions depending on the capacity of the executive office managing a fund. The ENCON fund, for instance, provides soft loans for enterprises to pro- mote energy efficiency and renewable energy through eleven commercial banks. In the case of CCDM fund, loan (investment) projects are managed directly by the executive office (the CCDM fund Management Center). In the CCDM fund, investment projects are identified in cooperation with provincial finance bureaus, where potential applicants are invited to file their applica- tions. Following the submission of project proposals, provincial finance bureaus will conduct the neces- sary due diligence, where the CCDM fund will provide management fees to the bureaus for the service. The Management Center will consider national economic, industrial and climate policies when reviewing invest- ment projects. For an investment project that is larger than RMB 70 million (US$ 11 million), approval from the Board is required as it is considered a strategically important project. Projects with a total value of less than RMB 70 million will be approved by the CCDM fund Management Centre. Hiring a manager to implement each program fi- nanced by a national fund may be necessary to in- crease effectiveness of program implementation and reduce the burden of the executive office. To imple- ment the TEERF, DEDE has been working with commer- cial banks to provide soft loans for businesses. Having commercial banks to manage the Revolving Fund is advantageous because of their capacity in managing loans and dealing with lenders. The program can also create awareness for commercial banks about the im- portance of providing loans for energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives. In contrast, to manage the ESCO fund of the ENCON fund, two fund managers from non-profit organizations have been appointed. As previously discussed, the fund managers have been proactive in working with SMEs and ensuring the en- terprises to access the ESCO fund. The governing body of a fund, including the Board, the Executive Office and appointed Program Managers, owe a fiduciary duty to their beneficiaries. A fiduciary duty is a legal or ethical relationship of confidence or trust between the governing body and beneficiaries. Fiduciary standards, therefore, require the trustee to act in the best interests of their beneficiaries and to ad- minister the trust with care and prudence. In the case 18 National Climate Funds of NCFs, fiduciary standards should: 1) ensure that al- located budget is used for the purpose for which it is intended; and 2) ensure that funds are managed (in- vested) and spent in an efficient and transparent man- ner as possible in order to maximize value for money. Donors and vertical global funds apply different fidu- ciary standards and requirements. For instance, the Global Environment Facility and the Adaptation Fund have different fiduciary standards, and the GCF will also have its own standards. Noting all these funds have their own standards, as an example, the fiduciary standards applied by the Adaptation Fund are provid- ed in Box 3. Working with beneficiaries at the local level One of the strategic objectives of NCFs can be to en- sure that sufficient financial resources are allocated and directly channeled to local communities and other potential beneficiaries. However, despite specific allo- cation of resources for local stakeholders, often it is dif- ficult for them to access these resources due to several barriers, such as low capacity in developing project proposals. Working with local beneficiaries requires NCFs to pursue strategies such as developing capacity of local stakeholders and building learning networks throughout project implementation. The Lao EPF, for instance, has been successful in reaching local benefi- ciaries as a result of continuous support provided by the executive office to potential beneficiaries in the form of training and other forms of capacity develop- ment. In the case of the MCT, training by experts from its two peer learning networks (Micronesians in Island Conservation and Pacific Islands Managed and Protect- ed Areas Community) is provided when the needs for capacity development are identified. NCFs should also have some flexibility to ensure that the right beneficiaries, especially the local stakehold- ers, will get a fair chance to access", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e54f760d-8ea6-46dd-a392-fc9ed03766b5": {"__data__": {"id_": "e54f760d-8ea6-46dd-a392-fc9ed03766b5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-funds-learning-experience-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National Climate Funds: Learning from the experience of Asia-Pacific countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-funds-learning-experience-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e47a76b7b9f31f9d3a42d541bec64f2b80213dac1a217615228442dfc3d20cfa"}, "3": {"node_id": "e934636f-2e00-4452-9be9-1e39a7d9e159", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-funds-learning-experience-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2c834e192be40e153020b54ec7a91a55a8faa2a1a20d5baa3e3dd36d5b83ec9c"}}, "hash": "a551d50416f3d99d344f1ac3053134c5cf19f438debaba1393823010bd152e96", "text": "the fund.

Fiduciary Standards: the Adaptation Fund The fiduciary standards of the Adaptation Fund cover the following aspects: 1. Financial management and integrity a. accurately and regularly record transactions and balances in a manner that adheres to broadly accepted good practices, and are audited periodically by an independent firm or organization b. Managing and disbursing funds efficiently and with safeguards to recipients on a timely basis c. Produce forward-looking financial plans and budgets d. Legal status to contact with the Adaptation Fund and third parties 2. Requisite institutional capacity a. Procurement procedures which provide for transparent practices, including competition b. Capacity to undertake monitoring and evaluation c. Ability to identify, develop and appraise project \u2013 ex ante and ex post \u2013 technically, legally, financially, economically, socially and environmentally d. Competency to manage or oversee the execution of the project including ability to manage sub-recipients, fit for purpose infrastructure and resource to support project delivery and implementation 3. Transparency and self - investigative powers a. Competence to deal with financial mis-management and other forms of malpractice Source: http://adaptation-fund.org/system/files/AFB.B.6.4_Fiduciary_Standards.pdf 19 National Climate Funds will request participation of a more established NGO to function as the so-called fiscal sponsor. Performance based monitoring NCFs should perform both technical and financial mon- itoring. The financial monitoring includes scrutinizing the disbursement and the utility of the finances, while the technical monitoring requires the assessment of projects\u2019 progress and achievement of their intended purposes. It is also imperative to measure the impact of projects. Grantees need to submit progress reports, both financial and technical, to an executive office pe- riodically. The Executive Office should keep the Board informed on the progress of its activities through regu- lar progress reports. Annual reports covering technical progress and (externally) audited financial statements can also be put into the public domain. Considering low capacity of local stakeholders to write a progress report, the monitoring and reporting sys- tem for local beneficiaries often needs to be simpli- fied. The EPF, for instance, accepts oral submission for a progress report. The executive office of the EPF ar- ranges a stakeholder meeting periodically at the pro- vincial level, where all beneficiaries receiving funds from the EPF will be invited. In the meeting, which is usually chaired by the Vice Governor, all beneficiaries will verbally report the progress of their projects. A rep- resentative from the EPF will then prepare the minutes of meeting where details of the verbal discussion will be noted down. Following the meeting, the minutes will be circulated to all beneficiaries for them to agree on what is written, including the progress of the proj- ects and their future action plans. Based on the agreed minutes, the EPF will conduct regular monitoring of project implementation. The monitoring and evaluation of NCFs themselves need to focus on measuring the impacts of the pro- grams. To enable the monitoring of results, quantita- tive targets and key performance indicators should be put in place. For instance, the impacts of funds spent on climate mitigation can be measured based on the total emission reductions achieved. The Revolving Fund, financed by the ENCON Fund, set a range of Key Performance Indicators (KPI) to monitor the perfor- mance of the Fund. Participating banks are required to provide monthly reports to DEDE. Based on the re- ports, DEDE assesses the achievement or performance of the Revolving Fund, including the total of electricity and oil saving per year. For example, in 2008, the total revolving fund loan was US$ 94.7 million, while the to- tal electricity and oil saving were US$ 31.3 million and US$ 42.5 million respectively.

TEERF is implemented by eleven commercial banks and monitored by Department of Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency (DEDE). Follow- ing a review conducted by DEDE, it was found that it had been mostly large businesses that benefited from TEERF. Based on this review, DEDE considered the need to establish a specific program to attract investors for small projects, mostly implemented by small and me- dium enterprises (SMEs). To achieve the objective, the Energy Service Company (ESCO) fund was then intro- duced in 2008, where non-profit organizations were appointed as the fund managers. 20 National Climate Funds Recommendations Based on the analysis conducted on existing national funds in Asia Pacific, several lessons-learned can be synthesized to provide policy recommendations for decision makers on the three important phases: decid- ing about the establishment and the design of an NCF as well as when managing an NCF. 16 16 It varies between countries. In Thailand, for instance, the Bureau of Bud- get under the Prime Minister office has the authority to compile the expected revenue and expenditures of government agencies and state enterprises and develop state budget documents. Box 4: Questions to guide decision makers in conducting a feasibility analysis prior to establishing an NCF Strategic Role: 1. What is the strategic role of the proposed NCF in the context of financing the country\u2019s climate change policy objectives? Recommendation: NCFs can play the following (combination of) roles: earmark of government revenue, pool or blend resources, generate income from investments and achieve specific purposes (i.e. distribute financial resources to local communities; leverage private investments), to promote low emission and climate-resilient development. Caution: A popular reason for establishing an NCF in Asia-Pacific is that a fund can play a role as a stepping-stone as coordinated planning and subsequent structured budgeting within the regular government system for climate change could be hard to achieve in the short-term. Many countries cannot wait to have all their processes and institutional arrangements in place to address the increasing pressure to act upon impacts generated by climate change,. Hence, NCFs are expected to address urgent needs to start with, with high-level, cross-sectoral political representation. However, countries need to be mindful when establishing NCFs as a stepping-stone. Learning from the experiences in the region, the establishment of funds takes time and resources. For instance, the establishment of the CCCA Trust Fund, which has the simplest design features of a national fund, took 2 years from the negotiation process until the first call for project proposals. If a country decides to establish an NCF as a stepping-stone, a long-term plan should be agreed upon and put in place upfront to be clear upfront on the next steps beyond the NCF (see below on financial feasibility). 2. What are other available options (alternative to an NCF) in your country? Example: If the main purpose of an NCF is to manage earmarked government revenue for climate change, decision- makers can consider issuing a regulation to set aside a portion of government budget for a specific purpose and channel it through the formal budget system. For instance, several developing countries (i.e. Indonesia), by law, set aside and spend a portion of its annual national and local expenditure for specific sectors, such as education. Recommendation: A country should avoid establishing an NCF when there is no added-value that justifies the amount of resources to be spent for establishing it, particularly when other options are available (i.e. channeling through a formal government budget system or expanding an existing national fund to include a window focusing on climate change). 3. Who are the main beneficiaries? Recommendation: NCFs can be established to ensure that necessary channels are available to reach those who need the funds most, such as the most vulnerable at the frontline of climate adaptation and private actors in the case of climate mitigation. These beneficiaries are often excluded when financial resources are channeled through a formal government system. Prior to deciding on NCFs, a thorough analysis is required to: 1) assess the overall climate finance landscape; 2) consider the specific objective that an NCF aims to achieve and 3) how it can contribute to achieving national policies on climate change. Building on the experiences with national funds in Asia- Pacific countries, this paper has proposed a set of feasi- bility criteria to guide conducting a feasibility analysis. Several questions that can guide decision-makers in conducting a feasibility analysis are proposed in Box 4. 21 National Climate Funds Caution: if the main beneficiaries are government agencies, an NCF should avoid duplicating the function of ministry of finance who is responsible for allocating", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e5f52d8f-b93a-4ea8-8ae0-50226b09ec24": {"__data__": {"id_": "e5f52d8f-b93a-4ea8-8ae0-50226b09ec24", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-funds-learning-experience-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National Climate Funds: Learning from the experience of Asia-Pacific countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-funds-learning-experience-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "43203ace092864edaf85db2bbf7f25cf7110490a598fe03d91e01bc3e2349dd2"}}, "hash": "43203ace092864edaf85db2bbf7f25cf7110490a598fe03d91e01bc3e2349dd2", "text": "budget to government agencies.16 For instance, the ENCON fund provides grants for government agencies, non-governmental organizations as well as research institutions and also finances several financial instruments to promote energy efficiency. The amount of fund allocated to provide grants for government agencies are rather a significant portion of the total ENCON fund. This portion of the fund is managed by a directorate within the Ministry of Energy. Managing hundreds of grant projects has caused a very high workload for the directorate, which performs a rather similar function to the Bureau of Budget and the Ministry of Finance. NCFs need to avoid playing a role that is similar to a government system, and focus on strategic roles that cannot be performed by a regular budget process. Political feasibility 1. Is there any existing mechanism that can be expanded for accessing and managing climate finance (which may be more cost effective rather than establishing a new NCF)? 2. Who are the main stakeholders that will need to make the decision on establishing an NCF? Who will support and oppose to the idea of establishing an NCF? Why and what can be done to influence their positions? 3. What is the legal framework that will be required to establish an NCF or to expand the mandate of the existing national fund to address the issues of climate change? If a regulation is required, who can/should issue it? 4. Do the government/donors have political commitment to provide sustainable source of finance? If not, how can financial resources be mobilized and sustained? Human and institutional capacity 1. What is the existing capacity for establishing and managing an NCF (i.e. financial management and fund operations)? 2. Are there existing (national/international) institutions that meet international fiduciary standards? Can these institutions be involved in the management of an NCF? Or can the mandates of these institutions be expanded to access and manage climate finance? 3. Is there any human resources capacity available in managing a fund according to the required fiduciary standards? If yes, can they easily be recruited? If not, how much investment should be allocated to develop the capacity before a fund can be fully operationalized? Cost and time consideration 1. How quick do you expect an NCF to be operationalized? 2. How does this timeframe take into consideration the complexity of the funds design (type, beneficiaries, capacity, etc.)? 3. How much resources are you willing to invest prior to the establishment of the fund? How much resources are you willing to invest in developing human and institutional capacity to manage an NCF? 4. Who will cover the costs of establishing the fund? Financial Sustainability 1. If the main purpose of an NCF is to pool external resources, how committed are donors in providing finances? Is the finance provided as a one-time contribution or is a source for regular replenishment for capital available? 2. If the main purpose of an NCF is to ensure sustainable income from investments to provide grants for financing climate actions, how much upfront capital is required to generate the expected amount of interests/dividends? Recommendations: An endowment fund may be very useful for least developed countries where the contribution of external finance is often higher than government resources in financing climate actions. For middle-income countries, an endowment fund may be useful if an NCF aims to provide sustainable income for providing small grants tolocal communities. After a country decides to establish of an NCF, specific design features should be selected according to the NCF proposed objectives. The selection of design fea- tures should also take into account the political com- mitment of government/donors that can be secured (in providing capital), the resources required (or willing to be invested) to establish the fund, and the target time when the fund should be operationalized. 22 National Climate Funds When the objective of NCFs is to pool external fi- nancial resources and channel them to immediate beneficiaries, a sinking fund may be considered as an option to access and manage climate finance. A sinking fund is the simplest type of a national fund (Figure 2). Depending on the legal framework of a country, estab- lishment of a sinking fund does not require an approv- al from parliaments nor an issuance of a government regulation, particularly when a fund is operating like a traditional project/program of development partners. A multilateral agency (i.e. UN agencies and develop- ment banks) can be assigned to administer the fund in the interim until the institutional and human resource capacity in a country is developed. This arrangement should be seen as an immediate and temporary solu- tion.

When the purpose of NCFs is to channel earmarked government budget to intended beneficiaries, a national fund can be created in the form a revolving fund (i.e. to manage a portion of government taxes or levies earmarked for climate change). Establishing a revolving fund will require a stronger legal basis, and often a longer political process, compared to a sinking fund. The political process may take longer because governments should be committed to ear- mark a portion of their taxes or levies for an indefinite period of time. The establishment of a revolving fund is often legalized by a government regulation or an act. The ENCON Fund, for instance, required around three years to be operational after the issuance of the ENCON Act, although it was unclear about the length of the political process required to pass the Act. More- over, the collection of revenues is often under the re- sponsibility of an executive office of a national fund. In the case of the CCDM fund, the management center is responsible for the collection of the levies on CDM projects in China and the management and distribu- tion of the collected revenues. The principle capital of a revolving fund can also be invested in a financial market to generate interest or dividends. However, in most cases, the investments are in the form of risk- free financial instruments. The capacity to manage such investments is generally lower compared to the management of an endowment fund. When the purpose of NCFs is to generate sustain- able income from investments and channel it to in- tended beneficiaries, an endowment fund would re- quire a more sophisticated arrangement and capacity, particularly in the management of assets or funds that are invested in financial markets. An endowment fund is common in Least Developed Countries as an innova- tive option to generate sustainable income from the re- turns of investments. However, returns generated from endowment funds are rather small in scale. To ensure that endowment funds generate sufficient returns to finance climate actions, it would require more capital upfront. In the management of an endowment fund, investment losses can occur, therefore, a sophisticated system should be put in place to manage such a fund. When capacity is lacking, a national fund can hire an investment manager to oversee the investment. In the case of Bhutan, an investment manager was first hired, before slowly moving to be a fully Bhutanese commit- tee (with an international consultant hired to provide investment advice on a regular basis). Finally, capacity building is an important element in the establishment and the management of an NCF. Sufficient capacity is necessary not only for the govern- ing body of a fund (including trustees, executive offic- es and investment committees) but also the intended beneficiaries of a fund so that they can access financial resources allocated for them. A strong capacity devel- opment strategy, particularly in financial management and fund operations, should be developed as an inte- gral part of the NCF design to ensure that it obtains sufficient attention and resources. 23 National Climate Funds Less To pool external source: multi-donor trust fund To earmark government resources: revolving fund Time required to establish >5 years Usually managed by an independent body Challenges: capacity Investment: Endowment Fund More Time required to establish: 1-2 years* Operating like a project: international agencies running the Executive Office Challenges: establishing governing body and moving to be a nationalized fund A law is usually required - time required to establish a fund after a laws is issued: around 3 years** The executive office should have the capacity to collect revenue - usually managed by an independent body or an extension of government administration Challenges: securing long-term commitment for regular replenishment of capital Time required to establish: 5 years*** Usually managed by an independent body \u2013 with an investment committee (or hired investment firm) to manage assets Challenges: capacity to manage investment portfolio (incl. dealing with risks of financial loss) Required Time and Resources One-time contribution Regular replenishment * The process includes political negotiations with relevant stakeholders (particularly donors) and setting up necessary rules and regulations,until a fund is fully operationalized ** The process does not include the time required for political negotiations for a law to be issued. *** The process includes political negotiations with relevant stakeholders (particularly donors), resource mobilization, and setting up necessary rules and regulations, until a fund is fully operationalized.

Figure 2: Potential NCF designs Sequencing of funds: endowment and revolving or sinking fund 24 National Climate Funds Annex 1 Views from practitioners about advantages and concerns on managing climate finance through formal budget systems and National Climate Funds that emerged from discussions in preparation for this paper. Possible advantages of managing climate finance through formal government budget systems: \u2022\ufffd \ufffdMuch climate expenditure already flows through national budget \u2013 Climate actions are currently fi- nanced mostly by national budgets and the contri- bution of external finance is expected to be smaller, particularly in middle-income countries.17 Hence, external finance would be best channeled through formal budget processes. External funds can be treated as external \u201crevenue,\u201d that is raised inter- nationally rather than domestically. So as with any fiscal revenue, the funds should be captured in the national budget process. \u2022\ufffd \ufffdFormal budget processes engage all government agencies led by Ministry of Finance \u2013 Using formal government budget systems will ensure a compre- hensive fiscal framework for climate expenditure because of the comprehensive nature of the bud- get government process involving all government agencies. This will reduce duplication and fragmen- tation in climate relevant public expenditure. \u2022\ufffd \ufffdBudget can disperse large volumes of finance \u2013 Due to the scale and nature of climate finance, which will be in higher magnitude than the previous envi- ronment finance, there has a strong argument to use the formal budget system to access and manage climate finance as it can handle large volumes of fi- nance. \u2022\ufffd \ufffdAllows funds to \u201ctop-up\u201d sector spending to sup- port \u201cmainstreaming\u201d of climate \u2013 In many devel- oping countries, the government budget system 17 See reports on Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR) conducted in five countries including Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ne- pal, Thailand and Samoa, on http://www.aideffectiveness.org/CPEIR-Work- shop2012 has established mechanisms for channeling finance for development activities in different sectors. Cli- mate finance managed through the formal govern- ment system can allow the government to top-up sector spending to move towards low carbon and climate-resilient development. Possible concerns about managing climate finance through formal government budget systems: \u2022\ufffd \ufffdIssue of earmarking: The allocation of government budget involves political negotiations during the budget process that provides no guarantee that sufficient financial resources will be allocated for cli- mate change, particularly when government need to prioritize scarce domestic resources. \u2022\ufffd \ufffdPotential limited outreach to non-government beneficiaries: Channeling climate finance through formal government systems may limit opportunities to reach out to beneficiaries who have no direct ac- cess to the systems, particularly civil society, private actors and local communities to finance climate ac- tions on the ground. Possible advantages of managing climate finance through National Funds: \u2022\ufffd \ufffdPool international climate finance \u2013 In a number of cases, a national fund is established at the request of donors who need to highlight to their constituen- cies that they spend their financial assistance on cli- mate change. Donors therefore wish their finances for climate change to be insulated from other finan- cial flows in the receiving government its general budget, so that money can be easily tracked from source to beneficiaries. At the same time, there is a shared responsibility on international climate fi- nance: For example, developed countries should make international climate finance available in a timely and predictable manner which is important for the sustainability of NCFs. Aid effectiveness prin- ciples should be used as guidance. \u2022\ufffd \ufffdBlend international, national, public and private finance. An NCF with banking functions can blend various sources of international, national, public and 25 National Climate Funds private finance together. In this way, an NCF can catalyze further finance toward a country\u2019s climate and development objectives. This can be particu- larly effective at the project level, where NCFs can bring together loans and grants to increase the vol- ume and impact of its work. \u2022\ufffd \ufffdEnsure government funds are earmarked specifi- cally for climate actions \u2013 When climate finance is channeled through the formal budget system, the allocation of financial resources will be decided through political negotiations in the government budgeting process. There is no guarantee that suf- ficient budget will be allocated for climate change, unless it is being earmarked legally by a govern- ment regulation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "34e91040-cc8e-4e8f-980c-43074a3220eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "34e91040-cc8e-4e8f-980c-43074a3220eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-funds-learning-experience-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National Climate Funds: Learning from the experience of Asia-Pacific countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-funds-learning-experience-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bfc9a7e31b4c213e243de1ea89c5ca84da200a9cf5992f7a82097379c2f6ef33"}, "2": {"node_id": "19ecd6d3-9390-4584-801f-1daf382df884", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-funds-learning-experience-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e6b237769b6f6881f773179628e39e8cbec0358b9980e3d3c68f469f892a3995"}}, "hash": "34c3409c4a90f8fbe30a4571e35a10b1f9306965dd3bbc129841db488c12a836", "text": "Channeling government budget through national climate funds can serve as a clear signal of government commitment to the issue of climate change.

Possible concerns about managing climate finance through National Funds: \u2022\ufffd \ufffdDisconnect with overall government budget processes \u2013 Managing climate finance outside formal government systems can compromise the discipline of the resource allocation process. There is a real risk that national climate funds may man- age financial flows not in conjunction with the na- tional budget process. As funding sources become fragmented, there is a danger that the benefit of a unified approach of how government resources are being allocated is lost, which can lead to gaps and overlaps in expenditure. The findings of the Ban- gladesh CPEIR are indicative in this regard: there is a proliferation of funding mechanisms within the country, each with their own institutional arrange- ments, through which sector Ministries could po- tentially request additional financing.19 \u2022\ufffd \ufffdIssues in transparency and accountability \u2013 Ex- tra-budgetary funds are sometimes associated with the dilution of accountability and control and also problems in reporting and consolidating fiscal da- ta.20 National budgets should be transparent so that decision makers have all relevant issues and infor- mation before them when they make decisions. It is difficult, for example, for the Ministry of Finance to allocate resources strategically to climate change programs if it does not have information on the al- locations of national climate funds. On the other hand, there are also in a number of countries serious concerns about transparency and accountability of government systems, and national funds have been used in various cases to bypass such systems, ensur- ing the beneficiaries will be reached in the most ef- fective manner. Whether an NCF can improve or de- crease transparency and accountability depends on how its governance structure is designed and how well Government\u2019s structures function. 19 Miller (2012) Making Sense of Climate Finance, UNDP Asia Pacific Region- al Office, Bangkok. 20 Allen and Radev (2010) Extrabudgetary Funds, OECD, Paris.

Cherie Hart from the UNDP RCB provided invaluable support with regards to advocacy and media outreach. Global oil prices have been rising steadily and now have hit an all-time high of US$84 per barrel. UNDP commissioned this Report because there is evidence that these rising oil prices are starting to bite, most severely at the incomes and lives of the region\u2019s poor. Governments have been trying to protect the vulnerable \u2013 either by providing subsidies, or by obliging public oil companies not to pass on the full international price increases to local consumers. However, these policies are becoming difficult to sustain. The political and social consequences are severe. Over the past few years, people across the region have taken to the streets in various Asian countries in reaction to significant fuel price hikes. This Report examines how oil price rises are affecting the region\u2019s poorest people. To capture this, it starts with a survey of day-to-day realities on the ground. The results are deeply disturbing. Over the last three years,households in the region are paying,on average,171 percent more for cooking fuels,120 percent more for transportation, 67 percent more for electricity and 55 percent more for lighting fuels. This Report also develops an Oil Price Vulnerability Index (OPVI). This is a composite of selected indicators that reflects not just a country\u2019s economic performance and the resilience of its economy,but also the extent to which it depends on imported oil.For 24 countries for which the index has been calculated, 13 have been flagged as relatively vulnerable, with high OPVIs. However, macroeconomic consequences have not yet become fully visible in many countries, although rates of inflation have shown a tendency to rise. The current price rises should, however, not be viewed simply as the source of an impending crisis.They also offer an opportunity to seek new and promising directions. Indeed, many countries have the chance to redesign policy to achieve not just national energy security, but also security at the household level.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d8a24645-80b8-4756-bfaa-a42d794e2505": {"__data__": {"id_": "d8a24645-80b8-4756-bfaa-a42d794e2505", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ab7df032d9bf2329e8a22a413f640ebf9209c9db5a8ac47e010cba4d77da9d4f"}, "2": {"node_id": "1322296c-ee12-4ff1-b06d-528db70101f7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b64e63e918d8d5e9a06f91d04a4cfad0c43c7a4fed92c48c87112b0307d0828"}}, "hash": "8256d5a582d11eddf61e275c4154d1f161d555f7f3e435ac5a6a292ee708de7a", "text": "The Report proposes the establishment of an Asia-Pacific Compensatory Oil Finance Facility for least developed countries and small island developing states with a two-fold purpose: first, to help tide poorer countries over the immediate balance of payments or fiscal deficits provoked by the oil price hike; second, to enable countries to invest in alternative forms of energy so that they become less dependent on imported oil.

Finally, we would like to thank Peter Stalker and Kay Kirby Dorji for their diligent editing. In taking on the subject of oil prices and the poor, we were humbled by the fact that no single mind or book can comprehensively address the issues under consideration. We hope that the analyses of ground-level realities and possible policy responses will prove useful to decision makers and other stakeholders in devising strategies aimed at mitigating the impacts of rising oil prices on poor people. We are hopeful that the Report will catalyze a constructive dialogue with development partners, and that the impacts on poor people will become an important consideration in the development of future policy responses.

Summary Across Asia and the Pacific, soaring oil prices are threatening the prospects of millions of poor households \u2013 and posing an unforeseen challenge to the Millennium Development Goals. Since 2003, prices have been rising inexorably, from around US$22 to above US$80 a barrel now, and have been showing little sign of easing. Indeed, many developing countries in the region are likely to become even more exposed to rising prices, as measured in this Report by a new \u2018Oil Price Vulnerability Index\u2019 (OPVI). In response, the Report represents a set of policy options and priorities that can help reduce national vulnerability to future price rises and protect the interests of the poor. How oil price rises have hit the poor The Report starts by asking poor communities how they have been affected by rising oil prices. For this purpose, field studies were carried out in rural and urban areas of four countries: China, India, Indonesia and Lao PDR, interviewing 500 mostly poor households along with local authorities, public service institutions and other community stakeholders. These communities used four main petroleum fuels \u2013 kerosene, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), diesel and gasoline. In addition, farming communities use chemical fertilizers for which the feedstocks are often petroleum products and natural gas. Kerosene \u2013 Rural communities mainly use kerosene for lighting whereas urban households use it for both lighting and cooking. LPG \u2013 Most urban households prefer this for cooking because it is convenient, efficient and clean, though many rural households may opt to cook with traditional fuels. Diesel \u2013 In rural areas diesel can be used as a fuel for farm machinery and as a source of electricity in power generators. The poorest households, however, tend to use diesel more indirectly, through public transportation. Gasoline \u2013 This is the least significant fuel for poor households, since it is used mainly in cars and motorcycles that relatively few can afford. Chemical fertilizers \u2013 Expenditure on petroleum- based fertilizers can be quite substantial for poor households. The poor communities interviewed experienced steep increases in the retail prices of all these oil products. Before 2003, they had been protected to some extent by government subsidies. But when prices started on their upward spiral, these policies proved difficult to sustain and subsidy shields are steadily being stripped away. In some countries, the resulting price increases have provoked a public backlash,posing a dilemma for governments torn between the conflicting priorities of fiscal prudence and social justice. Between 2002 and 2005, the households interviewed suffered some dramatic price increases, paying as a whole 74 percent more for their energy needs.This included: \u2022 171 percent more for cooking fuels; \u2022 120 percent more for transportation; \u2022 67 percent more for electricity; \u2022 55 percent more for lighting fuels; and \u2022 33 percent more for petroleum-based fertilizers and other agricultural inputs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "65a54eb8-bcac-4203-96c5-40673776ab76": {"__data__": {"id_": "65a54eb8-bcac-4203-96c5-40673776ab76", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "effc89c5aff3f4e343cd86cde75d07fdb1566043dc21869769650cb27c0e1d53"}, "2": {"node_id": "2c56a547-f833-4855-bc69-6879372783bb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dc674f69e13bf913a63474d2124f0368589e0f4f931749706dfde6f454ccf505"}}, "hash": "3599fab153b8de955111de3831aed30d9e8eab4bb7beafac336b05b20f31f172", "text": "The survey asked how they had coped with these increases.Most reported they had,to some extent, been climbing down the \u2018energy ladder\u2019 and reverting to inferior fuels.

Or they are simply going without: if they cannot afford kerosene for lamps during power outages, they stay in darkness. Faced with rising fares, families have also had to cut back on transport. Unable to afford public buses, they may now be walking to the nearest health centre or school. Or they may simply have cut back on travel: urban migrant workers in India, for example, now return less frequently to their home villages. Executive Summary On the whole, rising oil prices have left the poor with few choices other than to cut back on their consumption of oil products or make other cuts in their household budgets.The urban poor tend to be worse off since they do not have the alternative of collecting fuelwood or other biomass. The rural poor, however, are more vulnerable to higher prices for lighting fuels, especially in unelectrified villages.They are also at a greater disadvantage when high transport costs isolate them from essential services that they do not have in their villages. In India, rising transport costs have compelled a number of households in both rural and urban areas to move their children from better but more distant schools to others closer to their homes, and, as a result, the quality of children\u2019s education has suffered. Switching back to biomass fuels has especially serious consequences for women and children, who not only suffer from increased pollution at home, but also have to spend more time and effort gathering fuels. And to meet rising household fuel bills, women have in addition been forced to take on extra work outside the home. In fact, given the steep price rise it is surprising that the effects have not been more severe.This is largely because many of these households might be classified as \u2018near-poor\u2019 \u2013 they have a small financial cushion that can temporarily absorb the additional expenses. But if oil prices continue on their present trajectory, these resources will soon be exhausted and households will find that these price increases are not only undermining their present lifestyles but also their future prospects. Less able to provide a decent education for their children, to work because of an unhealthy home environment, and to use transport to seize opportunities to earn additional income, many poor families are seeing their futures compromised. The macroeconomic impact Millions of poor people have been hit by these rising prices. But the effects do not yet seem to have been severe on national economies. Certainly the impact has been nothing as severe as might have been expected based on the experience 30 years ago.The current rising prices are, however, in many respects different from those during the oil shock of the 1970s.Although the increases have been substantial and persistent, they are nonetheless not as steep as before. Their cause too is slightly different: in the 1970s, the sudden hikes were due primarily to disruptions in supply,but over the past five years, the increases have been due more to strong demand, as well as to geopolitical and other factors that have kept supplies tight. Prices have also become more volatile. Previously, fluctuations in supply and demand were dampened by three main buffers: surplus production capacity among OPEC members, large oil inventories,and surplus refining capacity in consuming countries. All three buffers have, however, been shrinking, and, as a result, the world oil market has become much less predictable. This uncertain environment could have serious long-term implications for the Asia- Pacific region,particularly for the least developed countries and for the poorest communities,which have faced sudden rises in the price of energy. Rising oil prices do not appear to have stifled economic growth, which has continued to flourish, both at the global level and within Asian developing countries. The price rises might also have stoked inflation, but at the global level this does not appear to have happened either; indeed, inflation declined, though in developing countries in Asia there have been some signs of rising inflation. Another possible outcome is that higher prices could have encouraged countries to become less oil intensive to use fewer barrels of oil per unit of GDP. In fact, many countries had already been reducing their dependence on oil in the 1990s,so this trend largely continues. Even so, the region\u2019s oil intensity remains higher than the global average and is likely to stay quite high. In India and China, for example, growth in demand is expected to cause oil consumption to rise by about 3 percent per year. Why have the macroeconomic effects been so small?

Another factor is that governments have often shielded consumers from the price increases through subsidies, which has helped to curb inflation. Of course, it is possible too that the macroeconomic effects have simply been delayed, and could emerge in the future, especially if recent increases represent the start of a long upward trend. 2 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific National vulnerability to oil price rises Rising oil prices affect every country, but some are more exposed than others: those that are highly oil dependent perhaps, or those relying heavily on imports. One indicator of dependence is \u2018oil intensity,\u2019 the amount of oil required to produce a unit of economic output. On this basis, both large and small countries are vulnerable to high oil prices for different reasons. Larger countries like China, India and Thailand appear to be more vulnerable because they have high oil intensities and also depend heavily on oil imports. Some smaller countries are also at risk, including Cambodia, Nepal and the Pacific Island Countries,as they are heavily oil import dependent for critical purposes such as transport and power generation. As they have developed, particularly at the outset, most countries have become more oil intensive. But at higher levels of per capita GDP, their oil intensity can start to drop as they switch to cleaner and more efficient forms of energy. China and India, for example, have been able to slow the rate of growth in oil consumption without sacrificing economic growth. At lower levels of income, the transition to more modern fuels can trigger a substantial improvement in human development. So while it might be tempting to encourage countries at early stages of economic development to reduce their dependence on oil, this could also deny many people the benefits of modern energy \u2013 not just the comfort and convenience it brings but also the economic opportunities it creates. Nevertheless,it should be possible to enable poor people to switch to some extent to non-oil sources without sacrificing human development. Even if the poor now rely on kerosene and LPG as \u2018transition fuels,\u2019 they can, as their incomes increase, switch to natural gas or electricity. National vulnerability to oil price increases depends not just on oil intensity and on how much of the oil has to be imported, but also on the resilience of the economy. To highlight the relative vulnerability of countries, this Report presents an \u2018Oil Price Vulnerability Index\u2019. It incorporates variables that represent economic strength, economic performance and the extent to which countries base their growth on the use of oil. The country occupying first place, that is, the least vulnerable,is Iran,followed by China and Malaysia. At the other end of the scale are countries with low economic strength, lower economic performance and high oil dependency \u2013 such as Cambodia, Maldives and Vanuatu. Based on their OPVIs, countries can be grouped into one of three categories:high,medium or low: \u2022 Low vulnerable countries (low OPVI) \u2013 China, Iran, Malaysia \u2022 Medium vulnerable countries (medium OPVI) \u2013 Bhutan, India, Indonesia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea,Thailand,Viet Nam \u2022 High vulnerable countries (high OPVI) \u2013 Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Fiji, Lao PDR, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka,Vanuatu Reducing oil price vulnerability What should countries do to reduce their vulnerability? Clearly, they will want to boost supplies and restrain demand. But they will also need to find ways of managing oil price risks while at the same time preparing for potential oil shocks. The options can be divided into five categories: Managing oil price risk \u2013 Many governments have shielded consumers from the effects of oil price rises through a series of pricing measures that have regulated the \u2018pass-through\u2019of global prices to domestic prices.They have often, for example, subsidized petroleum products, smoothed prices for consumers by adjusting the rates of taxation, or passed the subsidy burden on to the private sector by requiring companies to absorb international oil price increases. Governments can also try to offset the impact on the poor by compensating them in various ways, through cash transfer schemes and other forms of safety nets. To deal with price volatility, they might also be able to use sophisticated financial products, including futures and swaps. Other options include building up oil price stabilization funds and engaging in long-term supply contracts. Enhancing oil supply \u2013 Though the supply of oil is finite, governments can take a number of measures to enhance supplies. They can, for example, strengthen oil exploration", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "be2806f6-a355-48f5-80a1-bcfa7b1f90ea": {"__data__": {"id_": "be2806f6-a355-48f5-80a1-bcfa7b1f90ea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f06f9062c2492fefe342c1484e22d960295f5e8b2ae023412abb4a75f4a8de93"}}, "hash": "f06f9062c2492fefe342c1484e22d960295f5e8b2ae023412abb4a75f4a8de93", "text": "and extraction and increase refining capacity. They can also diversify their sources of supply, by investing in foreign oil fields, perhaps, or importing from a wider range of countries, or tapping the region\u2019s own oil resources by expanding cross-border trade between producing and consuming countries. Another option is to engage in barter, trading manufactured products, industrial crops or services for oil. Executive Summary 3 In contrast to the 1970s,recent increases in oil prices have been due more to strong demand than to tight supplies Restraining oil demand \u2013 This does not mean cutting demand at the cost of economic or social activity, but rather increasing efficiency and concentrating the use of oil on purposes for which cheaper alternatives are unavailable.In the transport sector, this would include improving public transport and reducing fuel wastage in cars through congestion charges in cities, and encouraging industry and households to use energy-efficient equipment. Diversifying fuels \u2013 Restraining demand for oil will have to be accompanied by efforts to switch, in the medium and long term,from oil to alternative sources, including natural gas, coal, large hydro and renewable energy technologies. The consumption of natural gas, for example, is expected to rise significantly, particularly for power generation and also to some extent for transport.Some countries also have the option of using more coal, particularly through clean coal technologies. Preparing for emergencies \u2013 Each country also needs to prepare for abrupt disruptions in oil supplies, by building strategic reserves, for example, or making plans for rationing. Options in renewable energy One of the most promising forms of fuel diversification is to make greater use of renewable energy sources. These include small hydro, biomass, wind, solar and geothermal sources as well as biofuels for transportation. These options are becoming increasingly viable: the technology is developing fast, and in many situations small-scale renewable energy is now the cheapest option for the poor. Renewable energy technologies are already being used to provide power to electrical grids. Most of this is coming from large hydro systems, but increasingly countries are considering small hydropower installations along with wind energy. The other main source for grid electricity is biomass, using agricultural wastes, such as bagasse, rice husk, wood wastes, and palm oil empty fruit bunches. In many cases, renewables can generate power competitively with fossil fuel sources. The national grid does not, however, always extend to the poor in the more remote areas,who typically have to rely on gasoline- or diesel- powered generator sets for electricity in either off-grid or mini-grid systems. For these purposes, renewables can be cheaper than gasoline or diesel \u2013 though solar photovoltaic systems usually work out more expensive. These developments have considerable significance for poor and remote rural communities that use off-grid or mini-grid electricity for heating and lighting as well as for boosting production and household income. Conventional energy systems tend to have low capital costs but significant operating costs. For renewable systems,the picture is reversed:capital costs are high, but, over time, these are offset by low operating costs. Added to this are the environmental benefits, the prospect of increased employment, reduced import dependence, and reduced burden on foreign exchange. However, the marketplace does not account for any of this value creation. Nor does it regard the rural poor as good credit risks, seeing off-grid systems as high-risk, low-return propositions. In the past, some governments have responded with large subsidies in the hope that this would attract the private sector into the market. But it now seems unlikely that this on its own will do much to deliver energy services to the rural poor. Instead of withdrawing to let private markets develop on their own, a better approach is to work alongside local communities and the private sector to remove barriers and reduce risks. Another important renewable option is the use of biofuels \u2013 either bioethanol, which comes mainly from corn or sugar cane,or biodiesel from refined vegetable oils such as rapeseed, soy, palm and coconut. One of the newer options is Jatropha Curcas, a fast-growing, drought-resistant perennial that can be planted even in wastelands. In preliminary applications, it has shown a high oil content and can be burned in a simple diesel engine without being refined. However,there is a widening and increasing recognition of the need to further assess the economic viability and the ecological, environmental and social impacts of growing Jatropha as experience of cultivating this plant for commercial use has been limited to date. Even today, some biofuels are competitive with petroleum-based products. Others can compete only with the help of subsidies, though with improved technologies and economies of scale, prices generally", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fef0f884-4212-46cb-9db6-c7f795cb300e": {"__data__": {"id_": "fef0f884-4212-46cb-9db6-c7f795cb300e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eb0fed22c8d70a8a0e2bf5e7ad3261329801789ed51473ec5727568aee7d0ce0"}}, "hash": "eb0fed22c8d70a8a0e2bf5e7ad3261329801789ed51473ec5727568aee7d0ce0", "text": "are coming down. Nevertheless, even if biofuels are competitive, they may not 4 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific always be a good choice. The rapid recent increase in biofuels production has triggered concerns about the negative impact on food supply and prices. Using food crops such as corn to produce ethanol will push up the prices of corn and corn-derived food items. There is also concern about converting land from food crops to biofuel feedstock crops, with the danger that biofuels development, instead of helping to reduce poverty by providing employment in growing the feedstocks,could instead exacerbate food insecurity.There are also environmental risks in converting forests to monoculture biofuel feedstock plantations,in addition to age-old rural and agricultural development issues such as land tenure. All these issues need to be dealt with properly, assuring fair and equitable sharing of profit and income with the poor. Policies for an uncertain oil price future What can the countries of the region do to protect themselves in an increasingly uncertain energy environment? To arrive at a more precise sequence, it is useful to consider different possible scenarios. The four proposed in this Report are: baseline, supply shock, peak oil price and energy security. \u2022 Baseline \u2013 Oil prices remain between US$65 and US$75 per barrel. \u2022 Supply Shock \u2013 A supply crisis suddenly pushes prices beyond US$100 per barrel in the short to medium term, but over the long term prices decline to their previous levels. \u2022 Peak Oil Price \u2013 This scenario reflects the Hubbert\u2019s Peak theory, according to which, world oil production will start to peak. Prices rise gradually toward US$100 per barrel and increase exponentially thereafter. \u2022 Energy Security \u2013 Concerns for both energy and environmental security lead to reduced oil demand, so prices fall back to a lower equilibrium at around US$50 per barrel. Given these scenarios, which strategies should governments adopt? The scenarios to which they immediately need to respond are the first three \u2013 baseline, supply shock and peak oil price. Long- term strategy, however, is to move to an energy secure scenario. In order to bring prices to a lower level, many conscious policies need to be pursued. While some such policies might be inherent to the first three scenarios, these by themselves will not be sufficient to engineer a lower oil intensity. In the early years under the energy secure scenario, it is possible that prices get reduced due to a drop in absolute demand, meaning curtailment of consumption. But in later years, lower prices can be sustained without compromising demand growth only through conscious policies on efficiency and fuel substitition. Table 1 ranks the significance of the strategies for each scenario from 1, the least important, to 5, the most important. Not surprisingly, when it comes to the sudden shock scenario, emergency preparedness jumps into first place. While these listings give an overall indication, the list of priorities will depend on national circumstances and opportunities. The Report also gives a detailed listing of strategies and sub-strategies for the four focus countries: China, India, Indonesia, and Lao PDR \u2013 policies that could also be extended to other countries in the region that have similar OPVI scores. Much will depend, however, on each country\u2019s source of vulnerability; countries for whom vulnerability derives from overdependence on oil rather than economic fragility, for example, will need to concentrate more on fuel diversification. Safeguarding the interests of the poor Rising oil prices have had a serious impact on the poor, causing some rural households to revert either completely or partially to biomass fuels. Policies to help the poor include: \u2022 Cooking fuels \u2013 Providing access to sustainable wood resources, as well as to solar- or biogas-powered cookers, LPG and in some cases piped natural gas.

In pursuing such recommendations, countries in the region should also be able to rely on support from bilateral and multilateral development agencies, which can help build alliances and institutional frameworks, promote research and advise on some of the necessary mechanisms, such as oil price stabilization funds and innovative compensation and subsidy schemes. Proposal for a regional compensatory oil finance facility With small foreign exchange surpluses and low or no trade surpluses, many least developed countries in the region will see their current account deficits widen and could increasingly sink into debt in order to pay for more expensive oil imports. One solution would be to create an Asia-Pacific Compensatory Oil Finance Facility. This would have two purposes. First, it would enhance a country\u2019s liquidity to help it overcome a balance of payments or fiscal deficit. Second, it would help the country finance essential structural changes to reduce its dependence on oil.A portion of the financial assistance could also be earmarked for measures to enhance energy access for the poor. The facility could derive the bulk of its funds from bonds issued in regional and international capital markets, supplemented by donor grants, along with financing from existing international exogenous shocks facilities. Where do we go from here? Along with the rest of the world, developing countries of the Asia-Pacific region face an uncertain oil future. While no one can predict how oil prices will move in the coming years, more signs seem to indicate an upward move than not. But in the final analysis, they converge on a single point, which is that the world\u2019s finite oil resources will one day or another be exhausted. Yet for the poor to rise above poverty, they will have to consume more electricity and modern fuels, including oil. Failure to ensure this means the poor will remain poor \u2013 indeed millions will slip back to relying on biomass fuels and human labour, back to eking out subsistence-level incomes while the rest of the population moves farther ahead in social status and economic affluence. This Report outlines a range of solutions to prevent this from happening.While each country will doubtless weigh them in the light of its own circumstances, the broad direction should be clear. While adopting strategies to secure the future of their economies, all developing countries must alleviate the suffering of their poor in the immediate present. This means providing the poor with essential relief against rising fuel prices, by way of focused subsidies, compensation and direct cash transfers. Simultaneously, a concerted effort is needed to shift the future trajectory of energy consumption, not only of the poor but also of whole economies, away from a reliance on oil. Reducing the oil intensity of development is no longer a matter of choice; it is the only course. The time to act is now \u2013 before affordable oil becomes a distant memory. 6 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific Chapter 1: How oil price rises have hit the poor 1 This Report examines the impact of rising oil prices since 2003 on developing countries of the Asia-Pacific region.Its central aim,captured in this chapter, is to find out how the poor in these countries have fared in the past five years of high oil prices, and what needs to be done to protect their interests. The Report is framed by the awareness that even after a persistent five-year run from around US$22 to over US$80 a barrel, global oil prices show little indication of easing. With futures markets pricing a barrel of oil at more than US$100 a year from now1, the impacts observed so far may presage worse to come. A key feature of the ongoing oil price \u2018shock\u2019 is that it has arrived in the midst of a global economic boom from which the Asia-Pacific region may have benefited most. As a result, the region as a whole has managed to sidestep economic downturns of the kind triggered by past oil price spikes. Although some signs of strain are showing of late, the macroeconomic fundamentals of most countries have, by and large, remained intact. However, underneath this fabric of general well-being, the poor are being hurt in numerous ways by rising fuel prices.Many are being forced to surrender hard-won gains in their lifestyles and livelihoods. If their problems are not resolved, their distress can escalate into a larger socioeconomic setback. This introductory chapter revolves around case studies of 14 rural and urban communities in China, India, Indonesia and Lao PDR. Though limited in scope, the case studies offer a lens through", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2b77f95a-16e7-45d6-92cc-7c059e53038d": {"__data__": {"id_": "2b77f95a-16e7-45d6-92cc-7c059e53038d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a99c5d52e45db93b764d5a998bb94c92ccd3d8584b59fc4d9e311d1b100e67e5"}}, "hash": "a99c5d52e45db93b764d5a998bb94c92ccd3d8584b59fc4d9e311d1b100e67e5", "text": "which to view ground-level realities largely lost in the glare of aggregated statistics at national levels.The story they tell is disturbing. The energy connection to poverty Energy deprivation is a defining characteristic of poverty and a formidable barrier to its resolution. In order to understand the impacts of oil prices on the poor, one must first grasp the role that energy plays, or fails to play, in their lives. The Asia-Pacific region is home to more than half of the world\u2019s population and two-thirds of its poor. While the proportion of people surviving on less than US$1 a day fell from 31 to 20 percent between 1990 and 2001, the poor population\u2019s absolute number remained high, at 679 million (UNESCAP 2005). The majority of these people live in rural areas with no, or low, access to electricity and are unable to afford more than a modicum of modern fuels like kerosene for essential lighting. At the same time, relentless urbanization,projected to increase between 2000 and 2030 from 35 percent to 53 percent of the population (UNDESA 2002), has been steadily shifting poverty from rural communities to urban settlements. Although the urban poor may seem to have better access to fuels and electricity, many continue to rely heavily on inferior biomass for cooking which, in poor households, is the single largest use for energy, because they cannot afford modern energy alternatives (Appendix A.1 details the socioeconomic and energy profiles of the region). Poverty in the region is thus closely linked to high biomass consumption and low access to electricity (Figure 1-1). As many as 72 percent of the world\u2019s people who depend on biomass fuels live in the region.Nearly a third of the population, How oil price rises have hit the poor Will soaring oil prices dash the poor\u2019s hopes of escape from poverty? This is a distinct possibility if alternatives are not found quickly. In a number of countries,rising costs of domestic fuels and public transport have severely affected poor households. In some cases, the ensuing discontent has spilled out onto the streets. Now at record levels, oil prices pose an unforeseen challenge to the Millennium Development Goals \u2013 crucially,the overarching goal to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger. more than 1 billion people, in Asia-Pacific developing countries lacked access to electricity in 2000. It is estimated that 1,000 kilogrammes of oil equivalent of energy is needed per individual annually to ensure an acceptable standard of life (Goldemberg & Johansson 1995). Against this, an individual in poorer countries of the region consumes just 400 kilogrammes of oil equivalent or less,and even this consists largely of fuelwood, agricultural residue and animal waste. The evidence is compelling. Raising the poor\u2019s consumption of modern fuels \u2013 including oil-based ones like kerosene, diesel and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) \u2013 and electricity is essential for eradicating poverty.These energy sources are vital for meeting the poor\u2019s day-to-day needs and assuring them of a minimum level of human comfort. More important, they are a prerequisite to help the poor break out of poverty by putting energy to use in productive activities that currently involve onerous, and wasteful, human labour. The connection of energy to poverty is fundamental. It is also a paradox, in that the poor are caught in a vicious cycle whereby the very state of being poor denies them the energy they need to rise out of poverty. If the cost of energy goes up, as is now happening with oil, prices not only perpetuate this vicious cycle, but can also drag people who have escaped poverty back to where they were.How to break out of this cycle is the dilemma the poor stare at each day and the hurdle that governments must navigate if they are to reach their MDG targets. Who are the poor, and how important is oil to them? The poor are everywhere in the Asia-Pacific region, although the vast majority of them \u2013 75 percent \u2013 live in India and China. They live in rural areas,where distance and remoteness mean a shortage of all things modern,including energy. They live in urban slums that are often islands of want in seas of plenty of almost everything. They live in Least Developed Countries (LDCs) where poverty and energy scarcity are pervasive. Sometimes,they live in energy-rich countries that may benefit from the current shock. But all of them are grappling with the impact of higher oil prices.

Source: IEA 2002a The very state of being poor encompasses a vicious cycle that denies people the energy they need to rise out of poverty India India\u2019s total energy consumption was 394 million tonnes of oil equivalent in 2003,with the residential sector being the largest consumer, followed by industry and transport. In the rural areas, 76 percent of households depend on fuelwood and other biomass, while only 5 percent use LPG for cooking. However, 51 percent of households use kerosene which, in unelectrified areas, is mainly for lighting. In urban areas, electricity is the main source of energy for lighting for 89 percent of households, with most of the rest coming from kerosene; for cooking, 22 percent of urban households use fuelwood and other biomass, while 44 percent use LPG. Oil accounts for about 34 percent of total energy consumption.India has some local production,but 72 percent of crude oil must be imported. The surveyed communities Two rural and two urban communities were covered by the survey: the adjoining villages of Deepdi and Bangrasia (Bhopal district, Madhya Pradesh), Hoglagare village (Kolar district, Karnataka), Kalyanpuri slum (Delhi, part of India\u2019s National Capital Territory), and Koramangala slum (Ambedkarnagar, Bangalore, capital of Karnataka). Madhya Pradesh, where the villages of Deepdi and Bangrasia are located,is one of India\u2019s least developed states.Around 25 percent of the working population in the two villages are employed as casual labour and in the small services sector.Most houses in the village are electrified,although living below the poverty line and \u2018near-poor\u2019 households just above the poverty line were considered. Near-poor households typically had incomes up to 25 percent above the poverty line3 and are especially vulnerable to shocks since they fall in and out of poverty in large numbers. Although absolute numbers of the poor are high in China, the survey found the lowest proportion of poor households there, with the majority in both rural and urban communities having incomes above the national poverty line. Not surprisingly, the highest proportion of the poor was in Lao PDR, where 67 percent of rural households and 75 percent of urban households fell below the national poverty line in the communities surveyed. In India, the average incomes of rural and urban households surveyed were slightly above US$1 per day,and in Indonesia they were around US$1.75 per day. The socioeconomic and energy consumption profiles of the communities in the four countries are outlined in (Box 1-1). Notable differences exist between the energy consumption patterns of the rural poor and those of the urban poor, with oil products playing a greater role among the latter in all four countries studied. Four petroleum fuels \u2013 kerosene, LPG diesel and gasoline \u2013 feature in poor people\u2019s lives. In addition, inorganic (chemical) fertilizers used in farming depend heavily on petroleum and natural gas. Chapter 1: How oil price rises have hit the poor 9 Box 1-1 The view from the ground: Four countries China Around two-thirds of China\u2019s primary energy consumption is derived from coal, of which the country is the world\u2019s largest consumer and producer. Much of the rest comes from oil. Since 2002 China has been the world\u2019s second-largest consumer of oil products.Chinese households have also been consuming more LPG,some of which is produced locally.Between 2000 and 2003 consumption increased from 10 million to 13 million tonnes.

The surveyed communities Two rural and two urban communities in the northern and southern regions of the country were surveyed:Tanchang village (Miaofengshan town, Mentougou district, Beijing city), Jiuyan village (Dongqiao town, Zhongxiang city, Hubei province), Chunshu street (Xuanwu district, Beijing city) and Wuhan city (Hubei province).Tanchang village is in a mountainous area 45 km from Beijing. Jiuyan village is 248 km from Wuhan city. In both villages, households use electricity for lighting, and coal, electricity, fuelwood and crop residues for cooking. Around 70 percent of their income comes from farming. The urban settlement of Chunshu street is an area populated mostly by civil servants, private sector practitioners and service professionals, along with temporary migrants. It is a fairly well-developed district, with only around 1 percent of the population below the poverty line.The other urban settlement,Wuhan, is a city of 2.5 million households. Its infrastructure is also well developed. Residents in both communities use electricity, coal and LPG for cooking, and electricity for lighting. Wuhan has extreme climatic conditions \u2013 hot in summer, and cold, damp and cloudy in winter. Its residents use air- conditioning and cooling fans in the summer, and coal stoves and electric heating in the winter. The rural poor and urban poor use energy differently, with oil products playing a greater role among the latter 10 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific Lao PDR Lao PDR\u2019s total energy consumption increased modestly, by about 5 percent, between 1996 and 2002. The most important source of energy, accounting for 57 percent of consumption, is fuelwood. Fuel oil is next, at 17 percent.The country has no oil production or refining capacity of its own, so it has to import all its needs. Lao PDR has local deposits of coal, however, which it uses for industrial purposes. In addition, it generates significant quantities of electricity from hydropower, whose share of energy consumption rose between 1996 and 2002 from 5 percent to 12 percent.Very few people use LPG. The surveyed communities One rural and one urban community were surveyed: Ban Nammadao village (Luangprabang province in the north of the country) and two central districts of Vientiane city (the capital). People in Ban Nammadao are mostly engaged in traditional farming, with a minority having small shops.Most people belong to the H\u2019Mong ethnic minority and live in traditional houses \u2013 small wooden huts with kitchen and sleeping spaces in different corners of the same room. Fuelwood, which is readily available, is their main source of energy for cooking. For lighting, they use kerosene or candles, and occasionally battery- operated torches. Other than kerosene, the use of petroleum products is very limited. People in the urban districts of Vientiane municipality live in clusters of semi-concrete or wooden dwellings. Despite having access to both electricity- and petroleum-based fuels, many households continue to use fuelwood and charcoal for cooking \u2013 largely because fuelwood supply is still easily available. Vientiane has hot, humid summers and relatively warm winters, so almost all households use electric fans, while around one-quarter use air conditioners. All houses are electrified, but power outages make the use of candles necessary. there are seasonal variations in supply and households experience outages of four to eight hours per day.The main cooking fuel used is biomass, followed by LPG. Kerosene is mostly used for lighting. For agricultural activities, farmers use diesel and electricity, primarily for tractors and pump sets. Hogalagere village is 25 km from Kolar city in India\u2019s eighth-largest state, Karnataka. It is in a semi-arid, drought-prone region, but is rich in biomass resources. Three-quarters of its working population is involved in agriculture. The village is fully electrified, though power cuts are common throughout the year, especially during the summer months, and can last for 12 hours a day.

Although the electricity is free, households occasionally have to pay a middleman to reattach disrupted connections. Indonesia During the 1990s, Indonesia, the only South-East Asian member of OPEC, was one of the largest oil exporters. Between 1990 and 1995,annual crude oil production rose from 467 million to 551 million barrels.It started to decline thereafter due to aging oil fields and stagnant investments in new technology. By 2006 production had fallen to 386 million barrels. However, consumption of petroleum products continued to rise, and eventually could no longer be met from national production. Indonesia is also a major producer of coal and is expected to become the world\u2019s third-largest exporter soon, after Australia and China. Much of the local consumption is for power generation. In 2004, the country produced over 2 million tonnes. The coal is widely used by industry and by middle- and upper-class households in major cities. In Jakarta alone, LPG consumption averages around 1,500 tonnes per day. In the rural areas, however, the primary fuel for cooking and other thermal energy applications is biomass. The surveyed communities The rural communities covered were in two sites in the province of West Java:Mekarjaya and Sukamaju,both some 40 km from the provincial capital, Bandung.The urban settlements were Cikutra and Cisereuh in Bandung city. Most people in Mekarjaya and Sukamaju work as farm labourers or small farmers.Their other sources of income include household businesses related to local industries that often involve woodcraft and carpentry. Their main sources of energy are kerosene and fuelwood for cooking, and electricity for lighting. Some houses in these villages share electricity from a single connection, which they also use to operate television sets and music players. Most people in Cikutra and Cisereuh work as daily labourers,in both the formal and informal sectors,while a few run their own businesses.Households in these urban communities typically use kerosene for cooking,electricity for lighting and gasoline for motorcycles, one of the main means of travelling between home and work. Unlike in the rural areas, urban consumers do not have the option of switching to traditional fuels. Chapter 1: How oil price rises have hit the poor 11 Kerosene Most people without access to electricity live in the rural areas, where remoteness and high costs prevent electricity supply through the centralized grid or the use of decentralized power generating options to any appreciable extent. For rural households without electricity, kerosene is the next best option for lighting because of its relative ease of use and low (subsidized) cost compared to other options like candles or batteries. It is also an essential backup for households that have an electricity connection, but with erratic supply.This happens in both rural and urban areas, partly due to overall supply constraints and partly because of equipment breakdowns. It is used as a cooking fuel when families upgrade from biomass and inferior fuels like charcoal,but are either unable to afford or do not have access to other modern energy sources like LPG and electricity. Among the rural communities surveyed, the use of kerosene for lighting is common in Lao PDR and India, but in rather different circumstances. None of the village households in Lao PDR has an electricity connection, so kerosene is their primary lighting fuel. By contrast, all households in the two Indian rural communities have an electricity connection, although supply is highly unreliable. As a result, 100 percent of the households in one village and 73 percent in the other use kerosene as a backup. In both Lao PDR and India, all urban households in the communities surveyed have electricity, but they are less affected by power outages. Consequently, from zero to 25 percent of these households use kerosene for backup,much lower than in the rural communities. In Indonesia, none of the rural and urban communities surveyed reported power outages, so no household consumes kerosene for lighting. The situation was similar in the two urban communities in China. Its two rural communities, however, reported some infrequent power outages, which they managed with candles. The use of kerosene as a cooking fuel,meanwhile, is closely related to the availability of biomass fuels. Where biomass is readily available, it is the preferred fuel for both convenience and cost reasons among rural and urban households alike in India, Indonesia and Lao PDR.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9e95e524-c937-4b52-8d07-7e2d21ef2100": {"__data__": {"id_": "9e95e524-c937-4b52-8d07-7e2d21ef2100", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b334d08bdb66402af66982f969abf6eb0148597c217f3a66a40f840f73f8cd3f"}, "2": {"node_id": "0f5943f2-1dff-44e1-b0a2-642868088ddd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e364ca9edb5a6df3c45101f40034effd8289418cb7d784482b19b795e98e0712"}}, "hash": "5f1bdea26c63a34a67293b1d48aa393c87d0175b264fdcc3f55d0c50f24e292a", "text": "Kerosene for cooking is used mainly by non-poor households and sparingly by a minority of poor households.

None of the Chinese households reported using kerosene for cooking. LPG Convenience, efficiency and cleanliness make LPG the preferred choice for cooking for most urban households,but not necessarily so for rural households, which either have concerns over its safety or feel traditional fuels are more compatible with their cooking habits. The main barriers to its use are its availability and cost. LPG is a pressurized mixture \u2013 consisting primarily of propane or butane, or both \u2013 usually sold in cylinders for domestic use. Its retail distribution requires a transport network more readily available in urban areas and less so in rural areas. More important, its higher cost compared to biomass, charcoal and kerosene limits its use to households that have the necessary income. LPG use for cooking was observed in only four of the 14 communities surveyed. All are urban communities and almost entirely non-poor. These households also often use kerosene as a backup or as a supplement, for example, using it for certain cooking tasks while limiting LPG use to others. This has a bearing on poor households: while they have little to do with LPG, they can be affected if its supply is disrupted, causing kerosene consumption among non-poor LPG users to rise and creating potential supply problems with the kerosene that poor households do use. LPG is also very occasionally used as a transport fuel. Among the 14 communities surveyed in all four countries, just one urban (non-poor) household in India reported using it, for a three-wheeled vehicle. Diesel Diesel has multiple uses in rural communities: as a transport fuel in public and private vehicles, as a fuel for farm machinery (tractors, threshers, irrigation pump sets), and as a source of electricity in power generators catering for a variety of domestic and commercial applications, such as lighting, grinding and operation of electrical machinery. Urban households use it mainly as a transport fuel, while urban establishments \u2013 hospitals, hotels, shopping and apartment complexes \u2013 also employ it in power generators as an emergency backup against grid outages. Lacking electricity,the poor mainly turn to kerosene for home lighting Given its versatility,diesel is used for one purpose or another by all households in all communities surveyed. However, its use among poor households is confined largely to public transportation. This is because diesel-using equipment is capital-intensive and, more often than not, beyond the reach of the poor. Few poor households in the four countries reported the direct use of diesel for transport, farming or power generation, although one household in India reported using a diesel lamp. The poor\u2019s indirect use of diesel through public transport vehicles is, however, extremely important, because these vehicles are their main means of conveyance to markets, schools, health facilities and places of work in rural areas. This is equally true for those in urban areas; many people commute routinely to their places of work and markets, with migrant workers also relying on public transport to travel to their home villages.In Lao PDR,for instance,61 percent of the national petroleum product demand is for diesel, the bulk of which is for public transportation. In all communities surveyed, reliance on public transportation is pervasive,highest in three of the communities where none of the households own a personal vehicle. The situation is somewhat better in the other communities where personal vehicle ownership, usually of motorcycles, range between 8 and 14 percent in India and Indonesia, and between 16 and 43 percent in China. The exception to the trend,surprisingly,is in Vientiane (Lao PDR), where 92 percent of households in the community surveyed \u2013 with 75 percent living below the poverty line \u2013 own motorcycles. This arises from weak public transport facilities in the city, where public vehicles are limited in number and serve only select routes. Gasoline (petrol) Gasoline is used mainly in private vehicles (cars and motorcycles). It is also a source of backup electrical power, though on a much smaller scale than diesel generators. It is consumed by households that own personal vehicles in the communities surveyed. With the exception of Vientiane, ownership of private vehicles among the poor is low to zero in the communities surveyed.No community reported using gasoline in power generators.
