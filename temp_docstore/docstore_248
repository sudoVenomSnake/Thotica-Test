They are also used to produce a variety of pesticides, herbicides and insecticides essential to crop production. To the extent chemical fertilizers are produced from petroleum products, their use amounts to an \u2018indirect\u2019 consumption of energy. Expenditure on such indirect energy consumption can be quite substantial for poor households, at times even more than what they spend on petroleum fuels in direct energy consumption. For instance, poor farming households in the mountainous Sichuan province of China spend as much as 16 to 32 percent of their recurring expenditure on chemical fertilizers to extract the most from a reluctant land under harsh climatic conditions, against only 4 percent on kerosene, candles and electricity from decentralized micro-hydro systems (Ramani 2003). The use of chemical fertilizers is widespread in all rural communities surveyed for this Report in China, India and Indonesia. Lao PDR is the exception, where rural people rely mostly on natural organic fertilizers like crop residue and animal waste. The extent to which poor households consume fertilizers depends largely on whether they own agricultural land or are employed as farm labourers. By this measure, the largest numbers of poor households using chemical fertilizers were in the two rural communities surveyed in China, one with 97 percent and the other with 69 percent. China\u2019s land tenure system combines private rights with public ownership, with agricultural land nominally owned by village collectives but allocated among individual households who operate it. This results in the vast majority of households, poor or not, using fertilizers in both villages. On the other hand, private ownership of farm land in India and Indonesia tends to exclude the poor (though not the near-poor). Hoglagare village in India,for instance,has a poor household population of 28 percent, the same as the proportion of households depending on daily wages as their primary source of income.As many as 65 percent of the households in Sukamaju in Indonesia and 69 percent in Deepdi-Bangrasia in 12 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific Diesel for public transportation creates access to a variety of services,from education and health to markets and employment Expenditures on petroleum-based chemical fertilizers can be a considerable burden on farmers\u2019limited cash resources Chapter 1: How oil price rises have hit the poor 13 India are similarly dependent on daily wages, implying their lack of ownership of agricultural land and, therefore, the lack of fertilizer use as well. This picture of consumption patterns in the four countries leads to the following conclusions about the extent of the poor\u2019s dependence on oil: \u2022 Kerosene for home lighting and diesel for public transportation are the most critical oil products for the poor. Where the poor own or operate agricultural land for their own benefit, petroleum-based chemical fertilizers are just as important. \u2022 The poor\u2019s modest consumption of kerosene, often just one to two litres a month, does not add up to a significant share of the total petroleum product demand in developing countries. But this can be deceptive: lighting is vital for human life. Its presence or absence affects a wide range of human activities upon which it is hard to place an economic value. \u2022 Because the demand for kerosene arises mainly from the lack of electricity, a reliable electric supply can reduce or eliminate the poor\u2019s dependence on kerosene. It also can lower their consumption of diesel in non-transport activities,such as irrigation and drinking water pumping. \u2022 The diesel consumed indirectly by the poor via public transportation enables them to access a variety of services, from education and health to markets and employment. Reliable data are hard to come by on the proportion that the poor\u2019s diesel consumption occupies in national petroleum demands. However, as with kerosene, its value to the poor is very high because it makes the difference between connecting with the outside world and being isolated. \u2022 Meeting the poor\u2019s cooking energy needs \u2013 which account for as much as 80 percent of their total household energy consumption \u2013 through petroleum products will be a huge challenge. While it is socially and environmentally desirable to help poor households make the transition from biomass fuels to cleaner ones like kerosene, LPG and electricity, the cost of such a move can be substantial, given the large numbers of poor currently relying on biomass. \u2022 Expenditures on petroleum-based chemical fertilizers can be a considerable burden on the limited cash resources of poor farmers. This can be reduced by switching to organic fertilizers, such as slurry from biogas digesters, or inorganic fertilizers made from other sources like coal.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b81898f-491a-4536-a4a3-dba63505e2b1": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b81898f-491a-4536-a4a3-dba63505e2b1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "066960a095ad37034e162cf66639f04551fd8547978c1f9273fdaabc7b414154"}}, "hash": "066960a095ad37034e162cf66639f04551fd8547978c1f9273fdaabc7b414154", "text": "Exposing the poor to the oil price shock Shrinking subsidies and soaring prices The main outcome of the ongoing high oil price spell has been a gradual, and in some countries abrupt, rise in the retail prices of oil products. Before oil prices began their upward spiral in 2003, the prices of oil products that matter to the poor were largely regulated by governments in most developing countries of the region; in other words,governments subsidized the prices of such products to ensure the poor could afford them. However, as the price of crude oil in world markets has continued to surge, the mostly oil- importing countries of the region have struggled to sustain this policy.The widening gap between international costs and domestic prices of oil products has stretched their capacity to maintain subsidies at the same levels as in the past. Juggling between the need to rein in a ballooning subsidy burden on government finances and the imperative to protect the poor\u2019s interests has not been easy. While the overall trend has been to move domestic product prices closer to world market prices, most governments have approached the process of price liberalization gingerly, feeling their way through depending on their respective economic circumstances. But mounting pressure from world markets has forced them to hike domestic prices in larger increments in more recent years. As a result, the poor find the subsidy shield being stripped away from them, and they resent it. In some countries where retail prices have jumped sharply, the resentment has erupted into a public backlash, posing a dilemma for governments torn between the conflicting priorities of fiscal prudence and social justice (Box 1-2). An important indicator of the extent to which oil product prices are being deregulated is the \u2018pass-through coefficient,\u2019 which has varied from country to country. This is the ratio of change in domestic retail prices over a given period to the change in corresponding international product prices during the same period. The higher the pass-through coefficient, the closer domestic retail prices will get to international prices. Governments subsidized the prices of oil products to ensure the poor could afford them,and now that capacity is overstretched 14 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific Table 1-1 illustrates how the pass-through has been lower for diesel,which has greater relevance for the poor, compared to that of gasoline, which is consumed mostly by the non-poor, in the four countries surveyed. A value in excess of one indicates a faster rate of change in domestic prices than that in international prices.It does not mean domestic prices have reached parity with international prices by removing subsidies altogether. Rather, it signifies that countries starting from a low price level (high subsidies) have had to reduce them more rapidly to catch up. In all four countries, varying elements of subsidies remain. Also, while reducing subsidies, their governments have adopted other measures to compensate the poor to some extent. Differences \u2013 at times steep \u2013 exist between official price increases sanctioned by government policy or national average prices and what the poor actually incur.The reasons behind this are: 1) Transport costs \u2013 Distance determines the cost of transporting fuels, over and above the costs of the fuels themselves. Hence, communities in more distant locations may incur higher end-user prices. 2) Intermediary costs \u2013 Where people consume fuels indirectly, as with public transport services, additional costs may be hidden in transport tariffs.Such costs could be legitimate \u2013 for example, to cover higher wages of employees of transport service providers as a result of inflation \u2013 or opportunistic, when service providers piggyback higher profit margins over a government decision to increase fuel prices. 3) Scarcity costs \u2013 What are often called \u2018black market prices\u2019are, in fact, prices loaded with a supply shortage premium, often due to unscrupulous practices like hoarding, diverting subsidized fuels intended for the poor to the open market and so on.Or they may be those governed by market dynamics, such as meeting demand that exceeds rationed quotas or during a real supply crunch. Bangladesh \u2013 Bangladesh\u2019s capital city of Dhaka has ground to a halt,gripped by protests over high fuel prices.Police said that some 4,000 riot police were on standby.Shops,offices and schools remained shut,although government offices and state-run banks opened as usual.

They are summarized briefly in the next part to provide the context for the price rises faced by the poor between 2002 and 2005. China Since 1998, China has linked petroleum prices to average crude oil prices in the international market. It also adjusts retail product prices, generally when there is a difference of more than 8 percent between domestic prices and the weighted average of prices in New York, Singapore and Rotterdam. It further subjects petroleum products to excise duties and value added tax (VAT). Oil product prices in the country have been rising steadily according to this formula since 2002, in tandem with international market prices. In March 2006 the government imposed a special oil income levy on revenues earned by state-owned oil enterprises from the sale of locally produced crude oil. As a result, ex-refinery retail prices of gasoline and diesel increased further, by 10 to 15 percent. To counter the increases, the government provides targeted subsidies for certain groups: fishers, farmers, state-owned forestry enterprises and urban public transportation firms. Early in 2006, for a limited period, some provinces also offered cash compensation to poor residents to offset rising LPG prices. Figure 1-2 shows the overall increase in fuel prices nationwide between 2002 and 2005.While coal prices remained low, the price of LPG jumped substantially,and the prices of diesel and gasoline more than doubled. While these increases are significant enough, households in the communities surveyed indicated their energy expenditure has, in fact, risen far more sharply (Figure 1-3): \u2022 Against the national average increase of 100 percent in the price of coal and 56.5 percent in the price of LPG, rural households reported an increase of about 215 percent in their expenditure on cooking fuels. The increase was steeper among urban households, at around 290 percent. \u2022 Diesel and petrol prices increased across the country by 174 percent and 129 percent respectively,that is,an average of 151.5 percent. Transport expenditure among households in the communities surveyed rose faster, by about 218 percent in the two villages and by 305 percent in the two urban areas. \u2022 Increases in public transport tariffs paid by households were, however, kept low at between 25 and 35 percent as a result of government subsidies to the transport companies. Overall, urban households encountered steeper increases than rural households, as reflected in their overall energy expenditure, which rose at twice the rate of the latter. India Until 2003, India had an administered pricing mechanism for petroleum products.This has now been dismantled. However, while the price of indigenously produced crude oil is linked to international crude prices, the oil marketing companies are not free to set the prices", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e2e1aaea-5ffa-4fd5-ac36-3034c5704221": {"__data__": {"id_": "e2e1aaea-5ffa-4fd5-ac36-3034c5704221", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "25c75ccf206841a6ac4ef2fb45e6ac4255febc1e0d6960d2b9caeed8959b12f2"}, "3": {"node_id": "528edbfd-d25d-4296-99d6-ba319167bd29", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "40cc95a5373bba9b6ceb31970c78501c160be5fd22aa45fd0b7460cd53ea037d"}}, "hash": "f5d74b24434ccbeb3ada475259cd9aa701b4a096d5acdd748a7ffcb447a50107", "text": "of petroleum products and have to absorb losses arising from government control over product prices.

This is due to high levels of taxes and duties \u2013 about 50 percent of the retail price consists of basic excise and customs duties \u2013 and the government applies additional duties to fund certain activities, such as road construction. To protect the most vulnerable consumers, the government subsidizes the prices for household consumption of LPG and kerosene, on which it has removed customs and excise duties since 2004. Schemes also exist to improve electricity access to poor homes, such as the kutir jyoti or \u2018bright home\u2019 programme, subsidise electrical power for agriculture, and develop biogas plants and improved stoves in rural areas. The average retail price increases in the country from 2002 to 2005 are shown in Figure 1-4 and the increase in household energy expenditure is shown in Figure 1-5. Increases in the prices of kerosene and LPG have been quite modest, largely because of continuing subsidies.In practice, though, these fuels are not always available at the official prices, forcing many households to buy on the black market.The increases have been larger for transportation fuels, in spite of the government\u2019s attempt to keep prices down by obliging refining companies to bear the losses. \u2022 Households in the communities surveyed reported an increase of about 20 percent in kerosene prices, half the increase in the national average. This reflects the government\u2019s measure to remove customs and excise duties on domestic cooking fuels. \u2022 Household expenditure on transport rose at a rate of 63 percent in rural communities surveyed and 60 percent in urban communities. This was somewhat lower than the average increases of 88.5 percent in the price of diesel and 61 percent in the price of petrol, mainly because of reduced consumption of these fuels. 0% 50% 100% 150% 200% 250% 300% 350% Energy expenditure Household petroleum products Transportation fuels Transportation tariffs or expenditure Tanchang (Rural) Jiuyan (Rural) Beijing (Urban) Wuhan (Urban) 0.15 0.32 0.35 0.59 0.21 0.47 0.66 0.95 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Kerosene (per litre) LPG (per kilogram) Diesel (per litre) Petrol (per litre) Retail prices of petroleum products in India, US$ US$ Price in 2002, US$ Price in 2005, US$ Figure 1-3 China \u2013 energy expenditure changes experienced by poor communities Figure 1-4 India \u2013 changes in prices of petroleum products Chapter 1: How oil price rises have hit the poor 17 \u2022 Overall energy expenditures in rural households rose faster than in urban households.However,urban households were worst affected by the price rise in cooking fuels since the rural households rely on traditional fuels. Indonesia Since the Asian financial crisis of 1997, the Indonesian government has provided large subsidies for domestic retail fuels, equivalent to 5.5 percent of GDP in 2000 (IMF 2003). In 2002, however, it introduced an automatic price adjustment system under which Pertamina, the state-owned oil company, resets the prices of domestic oil products each month (except for kerosene), at 75 percent of international prices.In September 2005, the government announced another sharp rollback of subsidies, which more than doubled the retail prices of gasoline and diesel. To protect the poor from the effect of these increases, the government uses some of the savings from the reduction in subsidies to introduce a programme of cash transfers. These are aimed at financing poverty reduction, rural development, and education and health programmes. The government still maintains subsidies on kerosene prices,although there have been moves toward more targeted subsidies.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "528edbfd-d25d-4296-99d6-ba319167bd29": {"__data__": {"id_": "528edbfd-d25d-4296-99d6-ba319167bd29", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "25c75ccf206841a6ac4ef2fb45e6ac4255febc1e0d6960d2b9caeed8959b12f2"}, "2": {"node_id": "e2e1aaea-5ffa-4fd5-ac36-3034c5704221", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f5d74b24434ccbeb3ada475259cd9aa701b4a096d5acdd748a7ffcb447a50107"}}, "hash": "40cc95a5373bba9b6ceb31970c78501c160be5fd22aa45fd0b7460cd53ea037d", "text": "By 2020, Indonesia aims to extend electricity access to 90 percent of the population through novel approaches based on community initiatives and diversified business and financing models.

Lao PDR Retail prices of petroleum products in Lao PDR generally reflect changes in import prices. But some price control exists through the tax and duty structure, along with other charges. Prices also differ between areas to reflect transportation costs. Between 2003 and 2006, retail prices of gasoline and diesel almost doubled, though the government has intermittently introduced duty exemptions to slow the pass-through. In order to reduce the costs of transportation and production, the government has kept diesel prices around 15 percent below gasoline prices.It also regulates electricity tariffs, which are subject to differentiated pricing and subsidies, with poorer residential and agricultural users benefiting the most. 0% 50% 100% 150% 200% 250% Energy expenditure Kerosene official price Kerosene unofficial price Electricity tariff Transportation expenditure Indonesia (Rural) Indonesia (Urban) 0.42 0.35 0.35 0.41 0.05 0.80 0.42 0.65 0.76 0.08 0.00 0.10 0.20 0.30 0.40 0.50 0.60 0.07 0.80 0.90 Kerosene (per litre) LPG (per kilogram) Diesel (per litre) Charcoal (per kilogram) Petrol (per litre) Retail prices of petroleum products and charcoal in Lao PDR US$ Price in 2002, US$ Price in 2005, US$ Figure 1-7 Indonesia \u2013 energy expenditure changes experienced by poor communities Figure 1-8 Lao PDR \u2013 changes in prices of petroleum products and other fuels Chapter 1: How oil price rises have hit the poor 19 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 120% 140% 160% 180% 200% Charcoal LPG Energy expenditure Transportation expenditure Rural 1 Urban 1 Urban 2 Changes in fuel prices during 2002-2005 are shown in Figure 1-8.Comparing them against the expenditure patterns of households surveyed (Figure 1-9) indicates that: \u2022 Kerosene prices increased by 90.5 percent, while LPG prices grew at a much lower rate of 20 percent. Since only urban households, mainly the non-poor, use LPG, the rural poor have suffered more through the steep rise in prices for kerosene, which is essential for home lighting. \u2022 Both rural and urban households are affected by the sympathetic increase, by 60 percent, in the price of charcoal, which they use for cooking. \u2022 The average increase in diesel and petrol prices has been 85.5 percent across the country. However, expenditure on public transport among rural households rose by 118 percent, suggesting a scarcity premium imposed by transport service providers. \u2022 The rise in transportation expenditure among urban households was 63 percent in one district and 178 percent in another district of Vientiane. The higher expenditure was incurred by households owning motorcycles, and the rate of the increase, compared to the official price,suggests the existence of a black market for petrol. \u2022 Overall expenditures on energy increased by 90 percent among rural households, somewhat higher than the 85 percent increase experienced by urban households.

Steep increases in their expenditure on a fuel indicate limits on their ability to do so. The extent to which these factors have been at play across the four countries is illustrated in Figure 1-10. For example, while retail kerosene prices increased by less than 50 percent in India, a major oil importer, they increased by about 200 percent in Indonesia, a major oil producer. This was due to higher subsidies in Indonesia ahead of the oil price rise. By 2005, prices in India and Figure 1-9 Lao PDR \u2013 energy expenditure changes experienced by poor communities Steeper price rises have occurred in countries with higher subsidies to dismantle A parallel black market exists where fuels are sold, often to the poor,at unofficial premium prices Indonesia had edged closer to one another, at 24 and 21 US cents a litre respectively. Both countries, however, kept prices well below international prices through continuing subsidies. In contrast,the highest price for kerosene in 2005, 80 US cents a litre, was in Lao PDR, which had a starting point of 42 US cents a litre in 2002. Its prices are, in fact, close to international prices. This faster pace of price liberalization presumably owes to the low volume of kerosene consumption. The merits of such a policy are debatable, however, as the logic can apply equally against such a steep increase when the subsidy burden on the government is relatively low. Overall, energy expenditure among poor households rose most in China, where expenditure on LPG for cooking, and on diesel and petrol for transportation, increased steeply. The scope for households in the country to reduce LPG consumption is limited as cooking energy requirements cannot be easily scaled down.Although this is generally not the case with transportation expenditure, rising income levels combine with higher levels of agricultural mechanization, in China\u2019s case, to inhibit a lowering of petrol and diesel consumption as well. The large differences between official fuel price increases and prices paid by the poor in India, Indonesia and Lao PDR indicate the existence of a parallel unofficial market. While distances contribute to an extent in such higher black market prices, supply unreliability is an equally important factor, especially for people in remote rural areas (Box 1-3). It must be noted that although the poor benefit from subsidies of oil products, so do many other people, as a result of \u2018leakages\u2019 to non-poor households. In Indonesia, for example, an estimated 70 percent of subsidized kerosene is consumed by non-poor households. In India, around 40 percent of the LPG subsidy is enjoyed by the top 7 percent of the population. The poor pay the price The case studies across the four countries show that even if their national economies have not suffered greatly as a result of the oil price rise, poor communities in them have clearly been hit hard. Within this group of countries, in just a few years (2002 to 2005) the average poor household paid: \u2022 171 percent more for cooking fuels; \u2022 120 percent more for transportation; \u2022 67 percent more for electricity; \u2022 55 percent more for lighting fuels; \u2022 33 percent more for petroleum-based fertilizers and other agricultural inputs; and \u2022 74 percent more for energy as a whole. On average, a poor family spent some 12 percent of its household expenditure on fuels and electricity and slightly over 16 percent on transport expenditure, most of which is oil- related. Thus, the total expenditure affected by high oil prices comes to 28 percent of household expenditure \u2013 for families with no or low surplus to spare. How are they coping? 20 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific 0% 50% 100% 150% 200% 250% Energy expenditure Household petroleum products \u2013 official Household petroleum products \u2013 unofficial Transportation fuels Transportation cost to households India China Indonesia Lao PDR Figure 1- 10 Increase in poor\u2019s fuel expenditure across the four countries between 2002 and 2005 In just a few years,the average poor household paid 74 percent more for energy as a whole There are two ways to approach the question.

The other is to examine the eventual impacts of such changes on their lifestyles and livelihoods. The latter is more important for this Report. Climbing down the energy ladder The energy ladder is a concept describing the process of people switching to increasingly efficient (and more expensive) modern energy sources as their incomes rise. For those at the bottom rungs of the ladder, the poor, it means moving up from a labour-intensive way of life that consumes a disproportionate amount of their time to an energy-intensive way of life that unleashes their human potential for betterment. Increases in the prices of oil products have reversed this process for many poor households, forcing them to either consume less of these products or to fall back upon inferior sources of energy. For certain critical uses, these households have had little option but to pay ever-increasing prices for fuels and other oil products, which has encroached upon their other needs. Among the 14 communities surveyed: \u2022 Some 36 percent of kerosene-using households in India and 80 percent in the rural communities of Indonesia have reduced their consumption of kerosene for cooking. Instead, they have reverted to biomass and dung cakes, wholly or partly. Urban households in Indonesia that do not have these options continue to pay higher prices for kerosene, but at the cost of other household expenditures. \u2022 In China, 89 percent of the rural households using LPG and coal for cooking have switched partly or entirely to fuelwood and crop residue. Some 29 percent of the urban households have reached the limits of their ability to absorb higher LPG prices and plan to shift to coal if LPG prices climb further. \u2022 Higher public transport costs have curtailed the poor\u2019s access to essential services, especially those in remote rural communities. Several villagers in Lao PDR have gone back to travelling by foot or horseback to the nearest district centre, where the health care services and markets are located. \u2022 Urban migrant workers in India now travel less frequently to their home villages. Motorcycle users in China, Indonesia and Lao PDR, unable to restrict their essential travels, have borne higher petrol prices, with adverse implications for their other expenditures. \u2022 Lacking other options, most poor households have continued to incur higher expenditures on kerosene for home lighting. Some very poor households in India, unable to pay the price, stay in darkness during long hours of power outages. Chapter 1: How oil price rises have hit the poor 21 The supply of kerosene to households in India is rationed per household and made available at a subsidized rate from fair price shops under the Public Distribution System (PDS). For this, separate categories of ration cards are issued for families below poverty line (BPL) and above poverty line (APL), defined according to the national poverty line. Though BPL and APL households get kerosene at the same price through the PDS, BPL households are allocated a higher quantity at the subsidized price. However, the poor households do not necessarily get either their cards or their allocated quota of kerosene. This is partly because of bureaucratic delays but also because of discrimination in the distribution. For example, in Deepdi and Bangrasia, villages in Madhya Pradesh, kerosene distribution is in the hands of a discriminatory local self-governance unit (panchayat). Consequently, households are compelled to purchase kerosene from the local market at a much higher price \u2013 typically double the PDS rate \u2013 thus making the fuel unaffordable to many poor households. Unofficial kerosene rates also differ seasonally. Households surveyed in Koramangala, Bangalore, reported that during the rainy season,as the demand for kerosene increased with fuelwood becoming damp and difficult to use,the price of kerosene in the unofficial market also rose. Another factor in many areas is the poor availability of LPG cylinders. As a result, many non-poor households that can afford LPG are unable to obtain adequate supplies.LPG-using households surveyed in Deepdi and Bangrasia reported reducing LPG consumption by one-third. Some better-off households illegally purchase LPG cylinders at a higher rate. Box 1-3 Poor in India suffer from both high prices and shortages of fuels \u2022 Farming households have had to absorb higher costs of fertilizers and fuel to operate agricultural machinery, on which their livelihoods depend. Large increases in fuel costs have hit them harder. On the whole, rising oil prices have left the poor with few choices other than to cut back on their consumption of oil products or, for uses that cannot be avoided, to bear the higher prices and look elsewhere in their household", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9b802111-36ed-4d8f-b0f8-659b457e9665": {"__data__": {"id_": "9b802111-36ed-4d8f-b0f8-659b457e9665", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "90b2edf7be07b572e8c9124ad1e173153b8a467184a6412593f3a59e506c1de2"}}, "hash": "90b2edf7be07b572e8c9124ad1e173153b8a467184a6412593f3a59e506c1de2", "text": "budgets to find the additional money. Since the urban poor rely more on oil products like kerosene and LPG, they are worse off than their rural counterparts, who are either biomass users or have the biomass option to fall back upon.The rural poor, however, are more vulnerable to higher lighting fuel prices, especially in unelectrified villages but also in electrified villages subject to frequent supply disruptions. They also are at a greater disadvantage when it comes to transport fuel costs, because inability to pay means forgoing essential services not available in the villages. Impact on lifestyles and livelihoods Across all countries, wherever families have switched to biomass fuels, the worst-affected have been women and children, who not only suffer from increased pollution at home but also have to spend more time and effort gathering fuels. This has been a particularly critical phenomenon in China and India, where such a switch has occurred in large numbers. As a result of rising transport costs, 64 percent of the surveyed rural households in Lao PDR reported scaling down their expenditures on children\u2019s education,and 35 percent said they are able to spend less on items other than the most essential like food, clothing and health care. In India, rising transport costs have compelled a number of households in both rural and urban contexts to move their children to schools closer to their homes from better ones farther away. The quality of children\u2019s education has suffered as a result. Rising household expenditures due in part to higher energy costs have obliged women to take on extra work. Among urban households surveyed in India, many women have started working,mostly as domestic help in other houses, in order to supplement family incomes.They also reported rising domestic tensions due to heightened financial pressure. The majority of families interviewed are contemplating loans from moneylenders, self-help groups, banks and family members to cope. The foregoing impacts do not surprise. What should surprise is that they have not been more widespread than reported so far, considering how steep the rise has been in their essential expenditures on oil products. A good part of the reason behind this is that many of the households covered by the case studies are in the \u2018near-poor\u2019 category, meaning they had some financial cushion to absorb the additional expenses. However, it would be a mistake to presume this can last long if oil prices continue on their present trajectory. Implications for the MDGs The linkages between high oil prices and the MDGs are complex and not easily quantifiable. However,based on the pathways shown in Figure 1-11,a number of commonsense conclusions can be drawn. MDG 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger Higher retail prices of fuels and petroleum products like fertilizers can have economy-wide inflationary and/or recessionary impacts, leading to higher unemployment. At local levels, drastic reductions in or the complete removal of fuel subsidies will result in high prices for agricultural inputs, transport services to workplaces and markets, lower incomes and the elimination of savings. These can slow the rate of poverty reduction. To an extent, this can be mitigated through new employment opportunities emerging from the introduction of renewable energy supplies to remote rural areas and commercial cultivation for biofuel production. The latter can, however, have negative implications for food security and may worsen problems of malnutrition and hunger. MDG 2: Achieve universal primary education Education costs will rise if the rate of inflation climbs due to higher oil import bills and spillover effects across the economy. Schools will have to pay more for their infrastructure and teaching staff.The choices for poor children to attend good education facilities will be reduced, potentially relegating them to cheaper, qualitatively inferior schools. Rising transport costs can play a role in this for children in rural communities having to travel to schools located in urban centres. 22 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific Rising oil prices have made some poor people go back to using biomass fuels, deepening energy poverty MDG 3: Promote gender equality and empower women In households forced to switch back to traditional biomass fuels, demands upon the time of women and children for fuel collection and cooking will increase. This will eat into the time they will have for other, more productive activities.Families pressured to curtail household expenses may opt to withdraw girls rather than boys from schools, thus worsening gender disparity. On the other hand, gender equality may be boosted if non-working women come out of their homes to earn additional incomes for their families.

This will carry a range of environmental benefits to all, including the poor,via decentralized rural electric supply and the use of clean technologies. MDG 8: Develop a global partnership for development New opportunities for international cooperation will emerge as markets for renewable energy and efficient energy equipment expand at an accelerated pace. These can add significantly to existing opportunities for partnership under global environmental treaties and agreements. Energy security and human security: two sides of the same coin While their implications for the MDGs are largely negative, high oil prices carry some potential benefits, as noted above. In the short to medium term, however, it is the negative implications that are more likely to materialize. The impacts experienced by poor households indicate that it is not only their present lifestyles that are being undermined, but their future prospects as well. Reduced ability to provide a decent education to their children, loss of productivity due to an unhealthy home environment, and missed opportunities to earn additional income because of dwindling mobility are all evident in the scattered warning signals appearing now among those living below the poverty line. If or when they catch up with those perched precariously just above the line, such impacts can multiply rapidly across whole societies, to devastating effects. The oil price rise has heightened international concern over energy security, a concept associated mostly with the supply security of nations. This has led to a frenzy of actions to secure new oil supply sources, look for new reserves, expand and protect supply routes and pipelines, and enhance cooperation in sharing new technologies and knowledge.The findings of this chapter draw attention to the other face of the concept, which has to do with the security of people within a country, especially the poor. Although the poor are insignificant consumers of oil in the totality of a country\u2019s oil dependence, there are millions of them.The uses to which they put oil are not just critical to their survival; they are the passage to the poor\u2019s social and economic integration with the rest of the population. Countries that have eliminated poverty or reduced it drastically are now benefiting in numerous ways from the enormous boost to their economic capacity by the induction of the erstwhile poor into the mainstream. High oil prices thus not only deny the poor the opportunity they deserve to escape poverty, but they also rob countries of the added strength that an enlarged, skilled labour force will bring.

National poverty lines at around US$1.5/day were used to determine the former in all countries except Lao PDR, where the international poverty line of US$1 a day was applied. 3 The importance of including them is underlined by the example of Indonesia, where only 7.5 percent of the population lives below US$1 a day but as many as 42 percent are between US$1 and US$2 a day, with an extremely high number near the national poverty line of US$1.5 a day (World Bank 2007a). Chapter 2:The macroeconomic impact 2 Following a decade of fluctuation within a relatively narrow range in the 1990s, and a low point of US$13 per barrel in 1998, the price of oil has increased sharply. Between 2002 and July 2006 the price nearly tripled, from US$25 to US$74 per barrel, and in mid-2007 remained around US$70. Figure 2-1 tracks these changes, showing the average nominal and real annual prices from 1980 to 2006.While oil price increases have been substantial and persistent, they are not as steep as in some earlier periods. For one category,West Texas Intermediate (WTI), for example, the largest monthly rise was in October 2004 \u2013 16 percent \u2013which is substantially lower than the 48 percent spike in August 1990 and significantly lower than the levels seen in the 1970s. Another feature of recent trends in oil prices is the gradual reduction in the difference between nominal prices and real prices.Nominal prices are converted to real prices using a \u2018GDP deflator,\u2019 in this case using 2000 as a base year with a value of 100. In 1980, for example, the deflator, based on year 2000 dollars, fell as low as 87, while in the 1990s it fluctuated in a narrow band between 90 and 110. One reason for the convergence in real and nominal prices in the 1990s and the early 2000s has been the general stability of prices. Since 2004, there has been some divergence between nominal and real prices, though not on the same scale as in the 1990s. Increases in prices for crude oil have been matched by increases in the prices of petroleum and other oil products, with differing rates of increase. Figure 2-2 presents this in greater detail, showing the quarterly changes in prices of various products over 2000-2006; the percentage increases over this period were: diesel,101 percent; kerosene, 130 percent; naphtha, 123 percent; liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), 92 percent; and gasoline, 208 percent.

The price differential between WTI and the OPEC basket was around US$1.9 early in 2002, but by various quarters in 2004 and 2005, it had increased to between US$6 and US$9.5. This was due to a number of factors: rising demand for light-oil products, particularly gasoline for transportation; stronger regulations on the quality of petroleum products; bottlenecks in refining capacity for processing heavy or high-sulphur crude oil; and changes in the supply mix, with a falling proportion of light- sweet crude. Oil prices have also been affected by the falling value of the US dollar. As the US dollar has lost value, the oil price rises have been higher in US dollars than in euros or yen, which has created problems for certain countries (Box 2-1). Moreover, the depreciating US dollar combined with low interest rates may itself have contributed to increasing oil demand and thus to the rise in oil prices (IMF 2006a,and consultations with energy experts). 26 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Q1 2000 Q4 2000 Q3 2001 Q2 2002 Q1 2003 Q4 2003 Q3 2004 Q2 2005 Q1 2006 US$/barrel High Speed Diesel Kerosene Naptha Propane Gasoline 0 Figure 2-2 Petroleum products, quarterly prices, 2000-2006 Table 2-1 Uses of major petroleum products Notes: 1.The price for kerosene has been estimated from that of ATF. 2.The price used for LPG is that of propane. 3.

In the 1970s, for example, price rises were due primarily to disruptions in supply. But recently, in a period when supplies have been tight, the increases have been due more to strong demand. At the same time, prices have also been pushed up by rises in marginal costs. In the OPEC region, for example, more of the output is coming from smaller oilfields which have higher unit costs, while in the non-OPEC countries more output is coming from mature basins, which tend to have higher marginal costs (Verleger 2005, OECD/IEA 2004, IEA 2004a, Koyama 2005). Geopolitical tensions and conflicts in some major oil- producing regions, especially the Middle East, are another potential cause of price increases, because they are raising the prospect of supply disruptions and adding a \u2018risk premium\u2019 to prices. These and other factors behind the current oil price rise are considered in the sections below. Growth in world oil demand The rise in crude prices in recent years has been driven partly by the conspicuous growth in demand. According to the International Energy Agency, between 2002 and 2005 world oil demand expanded by 7 percent, to 84 million barrels per day. Much of this growth in demand came from the United States and from Asian developing countries, notably China, which over the period 2002-2005 accounted for 30 percent of total demand growth.This prompted many oil producers to increase their production. It also absorbed much of OPEC\u2019s surplus capacity, making the oil market more vulnerable to supply or demand fluctuations (Figure 2-3).

Crude oil contracts are traded in dollars, exposing most oil-exporting or oil-importing countries,excluding of course the United States,not just to oil price risks but also to currency exchange risks.This has been evident during the recent period of dollar weakness:consumers in countries whose currencies appreciated against the dollar have gained, while those with dollar-pegged currencies have paid more per barrel of oil. Because of this, some analysts have explored the possibility of switching the oil transaction currency to the euro, especially given the extensive trade links between OPEC member countries and the euro zone.But this could create further problems:a rapid and complete move to the euro might,for example,cause a US dollar crash,which would have huge implications for the world economy,and especially for those developing countries holding large amounts of their foreign exchange reserves in US dollars. Even using a parallel system, the US dollar alongside the euro, would create difficulties for buyers and sellers alike by reducing the transparency in oil pricing and increasing the risk of currency arbitrage. Sources: BP 2007; EIA 2007d In contrast to the 1970s, recent rises in oil prices have been due more to strong demand than to tight supplies An important feature of this rising demand is that much of it has been for gasoline and diesel. The United States continues to be a major user of gasoline for cars, but developing countries like Brazil, China and India are also consuming more gasoline for personal transportation. European countries, on the other hand, have been switching more to diesel for cars (Figure 2-4). Asian developing countries are also using more diesel, though in this case it is used to fuel the many backup generators, as well as to replace coal in large-scale electricity generating plants in efforts (ICF 2005). Shrinking buffers In the past, fluctuations in supply and demand have been dampened by three main buffers: surplus production capacity among OPEC members, large oil inventories and surplus refining capacity in consuming countries. All three buffers have, however, been shrinking. As a result,the world oil market has become more vulnerable to price volatility and supply disruptions. In the past, much of the surplus production capacity was provided by OPEC. This has now decreased: between 2000 and 2004, it fell from around 7.0 to 0.6 million barrels per day. Subsequently it rose, reaching 2.2 million barrels per day by May 2005, but is still relatively small. Moreover, this surplus comes from just a few countries, notably Saudi Arabia and Iraq, so any problems with their exports will have major repercussions for the world oil market. A further cause of tightening oil markets is shrinking oil inventories. To rationalize their production and cut costs, oil companies, particularly in the United States, have been holding lower stocks of both oil and gasoline. Refineries too are working with less slack.Despite rising demand, the oil companies have not been building many new refineries, preferring instead to reduce their surplus refining capacity. The combination of tighter supplies and changing demand \u2013 or speculation about such changes \u2013 has made prices much more volatile and increased vulnerability to disruptions in supply, particularly in oil-importing developing countries. Oil supply insecurity Oil prices have also been affected by security issues, linked primarily to the unstable situation in the Middle East. In May 2004, for example, oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s largest oil producer, suffered two attacks. These did not reduce Saudi production, but they did have a psychological impact, raising doubts about the country\u2019s security and causing price hikes in the market for crude-oil futures. Added to this is the uncertainty created by the situation in Iraq. Around the time of the Iraq War, oil production fluctuated wildly before returning in March 2004 to the pre-war level of 2.4 million barrels per day. Since then, deteriorating public security and attacks by insurgents on oil facilities have again undermined production, which has been as low as 1.8 million barrels per day. 28 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific Product consumption by region Million barrels daily Light distillates Middle distillates Asia Pacific Africa Middle East Former Soviet Union Europe S. & Cent.

In 2004, legal problems with the government led to the collapse of Russia\u2019s largest oil company,Yukos; in Mexico,devastating hurricanes hit the oil-producing Mexican Gulf coast; and in Nigeria, intermittent militant attacks on facilities have made it more difficult to maintain supplies. The situation is further aggravated by the possibility of structural changes in countries like Bolivia and Venezuela, which are nationalizing their oil and gas industries. Furthermore, in some parts of the world, notably Mexico and OECD Europe, production prospects are deteriorating because of low levels of investment in exploration. All these factors are heightening oil supply insecurity. They have also raised questions as to whether world oil production has already peaked (Box 2-2). Speculation in the world oil market Oil supply-demand imbalances and uncertainties have been exacerbated by a massive influx of speculative money into the market for crude oil futures. Speculators, reacting to vulnerabilities in supply, fluctuations in demand and external shocks,have expanded their trading,often basing their judgments on media reports. In so doing, they have heightened the price volatility. Speculative activity can push oil prices higher, since this unstable situation adds a larger \u2018risk premium.\u2019 Over the short term,futures prices thus may be subject to excessive hikes that bear no direct relation to current supply or demand fundamentals. However, these prices can themselves trigger further changes in supply or demand, leading to another round of wild fluctuations. The oil price hikes also incorporate an element of \u2018geopolitical risk premium.\u2019 Buyers who fear the prospect of damage to oil facilities in the Middle East are prepared to pay more to secure supplies (OECD/IEA 2004). This is thought to be contributing to between 20 and 25 percent of the current oil price. Underinvestment in exploration and refining Prices have also been higher because of underinvestment. The key players in the global energy industry, OPEC national companies and the large multinational companies, failed to anticipate the growth in demand and did not sufficiently expand their output. Indeed, at the end of the 20th Century, following the collapse of the price, they had often reduced or even stopped investment and then did not subsequently step up production as prices rose. Some people argue that the recent price rises, particularly for sweet-light crudes such as WTI, have actually served a useful purpose in stimulating investment across the oil supply chain.This is also often seen as a \u2018justification\u2019 for the oil price rise. However, underinvestment in the oil sector may not be simply an inadequate response to rising demand but also may reflect a general situation of uncertainty and price volatility, leading to a vicious circle whereby the lack of investment could once again propel prices upward. Added to underinvestment in exploration is inadequate investment in refining capacity, particularly for the lighter products that have to be processed out of heavy-sour crudes, mainly gasoline, diesel and ATF. Chapter 2:The macroeconomic impact 29 Box 2-2 Has world oil production peaked? Recent oil price rises have again triggered discussions about natural limits to oil production \u2013 \u2018peak oil\u2019 \u2013 and revived the \u2018Hubbert\u2019s Peak\u2019 theory, which concerns the long-term rate of extraction and depletion of conventional oil and other fossil fuels. In 1956, geophysicist M. King Hubbert created a model of known reserves and proposed that oil production in the continental United States would peak between 1965 and 1970, and that world production would peak in 2000. He was more or less right about the US,where oil production peaked in 1971.He was wrong about global production,although supporters of his theory suggest that the global peak has merely been delayed by the 1973 and 1979 OPEC oil shocks, which effectively reduced global demand. The oil price rise in late 2002 focused greater attention on Hubbert\u2019s theory and its potential implications, including discussions about whether the peak has in fact been reached. Some, like the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas, assert that the peak was reached in 2004/2005. Others, such as the International Energy Agency (IEA), feel that oil production will peak only in 2039, pointing, for example, to limited exploration in the Middle East and Russia; large reserves in countries whose governments prefer not to explore; untapped frontiers in deepwater and polar regions; the potential for development of new and unconventional oil and gas products; and continued underinvestment in exploration and production.

The following paragraphs assess the effects, globally, regionally and subregionally, on GDP growth and inflation, as well as on foreign exchange reserves and current account balances. They also look at changes in the consumption of other forms of energy. GDP growth,inflation and oil intensity of GDP One of the greatest worries about a steep rise in the price of oil is that it will stifle economic growth. The simplest way of assessing this is to compare rates of GDP growth with changes in the average price of oil. As Figure 2-5 indicates, though oil-price rise does not appear to have affected growth significantly till 2004, either at the global level or within the Asian developing countries,it appears the impact is being felt post- 2005. Over the period 1999-2004, the crude price more than trebled, but real GDP continued to grow, both for the world as a whole and for developing Asia. The steep increase in oil prices since 2005, it appears, has caused a slight decrease in the GDP growth rate both at the global as well as regional level. This declining trend is more pronounced in the case of Asian developing countries. Though it needs to be verified with more recent data, the trend shows that the global economy is feeling the heat of oil price rise. The increase in the prices of petroleum products could also have stoked inflation. But again, at the global level this does not appear to have happened; indeed, inflation declined (Figure 2-6). 30 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 Consumer price 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Crude price (US$/barrel) Developing Asia Average price of crude World Figure 2-6 Oil product prices and the consumer price index, 1990-2006 Sources: IMF 2000; IMF 2006b 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 Real GDP growth (%) 00 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Crude price (US$/barrel) Developing Asia Average price of crude World Figure 2-5 Real GDP growth and rising oil prices, 1990-2006 Sources: IMF 2006b; EIA 2007a; EIA 2007b The situation is different in developing countries in Asia because of some inflationary trends. Quarterly data showed that after fluctuations between 2002 and 2004, the inflation rate had stabilized toward the end of 2005 but showed an upward trend in the first quarter of 2006. A further possible macroeconomic consequence is that economic growth could have become less oil intensive, encouraging countries to use fewer barrels of oil per unit of GDP. As indicated in Figure 2-7, this had already been happening throughout the 1990s, though the region\u2019s oil intensity is still much higher than the global average, implying higher dependence on oil and lower efficiency of oil consumption. For all three variables \u2013 GDP, inflation and oil intensity \u2013 the average values for the periods before and after the price hike are shown in Table B-1 of Appendix B. This further reinforces the above observations reflecting the minimal influence of the oil price increase on macroeconomic indicators. Trends in prices of other energy sources and other essential items The rise in the price of oil also can influence, either directly or indirectly, the prices of other energy sources,particularly those of gas and coal, as well as a number of other items. Gas \u2013 Because oil and gas can be substituted for many uses, including power generation and as a feedstock for fertilizers, the price of oil has had a strong influence on that of gas, as is evident in Figure 2-8. In the years ahead the two prices may decouple to some extent, since long-term gas contracts are based more on spot or futures gas prices. Similarly, for the power sector, which by 2030 is likely to account for nearly half of gas demand, gas prices are likely to be indexed on electricity prices. Nevertheless, since gas and oil still compete in non-power sectors, such as fertilizer and steel, oil prices will continue to influence gas prices on the spot and futures markets. It should also be pointed out that gas Chapter 2:The macroeconomic impact 31 0.005 0.004 0.003 0.002 0.001 0.000 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Intensity barrels/US$ Developing Asia oil intensity World oil intensity Figure 2-7 Oil intensity of GDP for the world and developing Asia, 1990-2005 Sources: IMF 2006c; BP 2005 0 50", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c67dcf95-ac23-4628-9f93-050c9eaaa9d5": {"__data__": {"id_": "c67dcf95-ac23-4628-9f93-050c9eaaa9d5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9a0c9d24ff2835bb6be6f21c8785aa28198452710c920daf0f62100dc52f41ed"}, "3": {"node_id": "ee1dd28b-3cb6-42eb-8b80-34c7890df104", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "57455d6ce164d584d3fde4496fa13e0aed3806b13396170300c1fbf33eb07238"}}, "hash": "0cbbe3f844d1b57096137c642549d5bfd45b6f72a51f1132a24f45c062a200ea", "text": "100 150 200 250 300 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 Index (2002 = 100) Coal price index Natural gas price index Index of crude oil Figure 2-8 Movements of prices of crude oil, coal and natural gas \u2013 indexed to 2002, 1990-2006 Sources: IMF 2006c; BP 2005 markets,unlike those for oil,are highly regionalized, and prices often diverge substantially across and within regions (OECD/IEA 2004). Coal \u2013 In most sectors coal and oil are not directly substitutable, especially in the short to medium term, so the prices are not closely linked (Figure 2-8). Nevertheless, in several developing nations in the region, high and rising oil prices may in the longer term propel a shift from oil toward more coal-intensive technologies. Commodity prices \u2013 Oil can also be expected to influence the prices of other commodities.Table 2-2 shows the price indices for major commodity groups, which divide overall into fuel and non- fuel. The weights refer to the proportion that each represents of total export earnings. The energy group,in which oil has a large weight, closely tracks increasing oil prices. Food, on the other hand,has not shown a large increase \u2013 only 27 percent \u2013 as production has kept pace with demand and, for some basic items, prices are regulated. For metals, the price rises will reflect global economic expansion, with consequent increases in demand as well as rises in production costs because of the increase in the price of coking coal. Impact by subregion Oil price rises can have greater impacts in certain regions and countries. This section tracks these differences with respect to four macroeconomic variables: the GDP growth rate; the inflation rate; the change in foreign exchange reserves; and the current account balance as a percentage of GDP. It would also have been interesting to monitor central government expenditure but this proved impossible because of the lack of uniform data. GDP growth In general, the Asian economies are benefiting from a strong world economy with unabated demand for varied products (Figure 2-9). Some countries will also have been affected by non-economic factors: Nepal and Sri Lanka, for example, have been coping with political turmoil and insurgency, while Maldives, which depends heavily on international tourism, was devastated by the December 2004 tsunami. 32 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific Table 2-2 Price trends for other commodities, 2003-2005 Commodities Weights 2003 2004 2005/Q2 05 Q3 05 Q4 06 Q1 06 Q22 Non-fuel commodities1 52 82 97 107 107 111 122 138 Food 22 86 98 98 98 98 103 109 Metals 16 81 110 139 138 151 177 218 Energy 48 161 211 292 326 311 332 369 Spot crude3 40 168 220 310 349 329 355 397 Natural gas 5 162 180 256 272 312 283 288 Coal 3 74 146 130 133 109 130 144 Notes: 1.

Malaysia has benefited from strong demand for electronic products. The Philippines has large flows of overseas workers\u2019 remittances, and Thailand has had growth in tourism. Of late, Myanmar has seen improvements in agriculture, forestry, fisheries and manufacturing. Pacific Island Countries \u2013 These economies appear to have been hardest hit by the rise in oil prices: between 2004 and 2005 the average growth rate fell.Most depend heavily on oil,but being located far from world oil markets, they also face higher shipping costs. Nevertheless, some factors may cushion the impact.Tourism,for example,is doing well, helped in part by the arrival of budget airlines into the subregion. Aid flows and workers\u2019 remittances also help, and government trust funds have benefited from the continuing strength of international capital markets. Finally, Papua New Guinea is itself an oil exporter, and in addition, its agricultural sector has benefited from strong international prices for products like coffee and rubber. Inflation Although inflation rates are generally quite low, there have been increases in a number of countries (Figure 2-10). Since international oil prices began to rise,many Asian economies,most of which regulate oil prices, increased the retail prices of petroleum products, particularly in 2005 (ADB 2006). North-East Asia and the Mekong subregion \u2013 Average inflation rates show a relatively modest increase from 2002, primarily due to the stabilizing of Viet Nam\u2019s inflation rate, which in 2002 had touched a high of 57 percent. In Mongolia in early 2005, this was due to higher prices for fuel, utilities and food, though food price inflation subsequently eased. In Viet Nam, inflation has risen as a result of more expensive retail petroleum products. South and West Asia \u2013 Inflation has also increased here.In Pakistan, for example, higher domestic oil prices have pushed up transport costs. And in India, it proved difficult in 2006 to cushion the impact of rising global prices on the domestic economy. South-East Asia \u2013 Between 2004 and 2005, all countries in the subregion recorded higher inflation rates.

In the Philippines in 2005, rising oil prices, combined with the effects of a drought, increased inflation. In Thailand, higher power and transport prices have been accompanied by wage increases that have pushed inflation to the highest level in seven years. Pacific Island Countries \u2013 Most of the subregion relies on imported petroleum products for air and sea transportation and for generating electricity. The remote locations also entail higher transport costs. Increased costs due to higher oil prices have been experienced by Samoa, the Solomon Islands and Tonga. Few countries have strong regulatory mechanisms to influence domestic wholesale and retail prices, but some, such as Fiji, have been controlling the price of fuels. Foreign exchange reserves Asia\u2018s foreign exchange reserves have grown substantially since 2001 because of capital inflows and increased aid flows into developing countries. However, the growth rate appeared to level off in 2005-2006 (Figure 2-11). North-East Asia and the Mekong subregion \u2013 The healthy position here is largely due to foreign investment in manufacturing capacity in China. But China, along with a number of other countries, including Viet Nam, has also benefited from a flow of remittances. Aid has also contributed in Lao PDR and Cambodia, and there has been substantial investment in mining in Mongolia and in hydropower in Lao PDR. South and West Asia \u2013 India has had strong foreign investment inflows, though much of this is portfolio investment.

Viet Nam benefits from increased export earnings of the crude oil it produces, though this is offset to some extent by the need to import refined petroleum products, also at increased rates, since the country has no refining capacity of its own. South and West Asia \u2013 Since 2003,current account deficits have been widening in all countries, except for Nepal and Iran, which is an OPEC oil-exporting country. In Pakistan and Bangladesh, some of the effects have been offset by strong flows of remittances. South-East Asia \u2013 A number of countries are under pressure. Current account balances have declined in Malaysia and Indonesia, and Thailand slipped into deficit in 2005. As ever, the Philippines has been protected somewhat by strong flows of remittances. Pacific Island Countries \u2013 These countries are particularly vulnerable, hit both by rising prices and by the cost of shipping oil to remote countries.They could also lose out when supplies are short since, offering only small markets, they represent a low priority for oil exporters (UNDP 2005). Changes in consumption of oil, natural gas and coal, by subregion Despite the rise in prices, Asia will remain a major consumer of oil. Strong economic growth, particularly in India and China, and the growth in transport sector oil demand, are expected to see consumption rise by about 3 percent per year. Between 2002 and 2030, South and East Asia are likely to account for around 20 percent of the increase in total world energy demand (IEA 2004a).

Fiji and Papua New Guinea consume small amounts of coal; only Papua New Guinea consumes natural gas. Overall, therefore, the message from around the subregion is that while oil consumption continues to increase,there are even greater rises in the consumption of coal and gas.This not only indicates \u2018fuel switching\u2019 in all subregions and countries away from oil,but also new demand for energy being met increasingly by non-oil options. However, oil is not being substituted to any appreciable extent in the transport sector. 36 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 Oil consumption (Thousand barrels/day) Coal consumption (Thousand barrels/day) Natural gas consumption (Billion cubic feet) Average crude oil prices Consumption Average crude oil price (US$/barrel) Figure 2-14 Growth in consumption of coal, oil and natural gas in South and West Asia, 1990-2006 Sources: EIA 2006; IEA 2006 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 Oil consumption (Thousand barrels/day) Coal consumption (Thousand barrels/day) Natural gas consumption (Billion cubic feet) Average crude oil prices Consumption Average crude oil price (US$/barrel) Figure 2-15 Growth in consumption of coal, oil and natural gas in South-East Asia, 1990 -2006 Sources: EIA 2006; IEA 2006 The rise in coal and gas consumption is even greater than for oil, indicating \u2018fuel switching\u2019 and new energy demands being met by non-oil options Electricity generation One of the most important uses of primary energy sources is to generate electricity, the availability of which has a direct impact on the lives of the poor, for a whole range of uses from lighting to powering agricultural equipment. Across the countries surveyed in this report,there appears to have been a shift toward generating electricity from natural gas. Coal also remains important, as does hydropower, though its use appears to be diminishing in countries like Myanmar,Sri Lanka and Viet Nam.Nuclear energy too is making inroads; in 2002 it constituted around 1 percent of the primary energy mix in China and India (IEA 2004a). Encouragingly, between 1990 and 2003 all countries saw significant rises in electricity production, from 110 percent in the Philippines to 370 percent in Viet Nam. The most rapid progress seems to have been in Malaysia and Thailand,as well as in China.But striking contrasts exist across the region: per-capita electricity consumption in high-income countries is about 26 times that in low-income countries. This is indicated in Table 2-3, which also shows that three countries, Nepal, Myanmar and Sri Lanka, have per capita electricity consumption figures that are lower than the low-income group average.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1af24acb-2c9d-4e58-af36-21acfd49d62a": {"__data__": {"id_": "1af24acb-2c9d-4e58-af36-21acfd49d62a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "153f5567666e607410415bc9f2eeb906df3d86f4ff602d47030b1893b4912b3e"}, "2": {"node_id": "2fc164a7-65f0-4511-a696-a1022eae2fcf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7f12a01d6b781e024f8a28d8cbfc9ad3b0707bcdb11c735039fecd31bd138a5e"}}, "hash": "31c764adec67978f4f5a7118d2a2f31c1057f92bfe2a7ee71f7d1ab17e95e407", "text": "Chapter 2:The macroeconomic impact 37 Source:World Bank 2006 Percentage increase in electricity production (bn kWh) 1990-2003 Electricity consumption per capita, (kWh) 2003 Percentage of oil in total electricity generation Percentage of natural gas in total electricity generation Observations 1990 2003 1990 2003 China 207 1,379 7.9 3 0.5 0.3 High usage of coal: 80% of all electricity generated from coal in 2003 India 119 435 4.3 4.6 3.4 11.5 High usage of coal: 68.3% of all electricity generated from coal in 2003 Indonesia 239 440 42.7 24.6 2.3 20.3 Diminishing role of hydropower as a source of energy generation Iran 158 1,916 37.3 16 52.5 76.7 Natural gas main source of electricity generation;

The \u2018before\u2019 period is 2000 to 2002; the \u2018after\u2019 period is from 2003 to the first quarter of 2006. The results are shown in Appendix B, Table B-2. As this indicates, all countries saw a rise in GDP growth, while some saw a rise in inflation. Most also suffered a deterioration in the current account balance that, for the oil-importing countries,might be attributed partly to the rise in oil prices. In terms of budget balances, however, there have been significant improvements: before the price rises, all had budget deficits, while after the price rises,all countries except Lao PDR reduced their deficits, probably because of a reduction in subsidies for oil and oil products to consumers. For these periods the available data on other variables are more limited. But overall unemployment, for example, seems to have risen in the period after the price increase.The data on extreme poverty on the US$1-per-day measure show mixed results: down in China, India and Indonesia; up in Bangladesh, Lao PDR and Sri Lanka. Inequality rose in Bangladesh, China, India, Lao PDR, Malaysia and Sri Lanka, but fell in Indonesia and Thailand. Why have the effects been so small? Apart from some increases in inflation and a worsening of current account balances due to rising oil import bills, recent oil price rises do not appear to have had a dramatic macroeconomic impact on the low-income and developing nations of the Asia-Pacific region. Certainly the impact has been much less than earlier oil shocks, which led to a period of stagflation. The difference this time around has been the occurrence of the oil price rises in the midst of a global economic boom, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, where economic growth has been accelerating in recent years, not only in China and India but also among many middle- and even lower-income countries. Ballooning exports have gained Asian economies US$3.6 trillion (nearly 60 percent) of the global foreign exchange reserves of US$6.1 trillion by mid-2007 (IMF 2007), allowing them to finance their oil import bills far more comfortably than in the past, when the foreign reserves of most regional countries were on a shaky footing.Thus, while the region\u2019s dependence on imported oil has grown, its economic capacity to sustain imports has grown faster, at least until now. Over the period of the current oil price rises,both supply and demand for goods and services at large have remained quite high. Supply has been maintained because the larger economies, China and India, have been able to expand production using ample cheap labour with the added discipline of fierce competitive pressures to keep costs low. Meanwhile, demand has been sustained at least in part by relatively low interest rates that led to \u2018cheap money\u2019. The result appears to have been fairly robust growth combined with inflation rates which, even if increasing, are still relatively low. There are, however, several provisos. One is that inflation may have been restrained because governments have taken measures to shield consumers from oil price rises by subsidizing the prices of oil products. One indicator of this is the \u2018pass-through\u2019 coefficient, which, as noted in Chapter 1,measures the extent to which crude oil price rises have been passed on to consumers (ESMAP 2006a). For those of the 10 countries for which data are available, the coefficients are shown in Table 2-4 (see also Table 1-1 for the case-study countries alone). A coefficient less than one means that not all the percentage increase has been passed on. A coefficient greater than one means that more than the percentage increases has been passed on. Though some countries can be starting from high levels of subsidy, they could increase domestic prices by more than the increase in the world market and still leave a large element of subsidy. As is evident from this table, apart from Malaysia, governments are more likely to pass on the prices of gasoline than of diesel to consumers, since gasoline is used more for private cars and diesel more for public transport.

Another overall issue is the fact that although the effects have yet to appear,they could still do so in the future after a longer time lag.This will depend to some extent on whether the current high prices represent a correction to the oil price collapses of the early 1990s, in which case the 38 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific macroeconomic effects may not actually be great. On the other hand, they could represent a longer secular trend, and impacts in the future could be quite serious. It is also notable that despite the oil price increase, there does not seem to have been a fall in demand for oil. This is partly because oil consumption does not seem very sensitive to price increases, that is, short-run \u2018demand elasticity\u2019is quite low, ranging between -0.02 and -0.03 percent.On the other hand,as their incomes rise, consumers tend to require even more oil, that is, \u2018income elasticity\u2019 is quite high, ranging between 0.12 and 0.19 percent. Thus, despite rising prices these two elasticities have sustained increased oil consumption.

Source: ESMAP 2006a Chapter 3: National vulnerability to oil price rises 3 Rising oil prices have serious implications for the Asia-Pacific region. Of the region\u2019s commercially traded energy, 30 percent comes from oil and most of the rest, 47 percent, comes from coal, with natural gas a distant but rising third at 11 percent (BP 2006). Although many countries, notably China and India, have domestic supplies of coal, when it comes to oil and gas, they are more likely to rely on imports. Oil intensity One useful indicator of dependence on oil is \u2018oil intensity,\u2019 which is the amount of oil required to produce a unit of economic output, conveniently expressed through an \u2018oil intensity index\u2019 where the global average is 1.0. This can then be considered alongside estimates of the \u2018oil supply gap,\u2019 or the difference between domestic production and consumption, to indicate the extent of a country\u2019s vulnerability to international oil price fluctuations. The information for some of the larger countries in the region and elsewhere is presented in Figure 3-1. Of these, China, India, the Republic of Korea and Thailand appear to be at greatest risk, because they have high oil intensities and also depend heavily on imports. In addition, though not included in this figure,some smaller countries in the region also are at risk, including Cambodia, Nepal and the Pacific Island Countries. The situation in most countries has also been exacerbated by rising oil consumption. The significance of this can be appreciated by considering the proportion that oil represents of the country\u2019s total energy supply and the extent to which it has changed over the past 10 years.This is illustrated for a range of countries in Figure 3-2, which shows that for most countries, grouped to the left of the figure, the proportion of oil in the mix has increased \u2013 especially in Sri Lanka, for power generation, and in Viet Nam, for transport and industrial steam. Nevertheless, even among this group, the share of energy coming from oil can still be quite modest. In China and India this is because they have other options, including coal and hydropower. National vulnerability to oil price rises Rising oil prices affect every country to some extent, but some are much more exposed than others \u2013 highly oil dependent, perhaps, or relying heavily on expensive imports.

These include the more advanced developing countries like Malaysia and Thailand, which have been basing their growth more on service industries that are less energy intensive, while they have been able to substitute oil with natural gas and coal for power generation. Oil consumption and economic growth In general, per capita oil consumption in Asia- Pacific developing countries still remains low: in 2004, it was less than 0.8 tonnes of oil equivalent (toe), against the average of 4.7 in the OECD countries. Nevertheless, most countries in the region have been increasing oil consumption as part of more rapid economic growth. They have, for example, been mechanizing agriculture, expanding their industries, and using more personal and freight transport. At the same time, they have been modernizing away from traditional forms of energy such as biomass, human or animal labour, and in some cases solid fuels, and towards more modern fuels, including electricity, oil and gas. This has been happening, for example, in China, India, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam. Figure 3-3 illustrates, for selected countries, the correlation between oil consumption and economic growth. For each country the lines join the points for these pairs of variables, in date order. The story is clearest, perhaps, for countries like China,whose fairly straight line indicates that per capita oil consumption has risen steadily along with increases in per capita GDP. The situation is similar in India, though the overall changes in both variables have been smaller. For Viet Nam the line has also been fairly straight, but is much steeper, implying that growth is becoming more oil intensive at a greater pace than in other countries,because people use more motorcycles and cars along with other oil-based appliances for industrial steam generation. For other countries the situation is different. For Myanmar, for example,the line is virtually flat, an unusual case. This means that although the country has a rapidly expanding economy, it has not seen a corresponding rise in per capita oil consumption.This could be because its growth is based on higher state earnings \u2013 from the export of oil and gas and other natural resources \u2013 while within the economy, people have not been making greater use of transportation and other oil-consuming sectors have only grown slowly. Other countries such as Pakistan and the Philippines, on the other hand, have more eccentric lines, reflecting the fact that per capita GDP and/or per capita oil consumption have at times risen and at times fallen. It is not surprising that economic growth should result in increased consumption of modern forms of energy, including hydroelectricity, coal and oil. Less acknowledged, perhaps, is the fact that in order to achieve faster growth, countries need to make greater use of oil products, that is, they need to become more oil intensive.If they cannot make this change, their growth is likely to be hampered. If they want to expand rural transportation, for example, they will need to consume more gasoline and diesel for some time to come. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Nepal Myanmar China Viet Nam Brunei Darussalam Bangladesh India Sri Lanka Indonesia DPR Korea Pakistan Philippines Thailand Malaysia Oil demand / TPES (%) 1995 2005 Figure 3-2 Changes in the share of oil in total primary energy supply, 1995-2005 Data source: IEA 2007a Yet if poor countries do not become more oil intensive, their growth is likely to be further hampered Chapter 3: National vulnerability to oil price rises 43 Figure 3-4 indicates the extent to which countries, while increasing their total per capita energy consumption,have also increased their oil intensity. Though the lines are generally not straight, their overall direction is clear: most countries in the region, especially the less developed ones, while using more energy per capita have also become more oil intensive. Most countries, as they have become richer, have also become more oil intensive, but at higher levels of per capita GDP, their oil intensity can then start to drop as they switch to other forms of energy, which are often cleaner and renewable.

This was further facilitated by structural changes in the economies through a shift from energy-intensive manufacturing to the energy-light services sector, such as information technology, banking and insurance.

Source: IEA 2007a Nevertheless, declines in oil intensity have not always been due to gains in efficiency. Malaysia and Thailand, for example, saw a drop in oil intensity because of the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s which resulted in temporary declines in per capita GDP. Viet Nam,on the other hand, has seen an increase in oil intensity as a result of structural changes in its economy. Oil and human development Countries that increase their oil consumption can thus accelerate economic growth. However, they will not see a real improvement in human development unless they ensure that the benefits are shared broadly across their societies. Otherwise, there is a danger that the benefits will be seized by the affluent minority,who tend to be more prolific consumers of electricity and oil. Countries therefore need to ensure that the poor too can make best use of modern sources of energy. The value of increased energy supplies for human development is illustrated in Figure 3-6.The tail of the arrow represents the 1995 position and the tip,the 2004 position.This shows first,as might be expected, that countries with higher per capita energy use also have higher levels of human 44 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.10 0.11 0.12 0.13 0.14 0.15 0 1,000 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000 6,000 7,000 8,000 9,000 10,000 Per capita GDP (US$ per capita at 2000 price and PPP) Indonesia India Pakistan Nepal Philippines Thailand Malaysia Other Asia China Asia excluding China Sri Lanka DPR Korea Bangladesh Myanmar Viet Nam Oil intensity (toe per 1000 US$ at 2000 prices & PPP) Figure 3-5 Evolution of oil intensity and per capita GDP, 1995-2005 Note: For each country, the lines join the points, in date order, of the two variables Source: IEA 2007a 0.4 0.45 0.5 0.55 0.6 0.65 0.7 0.75 0.8 0.85 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 Primary energy supply/population (toe per capita) Bangladesh Nepal Pakistan India Myanmar Viet Nam Indonesia Sri Lanka Philippines Thailand Malaysia China Human Development Index Figure 3-6 Human Development Index and per capita energy use, 1995 and 2004 Sources: IEA 2007a; UNDP 2006 development, as measured by their human development index (HDI).

They also rely on oil for transport. This is especially true in small island nations, where people depend on oil for power and for sea transport. This has important implications.While it might be tempting to encourage countries at early stages of economic development to reduce their dependence on oil, there is a danger that this could also deny many people the benefits of modern energy \u2013 not just the comfort and convenience it brings, but also the economic opportunities. Nevertheless,it should be possible to enable poor people to switch, to some extent, to non-oil sources without sacrificing human development. One analysis shows that even if the poor now rely on kerosene and LPG as \u2018transition fuels,\u2019they can also, as their incomes increase, switch to natural gas or electricity (IEA 2002b). Oil price vulnerability of the Asia-Pacific region As countries become more oil intensive they are likely to become more vulnerable to oil price rises. However, the effects will vary substantially between subregions and in individual countries. Table C-1 (in Appendix C) and Table 3.1 to 3.3 show some of the key data as well as the results of an analysis performed to assess this potential vulnerability. North-East Asia and the Mekong subregion China\u2019s strong economic position enables it to diversify oil supply sources through intensive exploration activities and investments in foreign oilfields, diminishing its long-term vulnerability to higher oil prices despite a current decline in its proven oil reserves. This is in marked contrast to the other countries in North-East Asia, which for oil are almost entirely dependent on imports. Moreover, oil consumption levels have been rising significantly. Between 1995 and 2004, consumption rose by 90 percent in China and 144 percent in Viet Nam. Viet Nam does have oil Chapter 3: National vulnerability to oil price rises 45 Korea, Rep. of Malaysia Thailand Maldives Indonesia Mongolia Vanuatu India Lao PDR Pakistan China Philippines Sri Lanka Viet Nam Cambodia Myanmar Bangladesh Nepal Papua New Guinea 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 Oil consumption per capita (barrels per capita) Human Development Index Figure 3-7 Correlation between per capita oil consumption and the Human Development Index Sources: ADB 2005; UNDP 2003 In poor countries,small increments in energy use can trigger substantial improvements in human development by satisfying basic needs If countries just beginning economic development reduce their dependence on oil,it could deny many people the benefits of modern energy reserves, but lacks adequate refining capacity. So although it exports crude oil, it has to import petroleum products, largely eroding the financial benefits of higher oil prices. On the positive side, most countries use diverse sources of energy. Coal is extremely important in China and Mongolia, and natural gas consumption is increasing rapidly in China and Viet Nam. Cambodia and Lao PDR, on the other hand, appear to be less vulnerable because of their high reliance on traditional energy sources. However, in the long run, with a shift towards modern fuels, especially petroleum products, their vulnerability could reach critical levels. A high proportion of energy use is from traditional sources \u2013 77 percent in Lao PDR and 92 percent in Cambodia \u2013 so they are less exposed to the effects of price rises, but this also means that the poor often lack access to the energy they need, and in both countries forest cover is declining. South and West Asia Except for Nepal, countries in South and West Asia have been growing by more than 5 percent annually.However,increases in domestic gasoline product prices since 2004 have triggered inflationary concerns in many countries. Most have forms of administrative control in the oil sector,but given rising global oil prices,even here domestic prices have been rising. Proven oil reserves are static or non-existent in all these countries except for oil-exporting Iran. As countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan and India expand their industries, they will also become more vulnerable to rising oil prices. Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Bangladesh, and to a lesser extent Pakistan, appear vulnerable due to their relatively weak economic capacity to absorb oil price shocks, as does Maldives due to its high dependence on imported oil. Iran, with its oil reserves, is currently seen to be the least vulnerable in the region, followed by India, which derives its strength from its economic performance. Encouragingly, most countries are increasing their consumption of non-oil-based energy sources, and natural gas use in particular has risen in Bangladesh, India and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "07defbad-c298-4754-a4b8-8f2a5c7a929c": {"__data__": {"id_": "07defbad-c298-4754-a4b8-8f2a5c7a929c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "da99bfc9cc348025021925f8db1fa60a04f5fc4f459e5667ccf85f0d8b0aaa52"}}, "hash": "da99bfc9cc348025021925f8db1fa60a04f5fc4f459e5667ccf85f0d8b0aaa52", "text": "Pakistan. Despite declining poverty levels in general, inequality has risen in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. Sri Lanka has seen an increase in poverty, but, nevertheless, income is fairly equitably distributed. However, deforestation is a cause for concern in Sri Lanka and particularly in Nepal, which meets about 90 percent of its energy requirements through traditional fuels from sources like biomass. South-East Asia Overall, the region appears to have recovered from the Asian financial crisis in 1997,as reflected in GDP growth rates and foreign exchange reserves. Inflation, however, is on the rise. Poverty levels have declined in all countries, although inequality seems to have increased to a small extent in Indonesia and the Philippines. Though South-East Asia is endowed with oil and natural gas reserves, all the countries currently import oil or oil products. Malaysia, however, is a net exporter, while all others are net importers. Many are increasing their use of natural gas, so they should become less dependent on oil. Another redeeming feature on the energy access front is the decline,except in Myanmar, in the use of traditional fuels. The Philippines is more vulnerable to higher oil prices than Indonesia, Myanmar, Malaysia and Thailand. This is because it is more oil import intensive and also has some of the highest levels of poverty and inequality. Myanmar, in the short run, is less vulnerable because of its low oil dependency.Timor-Leste is a low-income country currently fraught with political instabilities,but it has vast oil and natural gas reserves and may therefore be less vulnerable in the longer term. Pacific Island Countries Economic growth in most Pacific Island economies is closely tied to external events and conditions. Almost all the countries are heavily dependent on imports for many essential supplies, while relying on a narrow range of commodity and natural resource exports or international tourism for their export receipts. Many islands are also highly dependent on aid inflows. Personal remittances from members of the diaspora are significant and serve to fuel domestic consumption demand.Many also suffer from significant and growing levels of poverty. Although data are scarce, more than 25 percent of the populations of Fiji, Kiribati, Micronesia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and Vanuatu are believed to be living in poverty (ADB 2005). 46 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific The Pacific Island Countries in general are extremely vulnerable to increased oil prices.They comprise distant and small markets and have to bear the added burden of higher shipping costs. Electrical power generation in the islands is largely fuelled by diesel.Those less vulnerable are the larger countries of Samoa and Papua New Guinea. Samoa has one of the region\u2019s most efficient retail fuel markets as well as the strongest economic performance, with lower levels of poverty than most other Pacific Island Countries. Papua New Guinea produces and exports crude oil, and refines oil at the recently commissioned Napanapa oil refinery both for export and domestic consumption.The rise in oil prices has therefore had considerable positive implications for, and has made a big contribution to, the government budget. An Oil Price Vulnerability Index Is it possible to quantify the extent of this vulnerability? The earlier part of this chapter considered this by assessing which countries were both oil intensive and also relied on oil imports. But as the section above has shown, this is only a small part of the story. The degree of vulnerability will depend on many other factors, such as the GDP growth rate, and on foreign exchange reserves. The extent to which poor people are vulnerable will also vary, for example, according to the types of energy they use and to how much they depend on oil as an energy source. One way to highlight the relative vulnerability of countries in the region is to construct an \u2018Oil Price Vulnerability Index\u2019(OPVI).This needs to capture the three commonly accepted aspects of vulnerability: hazards, resistance and damage. Hazards are international events not under the country\u2019s control. Resistance represents the resilience and fundamental strength of the economy. Damage is measured through social vulnerability and is tracked by indicators of human development. Developing a robust OPVI thus involves combining relevant economic, energy and social variables. For this exercise 15 variables were initially identified.They could be broadly divided into two categories: economy related and energy related.The 10 economy-related variables were: real GDP growth rate, GDP per capita, balance of payments, current account, budget balance,import cover,share of net oil fuel subsidy or tax revenue in GDP, contribution of food and beverages to inflation, trade as a percentage of GDP,the Gini index and the Human Development Index.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ce6bcade-8ddf-4dcc-82f9-9aa04b9b6584": {"__data__": {"id_": "ce6bcade-8ddf-4dcc-82f9-9aa04b9b6584", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0127d82db81b0f4caf290d5d8582309a7d89f6bc32301e7fab18d2d2a5a46ad9"}}, "hash": "0127d82db81b0f4caf290d5d8582309a7d89f6bc32301e7fab18d2d2a5a46ad9", "text": "The five energy-related variables were: oil intensity of GDP, oil import dependence, share of oil in primary energy consumption,the ratio of oil reserves to production,and the share of transport in oil consumption. Table C-1 in Appendix C shows the values of these variables for the 24 countries in the region for which comparable data were available. As with any index constructed with a large number of variables, there is likely to be significant redundancy or overlap. Some variables could be dependent on each other; others could involve double counting. An assessment was therefore carried out using logical reasoning and correlation analysis to justify the inclusion of each variable.This exercise reduced the number of variables to eight which, using \u2018principal component analysis,\u2019 a popular statistical technique, were then grouped through linear combinations of variables into three principal components, logically related to three 'dimensions.\u2019 The process for developing the OPVI is elaborated in Figure 3.8 and details of the methods used are given in Appendix C. The three resulting dimensions were: 1. Economic strength (Strength) \u2022 Balance of payments: current account \u2022 Budget balance \u2022 Import cover \u2022 Oil import dependence Strength represents the economic capacity to afford oil imports. A country will be less vulnerable if it has high and positive scores for balance of payments,budget balance and import cover, and a lower score for oil import dependence. 2. Economic performance (Performance) \u2022 GDP per capita \u2022 Oil intensity of GDP Better economic performance results in higher levels of GDP per capita, which should make a country less vulnerable. In developing countries that are shifting from low-quality traditional fuels to high-quality modern fuels such as petroleum products, this will lead to an increase in oil intensity. This may not be an attractive indicator from an environmental standpoint but is relevant at initial stages of economic development. Chapter 3: National vulnerability to oil price rises 47 3. Economic growth with low share of oil (low-oil growth) \u2022 Real GDP growth rate \u2022 Share of oil in primary energy consumption Many countries initially base their development on primary energy sources other than oil, traditional fuels perhaps or, as in the cases of China and India, coal and hydro. But they are likely to become increasingly oil dependent. A country will be less vulnerable if it can combine a high GDP growth rate with a low share of oil in primary energy consumption. Combining the component variables in a linear fashion produced overall scores for the three dimensions. The scores for all the developing countries of Asia and the Pacific are listed in the first three columns of Table 3-1. The next step was to combine these dimension scores into a single index. Instead of uniform weights, the relative importance was used to come up with the final ranking.1 The relative importance (weights) of these three dimensions are determined based on their ability to explain the changes in the level of vulnerability. The OPVI for each of the countries was calculated from these weighted total scores using a formula that draws on the methodology for the International Energy Agency\u2019s Energy Development Index.2 The third column of Table 3-1 shows the resulting index score, and using this, the ranking of countries was done in increasing order of vulnerability. At the top of the list are countries with high strength and performance, combined with low-oil growth. In first place is Iran, which, although highly reliant on oil, is a net oil exporter, followed by China and Malaysia. At the other end of the scale are countries with low economic strength, lower economic performance and high oil dependency \u2013 such as Maldives,Vanuatu and Cambodia. India ranks quite high. Although its oil has to be imported, this does not represent a high share of total primary energy consumption since India uses more coal. India is also showing excellent economic performance. A number of other countries are less vulnerable by virtue of their energy profiles: Iran, Malaysia, China, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. 48 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific Figure 3-8 Schematic process for developing the Oil Price Vulnerability Index Preliminary set of 15 variables based on literature review, consultative process Logical reasoning and correlation analysis to prune the list to include only eight relevant variables Principal component analysis to determine the underlying principal components Obtain the dimension values for all the countries Estimate the weighted total scores using these values and dimension weights given by PCA Develop the OPVI using weighted total scores in the IEA\u2019s formula for indexing Identify significant variables under each principal component Establish logical relationships", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ff69eb25-7036-44f2-939f-6820b0100242": {"__data__": {"id_": "ff69eb25-7036-44f2-939f-6820b0100242", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "44880a15c4af4b5a6845f356ee2a63a648d3f11016d6538a0b070c07e4442260"}, "3": {"node_id": "6cfbdc26-209f-457a-b7ec-09ba4ab101d3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3429ecb9e1916c125be995f83cc8237e345ca92535595c37c26bb1ff327726f8"}}, "hash": "ce8ad0343a65485c7d149980655f747dcf73234b632b79753daf036c9ceead3d", "text": "between principal components and economic/energy dimensions Ranking of countries based on OPVI STEP 1: Arriving at relevant macroeconomic and energy-related variables STEP 2: Establishing the dimensions of oil price vulnerability levels STEP 3: Developing OPVI Bhutan\u2019s high rank might appear odd. This is because Bhutan, with ample hydroelectricity, has a low share of oil in primary energy consumption, at 12 percent, and its economy does not rely heavily on oil. At the same time, it has managed high growth with a higher-than-average per capita income.This is highlighted in Table 3-2 which ranks countries based on the individual dimensions. Bhutan is in first place for low-oil growth. Based on their OPVIs, countries can be grouped into one of three categories: low, medium or high (Table 3-3). The dividing lines are based on how the OPVI scores are distributed around the average value of OPVI (refer to Appendix D). \u2022 Low-OPVI countries \u2013 High economic capacity, or strength, to absorb oil price shocks, performing better, with high per capita GDP and economic growth rate, and with either low reliance on oil or a net exporter of oil \u2022 Medium-OPVI countries \u2013 Medium economic capacity, or strength, to absorb oil price shocks, performing better with high or medium per capita GDP and economic growth rate, and either having a low reliance on oil or being a net exporter of oil \u2022 High-OPVI countries \u2013 Low economic strength, low economic performance and high oil dependency It should be noted that these OPVI scores and categories reflect the current position of these countries based on a limited set of variables.They do not consider future trends. Several countries, such as Iran and Malaysia, though currently among the least vulnerable, could be considered at future risk on account of their rapidly growing oil consumption relative to domestic supply. Similarly, Thailand and India could be at greater risk in the future given their persistently high dependence on imported oil.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6cfbdc26-209f-457a-b7ec-09ba4ab101d3": {"__data__": {"id_": "6cfbdc26-209f-457a-b7ec-09ba4ab101d3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "44880a15c4af4b5a6845f356ee2a63a648d3f11016d6538a0b070c07e4442260"}, "2": {"node_id": "ff69eb25-7036-44f2-939f-6820b0100242", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ce8ad0343a65485c7d149980655f747dcf73234b632b79753daf036c9ceead3d"}}, "hash": "3429ecb9e1916c125be995f83cc8237e345ca92535595c37c26bb1ff327726f8", "text": "It should also be Chapter 3: National vulnerability to oil price rises 49 Table 3-1 Ranking of countries based on weighted dimension scores and composite OPVI Rank Countries OPVI Strength Performance Low-oil-growth Weighted Total Score 1 Iran 1.00 2.16 0.79 -0.15 2.81 2 China 0.78 0.87 0.50 0.40 1.77 3 Malaysia 0.72 1.06 0.51 -0.08 1.50 4 Bhutan 0.56 -0.20 0.25 0.70 0.75 5 India 0.49 -0.03 0.14 0.33 0.44 6 Papua New Guinea 0.46 0.81 -0.07 -0.45 0.30 7 Indonesia 0.45 0.32 0.03 -0.11 0.23 8 Thailand 0.44 0.23 0.17 -0.18 0.22 9 Mongolia 0.43 0.34 -0.23 0.07 0.18 10 Viet Nam 0.42 -0.18 0.53 -0.26 0.10 11 Myanmar 0.40 0.08 -0.27 0.20 0.01 12 Philippines 0.39 0.14 -0.13 -0.05 -0.04 13 Afghanistan 0.38 -0.24 -0.20 0.38 -0.06 14 Nepal 0.38 0.41 -0.47 -0.01 -0.07 15 Bangladesh 0.34 -0.08 -0.41 0.24 -0.25 16 Pakistan 0.34 -0.22 -0.17 0.14 -0.25 17 Lao PDR 0.31 -0.55 -0.25 0.40 -0.39 18 Fiji 0.28 -0.12 -0.11 -0.31 -0.55 19 Samoa 0.24 -0.05 -0.51 -0.17 -0.73 20 Sri Lanka 0.18 -0.81 0.00 -0.18 -0.99 21 Solomon Islands 0.18 -0.52 -0.20 -0.29 -1.01 22 Cambodia 0.17 -0.36 -0.53 -0.16 -1.05 23 Vanuatu 0.17 -0.30 -0.45 -0.32 -1.07 24 Maldives 0.00 -2.76 1.08 -0.16 -1.84 Economic strength, economic performance and low-oil-growth form major aspects of a country\u2019s oil price vulnerability Least vulnerable Medium Most vulnerable noted that the index is relative to this group of countries, so even the least vulnerable countries on this list could be much more vulnerable than many countries outside the region. The logic behind these rankings and classifications can be seen by a closer assessment. The Philippines, for example, is a borderline case and is categorized as a high-OPVI country because of its relatively high oil dependency, both in terms of intensity and share in primary energy. On the other hand, Viet Nam compares poorly to the Philippines in terms of the economic strength and low-oil growth dimensions; its economic performance is excellent and it is a net oil exporter, thus, it has a higher rank than the Philippines. On the OPVI scale Maldives is in last place even though it is first in terms of economic performance. Its rank is reduced mainly because of its low score on economic strength, a result of its highly negative balance of payments and budget balance positions as well as its high import dependence. Influence of HDI on country vulnerability rankings As explained above, the rankings of countries using the OPVI are obtained using macro indicators related to economic and energy variables.

An attempt has been made here, therefore, to incorporate the HDI as a ninth variable. The ranking of countries based on this OPVI is presented in Table 3-4 along with the rankings obtained earlier. Clearly, the countries with higher HDI levels have improved their rankings whereas countries with poor HDIs have worsened their rankings. Maldives, which was ranked last on the OPVI based only on macro indicators,improves its rank to 13. On the other hand, India\u2019s rank falls from 5 to 9. Countries such as Fiji, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam improve their rankings, whereas all the South Asian countries (except Sri Lanka) along with Lao PDR, Myanmar and Mongolia drop in the ranking. Iran remains at the top because of its strong macroeconomic indicators. This is also the case with China and Malaysia, which interchange positions. As the OPVI and earlier sections of this chapter have shown, a number of countries in the region are very vulnerable to oil price rises, and they could become even more vulnerable in the future. What can they do to reduce this vulnerability? That is the subject of the next chapter. Chapter 3: National vulnerability to oil price rises 51 Table 3-4 OPVI ranking of countries with and without the influence of HDI Endnotes 1 The analysis earlier had concluded that the variables in the \u2018Strength\u2019dimension accounted for 33 percent of the variance; those in the \u2018Performance\u2019dimension for 23 percent; and those in the \u2018Low-oil growth\u2019dimension for 19 percent.The dimension scores were therefore weighted accordingly to produce the weighted total score shown in the last column of Table 3-1. 2 Dimension index = Dimension value \u2013 minimum value Maximum value \u2013 minimum value Countries OPVI rank without HDI OPVI rank with HDI Afghanistan 13 23 Bangladesh 15 21 Bhutan 4 11 Cambodia 22 24 China 2 3 Fiji 18 10 India 5 9 Indonesia 7 6 Iran 1 1 Lao PDR 17 22 Malaysia 3 2 Maldives 24 13 Mongolia 9 12 Myanmar 11 15 Nepal 14 18 Pakistan 16 17 Papua New Guinea 6 8 Philippines 12 7 Samoa 19 16 Solomon Islands 21 19 Sri Lanka 20 14 Thailand 8 4 Vanuatu 23 20 Viet Nam 10 5 A number of countries in the region are very vulnerable to oil price rises, and could become even more so in the future Least vulnerable Medium Most vulnerable Chapter 4: Options for reducing oil price vulnerability 4 Rising oil prices can create a number of problems. They can, for example, increase inflation and put pressure on foreign exchange reserves. They can also create difficulties for poor households by pushing up the prices of kerosene and LPG, and for poor farmers through higher prices for fertilizers. This, in turn, creates problems for governments that wish to protect their citizens through subsidies. How can governments respond? This chapter outlines five strategic directions. The first pertains to managing the economic costs of oil price volatility and how this can be handled in the short run through a basket of fiscal and financial instruments. The second looks at the supply side, covering both domestic and other sources of oil. The third and fourth strategies both focus on reducing the demand for oil: one through reducing oil intensity, the other through diversifying to other fuels. The fifth strategy deals with emergency responses. Managing oil price risk Many governments have shielded consumers from the effects of oil price rises through a series of pricing measures that have regulated the \u2018pass-through\u2019. These measures, which are summarized in Table", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5d2f55c9-0e26-4769-992f-1f69f1673643": {"__data__": {"id_": "5d2f55c9-0e26-4769-992f-1f69f1673643", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bb7a3207f661d58367b5b7270c7d78a61490797aeda3a6c8429d19f1a7600315"}}, "hash": "bb7a3207f661d58367b5b7270c7d78a61490797aeda3a6c8429d19f1a7600315", "text": "4-1, include the following: Subsidies Governments often subsidize petroleum products, commonly household fuels such as kerosene and LPG but also, in some cases, transportation fuels. This, however, can be very costly. Thailand, for example, introduced price ceilings for petroleum products in January 2004, most of which continued until October 2004, and ceilings for diesel until February 2005,resulting in a subsidy bill for that period of around US$2.2 billion (ESMAP 2006b). Indonesia had a similar programme, which in 2005 produced a subsidy bill of about US$9.9 billion. An IMF study concluded that for a range of countries subsidy expenditures could be higher than health and education expenditures combined (IMF 2006d). On the other hand, the case studies in this report also point to the adverse consequences of completely withdrawing subsidies on household petroleum products, particularly kerosene, since this may push poor households back down the energy ladder to traditional fuels. Governments will therefore want to ensure that subsidy programmes are well managed and accurately targeted for the poor. Malaysia, for example, in 2006 launched a smart-card scheme targeted at public transport operators and fishermen, giving them access to subsidies through a monthly quota based on vehicle category or boat size. Lessons may also be learned from outside the region. Brazil, for example, progressively limited subsidies on LPG to only low-income consumers. This proved very effective and between 1960 and 2004 penetration of LPG increased from 18 percent to 98 percent (Modi et al. 2005). Other options include giving fewer subsidies for petroleum- based fuels and more for the capital costs of installing renewable technologies, as explored in the next chapter. Of course, the most enduring solution would be to reduce levels of poverty so that subsidies would be unnecessary. Tax adjustment Because many retail petroleum products, especially transportation fuels, can be quite heavily taxed, governments can smooth the prices for consumers by adjusting the rates of taxation. This has been the main form of adjustment in Bangladesh, for example, and Lao PDR. Following the recent oil price rise, more governments have resorted to tax adjustments rather than subsidies. Options for reducing oil price vulnerability What should countries do in response to rising oil prices? Clearly they will want to boost supplies and restrain demand. But they will also need to find ways of managing oil price risks while, at the same time, preparing for potential oil shocks. This chapter reviews some of the main options and the experience of the Asia-Pacific region in implementing them. 54 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific Price restraint Some governments have passed the subsidy burden on to the private sector, requiring companies to absorb international oil price increases. In China, India and Sri Lanka, for example, governments have obliged companies in the downstream oil sector to sell at lower prices. Similarly, in Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines and Thailand,governments have used their influence on the oil sector to keep petroleum product prices low. Compensation schemes If prices go up or subsidies are reduced, governments can try to offset the impact on the poor by compensating them in various ways. Indonesia, for example, after reducing subsidies on petroleum products in 2005, redirected some of the savings to a cash transfer programme for the poor of about US$30 per household every three months, as well as to poverty reduction programmes in education, rural development and health. China too has, in some provinces, briefly introduced cash transfer schemes to help tide consumers over rising oil prices. Governments also may consider that other safety net programmes offer good opportunities for targeting. Sri Lanka, for example, has a food stamps programme that is substantially better targeted than those for kerosene subsidies (IMF 2006d). A number of countries in the region have applied one or more of these pricing-related measures (Table 4-1). The guiding principles for these should be efficiency, equity, and effective revenue-raising, while also taking opportunities to reduce environmental impacts, for example, through higher taxes on gasoline for private cars. Using financial tools As well as being concerned about the level of prices, policy makers will also be worried about their volatility and the potential for sudden shocks. To cushion against these, governments and companies have at their disposal a variety of sophisticated financial products that they can buy and sell to enable them to offset the risks of sudden fluctuations. These derivatives take various forms, including \u2018forwards,\u2019 \u2018futures,\u2019 \u2018options\u2019and \u2018swaps,\u2019all of which can dampen the impact of price fluctuations. However, they are relevant largely in the short-term context, and all involve certain speculative risks of their own.

More recently, however, a process of deregulation has encouraged new risk management initiatives (Fusaro 2003). Some major corporate oil consumers in the region have also been using these tools. Airlines such as Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines and Malaysia Airlines use derivatives to hedge their jet fuel exposure. These measures are of course more appropriate for smoothing out prices and do not assist much with long-term price issues. It also seems that the use of such instruments is more relevant to major corporate consumers than to national governments. In addition to market-based tools, governments also have a number of other options for coping with oil price volatility.These include: Table 4-1 Price-based responses in selected countries Source: ESMAP 2006a Subsidies Tax adjustment Price restraint Compensation schemes Bangladesh China India Indonesia Lao PDR Malaysia Pakistan Philippines Sri Lanka Thailand Viet Nam \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd Governments can try to offset the impact of price rises by compensating the poor in various ways \u2022 Stabilization funds \u2013 These can be used by both oil exporters and importers. Based on pre-determined rules, exporters will pay into the fund when prices are high and can withdraw from it when prices are lower. Importers do the opposite. Norway, for example, in 1990, established a State Petroleum Fund to transfer wealth from oil and gas reserves to a broad-based portfolio of international securities. As well as acting as a form of savings, this also distributes wealth across generations. Management of the fund is outsourced but operates under government guidelines. Oil importers have also used such funds to stabilize retail prices. Namibia, for example, has imposed on consumers an \u2018equalization levy\u2019for every litre of diesel and petrol they buy \u2013 money which is transferred to a National Energy Fund. Within the region, Thailand established an oil price stabilization fund in 2004 to finance oil price subsidies. While the initial large demand upon the fund has subsided because of the subsequent removal of diesel and gasoline subsidies, the fund remains an important source of financing for LPG subsidies of about US$12.6 million a month (ADB 2005). India and the Philippines have had such funds, but these have now been suspended. Stabilization funds can be valuable, but they can also be difficult and expensive to operate and are probably best suited for addressing short\u2013 to medium-term oil price shocks. \u2022 Long-term contracts \u2013 Countries may also shield themselves from short-term fluctuations in oil prices by engaging in long-term contracts based on prices that are either fixed or adjustable within agreed ceilings and targets. Most of the trade in natural gas uses such contracts, but they are less common in the oil sector where, even in long-term contracts, the prices are linked to market prices. At present, however, there seems to be a move away from long-term contracts even for natural gas and crude oil, so this does not seem like a useful immediate option.

Enhancing oil supply Although the supply of oil is finite, governments in the region can take a number of measures to enhance supplies. These, which are summarized in Table 4-3, include the following: Strengthening oil exploration and extraction Higher prices can spur the search for new sources or encourage the exploitation of those hitherto unattractive. Some of the region\u2019s existing producers are now developing new fields. In Viet Nam, for example, exploration activities have been yielding results: in October 2004, a joint venture comprising American Technologies,Petronas,Singapore Petroleum and Petro Vietnam announced a 100-million-barrel oil discovery off the country\u2019s northeast coast. The Philippines too, though having only small reserves, in its Energy Plan 2005, stressed intensive promotion of oil and gas exploration. And the government of Sri Lanka is increasingly pinning its hopes on oil and gas discovery: In October 2005, it formed a new Ministry for Petroleum Resources Development to invite bids for oil and gas exploration (ESMAP 2006a). A number of oil-producing countries have also been simplifying their procedures and dismantling national monopolies in order to encourage greater private investment, including foreign investment. Indonesia, for example, has been limiting the control over oil sector development that was previously the preserve of Pertamina, the state-owned oil company. And Pakistan has executed production sharing agreements with exploration companies based in Austria, France and Malaysia. These measures offer considerable potential for LDCs in particular, since as well as bringing in capital investment, they also free up state resources for investment in the social sector. High oil prices have induced some regional countries who are not oil producers to redouble their efforts to discover resources, especially offshore.The main strategies in Sri Lanka and the Philippines, for example, involve oil and gas exploration. Countries can also take advantage of new technology to expand options, enabling companies to carry out more offshore drilling and make better use of unconventional sources, as has been done with tar sands in Canada and very heavy oil in Venezuela. These newer resources may be more expensive to exploit, but higher oil prices are making them more viable. New technology can also boost production at existing sites where rates of recovery are quite low. Globally, the average recovery rate is 35 percent, but in India, for example, it is 30 percent, and in Iran only 24 to 27 percent. Increasing refining capacity Another important way of enhancing supplies of petroleum products is to increase the capacity of refineries, as has been happening in China, India, Malaysia and Singapore.But it is also important to ensure that new refineries can process heavy sour crudes, which are cheaper and more readily available, while meeting the demand for lighter products such as transportation fuels, and accommodating environmental requirements. To refine heavier sour crudes, European and US refineries have been adding catalytic and hydro-cracking capacities. Asian refineries have also been doing so, but more slowly. China has been upgrading its refineries for this purpose, and in India, Reliance Petroleum is in the process of establishing a new 29-million-tonne refinery, capable of processing the heaviest and sourest of crude oils from the Middle East into high-quality refined products, primarily for export. This will benefit not only India but also the region\u2019s LDCs, which will have a new source of supply reasonably close to home and thus with lower transport costs. Building this kind of capacity is, however,expensive and time-consuming and has a high import requirement, so it will likely fall outside the reach of most of the poorer countries. Diversifying sources of oil Some economies in the regions that have sufficient demand can widen their range of supply sources, in three main ways: \u2022 Invest in foreign oil fields \u2013 India and China, mostly through state-owned companies, have already been investing in oil extraction in other countries. The China National Petroleum Corporation, for example, has invested in a number of countries, including Kazakhstan and Myanmar (ESMAP 2006a). \u2022 Diversify import sources \u2013 One way of reducing vulnerability to oil supply disruptions is to diversify sources of imports. For crude supplies, most Asian countries", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8be53e96-bed7-4ed3-8371-5ae067f0a507": {"__data__": {"id_": "8be53e96-bed7-4ed3-8371-5ae067f0a507", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d6878dc6c020de50c5da35c93f8efe2e5dca25ddfc3a24bc03d08637e12d7a68"}}, "hash": "d6878dc6c020de50c5da35c93f8efe2e5dca25ddfc3a24bc03d08637e12d7a68", "text": "will continue to depend largely on the Middle East, which is geographically the closest, but they could also diversify to some extent to Russia, Central Asia and Africa. This would reduce risks and also increase competition (APERC 2003). Maintaining oil price stability will also depend on regional and international 56 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific Some of the region\u2019s existing producers are now developing new oil fields cooperation among consuming countries, as well as on continuing dialogues between producers and consumers. Some importing countries have, for example, started negotiating price discounts or concessionary financing terms with oil producers. For example, Bangladesh, in March 2006, made an agreement with Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates to buy oil on concessionary terms. India has mooted the idea of limiting price volatility through an agreement between producers and consumers on a price band mechanism. Another option is to make bulk purchases: Honduras, for instance, recently announced such a government- supervised scheme. The Pacific Island Countries are currently discussing a joint procurement arrangement that could gain them price discounts on bulk purchases. \u2022 Cross-border trade \u2013 There are also opportunities for diversifying sources of oil by tapping the region\u2019s own oil resources through regional cooperation and mutually beneficial trade with neighbouring countries. On the one hand, the region has many consuming countries, which need to ensure the security, stability and sustainability of their oil supplies. These include the large oil consumers, China and India, as well as relatively smaller consumers ranging from Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Thailand to the mainly traditional energy consumers like Lao PDR and Cambodia. At the same time, the region also has a number off crude oil exporters \u2013 including Myanmar, Malaysia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Viet Nam. Both consuming and producing countries could therefore explore a common policy platform of Asian oil security, while bearing in mind the need to diversify sources of oil imports as well as sources of energy. This is especially important for LDCs, which have limited capacity to cushion themselves against supply bottlenecks and price barriers. Cross-border trade in oil could be promoted through mutually beneficial bilateral agreements. For this purpose, the oil sector could also learn from existing forms of regional cooperation for gas and electricity (Box 4-1). Engaging in barter The demand for oil is so large and persistent that many countries would do well to acquire it by exchanging their own exports directly. Bartering is a particularly useful option for countries that are short of US dollars, but other countries too can benefit from the reduced transaction costs. Countries could,for example,trade manufactured products or industrial crops for oil, arranging to get most grades of oil, most of the time, at the best available exchange ratios. They could also offer services. A number of oil-producing countries,especially those in Africa,lack the funds or knowledge to develop their infrastructure, while many Asian oil-consuming developing countries like China and India, which are struggling with high oil prices, can offer large pools of highly capable professionals and technical knowledge in exchange for oil. Chapter 4: Options for reducing oil price vulnerability 57 Box 4-1 Energy cooperation: Examples from gas and electricity Most energy resources yield optimal benefits when exploited by two or more nations,especially when they are relatively small and the resources are distributed across several countries. The hydroelectric potential of a river valley system, for example, can be exploited by several countries, and gas grids can connect several national markets. Such systems make better use of capacity and reduce costs. There already exist some examples in the Asia-Pacific region. Bhutan and India have arrangements for hydropower, as do Lao PDR and Thailand, and following the discovery of 10 gas fields, Thailand and Malaysia have agreed on a Joint Development Area. In addition, for gas, Indonesia has agreements with the Philippines,Thailand and Singapore. Now there is also an example for oil.Early in 2006,Timor-Leste signed a politically significant agreement with Australia to share equally the oil and gas revenues in a disputed territory that includes the Greater Sunrise gas field. Transportation of liquefied natural gas over long distances requires dedicated reserves and significant investment in infrastructure.But these can bring substantial economic benefits,as with the 8,000-kilometre Trans-Asian gas pipeline system that links East Asian markets. In this context, ASEAN's Regional Power Grid and Trans-ASEAN Gas Pipeline (TAGP) are important initiatives that can promote cross-border trade and cooperation for greater regional energy security. The TAGP is expected to build on existing national grids and bilateral pipeline connections, which at present connect Indonesia and Malaysia to Singapore,Myanmar to Thailand,and the delivery", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f2648131-9f90-482e-a6b8-97e726b83665": {"__data__": {"id_": "f2648131-9f90-482e-a6b8-97e726b83665", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b87e0213ffec04b43cb4aed352e761c5d6f687b55394aaa2319b1cba0e6f6a18"}}, "hash": "b87e0213ffec04b43cb4aed352e761c5d6f687b55394aaa2319b1cba0e6f6a18", "text": "of gas to Malaysia and Thailand from the Malaysia-Thailand Joint Development Area. Bartering of manufactured products,services or technical knowledge in exchange for oil is a particularly useful option In fact, for a variety of economic and political reasons various nations are already exploring barter trade in oil1: \u2022 China \u2013 The Yangpu Oil Barter Exchange is reportedly the world\u2019s first such exchange for oil and gas. The focus here is on putting together trades of oil for infrastructure. \u2022 India \u2013 The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation has teamed up with the L. N. Mittal steel group to offer a range of services to Kazakhstan in return for oil exploration rights. \u2022 Republic of Korea \u2013 The Korea National Oil Corporation has entered into an oil barter transaction with Nigeria, under which Korean conglomerate Daewoo will build a shipyard and a railway link in Nigeria. \u2022 Venezuela \u2013 Some 90,000 barrels of oil a day are shipped to Cuba in return for more than 30,000 physicians, sports coaches and teachers. Venezuela has also struck a deal with Argentina to supply additional oil against shipbuilding expertise and farm machinery. Restraining oil demand Restraining in this context does not mean cutting demand at the cost of economic or social activity, but rather, minimizing wastage and concentrating the use of oil on purposes for which cheaper alternatives are not available.This has the further merit of reducing costs for businesses and households while slowing the depletion of conventional oil resources and reducing the impact on the climate. 58 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific Table 4-3 Priority policy actions towards enhancing oil supplies Legislative and regulatory measures Fiscal, financial and institutional measures Direct public investment Strengthening oil exploration and extraction activities \u2022 Include oil exploration in the mandate of the oil companies; for example, a part of their profits must be expended on exploration activities. \u2022 Introduce fiscal incentives like tax rebates to oil companies to strengthen exploration activities. \u2022 Lend fiscal support to technological investments to enhance recovery rates from rigs; also allow them benefits of lower interest rates on institutional loans. \u2022 Invest in infrastructure around sites of oil exploration and extraction and in establishing technical R&D centres. Refining capacity to process sour crudes \u2022 Encourage the establishment of refining capacity for sour crudes. \u2022 Regulate the conversion of excess capacity, if any, for the processing of lighter crudes into refining capacity for sour crudes. \u2022 Introduce capital subsidies for sour crude refining facilities and duty exemptions for imported technology to be used in the refining facilities; also allow them the benefits of lower interest rates on institutional loans. \u2022 Provide infrastructure to establish new refining capacity and provide initial direct investments in new refining capacity for sour crudes. Diversifying sources of oil \u2022 Create policy initiatives to encourage investments in oil fields abroad by domestic oil companies and directives to explore new sources of oil, for example, tar sands. \u2022 Sanction the formation of strategic alliances across countries/ country groups to gain access to more diverse sources of oil. \u2022 Give tax benefits to companies investing in oil fields abroad. \u2022 Extend the facilities of accelerated depreciation to equipment used by oil companies extracting oil from unconventional sources such as tar sands and very heavy oil deposits. \u2022 Establish technical centres for R&D into new sources of oil. \u2022 Invest in pipelines and transport systems for the transfer of oil from international oil fields. Barter \u2022 Bring about legislation allowing international barter trade in oil. \u2022 Define areas of comparative advantage in the economy that may serve the country in a goods and services exchange programme. \u2022 Encourage the further development of non-oil sectors of comparative advantage, for example the services industry, through tax incentives. \u2022 Ease duty/ visa restrictions on the mobility of goods and services/ human capital associated with oil-related barter. \u2022 Invest in establishing an oil barter exchange. \u2022 Carry out techno-economic feasibility studies to examine on an ongoing basis which products may be bartered in exchange for oil, at what terms, and with which countries. This process has already been underway in the broader energy context, which includes oil. Between 1990 and 2002, energy efficiency improvements have helped reduce global energy demand by 20 percent (ENERDATA 2006). Over this period, 15 European countries on average improved the energy efficiency of final consumers by 10 percent. While between 1990 and 2003 their primary and final energy consumption increased by 0.9 percent per annum, their GDP grew twice as fast, demonstrating that economic activity had partially been decoupled from energy use.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b57b4a33-722e-47ea-968c-6a3777e075c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "b57b4a33-722e-47ea-968c-6a3777e075c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f0bc1d7d52b16828602ab868b56f7ad9d98bbcc4552d022cad7a307e24c20baf"}}, "hash": "f0bc1d7d52b16828602ab868b56f7ad9d98bbcc4552d022cad7a307e24c20baf", "text": "Around 10 percent of these gains came from structural changes in the economy toward less energy-intensive activities, often in the service sector. Asia-Pacific countries too have been improving energy efficiency. China has been leading the way:between 1990 and 2003,energy use per US$ PPP GDP declined from 0.49 to 0.22 kilograms of oil equivalent (kgoe) (World Bank 2006). India too achieved a reduction over the same period, from 0.25 to 0.18 kgoe, and Sri Lanka from 0.14 to 0.11 kgoe. Their changes may be smaller than China's but are still impressive since these countries started from higher levels of efficiency. Many other countries in the region have begun stressing energy efficiency and energy conservation. Indonesia, for example, has developed a Blueprint for Energy Management, while the Philippines has adopted an Energy Plan to curtail the intensity of fossil fuel consumption and help achieve energy independence. China and India have also enacted laws to conserve energy and have established accompanying implementation mechanisms. There are four broad strategies for achieving greater efficiency in oil use: \u2022 Making structural changes \u2013 Shifting to less oil-intensive activities, from manufacturing to services, for example. \u2022 Reducing oil intensity \u2013 Changing the patterns and practices of production and consumption to make them less oil intensive. \u2022 Improving technology \u2013 Upgrading production equipment and making consumer devices more energy-efficient. \u2022 Substituting fuels \u2013 Displacing oil with other fuels. The first three options are discussed in detail in the sections below on transport, industry, agriculture and households. The issue of fuel diversification is discussed in two parts. The first part in this chapter concerns diversification using fossil fuels.The second part,which forms the next chapter, concerns renewable energy options. The options for reducing oil intensity are summarized in Table 4-4. Transport Countries can develop strategies for reducing fuel consumption through, for example, inter-city freight transport plans, urban mobility plans that can involve inter-modal mass transit, and specific plans for targeted groups, such as youth and workers.They can also promote better use of land and \u2018smart growth\u2019that reduces urban sprawl and the need for driving, while also reducing fuel wastage through real-time, congestion-based road pricing. All these methods also will have the benefit of improving air quality. Another set of options involves changing patterns and practices to reduce vehicle- kilometres travelled.These include adjusting fuel and vehicle prices, improving mass transit services and promoting car-pooling and the use of smaller and more efficient vehicles. The government of Philippines, for example, has halted the purchase of new vehicles, optimized office air conditioning and reduced official trips. Other options include promoting on-board fuel economy technology, encouraging telecommuting and motivating drivers to drive more efficiently. In an example from outside the region,Honduras, in May 2006, introduced several new measures to save fuel costs. It changed fuel taxation to encourage fuel switching from gasoline with a research octane number of 95 to 87, and it ordered the 60,000 state-owned vehicles to use the cheapest fuel available and to circulate on alternate days depending on their license plates. Other ways to reduce energy intensity require better technology. These would involve more efficient vehicles, including hybrid cars as well as innovative structures and advanced materials such as lightweight steel and carbon-fibre composites.'Intelligent highway systems\u2019also can contribute, along with telematic systems for freight transport and more advanced technology in railways, airplanes and marine transport. Chapter 4: Options for reducing oil price vulnerability 59 New mass transit plans and \u2018smart growth\u2019that reduces urban sprawl can reduce fuel costs and consumption Some of these measures require major and potentially disruptive technological adaptations. To cushion the immediate impact on economic activity, these could be introduced in a phased manner. China, for example, is implementing fuel efficiency norms for passenger cars in two phases: Phase I was implemented in 2005/06, while Phase II will be implemented in 2008/09. Industry Many countries have been diversifying away from industries that are energy intensive, initially focusing on industries linked, upstream or downstream, to energy production. When it comes to energy-intensive products, they have been aiming to use a higher proportion of recycled materials.Within the electricity industry, some have been using a higher proportion of renewables and making efforts to manage peak electricity demand. They have also been taking measures to improve energy efficiency elsewhere while shifting from oil to other energy sources, particularly those like Lao PDR and Bhutan,which have considerable hydroelectric potential. Some countries have also been trying to change consumption patterns, for example, through education campaigns that aim to reduce peak electricity demand.In Viet Nam in 2005 and 2006, government agencies were asked to reduce fuel purchase expenditures by 10 percent (ESMAP", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29b76524-ff4a-443c-9e1c-07d023f5e1ba": {"__data__": {"id_": "29b76524-ff4a-443c-9e1c-07d023f5e1ba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "79247ad9d339d869dc9719cc5753a4dd00fb2e92bc2a7321a44eb8aec5e5935b"}}, "hash": "79247ad9d339d869dc9719cc5753a4dd00fb2e92bc2a7321a44eb8aec5e5935b", "text": "2006b). Countries in other regions, such as Guatemala, Honduras and Tunisia, have adopted daylight saving time in summer to reduce electricity consumption. Moreover, in Tunisia the public sector is required to choose low-energy consumption equipment and carry out annual energy audits. Several other countries are providing tax incentives and publicity campaigns to promote the purchase of energy-efficient appliances or imposing a ban on the import and marketing of inefficient appliances (ESMAP 2006a). Options for promoting more efficient use of energy include: offering tax rebates for energy-efficient technologies; raising taxes on energy guzzlers; introducing programmes for benchmarking and for appropriate labelling; improving building codes; and subsidizing energy audits. Industry and government can also negotiate voluntary agreements for improving energy efficiency and reducing energy-related greenhouse gas emissions. It is especially important to ensure effective programmes for testing the energy efficiency of equipment and promoting energy efficiency standards. Some countries in the region have introduced these but need to improve enforcement. Countries can also make better use of new technologies, to improve the efficiency of, for example, furnaces, boilers, burners, thermal insulation and steam networks, and to optimize and integrate various processes. Other options include thermal cascading, district energy schemes and better energy recovery. Agriculture Energy efficiency in agriculture can be increased by, for example, optimizing the use of oil- consuming agricultural machinery through cooperatives, reducing energy input per hectare and reclaiming marginal land for cultivation. There also exist possibilities for changing farming patterns and practices: encouraging farmers to operate tractors and pumps more efficiently and moving to night or drip irrigation. In the 1980s, Bangladesh imported from China many cheap but inefficient diesel irrigation pump sets, but following rural electrification, has encouraged farmers to switch to electric pump sets. Households Households can increase energy efficiency by working together. Many have micro-enterprises at home that they could combine as community enterprises.They could also consider community cooking. Manufacturers likewise have an important part to play in improving household energy use. They can offer more efficient appliances, including air conditioners, room heaters, electric irons, TV sets and motorized grinders.In many cases they do so voluntarily, but can also be obliged to follow regulations based on standards and specifications. All equipment should be screened before it goes on sale, so that consumers can make choices based on energy efficiency. For this to work, consumers will need to be sensitized to the benefits of buying energy- efficient equipment that may be slightly more expensive but will bring long-term savings. In rural areas these will include more efficient stoves and better-designed kerosene lamps. 60 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific Industries may benefit from tax rebates for energy- efficient technologies,as well as subsidized energy audits Manufacturers have an important part to play in improving household energy use,by offering more efficient appliances Policy tools and instruments Across all these sectors governments have three main sets of instruments: \u2022 Legislation and regulation \u2013 Laws, standards and specifications, mandatory quotas, targets and obligations. \u2022 Fiscal and financial measures \u2013 Subsidies, taxes, duties, financial incentives and disincentives. \u2022 Direct public investment \u2013 In social infrastructure, market infrastructure, technology, research and development, technology transfer, capacity building, and institutional and human resource development. The choices will vary according to oil price scenarios and national circumstances, but some of the most important options are listed in Table 4-4. While many of these measures will be useful for most countries,other approaches may be needed for the Pacific Island Countries. Most depend heavily on oil products as their main energy sources and have few options for producing biomass. Many are, however, blessed with solar and other indigenous energy resources. Where appropriate, certain islands with relatively high population densities could also look into the option of adopting systems of combined heat and power generation \u2013 heat recovered from thermal power plants can be tapped to desalinate water, for example, and for industrial Chapter 4: Options for reducing oil price vulnerability 61 Table 4-4 Measures to reduce oil intensity Legislation and regulations Fiscal and financial measures Direct public investment Transport \u2022 Mandate relevant authorities to develop transport master plans. \u2022 Adopt minimum fuel- efficiency standards and mandatory efficiency labelling. \u2022 Set target dates and penetration rates for biofuels and other cleaner fuels. \u2022 Remove price distortions and eliminate subsidies that mostly benefit the rich. \u2022 Introduce incentives for \u2018scrap and replace\u2019 programmes aimed at low-income households. \u2022 Provide financial assistance for urban mobility plans for various stakeholders. \u2022 Provide financial assistance to purchase fuel- efficient public transport vehicles. \u2022 Impose, on private vehicles, higher fuel taxes that reflect the social cost", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2522f64f-a926-43ff-9a87-16c2cf8a75b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "2522f64f-a926-43ff-9a87-16c2cf8a75b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f15a9b0e6162cc82899d31947e625c5b018a1dbf63281745e4dcbd2e77fc702d"}, "3": {"node_id": "335702a6-a927-4309-a5ab-6c94978b6f95", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "28e0716b86be48b46abf97be81203c8f2dd6ac7c8c01a1059200683865ac6dfe"}}, "hash": "443870e427ca5f95258bff1c6ad772ff63a029545b970fd302cb19966eb8daaa", "text": "of travelling. \u2022 Set annual registration taxes for cars on the basis of engine size, weight and efficiency. \u2022 Offer incentives for procurement of new technologies. \u2022 Strengthen existing institutions. \u2022 Set up observatories to gather relevant data and benchmarking. \u2022 Undertake \u2018well-to-wheel\u2019 analysis. \u2022 Launch driver-training and mass awareness programmes. \u2022 Support R&D to develop enabling technologies. \u2022 Support R&D and help manufacturers to improve production facilities.

In addition, electricity utilities on the islands can introduce pricing measures to reduce peak demand and, where feasible, distribute energy-efficient appliances to households. Diversifying fuels Given that energy demands will continue to rise, particularly in developing countries, restraining demand for oil will have to be accompanied by efforts to switch in the medium and long term from oil to alternative energy sources, including large hydro,coal,natural gas and renewable ener- gy technologies.These measures will,however,be subject to tradeoffs between the demands of efficiency, environmental protection, and equity. Sustaining access to energy services and switching from oil to domestic energy resources is also dependent on accessing adequate capital and sometimes technology to expand domestic energy supply systems. Possible energy sector liberalization and associated trade in energy services may further support other domestic efforts. Natural gas and coal One of the most readily available options is natural gas. Between 2002 and 2030, the IEA (IEA 2004b) expects gas consumption in developing Asia to more than triple, from about 208 to 672 billion cubic metres (bcm). Most of the absolute demand increase will be in East Asia, although India\u2019s share will also increase significantly. At present natural gas is not generally used for power generation but is likely to be used more for this purpose in future: in fact, about half of the increase in gas consumption in Asia by 2030 could be for power generation and some 23 percent for industry. Most of the increase in the gas trade in Asia is expected to be in the form of liquefied natural gas. The IEA expects gas flows into the Asia-Pacific region in 2030 to be dominated by those from the Middle East, including 57 bcm per year to the Republic of Korea, 44 bcm per year to India and 13 bcm per year to China (IEA 2004b). The other major flows into the region are expected to be from Russia, including 22 bcm per year to Japan and 19 bcm per year to China. The main sources within the region will be Indonesia, which will export 64 bcm per year to Japan, and Australia, which is expected to export around 40 bcm per year to Japan. Asian countries are adopting natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power generation systems.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "335702a6-a927-4309-a5ab-6c94978b6f95": {"__data__": {"id_": "335702a6-a927-4309-a5ab-6c94978b6f95", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f15a9b0e6162cc82899d31947e625c5b018a1dbf63281745e4dcbd2e77fc702d"}, "2": {"node_id": "2522f64f-a926-43ff-9a87-16c2cf8a75b4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "443870e427ca5f95258bff1c6ad772ff63a029545b970fd302cb19966eb8daaa"}}, "hash": "28e0716b86be48b46abf97be81203c8f2dd6ac7c8c01a1059200683865ac6dfe", "text": "Asian countries are adopting natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power generation systems.

The main targets in recent years have been the new industrial or urban zones and airport complexes in countries like Malaysia and Thailand. Cogeneration can substantially reduce generation losses, with conversion efficiency of fuel to useful power and heat as high as 80 to 90 percent. Cogeneration also has significant potential to reduce CO2 emissions. A further option is to use hybrid cycles in which each cycle uses a different fuel. For example, a gas-fired plant can be integrated into a coal-fired facility. A heat recovery unit transfers heat from the exhaust of the gas turbine to the coal side of the process. This is more efficient and cost- effective than building separate units and is suitable for sites such as industrial estates that require large quantities of high-pressure steam (Box 4-2).2 Gas will also be used more for transport.To lower pollution in congested city centres many cities of the region are starting to use natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas as fuels for urban transportation. For power generation many countries will also be making greater use of coal. In developing Asia, coal use for this purpose will almost quadruple by 2030. Compared with other fossil fuels, however, coal presents significant environmental challenges. Some of the near-term promising technologies for clean coal power generation are the use of better materials, higher pressures and temperatures, double reheating and reduction in condenser pressure. Technologies that are promising for higher power generation efficiency include supercritical pulverized fuel technology, atmospheric fluidized bed combustion, 62 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific Efforts must be made to diversify to oil alternatives such as hydropower,coal, natural gas and renewable energy technologies pressurised fluidized bed combustion, integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) and hybrid combined cycle systems. The scope for IGCC development is substantial in rapidly growing economies like China and India that also have large coal reserves and do not have natural gas readily available. The EIA (EIA 2004) expects Japan to remain the largest coal importer but to continue losing its share of the Asian import market to the Republic of Korea, and India. Japan has seen its share of Asian coal imports fall over the past two decades, from about 85 percent in 1980 to 46 percent in 2003. Over the next 20 years, coal imports are likely to increase substantially in Malaysia. The Indian government has recently approved captive mining for production of gas through coal gasification and liquefaction. The underground coal gasification programme is aimed at the extraction of energy from coal seams that cannot otherwise be mined through conventional methods. Renewable sources of energy Renewable energy technologies currently supply 13 percent of the world\u2019s primary energy supply but up to 32 percent for Asia. Thanks to the increased use of renewables such as hydropower, wind, solar, biomass and geothermal, the share of renewables in developing Asia should rise if their generation costs become competitive with conventional fossil fuel resources. The rapid pace of technological change is also creating opportunities for a broader range of small-scale and low-cost energy supply options that are affordable for the poorest, both for off-grid and utility-connected applications. The challenge lies, however, in using these resources for productive and income-generating activities, so that the poor can pay for these modern energy services that are essential for improving their quality of life. The cost-effectiveness of various technologies is explored in greater detail in Chapter 5. The following sections highlight the types of fuel diversification likely to occur in different economic sectors. Transport As one of the largest consumers of petroleum products, this sector is unlikely to move away from oil very quickly, but there have been a number of developments. One option is to develop electricity-driven mass transit systems. Another is to switch to alternative-fuel automobiles, using LPG or CNG, ethanol or biodiesel blending, hybrid-electric, and hydrogen fuel from windpower. The focus of India\u2019s biofuel programme, for example, is diesel produced from oil-bearing seeds of several plants, including Jatropha curcas, and blended with high-speed diesel. Several other countries in the region, including Malaysia,Philippines and Thailand,have adopted targets \u2013 some mandatory \u2013 to increase the contribution of biofuels to their transport fuel supplies.

One group of companies has already installed close to 2,000 MW of power generating capacity, capable of providing more than 900 tonnes of steam per hour for various industrial-processing units. For example, in the Map Ta Phut industrial estate in Rayong, a combined-cycle cogeneration plant started operation in October 1996 with the capacity to generate 300 MW of electricity,primarily using natural gas with diesel oil as backup fuel.In addition to generating electricity, the facility provides 320 tonnes of high-pressure steam every hour to several petrochemical and downstream industries. The electrical efficiency of the combined cycle is more than 45 percent, whereas in cogeneration mode, the global efficiency is almost 70 percent. To mitigate the risk and to avoid dependence on a single type of fuel,a new \u2018hybrid\u2019technology was adopted in the next phase of the project. Hybrid cogeneration allows for fuel flexibility as both natural gas and high-quality and clean bituminous coal are used as fuels. The circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boiler technology used in hybrid block cogeneration is a proven clean coal technology that produces lower emissions of SO2, NOx, CO2 and dusts than conventional technologies. The hybrid system\u2019s power generating efficiency is 43 percent, compared with the 41 percent that would have been obtained with a separate combined cycle gas turbine and a separate coal plant in condensing mode.The hybrid cogeneration plant generates 514 MW of electricity and provides 200 tonnes of high-pressure steam every hour. Source: COCO 2000 biofuels as an opportunity to revive and expand copra production for coconut oil as a fuel supplement, giving increased income to copra producers. Delivered in the right manner, biofuels are very promising. But there are risks, and it will be important to safeguard the interests of the poor. There are genuine concerns that growing crops for biofuels may create greater competition for limited land, water and food. The challenges and opportunities presented by biofuels are considered in greater detail in Chapter 5. Industry Fuel substitution options in the industrial sector include the replacement of petroleum chemical feedstock by biomaterials and the promotion of alternative fuels. An example of the former is the shift away from oil in the fertilizer sector, as in India, where for feedstock, there is a clear move away from naphtha to natural gas.In China,a similar shift is taking place, substituting oil with coal. Other options include promoting the conversion of existing oil-fired plants to other fuels or multi-fuel firing, and exploring alternatives like biomass gasification or biogas power generation for decentralized power supply. For example, following the oil price hikes during 2005-2006, several industries in Thailand switched from oil to coal, biomass or agro-industrial residues. The change is, however, likely to be gradual because of the need, for most applications, to invest in new capital equipment. Agriculture Farmers who use petroleum products in agricultural machinery for irrigation and in threshing can in some cases switch to electricity made available through accelerated rural electrification programmes. Other options for fuel substitution include biomass liquid fuel for tractors and diesel pumps along with the use of hybrid systems such as solar photovoltaic- powered water pumps, with diesel as a backup. Households With growing rural electrification and urbanization, it will be important to reduce the use of petroleum products in power generation. One option, for both grid-based and decentralized systems is to switch to renewable sources. China and India, which have large coal reserves, also would benefit from making more use of clean coal technologies. Several countries are seriously considering expanding their nuclear power capacity, as witnessed by the recent US-India agreement and signs of ASEAN reconsidering its decades-old stance as a nuclear-free zone. Because energy consumption patterns in households are closely linked to incomes, the replacement of oil by other fuels and energy sources bears upon poverty.In the initial stages of the transition from traditional biomass fuels and human or animal labour,poor households turn to petroleum products like kerosene and diesel. Measures to promote fuel substitution away from these will, therefore, need to be tailored to the poor\u2019s purchasing power.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e2e2c2ad-26ed-4a4e-98fd-514c9cbbd08f": {"__data__": {"id_": "e2e2c2ad-26ed-4a4e-98fd-514c9cbbd08f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fd6badb82f00950b88527ebc7fe115e812e1ef5bd169dc02296575805df53fc3"}, "2": {"node_id": "bf97d882-a89f-4963-a623-2b99e89f803c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8a0f865d145684593f00ed0d58e090b12d768069a8132d0d07398b2404936d55"}}, "hash": "b7c13e8b1a4993df66f62f69d67384a079b810cbee87b9be05c9ac7752dbd63f", "text": "A good solution for some rural areas in less developed countries is the development of renewable energy through community initiatives.

Table 4-5 lists priority policy actions for fuel diversification. UNDP\u2019s regional study on cross-border energy trade3 recognises possible benefits from energy sector liberalization and associated trade in energy services, in the form of increased investment, which can enable the switch from oil to domestic energy resources. The following section incorporates some relevant findings from the study and highlights in more detail the possible benefits from these, touching upon the case of costly traditional domestic resources. Trade in energy services The impacts of trade in energy services in the form of capital and technology can be beneficial for importing countries in their attempts to switch from oil to domestic energy resources. Expanding the distribution networks and also building new infrastructure to supply new customers requires adequate capital. Foreign investment provides also the possibility to gain access to improved technology and management methods. Energy services trade can be introduced as foreign participation in the domestic energy market regardless of whether the internal energy market has been liberalized. In a regulated 64 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific Community-based development of rural energy systems offers a promising model market, an example could be an investment in an independent power plant. The foreign investment within the energy sector may reduce the need for government investment funds, which can then increase money for other types of expenditures,including those that target poor people. A liberalized market that allows entrepreneurs, including foreign ones, to operate rural concessions in areas not covered by the grid could help increase access rates to energy services in rural areas. Improved technology and managerial methods, in turn, can improve quality of service, lower costs, and provide opportunities for improving access due to more cost-effective technological solutions within the energy sector. Moreover, these improvements can benefit energy consumers, including households, subsequently generating positive spin offs in the economy. Eventual lower costs of supply through improved efficiency should ultimately lower the cost of supply. These efficiency gains may be evident either in the form of lower prices for energy, or reduced government subsidies to the particular sector.

In addition, efforts are being made to rely more on domestic sources of energy, developed with the help of foreign investments (Box 4-3). Costly domestic resources A common strategy in many countries is an effort to rely more on domestic energy resources. Nevertheless, replacing oil by other fuels and energy sources might not be the first option in those countries where the poor rely on traditional biomass fuels. In many cases, without trade an energy supply system would be costly and access to energy services would be restricted, either because prices are beyond the poor, or because the sector's resources are so stretched as to limit investment in supply to the poor. The initial stage of fuel diversification is then more likely to be toward petroleum products as was discussed in the context of fuel diversification at the household level. Therefore, expansion of access to petroleum products via trade can help lower the pressure on biomass resources by reducing the use of fuelwood and charcoal, although the transition away from these fuels is often slow and influenced by a variety of economic and social factors. Preparing for emergencies Each country also needs to prepare for abrupt disruptions in oil supplies. This should involve measures to build strategic reserves as well as plans to make rapid and drastic cuts in oil consumption through rationing systems. Following the oil price shocks in the 1970s and 1980s, a number of countries like Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam introduced such measures as fuel rationing, fuel stamps and lifeline tariffs. Indeed, in India some of these measures like kerosene rationing and quotas at subsidized prices are still in place. Some of the available measures, which are summarized in Table 4-6, are as follows. Building strategic reserves Both governments and private companies can keep stockpiles of crude oil and oil products separate from operational ones. The cost of holding emergency stocks should be passed on to consumers through the market price. These costs can be high. For India, for example, the cost of building storage to stock 15 million tonnes of crude oil was estimated in 2004 at US$950 million (UNCTAD 2006). Governments can, however, reduce costs by holding stocks jointly with other countries (APERC 2000). As well as using the stockpiles for emergencies, governments might also consider them as ways of managing consumption and also of helping to reduce worldwide demand. But it may not be feasible to use reserves as a buffer against price volatility,and they will clearly be of little use during long periods of constrained production. Instead, they should be seen more as short-term solutions. Several Asia-Pacific countries have begun to develop strategic oil reserves.Japan has 171 days of consumption reserve,which would correspond to nearly 980 million barrels. India has begun to develop a strategic crude oil reserve expected to be pegged at 40 million barrels. The Republic of Korea has a reported reserve of 43 million barrels and Australia has 90 days of reserves in addition to over 200 days held in private reserves. Among the ASEAN countries,Thailand recently increased the size of its strategic reserve from 60 to 70 days of consumption. Singapore has an estimated storage capacity of 32 million barrels of crude oil and 65 million barrels of oil products. By 2008, China plans to have an 800-million-barrel strategic reserve stored at four facilities (Sakhuja 2005). 66 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific Box 4-3 Fuel diversification in Cambodia via cross-border trade and domestic resources Electricity is quite expensive in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh.

This fuel switch could reduce the price to half or even to one-eighth compared to the price before the switch. Further efforts are being made to diversify away from gasoline and diesel to alternative energy sources.Domestic hydroelectricity power generation,to be developed with the help of foreign investment,is envisaged for the future.Cooperation with Chinese companies is already bringing about a major change in Cambodia; local generators are giving way to nationwide grid connected hydroelectricity. While being relatively expensive due to high capital investment,hydropower should still be cheaper for consumers than electricity generated from oil. Source: Sokha 2006; Sokha 2007 An example of a multi-country strategic reserve within the framework of regional cooperation is the 1986 ASEAN Petroleum Security Agreement (APSA). This established an ASEAN Emergency Petroleum Sharing Scheme. In cases of critical shortage, total supply falls below 80 percent of normal domestic consumption, the oil-exporting members of ASEAN would provide emergency oil supplies.In times of broader crises affecting more than one ASEAN member state, the agreement calls for the distribution to be allocated initially in proportion to their respective normal domestic consumption and to exports for the 12-month period prior to the crisis. APSA has never actually been executed,although it nearly was in the early 1990s during the Gulf War (Giragosian 2004). Rationing to ensure essential supplies Even if a country can draw on an emergency stockpile, it will still need to restrain demand, both to conserve fuel and send a strong market signal. High prices may themselves restrain demand but may need to be supplemented by other measures such as establishing quotas for sectors that provide essential services (OECD/IEA 2004). But such rationing must be done with caution, bearing in mind possible fallouts: \u2022 Hoarding \u2013 Panic buying may result in hoarding. This can be averted by keeping oil supplies tight, for instance, through an oil allocation scheme. \u2022 Economic downturn \u2013 Rationing may curtail economic activity and affect the incomes of vulnerable groups. \u2022 Reduced mobility \u2013 Restrictions on transport would constrain mobility. This may not only reduce economic activity through lost work days but also undermine social welfare by denying access to education or health care. The transport sector does, however, offer many opportunities to restrain oil demand in emergency situations. As described earlier, these include increasing the use of public transport, encouraging car-pooling and telecommuting, changing work schedules, introducing driving bans and restrictions,and promoting \u2018ecodriving,\u2019 which includes modifying the driving style, for example, and adjusting tyre inflation to increase fuel efficiency.It should be noted,however,that in most developing countries of the region, these measures would generally only work in large cities. All of these initiatives require countries to plan and adopt systems early so that when a crisis arises, measures can be put in place quickly. Preparing for oil emergencies either through access to strategic oil reserves or through rationing requires considerable advance preparations. Table 4-6 outlines some of the priority measures that would have to be undertaken. In addition to the options listed in this chapter, countries will also want to consider diversifying the fuels they use, and in particular, making more use of renewable resources. This issue is addressed in detail in the next chapter.

Chapter 5: Options in renewable energy 5 Earlier chapters have shown how rising oil prices have hit many poor communities and also put pressure on the budgets of those governments that have tried to protect them through subsidies.In response,a number of countries with the appropriate natural resources have been diversifying to other energy sources such as large-scale hydroelectricity, natural gas or coal. But in recent years, countries all over the world have been exploiting a wider array and scale of renewable energy sources, particularly solar, wind, small-hydro, geothermal and biomass1. Investments in these renewable energy sources have recently been growing rapidly because of significant oil price increases and increasing concerns for climate change.These investments \u2013 mostly in developed countries \u2013 coupled with ongoing technology improvements and cost reduction policies and programmes, have made the cost of modern energy services from renewable energy technologies (RETs) increasingly competitive with oil-based systems. As indicated in Chapter 4, renewable energy technologies currently supply 13 percent of the world\u2019s primary energy supply, whereas their share is as high as 32 percent for Asia (IEA 2007b). A regional study undertaken by UNDP identified several models introduced in the region that showcase successful examples of scaling up off-grid renewable energy technologies, particularly in the poorer countries of the region2. These models include household biogas in Nepal, solar photovoltaic (PV) home systems in Sri Lanka, Nepal and now Bangladesh, and micro- hydropower in Indonesia, Nepal and the Philippines. In almost all cases, these markets are the result of public-private partnerships. RETs are often ideal for rural or remote communities, providing them with sustainable energy services for heating, electricity generation, transportation and other mechanical power applications. The rise of renewables The strongest growth in RET use has been in grid-connected power facilities such as small- hydro, wind farms and biomass cogeneration facilities. However, the viability and competitiveness of RET-based power generation facilities depend on many site-specific factors, such as local renewable resource endowment and policy and programme support. Thus, some grid-based RET power generation facilities may be cost competitive with fossil-based systems in one country,but not in another.There can also be differences between subregions within a country. Nevertheless, in most areas off-grid RET-based power generation facilities are generally cost-competitive with similarly sized petroleum-based systems. The cost competitiveness of RETs was analysed in a 2002 IEA study. Based on the experience of developed and developing countries, the IEA estimated the costs of generating electricity using biomass, solar, small-hydro, wind and geothermal technologies. Table 5-1 presents the findings, showing the ranges of investment and generating costs for 2002 with corresponding projections for 2010.These ranges are quite wide since the costs for renewables can vary greatly according to the type of system,the local physical environment and government policies. Options in renewable energy The previous chapter reviewed five broad strategies for reducing oil-price vulnerability. One of these was to diversify to other fuels,and this chapter considers one of the most promising ways of doing so \u2013 making greater use of renewable energy technologies. As Table 5-1 indicates,at the lower end of the cost spectrum a number of sources, such as biomass, small hydropower, wind and geothermal power plants, can, under optimal conditions, generate electricity at two to five US cents per kilowatt hour (kWh). These results were compared with conventional large-scale power generation facilities, based on coal, natural gas and nuclear energy. They show that renewables are on a par with wholesale electricity prices, and even at the higher end of the scale, small-hydro, geo-thermal and wind systems are producing energy at costs within the retail consumer price. In terms of technology,the highest growth in RET investment is in solar PV and wind power systems (Figure 5-1 and Figure 5-2). But other renewable sources have been expanding too, as indicated in Table 5-2, which shows the total capacity added in 2005.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cb60c20b-ab42-4d5b-8c11-e2e2796cd17e": {"__data__": {"id_": "cb60c20b-ab42-4d5b-8c11-e2e2796cd17e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "af137457245c0ad8e13fafe50c45104d2277e2c715f88329c0e2c48eae98d024"}, "2": {"node_id": "0f00749a-4d48-401d-a3e4-04c7660ed6ad", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1dc28b05af5f0d2fc35b1071a3f3ec1c1183660d8bd81f1725161c9090519f22"}}, "hash": "48b9b4210c4d7b184818220cfb0db85dc85763884b66c733f0716c39b2cc4726", "text": "Figure 5-3 shows the leaders in generating power from renewable resources other than large-hydro.

Sri Lanka. In these countries, micro-hydropower systems are usually developed as community- based energy systems and have often been able to provide energy services more equitably,as well as offer sufficient power for productive end uses in rural and remote areas. However, scaling up these community-based models remains a challenge. Grids are also being fed by wind energy systems. In this case Asia\u2019s leader is India, which has 4.4 gigawatts (GW) of installed capacity. But China too is moving ahead; already it has 1.3 GW of wind electric capacity and is adding more quickly; its near-shore and off-shore capacity is estimated at many tens of gigawatts. The Philippines also has considerable potential and,in 2004, inaugurated a 25 MW wind farm, the first in the South-East Asian subregion. There are also opportunities for Pacific Island Countries, but apart from Fiji,which has one 10 MW plant,countries have yet to invest in grid-connected wind systems. The other main source for grid electricity from renewable energy is biomass.

This made it possible to compare the levelized3 economic costs of electricity generation using different technologies over a broad range of deployment modes and demand levels, both present and future. 72 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific Figure 5-3 Leading countries in using renewable energy for power generation, 2005 Table 5-3 Forecast decreases in capital costs for various technologies, 2004 to 2015 World total Developing countries EU-25 China Germany United States Spain India Japan 200 150 100 50 0 Solar PV (grid) Geothermal Biomass Wind Small Hydro Gigawatts Note: Excludes large hydropower Source: REN21 2006a Source:World Bank 2005b Generating technology Decrease in capital cost Geothermal, biogas, pico/micro hydro, diesel/gasoline genset 0% to 5% Biomass gasifier 6% to 10% Solar PV, wind, PV-wind hybrids 11% to 20% For off-grid or mini-grid scenarios,most renewable energy systems are cheaper than gasoline or diesel generators The study also anticipated that over the period 2004 to 2015 the prices of these technologies would fall as a result of technological innovation and mass production, though by differing amounts corresponding to the maturity of each technology (Table 5-3). To allow for the range of circumstances in which the technologies could be operating, the costs were estimated for a \u2018low,\u2019 \u2018most-probable,\u2019 and \u2018high\u2019 cost trend, calculated over three different time periods (2005, 2010 and 2015). On this basis, the World Bank study concluded that for off-grid or mini-grid systems, most renewable energy systems could indeed work out cheaper than gasoline or diesel generators. Future oil price scenarios The picture can change, however, according to the level of oil prices and their variation over time. To address this, therefore, it is important to consider potential future oil price scenarios. For this report we have selected four, which have been discussed in detail in chapter 6: \u2022 Baseline (BL) \u2013 Oil prices remain between US$ 65-75 per barrel. \u2022 Supply shock (SS) \u2013 A supply crisis suddenly pushes prices beyond US$100 per barrel in the short to medium term, but over the long term, prices decline to their previous levels. \u2022 Peak oil price (POP) \u2013 This assumes that the world is reaching peak oil production. Prices rise gradually toward US$100 per barrel and increase exponentially thereafter. \u2022 Energy security (ES) \u2013 Concerns for both energy and environmental security lead to reduced oil demand, so prices fall back to a lower equilibrium at around US$50 per barrel. The rationale for choosing these four scenarios is presented in greater detail in the next chapter. The crude oil prices that they imply are indicated in Figure 5-4. The corresponding prices for gasoline and diesel are indicated in Table 5-4. The following is a cost comparative analysis of generation costs of RETs vs oil-based generator sets, which are calculated based on assumptions. The assumptions can be found in Appendix E.

Woody biomass and agricultural wastes are the main sources within the category of biomass fuels for heating. Biomass is a renewable energy source, though it may not actually be renewable in places where high commercial demand leads to unsustainable collection.The bulk of traditional biomass energy use involves inefficient stoves that waste energy and fill houses with smoky fumes that are a hazard to health, particularly for women and young children. Dirty, inefficient technologies and unsustainable resource management practices pose problems with continued and expanded use of biomass. Kerosene, LPG, or piped natural gas, and in some areas, coal, are the modern alternatives, but these fuels, unless subsidized, remain costly for many poor households. Modern biomass heating Modern biomass energy systems, coupled with sustainable biomass resource management practices, can be competitive with petroleum fuel-based cooking and heating.Modern biomass energy systems include improved stoves, boilers, kilns and ovens.They also include biogas systems. Recently, there has been a revival of biomass gasifiers and their direct use for heating, led primarily by India and China. These biomass heating technologies are used not only in households but also in enterprises and institutions for large-scale cooking and other heating applications. Efforts to develop and modernize biomass heating have so far concentrated largely on improving the devices in which the biomass is burned or combusted \u2013 particularly household stoves, furnaces and kilns, and boilers \u2013 along with efforts to make biomass production more sustainable through forest management, integration of fuelwood production in farm systems and use of agricultural wastes. An alternative to burning the biomass, particularly cow dung, is to use it to generate biogas through anaerobic digestion. Biogas is a low heating-value gaseous fuel composed of methane and carbon dioxide that can substitute LPG and kerosene for cooking and other heating applications. Another alternative is to use a \u2018gasifier\u2019, in which biomass is only partially combusted, to generate producer gas. Producer gas (composed of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide) is another low heating-value gaseous fuel that can be used for high temperature heating applications. All types of biomass, including cut twigs and branches, can be used to generate producer gas.This means that users need to trim only parts of trees and thus can harvest biomass more sustainably.

The poor can make extensive use of modern biomass energy technologies, including improved combustion devices, biogas systems and gasifiers.Within the household, they can use them for cooking, space or water heating with less indoor air pollution. Modern biomass technologies can replace petroleum fuels or save use of biomass fuels in large-scale commercial cooking, or other heating applications in food service establishments.They can also be used for process heating in small, medium and micro- enterprises such as those found in South Asian countries (see Table 5-8). Millions of similar enterprises can be found in other parts of the Asian continent. If proper policy and programme support are in place, poor households can own and operate these types of small establishments and enterprises, which can help lift them out of poverty. While promoting the modern use of biomass as substitute for oil products, Asia-Pacific countries need to take into consideration several factors (IEA 2007c): \u2022 The need to produce biomass in a manner that is considered sustainable and renewable. \u2022 The energy needed to transport the many forms of low-bulk and energy density biomass. \u2022 The quality and moisture content of biomass to ensure efficient conversion. \u2022 The selection of appropriate conversion technologies and size of plant to match the supply. \u2022 The market for the bioenergy carriers \u2013 as heat, electricity, gaseous fuels, or solid fuels as pellets. Solar thermal systems As a result of high petroleum prices,solar thermal systems have now become cost competitive. These include solar driers used in post-harvest and other agro-processing applications as well as solar water heaters for household and commercial applications. Solar water heating is a long-established technology but has recently become much more popular.

China has long been the world leader in their production and use and by the end of 2003 accounted for 55 percent of global capacity, with 40 million solar water heaters (Palz 2006). Nepal also has embraced solar water heating. Since the 1970s more than 100 small workshops in Kathmandu have been manufacturing such heaters, and many new houses of higher-income households have solar collectors built into their design.This technology is, however, less common in other countries in the Himalayan region where it would be equally applicable, but where commercialization strategies focusing on urban households have not been as organized and effective as in Nepal. More efforts have to be made to integrate solar water heaters into overall poverty eradication strategies so that the poor can benefit from this technology. Solar water heaters are mainly designed for piped domestic water supplies. Most poor households, particularly those in rural areas,do not even have easy access to a domestic water supply, still less a running domestic water supply.

Ethanol (or bioethanol) comes mainly from corn or sugarcane, though it is also produced on a smaller scale from sugar beets and wheat. Biodiesel is presently derived from vegetable oils such as rapeseed, soy, palm, coconut and, soon, jatropha. Figure 5-16 shows the trends in the production of bioethanol, for which output in 2005 reached 33 billion litres. Figure 5-17 shows the trend for biodiesel, for which output is expanding even more rapidly,though from a smaller base;by 2005 it had reached almost 4 billion litres. Even so, the 33 billion litres of bioethanol produced in 2005 were equivalent to only 1.2 percent of the worldwide production of gasoline by volume \u2013 and an even smaller proportion, about 0.8 percent, in terms of transport distance travelled, because of its lower energy content. Why the rapid growth? The largest producers, Brazil and the US, launched their major national ethanol biofuel programmes more than three decades ago in the wake of the first world oil shock. But biofuel production has accelerated in recent years not just because of rising oil costs and efforts to achieve energy security, but also because of environmental concerns about increasing urban air pollution and, more recently, worries about the rise in greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.

For bioethanol the dominant producer has been Brazil, which makes the fuel from sugarcane, though the United States, which makes it mostly from corn, has now caught up. In Asia the principal producers are China and India, and they are also in the forefront of biofuels development. In India, a rejuvenated sugar ethanol programme calls for the availability of E5 gasoline (gasoline with 5 percent ethanol) in most of the country, and there are plans to raise this to E10 and then E20. In China, the government is making E10 blends mandatory in five provinces that account for 16 percent of the nation\u2019s passenger cars.In Japan,the government has permitted low-level ethanol blends in preparation for a possible blending mandate, with the intention,by 2030,of replacing 20 percent of the nation\u2019s oil demand with either biofuels or gas-to-liquid fuels made from natural gas. In South-East Asia, Thailand, eager to reduce the cost of oil imports while particularly supporting cassava growers, has mandated an ambitious 10 percent ethanol mix in gasoline starting in 2007. For similar reasons, to support coconut growers, the Philippines will mandate 2 percent biodiesel and 5 percent ethanol.

Consequently, there have been substantial social and political pressures to promote its use in India and other developing countries in the region as a means of poverty reduction, after fully assessing their socioeconomic viability and environmental impacts. The costs of production Biofuel production costs depend on a large number of factors, including the technology involved, economies of scale, the price of the feedstock materials and competition for land uses. As a result, they vary among producers (Table 5-10). For bioethanol in 2005, for example, the prices per litre of oil equivalent ranged from US$0.30 in Brazil to US$1.0 in Germany. For biodiesel the prices are generally higher, between US$0.60 and US$0.80 per litre of petroleum diesel equivalent.

Newer producers will thus find it more difficult to compete internationally, though will probably subsidize production for local consumption in order to reduce oil imports and establish domestic industries for the long term (ESMAP 2005). Competitiveness of biofuels One of the key issues is the extent to which biofuels will be able to compete in the future with petroleum-based products.Figure 5-18 compares the current prices of biodiesel with diesel, using the four oil-price scenarios presented earlier. These are the expected prices of diesel after refining, but without distribution costs or taxes. This shows that Brazil, at US$0.45 per litre of oil equivalent, would be capable of producing competitive biodiesel under all the scenarios, but that other countries whose prices at present are currently above US$0.70 per litre of oil equivalent would be competitive only under the supply shock and peak price scenarios.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f2ab5227-89e3-42d2-a82a-fea02c642810": {"__data__": {"id_": "f2ab5227-89e3-42d2-a82a-fea02c642810", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "663b28825aff0f519bacc558b251a5cfccde02cb9891ff8fc77c8978b1770c3b"}, "2": {"node_id": "3e9b1826-69ea-455f-aec5-d61f2c36ec72", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "df49d937aa7528cb540d32446a260c1c8db5e470238b748ea1dca2ae921d2e4c"}}, "hash": "e7156c400e283b478726be104a3aa5a5ef8776576a7488f49b200e74d0817f1e", "text": "There are some concerns that as the demand for biofuels rises, this will push up the prices of vegetable oils. From January 2006 through mid-2007 there were substantial increases in the prices for soya oil, sunflower oil and especially palm oil, for which the price increased from US$ 425 to US$775 per tonne (Figure 5-19).This could inhibit long-term investments in biodiesel production even as investment in the production of the feedstock crops increases. Nevertheless,it is likely that over time the costs of producing biodiesel fuels will decrease with increased yields per hectare, improved efficiency in harvesting and conversion, improvements in technology, and increased scale of production. This was the experience with sugar cane-based ethanol in Brazil and corn-based ethanol in the United States, and the same is expected to apply to biodiesel production as well. The prices that consumers pay can, of course, be very different. Governments often provide subsidies for the production of biofuels to make them more competitive.

Nevertheless, Brazil has shown that subsidies can pay off. Over the period 1976-2004, Brazil offered large subsidies and reaped the benefits,as ethanol production substituted for oil imports worth US$61 billion, or as much as US$121 billion if the estimate includes avoided interest payments on the debt that could have been incurred by importing oil (WWI 2006). Benefits and costs In addition to the economic and fiscal considerations, countries also need to consider the social costs and benefits of moving to large-scale production and use. The benefits include: \u2022 Lower imports \u2013 Successful large-scale domestic biofuels industries will offset petroleum imports and improve the balance of payments.

On the other hand, large-scale production of biofuels can have serious economic and social costs \u2022 Higher food prices \u2013 The modest current levels of production have been pushing up the prices for many food commodities, and this trend is expected to continue. In the US, for example, corn futures in March 2007 rose to their highest level in 10 years. Several Pacific Island Country governments have opted to have staple foods such as cassava, taro and yam taken out of the fuel markets so that rural people will not be confronted with strong food price increases if demand for these crops for biofuels increases (Cloin 2007). \u2022 Deforestation and other ecological impacts \u2013 Already there are signs of environmental damage as higher prices encourage the conversion of tropical forests to monocrops such as palm oil, with attendant loss of biodiversity and habitat, expanded use of water, nutrient runoff and loss of watersheds. This is already a serious problem in some Asian countries. Indonesia has recently become the world\u2019s third-largest greenhouse gas emitter as a result of its clearing of peat bogs for expansion of plantation agriculture and the use of peat for power generation. \u2022 Water shortages \u2013 Large-scale production of biofuels will require expanded use of fresh water. The poor are likely to be affected the most. \u2022 Bad working conditions \u2013 While many more workers may be employed cultivating feedstock crops on plantations, they can suffer from poor working conditions and low pay. If the developing countries of the Asia-Pacific region are to take advantage of the opportunities afforded by biofuel, they will therefore need to proceed carefully, examining not just the macroeconomic and fiscal issues, but also the costs and benefits for the environment and for poor communities. Reducing significantly GHG emissions from the transport sector by fully replacing the petroleum fuels with biofuels is likely to take several decades. In the meantime, sustainable use of biofuels should be assured, which will require: \u2022 A comprehensive life-cycle analysis,from crop production of feedstock to processing of biofuel products, to assess the relative energy and carbon emissions impacts, \u2022 Development of technical fuel standards in the use of biofuels and warranties for vehicles using biofuels, \u2022 A harmonized set of biofuel standards for fostering both trade and investment, and \u2022 A comprehensive and internationally accepted assessment methodology to evaluate social and environmental impacts of biofuel projects, including land use. Table 5-12 lists potential initiatives that could be pursued to address these concerns. (USAID 2007) Financing experiences in making renewable energy affordable Most renewable energy systems are capital intensive and require initial financing. In the private sector, financing generally falls into three categories: debt or equity financing for businesses, and financing for consumers to enable them to buy systems. In addition, there is the option of \u2018carbon finance\u2019 through the Clean Development Mechanism. UNDP\u2019s regional study on private investment on renewable energy,7 which builds on an analysis made by the Expert Group on Renewable Energy (UNDESA 2005), noted several possible interventions as entry points for financing mechanisms and promoting larger investments and affordability of renewable energy. 86 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific Debt finance High interest rates, short maturities and low debt-to-equity financing can make renewable sources more expensive than conventional power, at least in the short term. To overcome such obstacles, these new systems will require long-term \u2018patient\u2019financing,whose interest rates reflect additional benefits in the form of environmental protection and energy security. To address some of the barriers to financing renewable energy infrastructure projects, the World Bank, Kreditanstant F\u00fcr Wiederaufbau, DEG5 and other development finance institutions are putting in place a variety of instruments to improve access to long-term financing. These include currency swaps to reduce foreign exchange risk, two-step bridging mechanisms to allow project refinancing, lease-financing arrangements to reduce off-take risk and various other approaches. Some Asia-Pacific countries have also established specialized institutions to provide loans.

The US-based E+Co, for example, is an independent company that provides business development services and modest loans or equity investments, aiming to demonstrate to public- and private-sector investors the advantages of local clean-energy enterprises. One example is a project for biogas production using the biomass waste from one of Thailand\u2019s largest cassava processors. E+Co has invested US$197,500, with leveraged co-financing of US$ 3.4 million from equity investors and banks. The factory is now displacing 8 million litres of heavy fuel oil each year, while generating 30,000 MWh of electricity. Another example is the international non-profit organization Winrock International which, along with network members in Indonesia and the Philippines, has provided seed capital for pre-investment support and cost-share investments. Since 1998, Winrock\u2019s Nepal programme, for example, has been able to leverage more than US$5 million in equity investment in the small hydropower sector. New types of finance instruments are also now available, including \u2018quasi-equity,\u2019 which can combine some forms of preferred shares with subordinated debt and the option to be bought out later. End-user finance Households or communities that want to install renewable energy technologies can get finance from various sources, including retailers, commercial bank loans and microcredit. Or they can lease the equipment or pay fees for services. Retailers who want to build a large-scale credit-backed sales operation will usually look to a banking institution. Thus far, however, this is happening only on a small scale. Banks are certainly making loans in unprecedented numbers for household appliances, motorcycles, cars and homes across many countries in Asia and the Pacific, largely in urban areas and based on salaried incomes. Mainstream banks have not, however, been financing renewable energy systems. Across the region,microfinance organizations too have only just started lending for solar home systems or biogas. Prominent examples include Grameen Shakti (Box 5-1) and Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC) in Bangladesh and Sarvodaya Economic Enterprises Development Services in Sri Lanka, all of which benefit from lines of credit from the World Bank and the Global Environment Facility. In other countries without long traditions of micro finance, it has been more difficult to raise the funds.However,organizations such as the Triodos Bank of the Netherlands have been providing loans to microfinance institutions to on-lend to their customers for energy systems. For the poorest households, usually the most successful way of providing finance for energy is by combining this with income-generation activities. One example is Wahan Dharak, a rural cooperative society in Maharashtra, India, which for a daily fee provides micro-enterprises with solar lanterns. Carbon finance Another potential source of finance is the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) which emerged from the Kyoto Protocol.

Buyers typically purchase a minimum of 30,000 tonnes of CO2 per year, which would need a project with 120,000 solar home systems to make it worthwhile to develop into a CDM project. 88 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific Innovative financing can result in larger investments in renewable energy, including new debt and equity investments, end-user finance and carbon finance Switching to renewable energy to benefit the poor The ranges of renewable energy technologies that can compete with oil-based systems are now much wider, particularly if the targeted applications are in remote and rural areas. Because these are the areas where most of the poor reside, renewables have the potential to provide them with more cost-competitive energy services, including those needed for livelihood activities. Table 5-13 shows some of these. Village lighting, for example, which today might use a diesel generator, could instead, depending on local conditions, be powered by pico-hydro, wind generators or photovoltaic systems. Heating or drying energy needs may be supplied by biomass or solar heaters/dryers. Nevertheless,not all these services are likely to be introduced at once. As rural development proceeds, patterns of energy use will change, allowing more opportunities for the introduction of more types of renewable energy technologies. Table 5-14 illustrates this as a broadly three-stage scenario, with types of rural energy demand changing and increasing between the different stages and the types of renewable energy technologies getting more varied and sophisticated. The period from 2007 to 2020 will probably cover until the early phase of stage 3. Renewables \u2013 the benefits to the poor Those who stand to gain most from renewable energy technologies are those currently not served by the national electricity grid and who have difficulty accessing petroleum supply. In summary, the benefits include: Savings on household expenditure \u2013 Households without electricity will spend less on kerosene for lighting, on dry-cell batteries for sound equipment, and on car batteries for televisions. A range of studies have reported savings of 20 percent to 50 percent.

In Indonesia, for example, solar PV lighting systems are generally more expensive since households spend more on monthly payments for the system than they save from using less kerosene.But they are willing to pay for the vastly superior quality of lighting, coupled with the elimination of fire hazards and toxic fumes. Use of improved biomass stoves eliminates indoor air pollution, making the kitchen a cleaner place in which to work. (Modi 2005) Working at home \u2013 The other main advantage of extending the range of energy sources is that it can allow people to run micro-businesses from home, including handicrafts making, embroidery, food processing and woodworking (Matly 2003). However, complementary policies and programmes should also be in place to support ownership and develop the skills of the poor so they can manage these micro-enterprises. Also, while the poorest households might not be using electrical devices for home production, they may still be able to benefit from lighting. In Nepal, for example, women can undertake handicraft work at night (Mahat 2004 and the HELP Programme). Other income generation \u2013 But most income benefits from new energy sources tend to be outside the home, for agriculture and various small businesses. Farmers, for example, can use electricity to power irrigation systems that double or triple agricultural productivity and enable them to diversify into other crops. They can also use electrical equipment for cold storage, refrigeration, vacuum packing and sealing, and so reduce post-harvest losses. In Cambodia, some villages use battery-powered lanterns outdoors for frog hunting, a significant source of income (Cecelski 2002). Similarly, small businesses that can use machinery for sewing and tailoring or wood-working may be able to produce higher-quality goods. And better lighting allows them to work beyond daylight hours and employ more people.The new energy sources can also cut costs. In Nepal, for example, some agro-processing mills used to run on diesel and used NPR 1,700 (US$1.0 = NPR70.0) worth of it per month. After the introduction of micro-hydro power, their monthly power bills amounted to a few hundred rupees. The renewable energy industry \u2013 Although most of the income benefits come from expanding power options for many small businesses, the renewable energy industry itself also employs a significant number of people.China and India,for example, are building a strong manufacturing base for solar PV panels and wind turbines.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5160b2ec-87b3-41a0-813f-07c1634a04d1": {"__data__": {"id_": "5160b2ec-87b3-41a0-813f-07c1634a04d1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4ca1561a69dec5215e2317f6266d475ba8725fa60a2235c0c7543b746306be5c"}, "2": {"node_id": "07f6940e-399f-4352-b934-46b0aaf6dcda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "93b8a3ada25c90b90c824d15a1db61d8042f829735f4de058995e406526fa29c"}}, "hash": "982512ebbfaf0f1a70393d8b9d39bee068fbd1179ba1c9060695fa666472cf69", "text": "China is also a major manufacturer of small hydropower equipment and solar water heaters.

Although these enterprises can be quite capital-intensive, others provide more employment. Biogas systems and improved cookstoves, for example, mostly use local materials and employ local artisans and masons. The skills required for manufacturing, installing and repairing these systems can easily be mastered by poor people with little training and education. The Nepal Biogas Support Programme, for example, has resulted in the employment of 11,000 people. The Appropriate Rural Technology Institute in India also employs a large number of people. Micro-hydropower systems typically use imported generators and controllers but are then manufactured locally. Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka all have industries to manufacture electronic battery-charge controllers for solar home systems. Overall, the value-added in solar home systems can be quite high even in countries that do not make solar panels because of the work needed for installation. Still, to ensure that renewable energy manufacturing will benefit the poor, governments will need to introduce and monitor explicit policies on guaranteeing fair employment practices and just wages. Renewable energy and the MDGs Although the MDGs do not specifically mention energy, energy plays an essential role in their achievement.Table 5-15 discusses the direct and indirect role that energy can play in achieving each of the eight MDGs. Chapter 5: Options in renewable energy 91 Benefits of renewable energy include savings on household expenditure and on time and effort,as well as higher-quality services Energy plays an essential role in achieving all eight Millennium Development Goals 92 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific Table 5-15 Renewable energy and the Millennium Development Goals Source: UN-Energy 2005 MDGs Relevance of renewable energy 1. Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger Energy inputs, such as electricity and fuels, are essential to generate jobs, industrial activities, transportation, commerce, micro-enterprises and agriculture outputs. Most staple foods must be processed, conserved and cooked, requiring heat from various fuels. 2. Achieve universal primary education To attract teachers to rural areas, electricity is needed for homes and schools. After-dusk study requires illumination. Many children, especially girls, do not attend primary schools, because they have to carry wood and water to meet family subsistence needs. 3. Promote gender equality and empower women Lack of access to modern fuels and electricity contributes to gender inequality.Women are responsible for most household cooking and water-boiling activities.This takes time away from other productive activities as well as from educational and social participation. Access to modern fuels eases women\u2019s domestic burden and allows them to pursue educational, economic and other opportunities. 4. Reduce child mortality Diseases caused by unboiled water, and respiratory illness caused by the effects of indoor air pollution from traditional fuels and stoves,directly contribute to infant and child disease and mortality. 5. Improve maternal health Women are disproportionately affected by indoor air pollution and water- and food-borne illnesses. Lack of electricity in health clinics, little illumination for night time deliveries, and the daily drudgery and physical burden of fuel collection and transport all contribute to poor maternal health conditions, especially in rural areas. 6. Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases Electricity for communication such as radio and television can spread important public health information to combat deadly diseases. Healthcare facilities, doctors and nurses all require electricity and the services that it provides (illumination, refrigeration, sterilization, etc) to deliver effective health services. 7. Ensure environmental sustainability Conventional modes of energy production, distribution and consumption have many adverse effects on the local, regional and global environment, including indoor, local and regional air pollution, local particulates, land degradation, acidification of land and water, and climate change.Cleaner energy systems are needed to address all of these effects and to contribute to environmental sustainability. 8. Develop a global partnership for development The World Summit for Sustainable Development called for partnerships between public entities, development agencies, civil society and the private sector to support sustainable development, including the delivery of affordable, reliable and environmentally sustainable energy services. A policy framework for renewable energy favourable to the poor8 Conventional energy systems tend to have low capital costs, but significant operating costs. For renewable systems the picture is reversed: Capital costs are high, but over time these are offset by low operating costs. Added to this are the environmental benefits, the prospect of increased employment, reduced import dependence and reduced burden on foreign exchange. However, the marketplace does not account for any of this value creation. Nor does it regard the rural poor as good credit risks, seeing off-grid systems as high-risk, low-return propositions.

But it now seems unlikely that this on its own will do much to deliver energy services to the rural poor. Instead of withdrawing to let private markets develop on their own, a better approach would be to work alongside local communities and the private sector to remove barriers and reduce risks. Among the policies that have proven their ability to advance renewables are: \u2022 Create supportive policy and institutional frameworks \u2013 In most countries, energy is principally a private business, but providing energy access for rural areas has traditionally been considered a government responsibility. Indeed, governments already subsidize the extension of electricity grids and provide the poor with subsidized petroleum fuels. They could similarly give support for renewable energy technologies, while linking these with wider rural development and poverty eradication initiatives. Governments could also support reliable assessments of renewable resources so as to encourage investment. \u2022 Promote private sector involvement \u2013 Supplying rural energy services often means dealing with a large number of small transactions dispersed over a wide area. This problem can be addressed with innovative financing mechanisms. These include microcredit, whether from the energy company or its dealers, or from micro-finance institutions or community-based organizations. These can be linked with specially designed credit lines through larger financial institutions, potentially backed by the government. The new financing mechanisms also include micro-rental or fee-for-service approaches, where all or part of the equipment remains the property of the company, and customers make regular payments for its use. One example is a utility-style concession in which a concessionaire owns the system, charges a monthly fee and is responsible for the service. \u2022 Level the playing field \u2013 Higher oil prices are creating major problems for countries that subsidize those fuels, threatening economic growth if the subsidies are kept in place and encouraging consumer outrage if they are not.Conventional energy sources also impose external costs on the environment and human health.These can be internalized with levies and taxes, as some countries in Europe are doing through carbon taxes to internalize the cost of greenhouse gas emissions. Just as many of the costs of conventional energy are not internalized, markets and policies often fail to internalize the myriad positive externalities \u2013 improvements in health care, education,communications and employment \u2013 that can result from bringing electricity to underserved areas. Community leaders, local residents and project developers should seek to explicitly identify such benefits. Identifying the costs and benefits would also benefit from reliable methodologies for quantifying externalities. \u2022 Nurture micro-enterprise \u2013 Renewable energy technologies can spur the creation of micro-enterprises by engaging local people, particularly the poor, in harnessing energy and in providing energy services. Renewable energy fights poverty most effectively when linked with income generation in both producing and using the energy, though the energy also has to meet essential human needs for cooking, lighting, heating and water supply. \u2022 Integrate projects around local needs and capacity \u2013 Renewable energy services must be coupled with existing development activities for water, health, education and entrepreneurship, which it can also make more effective. In particular, they should address the requirements of women, by offering security and income,reducing labour and improving health by reducing indoor air pollution. Chapter 5: Options in renewable energy 93 Capital costs of renewable systems are high,but are offset by low operating costs,environmental benefits and increased employment Countries must create supportive policy and institutional frameworks for renewables and promote private sector involvement Biofuel development to benefit the poor Biofuels are very promising if delivered in the right manner; but with the ever-increasing demand for transport fuels, there are genuine concerns that biofuels may create greater competition for limited land and biodiversity, water and food. From the point of view of benefits for the poor, biofuels present a number of challenges and opportunities which have to be examined carefully and balanced. The rapid growth in the demand and production of liquid biofuels and its impacts, particularly on food security, rural development, land use and the environment, can be both positive and negative. Development or expansion of existing liquid biofuels policies and programmes, particularly in making biofuels development work more effectively for poverty eradication, should be evaluated and assessed with considerations of these aspects: \u2022 Attention on biofuels should not be limited to sugar and starch crops for the production of ethanol and vegetable-oil plants for the production of biodiesel. A comprehensive sustainable bioenergy programme should cover all sources: \u00b0 Sustainable production of trees and other woody biomass from forests and non- forest areas for solid biofuel production. \u00b0", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3996f4f-37b1-4d20-ba92-eb35aff251e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3996f4f-37b1-4d20-ba92-eb35aff251e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "010872af53be842e63c82ce858bdf46434e07b47682fcb9d5f174f20b485c173"}}, "hash": "010872af53be842e63c82ce858bdf46434e07b47682fcb9d5f174f20b485c173", "text": "Agricultural residues for heat and power generation through direct combustion, co-generation, biogas generation and gasification. \u00b0 Cellulosic sources available for second- generation biofuel technologies from the agriculture and forestry sectors. \u2022 All end uses of these bioenergy sources should be considered, such as heat and electricity, including non-transport uses of liquid biofuels \u2013 liquid biofuels are too focused on private urban transport use. \u2022 Establishment of clear linkages between bioenergy development and food prices,food security, rural economics, trade, employment, biodiversity and climate change.

The exercise in expanding and strengthening biofuels programmes so that the poor get a greater share of the benefits should start with an evaluation and assessment of current experiences and policies.This can include models and practical tools currently used in national, regional and international organizations in areas such as land use planning, biofuels potential evaluation and impacts on food security and commodity prices. In most developing countries there is a need to strengthen the decision-making capacities so as to tap the above-mentioned opportunities whilst avoiding potentially important negative impacts in various fields linked to rural livelihoods, equitable economic development and the environment. The benefits of renewable energy services for the poor In summary,renewable energy technologies offer great potential for providing energy services to the rural poor, especially those not connected to electricity grids. At specific locations and oil price levels, they are likely to be cheaper and cleaner than fossil fuel alternatives or both off-grid and mini-grid systems, making it possible for poor communities not just to improve their living conditions, but also their income-earning opportunities. However, the upfront costs can be high, requiring innovative financing methods and government support. Biomass energy, particularly biofuels, can substitute for oil imports and will steadily become more competitive. Governments need to be aware of the social, economic and environmental impacts of biofuel production and hence put policy measures in place. The recent rapid increase in biofuel production has triggered concerns about its negative impacts on food supply and prices. Using food crops, such as corn, to produce ethanol will push up the prices of corn and corn-derived food items. This has already happened. There is also concern about using up land for biofuel feedstock production. Indeed, there is increasing concern that current biofuel development trends, instead of helping achieve poverty eradication in rural areas, could instead exacerbate food insecurity.There are also environmental concerns about the impacts of monoculture biofuel feedstock plantations and the conversion of forests to such plantations. 94 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific Food security,rural development and land use concerns of biofuel development must be addressed Even if the above concerns are addressed, programmes for biofuel production will also need to deal with age-old rural and agricultural development issues such as land tenure, land reform and and other means of facilitating the direct participation of the rural poor in biofuel production. These issues need to be properly dealt with, assuring fair and equitable sharing of profit and income with the poor, who will be involved either as direct owner-growers in small farms, as farm workers or tenants in large plantations, or as labourers in biofuel processing plants. Designing an appropriate mix of policy and programmes is emerging as a challenge that national governments cannot afford to ignore.

In summary, these were: 1. Managing oil price risk \u2013 Covering such issues as pricing policies, targeted subsidies and financial tools. 2. Enhancing oil supply \u2013 Including strengthening oil exploration and extraction, building refining capacity, diversifying sources of supply and engaging in barter. 3. Restraining oil demand \u2013 Increasing efficiency in transport, industry and agriculture. 4. Preparing for emergencies \u2013 Building strategic reserves and planning for rationing. 5. Diversifying fuels \u2013 In some cases this may mean using more coal,but for many countries the opportunities will lie in renewable resources. This chapter suggests a ranking of these strategies and their sub-strategies according to their potential to meet various objectives: increasing country-level and household energy security, increasing income generation, alleviating human poverty and minimizing environmental impacts. The strategies were also assessed in terms of their cost and the time required for implementation. A process for prioritizing sub-strategies under different oil price scenarios for case study countries is illustrated in Figure 6-1. Those with the highest potential to meet the various objectives listed above have the highest ranking (refer to Appendix F for methodology). Where sub- strategies have equal importance, they are given equal ranks, so although there are 18 sub- strategies in Table 6-1, there are only seven ranks. Which of these strategies should take priority will depend very much on national circumstances, which are discussed in subsequent sections of this chapter. For ease of interpretation, the strategies are grouped into three priority classes: high, medium and low (Table 6-2). Sub-strategies with ranks 1 to 3 are grouped as high priority, sub-strategies with rank 4 as medium priority, and those with ranks 5 to 7 as low priority. Clearly, the most appropriate policy mix will change depending on what happens to oil prices. To arrive at a more precise sequence, it is useful to consider different possible scenarios. As introduced in Chapter 5,the four proposed in this report are: baseline, supply shock, peak oil price and energy security. Baseline (BL) This is derived from the oil market scenario presented by the IMF (IMF 2005) which is consistent with those of the IEA,OECD and OPEC. It assumes that future oil market developments are likely to be in two phases. First, until 2010, high oil prices will keep the oil market broadly in balance, with incremental oil demand being met mostly by high non-OPEC production.From 2010, as non-OPEC production peaks,there are likely to be calls on OPEC to increase output. Subject to short-term reversible spikes, oil prices will range between US$65 and US$75 per barrel.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "828cf259-258c-4e03-adde-581ca58e2cda": {"__data__": {"id_": "828cf259-258c-4e03-adde-581ca58e2cda", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "af7c5be71924ddd707aa314283d400957c6bcba0aee81d16099ca920c00861c1"}, "2": {"node_id": "9b0bab57-3eb9-42dc-b56b-fdaee3d69e7f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "28aedb3c86825273b89b8c6e79703b191acc98314fff21aed2061600785ce8bc"}}, "hash": "2dd556536bd4d90fca039d4875aee0dd8186d1718d3c677e8bc94df61747a809", "text": "The oil intensity of economies will remain constant, or decline at current rates as a result of substitution mainly by natural gas and coal, which will be offset by continued growth in aggregate demand.

Or the shock could come from a natural disaster, such as a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico. Whatever the cause, there could be damage to the infrastructure for oil production, refining and transportation that will cause large and unexpected short-term supply shortfalls. The challenges will be to deal with short-term supply shortfalls, which may be large and unexpected. As a result, oil prices per barrel will spike steeply to US$100, plateau at around US$120,and in later years decline to the initial level of US$70. Over the medium term till 2011, as a result of the supply shortfall, countries will reduce their oil intensities. As supplies resume normal levels, they will probably increase intensities again, but not to the same levels as before, due to the greater substitution of oil by natural gas, coal, nuclear power and renewable energy.

There will be a temporary supply plateau until 2011,resulting from a more efficient supply infrastructure, but subsequently \u2013 supply will decline irreversibly by 2.5 percent annually. Oil prices will surge toward the mid-point of the peak and thereafter rise faster than the decline in supply due to a potential rise in geopolitical conflicts and speculation. Since this outcome is predictable, countries will be able to make some structural adjustments, encouraging oil substitution, technological improvements and greater energy efficiency. In this scenario, oil prices will increase gradually from their current level of around US$70 to US$100 per barrel in 2011,the mid-point of the peak. Thereafter,prices per barrel will rise more steeply, to US$130 in 2015 and US$190 in 2020. Until 2011, the oil intensity of economies will remain constant or decline at current rates of substitution, with natural gas and coal, but then decline at a faster rate as the impact of new fuels and technologies and structural changes begin to assert themselves. Energy Security (ES) Concerns for both energy and environmental security lead to reduced oil demand, so prices fall back to a lower equilibrium at around US$50 per barrel. The imperative for energy security will have been prompted by recent steep price rises. Those for environmental security will have been prompted by measures to reduce, among other things, greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, for fuel and for power generation, oil will be substituted over time by other conventional fuels, natural gas and clean coal, as well as by nuclear power and renewable energy.

The long-term strategy is, however, to move to an energy secure scenario. In order to bring prices to a lower level, many conscious policies need to be pursued. While some such policies might be inherent to the first three scenarios, these by themselves will not be sufficient to engineer a lower oil intensity. In the early years under the energy security scenario, it is possible that prices get reduced due to a drop in absolute demand, meaning curtailment of consumption. But in later years, lower prices can be sustained without compromising demand 100 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2015 2020 Baseline 28 54 70 70 70 70 70 Supply Shock 28 54 100 110 120 90 70 Peak Oil Price 28 54 70 84 100 130 190 Energy Security 28 54 70 65 60 50 50 Table 6-3 Oil price levels in different scenarios, US$ per barrel Figure 6-2 Oil price levels in different scenarios Table 6-4 Projections of prices of selected petroleum products in various scenarios, US$ per barrel Note: Prices are for the average nominal price of Brent, West Texas Intermediate and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries Basket Note: Figure based on REP-PoR oil scenario study 200 US$/barrel 160 120 80 40 0 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2015 2020 POP SS BL ES Year Baseline Supply Shock Peak Oil Price Energy Security Gasoline 2007 71 99 71 71 2009 71 108 84 67 2011 71 118 99 62 Naphtha 2007 64 90 64 64 2009 64 98 76 60 2011 64 108 90 55 Kerosene 2007 77 108 77 77 2009 77 118 91 72 2011 77 129 108 67 HSD 2007 73 102 73 73 2009 73 111 86 68 2011 73 122 102 63 LPG/propane 2007 159 214 159 159 2009 159 231 184 150 2011 159 250 214 141 Governments will need to respond differently to baseline,supply shock and peak oil price scenarios growth only through conscious policies on efficiency and fuel substitution. Table 6-5 presents the ranking based on the significance of the strategies for each scenario from 1, the least important, to 5, the most important. Not surprisingly, when it comes to the supply shock, emergency preparedness jumps into first place. Along similar lines, the strategies are also ranked in terms of their relevance to the case study countries with 1 having the least relevance and 5 the most relevance (Table 6-6). While these listings give an overall sense of priorities, these and the priorities for their component sub-strategies will depend very much on national circumstances and opportunities. Integrating the merit-based ranking of sub-strategies (Table 6-1),the priorities of these sub-strategies with respect to scenarios (Table 6-5) and their relevance to case study countries (Table 6-6) leads to the prioritized country-specific recommendations.The following sections therefore consider the policy recommendations for each of the four countries studied in depth: China, India, Indonesia and Lao PDR.

Because of its sheer economic power, China ranks as one of the least vulnerable countries on the OPVI. The other low-OPVI countries, Iran and Malaysia, cannot necessarily follow the same strategies, though they can gain some indications. Baseline China already has strong petroleum pricing and distribution measures that are backed by subsidies targeted to fishermen, farmers and state-owned forestry enterprises and that extend to oil refining companies. It has also imposed a special oil income levy on companies producing crude oil locally on prices over US$40 per barrel, and then used the revenue to subsidize vulnerable groups and other public welfare purposes. In the short run, China will benefit from strengthening these measures. It could then take steps to reduce demand through oil efficiency measures, particularly in the transport sector,as well as diversify to other fuels. To shield consumers during periods of oil price rise, in addition to targeted subsidies, it can also explore measures such as smart cards and cash transfers. Also, it can continue with plans for a strategic reserve. Over the medium-term, the focus would have to be on enhancing oil supply. Supply Shock In this case, the task will be to prepare for the emergency. The priorities will be to build on strategic reserves while establishing quotas for oil-consuming sectors. This scenario would also require a system of rationing, as well as cash grants to vulnerable groups. This could involve compensation for LPG usage, and the introduction of smart cards and vouchers for petroleum product consumption. This scenario would also require a continued emphasis on pricing and distribution policies, along with measures to improve efficiency in the transport sector, including the introduction of biofuels, while bearing in mind the implications for land use and the potential socioeconomic impacts. China could also expand its use of barter by exchanging its own commodities or export items directly for oil. In this direction, China has already established the Yangpu Oil Barter Exchange, reportedly the world\u2019s first for oil and gas. 102 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific Baseline Supply Shock Peak Oil Price Pricing of petroleum products Managing/targeting oil subsidies Oil efficiency in transport Improve public transport Strategic reserves Strengthening oil exploration Pricing of petroleum products Managing/targeting oil subsidies Oil efficiency in transport Improve public transport Strategic reserves Better land-use planning to reduce transport demand Strategic reserves Pricing of petroleum products Rationing Managing/targeting oil subsidies Oil efficiency in transport Improve public transport Refining capacity to process sour crudes Better land-use planning to reduce transport demand Rationing Financial tools Improve oil efficiency in industry Diversifying sources of oil Financial tools Strengthening oil exploration Refining capacity to process sour crudes Rationing Improve oil efficiency in industry Strengthening oil exploration Refining capacity to process sour crudes Better land-use planning to reduce transport demand Financial tools Improve oil efficiency in industry Oil substitution in transport Improve oil efficiency in agriculture Oil substitution in transport Barter Biofuels in transport Oil substitution in agriculture Oil substitution in industry Biofuels in transport Oil substitution in agriculture Diversifying sources of oil Improve oil efficiency in agriculture Oil substitution in industry Barter Diversifying sources of oil Biofuels in transport Oil substitution in agriculture Improve oil efficiency in agriculture Oil substitution in industry Barter Table 6-7 China \u2013 sequence of priority strategies in different oil price scenarios High Medium Low In the short run,China can further strengthen its petroleum", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "81ccea44-5330-4f7c-9678-57f79e899bfe": {"__data__": {"id_": "81ccea44-5330-4f7c-9678-57f79e899bfe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "403ec73685f37fb07ad7825b6e3f4fd58492a060beee29d2f0e424dbba1f3cc3"}}, "hash": "403ec73685f37fb07ad7825b6e3f4fd58492a060beee29d2f0e424dbba1f3cc3", "text": "pricing and distribution measures and subsidies Peak Oil Price This scenario allows time for structural adjustments, fuel substitution, technological improvement and greater energy efficiency. China has already been moving along this path, and is exploring technology options to enable fuel switching, such as coal for oil in fertilizer manufacturing. In the transport sector, the government is already considering ways to promote fuel efficiency and the use of alternative fuels, as with hydrogen for mass transit. Another existing programme valuable in this scenario would be ethanol blending with appropriate tax incentives. As a beginning, the government is making 10 percent ethanol blending mandatory in five provinces that account for 16 percent of the nation\u2019s passenger cars. China would also benefit from continued investments in foreign oil fields. Along with the several initiatives underway in China, the government could also take a number of supporting measures.These include: \u2022 Tariffs and rebates \u2013 Reduce import tariffs and export rebates to ensure a steady domestic supply of petroleum products and steady government earnings against sudden volatility in oil prices. \u2022 Diversify sources of supply \u2013 Improve the climate for investment in the oil and gas sectors, while acquiring exploration and development rights in oil fields abroad. \u2022 Fuel efficiency \u2013 Promote efficiency in the transport sector to curb increasing demand. \u2022 Alternative energy development \u2013 Develop liquefied coal and nuclear energy programmes while removing barriers to the development of geothermal sources. India The recent oil price rises did not have a large macroeconomic impact in India, mainly because of the country\u2019s strong economic performance, large foreign exchange reserves and extensive use of coal. There were, however, micro-level impacts on the poor that can provide pointers to the necessary corrective measures. Table 6-8 shows those that would be appropriate to the various oil price scenarios. India belongs to the medium-OPVI group, so these measures could also provide guidelines appropriate for other countries in that group.

For managing oil price risk, India would need to rationalize pricing strategies and use targeted subsidies, perhaps supplementing these with hedging instruments and establishing an oil price stabilization fund. For dealing with sudden oil price spikes, it could stockpile oil reserves. The next priority for India would be to restrain demand by improving the public transport system and using oil more efficiently. The transport sector accounts for 100 percent of gasoline consumption and about 65 percent of diesel consumption, and such initiatives could result in significant positive outcomes. Supply Shock Even in this scenario,the priority strategies would be to rationalize pricing, transmitting high prices and targeted subsidies from the international to the domestic market as a way of curbing demand. During international oil price negotiations, the government,as it has suggested, could attempt to manage crude oil prices by allowing prices to float within an agreed price band. Overall, the ranking of strategies is similar to that for the baseline. The only exception is a higher priority for fuel diversification, which is already happening to some extent, since urban pollution is forcing a shift to compressed", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e4fea27e-5ae5-4519-87df-f115e5b7dd30": {"__data__": {"id_": "e4fea27e-5ae5-4519-87df-f115e5b7dd30", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a4ce8122ca44ec49f17c32f2ac482d0735907475b2ba3f21b277250b3280b785"}}, "hash": "a4ce8122ca44ec49f17c32f2ac482d0735907475b2ba3f21b277250b3280b785", "text": "natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas for public vehicles. The government could also strengthen its ethanol-blended gasoline programme. The 5 percent ethanol blending is an ongoing programme; however, there are plans, depending on ethanol availability, to raise this requirement to 10 percent, and then 20 percent blending. Other measures would include stockpiling reserves and rationing. Peak Oil Price As for the supply shock scenario, in the peak oil price scenario, the priorities will be to reduce oil demand, while also aiming to reduce the fiscal and financial burden imposed by high oil prices. Along with oil price risk management strategies, it will also be vital to prepare for emergencies. Curtailing the demand and managing the price levels would have to be supported by building up strategic reserves and using rationing to stimulate greater efficiency in distribution. Since the peak oil price scenario implies long-term and irreversible changes, the aim should be to reduce demand by improving efficiency in the use of oil and substituting it with other fuels, including biofuels, particularly in public transport by using hybrid-fuel vehicles. In general, the Government of India could take the following measures to meet the growing energy demand: \u2022 Pricing \u2013 Move to a system of market- determined pricing of petroleum products. \u2022 Import pricing \u2013 The Import Parity Pricing formula must be revisited to ensure that the Indian refining industry enjoys a margin that is rational and fair to producers and consumers. \u2022 Excise duties \u2013 Duties should be based on a sliding scale that would fulfil the following objectives: ensure revenue earnings for the government in a period of rapid changes in international prices; safeguard consumers from the multiplying effect of an ad valorem duty; make the government responses to international oil prices more transparent. \u2022 Liquid petroleum gas \u2013 Since international prices of LPG are cheaper than those of kerosene, the production of kerosene could be phased out. For this purpose the government can emphasize the health benefits of LPG in the form of reduced indoor pollution, while directly subsidizing LPG for certain classes of consumers. It could, for example, introduce LPG debit cards jointly with financial institutions and oil companies. \u2022 Solar lighting \u2013 Since most kerosene in India is used for low-quality lighting, the government could provide highly subsidized solar lanterns to all unelectrified households \u2013 and at a fraction of the cost of the kerosene subsidy. \u2022 Energy efficiency \u2013 India\u2019s government can promote energy efficiency measures across all sectors.This could include fiscal incentives for fuel-efficient vehicles, the use of biofuels for public transport and greater use of rail for freight movement. Indonesia Indonesia has traditionally been an oil-rich country and has only recently become a net oil importer. It exhibits all the features of a developing economy, including high dependence on traditional fuels. The overall aim should be to reduce oil dependence while promoting cleaner oil-based fuels such as LPG. Table 6-9 outlines priority measures for different oil price scenarios. 104 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific Indonesia can reduce oil dependence while promoting cleaner oil-based fuels such as LPG Baseline In this scenario, the focus should be on reducing oil demand for transport. This should include disincentives for the use of personal transport,for example, through progressive taxation for family cars,with higher rates for second and third vehicles. The government should continue with its efforts to encourage carpooling and car sharing and improve the quality and quantity of public transport. Fiscal measures could include removing gasoline and diesel subsidies, except for public transport, while imposing taxes on fuels for personal transport and using that revenue to invest in public transport.At the same time, Indonesia could make better use of its oil reserves by improving the climate for investment in the oil and gas sectors and offering incentives for the development and implementation of improved oil recovery technologies and for extraction from marginal fields. Supply Shock This would require emergency preparedness, building strategic reserves and reducing oil demand through rationing and for other regulations. This will have to be accompanied by the selective use of financial instruments to tide the country over during short-term oil price volatility. Given that the urban poor have few alternatives to oil products such as kerosene and LPG, the government would also need to intro- duce a system of rationing to secure supplies, particularly for cooking. At the same time, Indonesia could also make better use of coal, improving the infrastructure and investing in research and development in clean coal technology. Small industries and parts of the service sector could replace diesel and kerosene", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e69fedd2-32ff-4858-b73b-72f08f6a607b": {"__data__": {"id_": "e69fedd2-32ff-4858-b73b-72f08f6a607b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0ec45733c87e92d5597e782a8334ccc9fa3c444345d2a488ad45c8d29cc22f06"}}, "hash": "0ec45733c87e92d5597e782a8334ccc9fa3c444345d2a488ad45c8d29cc22f06", "text": "with coal briquettes. Peak Oil Price This scenario should prompt faster exploration of alternatives to oil. Public transport, for example, could make greater use of electricity and, in particular, natural gas, which would entail constructing pipelines to transmit gas from the fields to the cities. This would also improve access to natural gas for households. These measures would have to go hand-in-hand with those for oil conservation, as outlined for the baseline scenario. Faced with dwindling oil resources, the country could also invest more in the development of biofuels. Existing diesel-based decentralized electricity generation in remote locations in particular would benefit from a switch to biofuels.The peak oil price would also allow time for the development of the country\u2019s geothermal potential.

Irrespective of trends in oil prices, Indonesia would benefit from addressing: \u2022 Subsidies \u2013 Design and implement targeted subsidy schemes for LPG or piped gas, particularly for poor urban households. \u2022 Transport \u2013 Improve oil efficiency through the design and promotion of public transport systems based on gas or electricity. \u2022 Coal \u2013 Invest in improvements in the utilization of coal. \u2022 Renewables \u2013 Promote renewable sources of energy such as geothermal,solar,micro-hydro and wind. Lao PDR As a low-income country with a relatively low penetration of modern energy, Lao PDR is in a unique position to frame its energy policy to maximize its people\u2019s long-term welfare. In general,Lao PDR prices its petroleum products so as to closely track international oil price trends, but also uses temporary tax and duty exemptions to cushion the populace from the impact of rising oil prices. The country may also consider adopting targeted subsidies for vulnerable sections, for the poor in remote rural areas and for mass transportation companies. The recommended priority policy options across the oil price scenarios are indicated in Table 6-10.Lao PDR is a high-OPVI country, so its strategies need to have long-term perspectives. The strategies under all the scenarios thus focus on restraining oil demand. Baseline The challenges are likely to come from sudden oil price spikes. This calls for emergency preparedness, for which the only available strategy is rationing. Lacking its own refining capacity, Lao PDR cannot consider stockpiling oil reserves to tide the country over during spike periods. The long-term aim should be to reduce oil demand by improving efficiency in public sector transport and other transport.Lao PDR will also need to speed up its development of indigenous sources of energy, particularly hydropower, and other renewable sources of energy. Supply Shock Since Lao PDR uses petroleum products primarily for transportation, in this scenario it will need to enforce measures for fuel efficiency and conservation. This could include restrictions on use of motorized transport while enhancing the provision of public transport.These options could be supported with fiscal and regulatory measures such as high road taxes and parking charges for privately owned vehicles.

For a least developed country it is difficult and expensive to implement technological improvements. However, since Lao PDR imports automobile parts for domestic assembly, or automobiles in their entirety, it can restrain the rate of growth in oil demand by setting stringent fuel efficiency criteria on imports. Peak Oil Price As with the other scenarios, the list of priorities is topped by measures to restrain demand,improve efficiency and promote public transport. This would need to be accompanied by appropriate pricing strategies and rationing measures to streamline the demand for petroleum products. For fuel diversification, Lao PDR has already initiated a programme on biofuels, which could become one of the prioritized strategies. For power generation it can also use wood chips and rice husks as localized energy sources as well as coal. Hydropower is particularly important, since this can not only help fulfil the country\u2019s requirements for power generation, but also, through exports to neighbouring countries, produce revenue that can be earmarked to finance oil imports. To achieve this, however, Lao PDR would need to collaborate closely with the more advanced nations as well as multilateral aid and funding agencies, which should be able to offer support to vulnerable communities in remote areas. To prevent poor households from switching back to solid fuels, the government could consider providing targeted subsidies for modern fuels as well as cash compensation schemes for the very poor. Poor households that still have to switch back could, however, be supplied with improved cooking stoves and smoke hoods. Other policy options could include the issuing of smart cards and vouchers for petroleum product consumption,as well as engaging in barter for oil 106 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific Energy strategies for Lao PDR require long-term perspectives,emphasizing biofuels,alternative energy for transport,and biomass in exchange for indigenous resources, such as minerals, and forest-based products like medicinal herbs. Barter trade can be a viable option for Lao PDR, since the country is extremely rich in mineral endowments, such as bauxite, copper and gold. It would also be desirable to develop coal deposits for industrial purposes. In general,Lao PDR will benefit from an emphasis on: \u2022 Biofuels \u2013 Develop liquid biofuels to substitute oil in the transport sector, bearing in mind possible adverse affects. \u2022 Transport \u2013 Adopt alternative electricity- and biofuel-based systems, particularly for public transport. \u2022 Power \u2013 Generate power from alternative sources, including hydro and biofuels. \u2022 Biomass \u2013 Explore biomass gasification options for use in industrial applications. Recommendations for other countries, based on their OPVI scores The recommendations made for the four focus countries could also be extended to other countries in the region, with similar OPVI scores. Each country\u2019s policies, however, will need to be matched to its own energy and economic situations.Therefore, the proposals suggested for the four countries should only be considered broad

Vanuatu All countries will benefit from measures to cut oil demand and should review oil price policies to prevent subsidy leaks to the non-poor medium or high categories (Table 6-11). Countries in the low-OPVI category could thus consider the strategies suggested for China, those in the medium category that of India and Indonesia, and those in the high category that of Lao PDR. Much will depend, however, on the source of vulnerability; those for which it derives from overdependence on oil rather than from economic fragility will need to concentrate more on fuel diversification. All countries would, however, benefit from measures to cut oil demand and should review their oil price policies to prevent subsidies from leaking to the non-poor. In addition, in the supply shock and peak oil price scenarios, they would of course need to prepare for emergencies. China is a special country, and no country, even if it is categorized as a low-OPVI country,can simply pursue the same strategies as China. The prioritized sub-strategies for China can at best serve as guidelines for other countries in the group, such as Iran and Malaysia. However, sub-strategies under fuel diversification and restraining demand are universally applicable. This may not be the case with countries like India and Indonesia, which are classified as medium OPVI, nor Lao PDR, which is classified as high OPVI. In terms of the need for variety of solutions, countries like India and Indonesia are comparable to Thailand and Viet Nam.Both these countries can follow India and Indonesia in prioritizing their strategies. The ranking of sub-strategies for Lao PDR could form the basis for many other countries in the high-OPVI group. Countries like Bangladesh, Nepal and Cambodia can adopt the prioritization suggested for Lao PDR without much modification. Each is endowed with one or the other energy resources; for example, Nepal with hydro, Bangladesh with natural gas and Cambodia with crude oil and natural gas resources. All these countries should, like Lao PDR, give a high priority to sub-strategies like improving public transport, increasing energy efficiency and pricing petroleum products more effectively. All these countries should have effective mechanisms for implementing targeted subsidies and rationing in order to shield the poor from the impact of steep price rises. Safeguarding the interests of the poor As highlighted in earlier chapters, rising oil prices have had a serious impact on the poor, causing some rural households to revert either completely or partially to biomass fuels, and in the case of China,from LPG to coal.The urban poor,however, do not generally have the option to switch to biomass so are likely to face increasing energy poverty. In addition, higher transport costs may reduce access to essential services such as health and education, and in some cases farmers will face higher prices for fertilizers. Some of the overall strategies to safeguard the poor are summarized by sector in Table 6-12. The ways in which these and other strategies fit together for 108 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific Table 6-12 Sectoral strategies to safeguard the poor from higher oil prices Sectors Strategies Transport \u2022 Subsidize and enhance the services of public transport forms. \u2022 Better facility planning in urban areas to reduce transport demand.

Households \u2022 Target LPG subsidies at low-income consumers. \u2022 Reduce/remove subsidies on kerosene, subject to availability of alternative fuels. \u2022 Provide cash transfers for specific purposes, like primary education (e.g., Indonesia) to cushion the impact of rising oil prices. \u2022 Promote the use of renewable energy-based lanterns and cooking devices, improved biomass cookstoves and community-based biomass gasifiers for electricity generation.

One is to increase their access to wood resources through sustainable management, and the second is to improve their fuelwood stoves as well as solar or biogas- powered cookers. The third would be to enable them in the short term to make more use of other petroleum products, especially LPG and in some cases piped natural gas, which would be of particular benefit to women who are burning biomass fuels in traditional stoves in poorly ventilated kitchens. Subsidies Subsidies can be offered through a number of mechanisms. These include cash transfers to eligible beneficiaries through coupons or bank transfers or through smart debit cards. Each of these options has its strengths and weaknesses. A coupon system requires the entitlements to be well defined and needs a sound administrative system not vulnerable to fraud.Bank transfers are neat in theory but logistically complex when there are large numbers of accounts to be serviced, and can also be expensive for the beneficiary in transaction costs. Smart cards are an attractive option in some cases, since as well as aiding disbursement, they can also maintain a data bank on the beneficiaries, their consumption patterns and Chapter 6: Policies for an era of uncertain oil prices 109 Figure 6-3 Connecting oil price policy measures with the Millennium Development Goals The aim of subsidy programmes should be to provide poor households with clean energy options Oil price rise Education MDG Health MDG Gender MDG MDG 8: Partnerships Oil price management (including pricing of oil and other energy forms) Calls for Calls for Calls for Growing energy demand Environmental MDG Macro Energy Security Micro Energy Security Reducing oil demand Augmenting oil supply Emergency preparedness Fuel diversification Along with Poverty MDG transaction histories. But they are only practical for countries that have the technological capacity. Those such as India that already have some e-governance structures and institutions may be in a position to consider smart cards, but other countries may have to rely on cash transfers. The aim of subsidy programmes should be to provide poor households with clean energy options.This means that they should be used, for example,to promote LPG rather than kerosene as an alternative to traditional fuels. However, all subsidy programmes have to guard against the danger that black marketers will corner supplies \u2013 which will require legislative reforms and the strengthening of institutional capacities for monitoring and enforcement. Transport Some compensation for rising transport costs could be provided through smart cards or other mechanisms to provide poor households with access to public transport at subsidized rates. However, other solutions lie outside the energy sector and include moving services and workplaces closer to communities or, as has happened in China,resettling communities closer to services. Journey times, and thus costs, could also be cut, resulting from better rural road infrastructure coupled with improved systems of public transport. Liquid biofuels Liquid biofuels, bioethanol and biodiesel, are particularly relevant for emerging Asia, which by 2050 is expected to witness a fivefold increase in the use of fuels for transport. Biofuels can bring clear benefits in terms of improved energy security as well as opportunities for boosting rural agricultural production and employment. Strategically used, they can also contribute to a modest reduction in the growth in greenhouse gas emissions from road transport. Biofuels can be very useful for remote mountainous and island communities, providing them with greater energy security and lower fuel costs for boats, mini-trucks and agricultural equipment, while also serving as routes for disposal of waste products. But there are caveats. They may initially be more expensive to the end user than petroleum-based fuels, though are expected to become cheaper over time. Moreover, diverting land to the production of crops for biofuels may also cut food production and drive up food costs. There are also environmental implications from the conversion of tropical forests to palm-oil monocrops. Some of the fuel-food tradeoffs can be averted, by combining food and energy production, for example, or growing energy crops only on more marginal lands, and by intensifying research to improve crop productivity. But overall, it is clear that while liquid biofuels hold significant promise, they should be developed with caution. Income generation Some interventions, such as the introduction of decentralized renewable energy systems, can also help the poor by providing them with new sources of energy for productive activities, particularly in communities in rural areas that have high population densities.

Biomass-based systems, in particular, offer huge potential to diversify agricultural and forestry activities, improve food security and reduce poverty. Many Asian countries, such as India and Viet Nam, are converting bagasse into process heat and electricity and in some cases supplying electricity to the grid. Solid biofuels and biogas also have tremendous potential for income generation. Recommendations for international action In pursuing the recommendations, countries in the region should also be able to rely on support from bilateral and multilateral development agencies, whose efforts could be focused on the following areas: Alliances \u2013 Helping countries develop strategic alliances to identify new sources of oil as well as to develop alternatives to oil. Institutional frameworks \u2013 Helping countries develop institutional frameworks at the local, national and regional levels to promote integrated approaches to the energy sector. Pro-poor policies \u2013 Helping countries integrate pro-poor policies in the energy sector with 110 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific International actions should focus on supporting alliances,pro-poor policies, research and producer- consumer dialogues policies in other sectors \u2013 such as road, transport and communication infrastructure, health and education services, water supply, agriculture and forestry, and small- and micro-enterprise development. Indicators \u2013 Frame and encourage the use of development indicators relevant to energy security at both national and household levels so as to measure the impacts of oil prices on income and on human poverty. Mechanisms \u2013 Help governments to establish some of the necessary mechanisms, such as oil price stabilization funds, innovative compensation and subsidy schemes, and microcredit facilities to assist the poor in acquir- ing more energy-efficient technologies and appliances. Research \u2013 Facilitate research into comparative assessments of alternatives to oil, especially biofuels, clean-coal technologies, renewable energy technologies and nuclear power, as well as on techniques to enhance the recovery of oil and find new sources of oil. Finance \u2013 Develop financing options under existing schemes, such as the CDM, to provide a fillip to the development of bioenergy and other mechanisms, such as a compensatory finance facility, outlined in the next section, to assist least developed and low-income countries. Producer-consumer dialogues \u2013 Enable producer- consumer dialogues towards moderating oil prices. The Indian government has, for example, suggested the concept of a price band negotiated between cartels of oil exporters and importers. The idea would be to allow the free play of market forces within a negotiated price band outside of which either exporters or importers, or both, would suffer beyond their desired levels of tolerance. Proposal for a regional compensatory oil finance facility A key finding of this report is that high oil prices will affect the least developed countries and low income countries (LDCs and LICs) of the region the most.These countries have modest economic growth, high indebtedness, low foreign reserves and balance of payments at the margin. If oil prices remain high or rise further, these countries will struggle to finance their growing oil import bills. Prolonged liquidity problems will force many countries to resort to external borrowings, the rise in debt and debt service costs squeezing their capacity to invest in critical economic, social and infrastructural development. All this, in turn, can only worsen the plight of their poor and critically undermine their prospects for achieving the MDGs.

An abrupt fall in oil prices can have the effect of undermining global demand for the dollar and lead to its precipitous fall, provoking an upheaval in the global financial system, the so-called \u2018disorderly adjustment.\u2019 There are thus factors at play in favour of high oil prices to help prevent such a development. Poorer countries of the region are besieged by these mega-trends outside of their control. Assisting them to cope with a high oil price future is a collective imperative for the international community since these countries are forced to bear the consequences of the actions of developed and fast developing countries. This invokes the notion of \u2018compensation\u2019, whereby those who benefit from high oil prices (oil exporters) or bear substantial responsibility for them (large importers with the ability to pay) help those who are disadvantaged by the phenomenon. The rationale for a financing mechanism to facilitate this consists of the following factors: \u2022 The present oil price rise has lasted for an extraordinary length of time,with little indica- tion of subsiding in the foreseeable future. It can well stabilize at an unsustainable level or rise even more. \u2022 Even if oil prices come down in the short-term, there is no assurance that a new uptrend will not occur subsequently.The uncertainties and attendant financial risks for oil-importing LDCs and LICs are, therefore, high. \u2022 Poorer countries of the region are already suffering from high oil prices. The financial impacts on them are acquiring a non- temporary characteristic, with potentially deeper structural implications, which is a matter of serious concern. \u2022 Without focused external assistance, these countries will find their economic and social development prospects dimming further in an era of protracted high oil prices. Their progress toward the MDGs will be retarded as long-term development investment capacity shrinks in the face of current financial shortfalls. \u2022 The economic, social and political repercussions of maldevelopment in poorer countries can spill over national boundaries in unpredictable ways.It is essential to minimize the chances of this happening. Several financing facilities aimed at external shocks, such as an oil price shock, have been set up over the years by the IMF and the European Union (EU). The IMF\u2019s Compensatory Financing Facility (CFF) and the EU\u2019s grant funds (STABEX, SYSMIN and FLEX) have assisted developing countries in dealing with trade-related shocks, but their primary focus has been on abrupt falls in the prices of commodities exported by developing countries. The CFF, which was most relevant to an oil price shock, has fallen into disuse. Other international facilities belonging to IMF and the World Bank that can potentially offer relief against the present oil price shock include the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), the Exogenous Shock Facility (ESF), the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). None of these facilities, however, wholly or substantially matches the financing needs of Asia-Pacific LDCs and LICs under the present climate of protracted high oil prices. Their main drawbacks are: \u2022 The lack of an explicit focus on oil price shocks, which limits the volume of financing available against an oil price shock. \u2022 Unavailability of assistance, with both immediate liquidity problems and financing for longer-term structural changes essential against the present protracted oil price shock. \u2022 Stringent eligibility criteria, preventing many LDCs and LICs from accessing available financing. \u2022 Insufficient duration of assistance against the present oil price shock, of which impacts could spread over five years or more. 112 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific Even if oil prices come down in the short-term, there is no assurance that a new uptrend will not occur A regional Compensatory Oil Finance Facility can assist least developed and low-income countries \u2022 Complex conditions that undermine timeliness of financing add to delays and uncertainties in disbursement, and can generate new social and political problems. \u2022 Preference to loans, which could worsen the indebtedness of countries already heavily in debt. \u2022 Insufficient funds against potential needs of affected countries \u2013 for instance, against the estimated US$60 billion required by oil- importing developing countries, the ESF plans to raise only US$2.9 billion in total funds until 2009 and a maximum of US$11.5 billion (PREM 2005).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fd246dcc-a9ec-4a86-bf05-eb0ca4bb43e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "fd246dcc-a9ec-4a86-bf05-eb0ca4bb43e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "808d44fd9720c107587833185896325e34c131a83cffa32ed2db8283929ff05b"}, "2": {"node_id": "e96b7b49-b4fc-4a80-b40f-0365599b134b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f460124e2fd9930004d382c9175ad26f963bb0318900709e61ed0f0296ebcabd"}}, "hash": "fb4b1abcfab30b3f5872253481803f5fbdb0906f2b1dc0210bcd9f54bd15f415", "text": "It is, therefore proposed that an Asia-Pacific Compensatory Oil Finance Facility (AP-COIL) be developed to assist regional LDCs and LICs by way of (a) enhancing their liquidity to overcome balance of payments and fiscal deficits, and (b) financing essential structural", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4c74aa23-7e92-4cbd-8535-73536adcb470": {"__data__": {"id_": "4c74aa23-7e92-4cbd-8535-73536adcb470", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a12c47b5fbd6587755897f75f87e60d475f421e6f433a71fafe2ba40d50fdfc7"}}, "hash": "a12c47b5fbd6587755897f75f87e60d475f421e6f433a71fafe2ba40d50fdfc7", "text": "changes in their energy economies to reduce their dependence on oil.

Along with the rest of the world, developing countries of the Asia-Pacific region face an uncertain oil future. While no one can predict with confidence how oil prices will move in the coming years, most signs seem to point upward. The situation is confounded by the extreme volatility in price movements. After surging to a record US$77 per barrel in July 2006, the price of crude plummeted close to US$50 per barrel in January 2007, only to take off again in the next eight months and enter uncharted territory, beyond US$80 per barrel in September 2007. A price of US$100 per barrel no longer seems out of the question. Even if prices subside, against the odds, toward their 2002 level of around US$22 per barrel,they might have a very short stay there. Developing countries of the region need to come to terms with the possibility that oil prices may have entered an irreversible trend, as opposed to the short, cyclical spikes of the past. The reasons for this, as set out in this report, are varied. But in the final analysis,they converge on a single point, which is that the world's finite oil resources will one day or another be exhausted, and that day might arrive sooner rather than later. The real question is: Where do we go from here? After five long years of high oil prices,developing countries of the region have reached a fork in their energy development road.On the one hand, most have been able to withstand the shock of the oil price rise without suffering permanent damage to their economies. GDP growth rates have not declined seriously, inflation remains manageable and other macroeconomic indicators are not yet flashing red. The main impact has been on their poor, but this may not be an insurmountable problem, because the amount of oil products consumed by them is a small part of the big picture. So long as countries have their own oil resources, or have other goods and services that they can trade in return for oil, there may be no need to panic. Economies may continue to expand and, as a part of the process, poverty may continue to decline and eventually be eradicated. On the other hand,poorer countries of the region have not fared so well. High oil prices have translated into worsening trade deficits,declining liquidity and growing debt. The prices of alternatives to oil like gas, coal, electricity and even biomass, the fuel of last resort, have been pulled higher by rising oil prices, creating broader pressure on their economies. In a number of countries like Bangladesh, Myanmar and Nepal, people are finding the costs of food and essential commodities and services going up as well. What is happening to the economies of the poorer countries may well be a portent of what can happen to those of other developing countries, regardless of their current resilience. Not all countries in the bottom half of the OPVI rankings presented in this report are LDCs. Which way, then, should developing countries turn? What is the way forward? Poverty has no borders, not when it comes to oil which,in a globalized market,goes to the highest bidder. For the poor to rise above poverty, their consumption of electricity and modern fuels needs to increase, including the consumption of oil for those uses for which there are, as yet, no substitutes. Otherwise, the poor will remain poor, and they will be joined by those who live in a state of borderline poverty. Millions will slip back to relying on biomass fuels and human labour, back to eking out subsistence-level incomes while the rest of the population in their own societies moves farther ahead in social status and economic affluence.

These by no means exhaust the possibilities. The future could present a mixture of one or more of these scenarios, or an entirely different set of circumstances. The menu of potential responses is also necessarily incomplete, based partly on past experience,current thinking and a degree of speculation about likely trends or events. While each country will doubtless weigh solutions in the light of its own circumstances,the broad direction should be clear: a dual track in energy policy.Policy and institutional response to rising oil prices is not only about \u2018national\u2019energy security. This supply-side approach, so far rampant in developing country policy models, is usually based upon grid-based energy supplies through generation of electricity (nuclear, coal-based, oil-/gas-fired plants) or piped gas/LPG for cooking.Yet national energy security, the first track of a national energy policy, is a necessary condition for enabling the poor to move up the household energy ladder. But to bridge the ever-increasing gap between those at the top of the ladder (urban consumers who are middle-class and above), who are the Chapter 6: Policies for an era of uncertain oil prices 115 main beneficiaries of policies aimed at national energy security, and those at the bottom, a dual-track energy security strategy is essential. The second track would help generate the income for the poor that will feed the demand for non-traditional energy products (improved cooking stoves) and services (RETs such as micro-hydro, biogas, solar PV), thereby creating a virtuous cycle that can sharply reduce poverty through the use of modern energy. Thus, all developing countries must alleviate the suffering of their poor in the immediate present while adopting strategies to secure the future of their economies. This means providing the poor with essential relief, by way of focused subsidies, compensation and direct cash transfers, against rising fuel prices. Simultaneously, a concerted effort is needed to shift the future trajectory of energy consumption, not only of the poor but also of whole economies, away from its reliance on oil. Reducing the oil intensity of development is no longer a matter of choice. It is the only course. Other events unfolding on the global arena point in the same direction. Increasing physical evidence of climate change \u2013 the rise in natural disasters, changes in weather patterns, declining biodiversity \u2013 is also making it more and more difficult to ignore calls to reduce emissions from fossil fuel consumption.Financial markets around the world are convulsing as excesses of the past catch up with them, posing the spectre of a global economic slowdown that can sap the newfound economic strength of many developing countries and move oil supplies out of the reach of their poor citizens. The time to act is now, before affordable oil becomes a distant memory. 116 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific Endnotes 1 Cutoffs are based on World Bank\u2019s classification of HIPCs and IMF\u2019s target for reducing unsustainable debt among HIPCs. 2 IMF\u2019s PRGF loans carry an interest rate of 0.5 percent.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "db6b409e-aa5c-49de-92b3-c2a44711ac7f": {"__data__": {"id_": "db6b409e-aa5c-49de-92b3-c2a44711ac7f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6c7768b586719ca44ff5e144b0fa59f3f069d754615ee897d6dfc7144b08b948"}, "2": {"node_id": "b54e2607-3c23-44d6-94bb-fdd3e9099ad5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e0fc4f7c04b11c290fa65e767bedda3cef835a12a7521339d056c866a150516d"}}, "hash": "cd5ea3748761bc06f2b0a534247fbf1cf88b864cf5e796db5c1b5a4a52cf2e37", "text": "2 IMF\u2019s PRGF loans carry an interest rate of 0.5 percent.

Macroeconomic indices Appendix B: Appendix C 125 C-1:AN OIL PRICE VULNERABILITY INDEX Is it possible to quantify the extent of this vulnerability? The degree of vulnerability will depend on many other factors such as the GDP growth rate, for example, and on the extent of foreign exchange reserves. And the extent to which poor people are vulnerable will vary accordingly, for example, to the types of energy they use. Factors and variables that influence a country's vulnerability to oil price changes, particularly in terms of impacts on poor households, are multiple and varied. These factors could be macroeconomic variables, such as GDP growth and foreign exchange reserves position, to more micro-level indicators, such as dominance of traditional fuels in the energy mix and incidence of poverty. This paper discusses such an attempt to develop a composite Oil Price Vulnerability Index (OPVI) for the 24 developing countries of the Asia-Pacific region. As a first level of classification, it may be possible to say that three kinds of factors (albeit not comprehensive) that can influence oil price vulnerability are economy-related,energy-related and social-related. Broadly, however, most of these major factors can be subsumed under two categories: economy-related and energy-related. With this preliminary understanding, a set of 15 variables have been identified to be influencing the oil price vulnerability level of a country. The data required for measuring these variables have been obtained from various secondary sources (Table C-1). Among the 15 variables, the variables like real GDP growth rate,GDP per capita,balance of payments (current account), budget balance, import cover, share of net oil fuel subsidy/tax revenue in GDP, contribution of food and beverages to inflation, trade as % of GDP, the Gini index and Human Development Index could be broadly classified under economic variables and the variables like oil intensity of GDP, oil import dependence, share of oil in primary energy consumption,oil reserves to production ratio and share of transport in oil consumption could be classified under energy-related variables. Among these variables (Table C-1), the first five economic variables (real GDP growth rate, GDP per capita, balance of payments \u2013 current account, budget balance and import cover) are expected to have positive influence in negating the vulnerability levels.The values of the variables determine the level of the influence (higher or lower) in negating the vulnerability levels. However, if these variables have negative values (e.g. negative balance of payments), even then they positively contribute to an increase in the vulnerability levels. On the other hand, the four energy-related variables (oil intensity of GDP, oil import dependence, share of oil in primary energy consumption and share of transport in oil consumption) are expected to have negative influence by contributing to the increase in vulnerability levels. As the values of the variables increase, there is a chance of experiencing higher vulnerability.Only the variable \u2018oil reserves to production ratio\u2019 has opposite influence compared to the other four variables.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__":

indicators) is given.It is possible that all of the 15 variables may not be necessary to develop an OPVI. Even when one observes the list of variables there are indications that some of them could be dependent on each other, and others could be contributing to double counting.Thus to identify the relevant variables and to justify their inclusion in the model in order to facilitate the development of OPVIs, a logical assessment of variables was carried out. This has been done through the assessment of variables for possible association, uniqueness, double counting and significance by using the correlation analysis and logical reasoning methods. C-2.1: Correlation analysis The results of the correlation analysis performed on the data are presented in Table C-2. It may be observed from Table C-2 that except for the variable \u201cshare of transport in oil consumption\u201d, all other variables are significantly correlated with one or more variables. Naturally, the next step would have been to select one of the correlated variables among different sets of correlated variables to be included in developing the OPVI.

The variables are independent, as far as possible,in the sense that each one measures a unique aspect of a system performance (economic or social). 2. Double counting or two or more variables measuring the same aspect should be avoided. 3. The variables significantly influence the levels of vulnerability. It is possible to argue that the variables can influence the vulnerability levels in two ways: 1. Positive influence: Higher observed values will reduce the vulnerability levels (economic variables). 2. Negative influence: Higher observed values will enhance the vulnerability levels (energy variables). As explained earlier, among the 15 variables, the first five are economic variables that are expected to have positive influence in negating the vulnerability levels. The values of the variables determine the level of the influence (higher or lower) in negating the vulnerability levels. However, even if these variables have negative values (e.g., negative balance of payments), they positively contribute to an increase in the vulnerability levels. On the other hand, the four energy-related variables are expected to have negatives influences by contributing to an increase in vulnerability levels. The higher the values of the variables, the greater the chance of experiencing a higher vulnerability. Only one variable, oil reserves to production ratio, has opposite influence compared to the other four variables. 1. Real GDP growth rate: This represents a country\u2019s \u201cdynamic ability to cope\u201d with price increase. If we can assume that the current rate of growth is a reasonable indicator of immediate past and expected future growth rates of real GDP, this variable can have a positive influence in determining the vulnerability levels. Countries experiencing higher growth rates can be expected to be less vulnerable than those experiencing lower growth rates.For example,a country like China will be significantly less vulnerable than Nepal. Afghanistan is an exception because of past poor performance. 2. GDP per capita: This represents a country\u2019s \u201cinherent capability to cope\u201d with oil price increase. This basically represents the economic strength of a country. In other words, it determines a country\u2019s affordability levels with the price increase. The higher the GDP per capita, the greater is its ability to be less vulnerable. For example, Malaysia is far less vulnerable than Samoa. 3. Balance of payments - current account: The current account is the sum of net sales from international trade in goods and services, net factor income (such as interest payments from abroad), and net unilateral transfers from abroad.This can be termed to represent a country\u2019s \u201ccapability to pay in FOREX\u201d. A positive and higher (as a share of GDP) balance of payments on current account represents a comfortable position in terms of paying for the imported oil (especially to take care of an oil price rise). Most importantly, this will be the surplus generated in terms of foreign exchange. Countries with negative balance of payments will be more vulnerable to an oil price rise.

A higher import cover means the country will be more comfortable in tackling the price rise. This variable can be equated to a country\u2019s \u201ccapability to sustain\u201dthe impact of oil price rise in terms of duration.In other words,how long can a country sustain the oil price rise? China is less vulnerable compared to Bangladesh. 6. Share of net oil fuel subsidy/tax revenue in GDP: This ratio gives the degree of oil subsidy burden on the economy.Because tax revenue is the most important component of government income,it is relevant to establish how much of it goes for subsidizing oil prices. If it accounts 128 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific Appendix C 129 for a small or negligible share, then there is scope for increasing it to tackle the impact of oil price rise.Countries with smaller shares will be less vulnerable than those with higher shares.At the outset,this variable appears not to be relevant, because both the components of oil fuel subsidy and tax revenue are part of budget estimates. Already, there is a variable \u201cbudget balance\u201dthat captures the position of a country in terms of vulnerability levels. Logically, we may state that this particular variable is redundant; however, this is not corroborated by the correlation analysis results, indicating no significant correlation between the two variables. The reason could be a negligible share of net oil subsidy in tax revenue, resulting in negligible contributions to overall variations. Again logically, this variable can be eliminated from the index determination model. 7. Contribution of food and beverages to inflation: This basically indicates how developed a country is.A country with higher contributions from agricultural commodities in the overall inflation is stated to be at the initial stages of development.Thus, one could conclude that a country having higher contributions of food and beverages to inflation would be more vulnerable to an oil price rise. However, this type of influence has already been captured through two variables, \u201creal GDP growth rate\u201d and \u201cGDP per capita,\u201d making this variable redundant. Even so, this is an indirect measure of influence on vulner- ability levels. Instead of this variable, a better variable could have been \u201ccontribution of oil price changes to inflation.\u201d This can be expected to capture both the direct and indirect impact of oil price changes on the economy, and would have enabled obtaining a better indicator for arriving at a vulnerability index. 8. Oil intensity of GDP: This determines the oil dependency levels of a country. The higher the intensity,the greater is the vulnerability of a country to the oil price increase. Cambodia is less vulnerable compared to Maldives. 9. Oil reserves to production ratio:This basically indicates a country's level of ownership of oil reserves and rate of exploitation. The higher the ratio, the greater is the comfort level of a country. Indigenous production of oil can act as an insurance cover for the international oil price rise. This indicator is more relevant for long-term vulnerability index. Countries that do not have any reserves are more vulnerable. 10. Oil import dependence:This is the most critical variable determining a country's vulnerability level.Those countries that depend 100 percent on imported oil are the most vulnerable to the oil price rise. Logically, those who do not have any oil reserves will be forced to import 100 percent of oil requirement. This may indicate that one of the two variables \u201coil reserves to production ratio\u201d and \u201coil import dependence\u201d is redundant in deriving the OPVI. That does not mean that a country that has oil reserves cannot have high import dependence. This is a possible situation for countries keeping their oil stock as strategic reserves and relying on imports for current requirements. In other words, it is possible to have countries with high oil import dependence as well as a high reserves to production ratio that exhibit less vulnerability to oil price shocks. Logically, both the variables are necessary for determining the OPVI; however, the data state the opposite. The correlation analysis shows that both the variables are highly correlated, and it is significant.Thus, it may be advisable to retain \u201coil import dependence\u201d and eliminate \u201coil reserves to production ratio,\u201d at least in the present context. 11. Share of oil in primary energy consumption: This variable indicates how important oil is in relation to other energy sources.The countries with a higher share will be more vulnerable than those with a lower share. 12. Share of transport in oil consumption: Just this variable alone would be inadequate to assess the linkage to vulnerability levels. It also is important to know how much", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fdcc3dbd-b1b1-4cb3-93cb-6d9c8e30169a": {"__data__": {"id_": "fdcc3dbd-b1b1-4cb3-93cb-6d9c8e30169a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b923f68f4cdc26e2833b4ba310d11b1eeb86a520577de6878f22e564c366a063"}}, "hash": "b923f68f4cdc26e2833b4ba310d11b1eeb86a520577de6878f22e564c366a063", "text": "the transport sector is important to the economy. It may be possible that most of the oil is consumed by the transport sector (this typically happens in less industrialized countries), but it need not be critical. With this variable alone, it may not be possible to state the relationship to vulnerability level. It cannot be true if one states that the countries with a higher share of transport in oil consumption will be more vulnerable to oil price shocks. It is necessary to include variable/s assessing the importance of transport. A derived variable capturing the essence of the two would be an ideal replacement. 13. GDP as % of trade: Much cannot be interpreted from this. Typically, smaller countries with relatively small domestic markets will have significantly higher international trade compared to the country's GDP. It is logically difficult to assess the influence of this variable on vulnerability. Even the observed trend based on the data provided does not appear to provide much insight on vulnerability levels. Thus, it may be eliminated from the basket of variables included for estimating OPVI. 14. Gini index: This is a measure of income inequality ranging from 0 (perfect equality) to 100 (perfect inequality). Higher values exhibit higher inequality. This may not be an appropriate variable for assessing the vulnerability levels. Income equality or inequality can happen at both extremes. A poor country can exhibit high equality, and the same might be the case for a rich country. Even the opposite can be true. For example, Afghanistan (35.5) exhibits higher equality compared to Malaysia (49.2),whereas Nepal, with a Gini index of 47.2, shows high inequality in comparison to Indonesia (34.3). We cannot state that countries with a higher Gini index are more vulnerable or vice versa. Mere observation of the data related to the Gini index of different Asian countries indicate that countries with higher Gini index values (higher inequality) are less vulnerable to an oil price rise. This variable may be eliminated because it may not have much influence in determining the vulnerability index. That countries with a higher Gini index are less vulnerable to an oil price rise can be logically argued in the case of India. On the basis of a composite index derived from the macro indicators, countries like India at the outset might look more vulnerable to the oil price rise.However,the reality may be different.This is due to the fact that a large majority of the population is not part of the energy mainstream (depending on modern energy carriers) and their role in oil economy is negligible. They hardly get impacted directly by the oil price rise. Even the indirect effects may be marginal because they are not a part of the mainstream market system. However, the macro indicators that are being used to arrive at the composite vulnerability index are derived, taking into consideration even this section of the population (e.g., per capita GDP with and without this section of the population). 15. Human Development Index: This is a socioeconomic indicator of well-being of a country that represents the overall social capacity of the population to respond to adversities. The countries with higher HDI values tend to be less vulnerable to the oil price rise. It may be possible that HDI can be significantly correlated with \u201cGDP per capita\u201d and \u201coil intensity of GDP,\u201d because both of these variables are part of the indicators that are used to determine HDI. However, logical considerations necessitate inclusion of all three variables in the model determining the composite index because the three variables measure different aspects of economic system. Though HDI includes economic indicators, the advantage is that it also captures the influence of social indicators. However, in the present analysis, the HDI has been excluded because of the following reasons: \u2022 It is a relative index (across countries) unlike other variables included in the analysis. Other variables either indicate exact measurements or are relative to sectors/ segments within the country. \u2022 The main objective here is to develop a country\u2019s vulnerability index. All the variables facilitate this except the HDI. The HDI goes beyond this and attempts to capture the \u201csocial empowerment\u201d levels, which are people-driven.

Human Development Index 130 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific Appendix C 131 C-3: DEVELOPING AN OIL PRICE VULNERABILITY INDEX USING PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a popular dimensionality reduction technique used for reducing the number variables in a model (e.g., econometric models). It uses the correlation structure of the variables to perform this task. Basically, the PCA forms linear combinations of variables to arrive at a principal component, and this principal component can be logically related to a dimension representing a set of variables. Taking the example of developing OPVI for 24 countries of the Asia-Pacific region itself, the attempt here is to quantify the degree of vulnerability by using a set of eight included variables which remain after the logical assessment. However, deriving an index with eight variables and then attempting to interpret it would be quite complex.Therefore,the purpose of using PCA is to reduce these eight variables into a manageable number of dimensions (or principal components) to facilitate development of a composite OPVI. Ideally speaking, if we can get one principal component (or single dimension), which accounts for maximum variation,then with few more simple steps, we could obtain the composite OPVI. The values obtained for this principal component for each of the 24 countries can be used for developing the OPVI. However, in reality, that too with eight variables, this cannot be expected. Arriving at a composite OPVI with more than one principal component is always complex (but easier than having eight variables). But the decision to use how many principal components is ours. The number of principal components depends on how much variance we want to account for. C-4: PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS \u2013 REDUCED MODEL WITH EIGHT VARIABLES The principal component analysis resulted in extracting three principal components from the eight variables considered for arriving at OPVI. The principal components having Eigenvalues of above 1 have been included in the model, explaining the total variation resulting in three principal components.The individual Eigenvalues and the explained variance are given in Table C-3. principal component 1 accounts for 32.74% variance, principal component 2 and 3 account for 23.1% and 19% variance and, cumulatively, all three account for 74.8% variance. Theoretically, we can account for 100% variance by including all the eight principal components (equal to eight variables).

The numbers are called factor loadings and these are equivalent of correlation coefficients. In other words,these numbers tell us how much the variable/s is/are correlated with the principal components. Principal component 1 has four significant variables loaded (are grouped under principal component 1), whereas PC 2 has two variables and PC 3 two variables (Table C-5). From the above data, the significant factor loadings have been extracted to know which variables have been grouped into a single given principal component. Table C-5 contains these details. Principal component 1 has four variables loaded (or four variables are grouped under principal component 1), whereas 2 and 3 have two variables each. The principal component analysis is used for variable reduction.In this case, the linear combinations of four variables formed the first principal component (PC1). Linear combination of the next two variables formed principal component 2 (PC2), and similarly, the remaining two variables formed principal component 3 (PC3).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "62a34eac-8b33-48d7-8582-fe9b7fa35419": {"__data__": {"id_": "62a34eac-8b33-48d7-8582-fe9b7fa35419", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1be3622a7bd42ecd21444556568e37028077b4c7aea215f5612eaf4440f58122"}, "2": {"node_id": "b63ef12c-5f7f-4d42-9eef-05f3988a5e6b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f94a01c4b97dd6c069e549ca29f88ea248375dc4b8cafb050d4ac70d02dab33d"}}, "hash": "1b382a532c13411879dfd38d2c76f159c3d68cb747ea47c85ca3d1a904c49746", "text": "132 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific Table C-4: Factor loadings on the principal components (with eight variables) Principal Component Principal Component Principal Component 3 2 1 - 6.0 50 5.0 16 - 3.0 92 e la GD g P rowt r h ate R 1.0 35 7.0 48 1.0 99 GD P pe c r ap ti a Balance of payments: current account 0.902 -0.114 -0.049 1.0 82 - 3.0 16 8.0 20 udge t b ala nce B - 3.0 07 4.0 30 6.0 00 over c tr mpo I 4.0 80 7.0 06 - 2.0 33 f GDP o", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5171dbc2-b4c4-496b-8f3f-86d4ca76a302": {"__data__": {"id_": "5171dbc2-b4c4-496b-8f3f-86d4ca76a302", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2a96cf39fed8c46ca790af37a11326470f1f3215e512502a5d138027b910d032"}, "3": {"node_id": "c05c0a1a-4887-48d3-a3ea-94e6c35270b1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "16145926a4fc6fc536dcacf090a681db9ff3434a9829a74f5080cbddee55afee"}}, "hash": "31444bf62bd472da2004218b3153a48105c69a7532d7b25a8490ec3809145cf8", "text": "y ten tis ni li O - 3.0 40 - 4.0 62 - 6.0 13 ependence d tr O i li mpo Share of oil in primary energy consumption -0.386 -0.101 0.777 Table C-5: Significant and dominant factor loadings on the principal components (with eight variables) Principal Component Principal Component Principal Component 3 2 1 - 6.0 50 e la GD g P rowt r h ate R 7.0 48 GD P pe c r ap ti a Balance of payments: current account 0.902 8.0 20 udge t b ala nce B 6.0 00 over c tr mpo I 7.0 06 f GDP o y ten tis ni li O - 6.0 13 ependence d tr i li mpo O 7.0 77 p ir mar e y nerg c y onsump oit n ni lio f har o e S Please note that in Table C-5, the variable \u201creal GDP growth rate\u201d has a negative sign for the factor loading and \u201cshare of oil in primary energy consumption\u201d has a positive sign, where logically the signs should have been opposite. Therefore, for the subsequent analysis the signs have been reversed for the factor loadings of principal component 3 (third column in Table C-4). From Table C-5, the groupings of the variables under each of the principal components are as follows: Principal Component 1: Economic Strength (Strength) \u2022 Balance of payments: current account \u2022 Budget balance \u2022 Import cover \u2022 Oil import dependence Strength represents the economic capacity to afford oil imports.A country will be less vulnerable if it has high and positive scores for balance of payments, budget balance and import cover, and a lower score for oil import dependence. Principal Component 2: Economic Performance (Performance) \u2022 GDP per capita \u2022 Oil intensity of GDP Better economic performance results in higher levels of GDP per capita, which should make a country less vulnerable. In developing countries that are shifting from low-quality traditional fuels to high-quality modern fuels such as petroleum products,this will lead to an increase in oil intensity. This may not be an attractive indicator from an environmental standpoint, but its is relevant at initial stages of economic development. Appendix C 133 Principal Component 3: Economic Growth with low share of oil in primary energy (Low-oil-growth) \u2022 Real GDP growth rate \u2022 Share of oil in primary energy consumption (Reducing share) Many countries initially base their development on primary energy sources other than oil, including traditional fuels or, as in the cases of China and India, coal and hydro. But they are likely to become increasingly oil-dependent. A country will be less vulnerable if it can combine a high GDP growth rate with a low share of oil in primary energy consumption. The values of these three principal components are called factor scores. As mentioned earlier, the principal components are derived based on the linear combination of the variables.

The categorization of countries into low, medium and high OPVI groups has been done using the mean (0.396) and standard deviation (0.215) combination on the estimated OPVI: Low OPVI countries OPVI value \u2265 Mean + Standard deviation High OPVI countries OPVI value \u2264 Mean Medium OPVI countries All the countries between the two limits 1. Low OPVI countries: High economic capacity (or strength) to absorb oil price shocks, perform better with high per capita GDP and economic growth rate, and have either low reliance on oil or are net exporters of oil 2. Medium OPVI countries: Medium economic capacity (or strength) to absorb oil price shocks, perform better with high or medium per-capita GDP and economic growth rate, and have either low reliance on oil or are net exporters of oil 3. High OPVI countries:Low economic strength,lower economic performance and high oil dependency Oil Price Vulnerability Index: country grouping Appendix D: Appendix E 141 The assumptions used in the comparative analysis of generation costs were based on the results and assumptions of a 2005 study undertaken jointly by energy research institutions and power generating companies under the direction of the World Bank.2 The study covered whether renewable energy technologies for off-grid and mini-grid applications are competitive with gasoline and diesel generation sets.The study shows: \u2022 Renewable energy is more economical than conventional generation for off-grid (less than 5 kW) applications. Renewable energy technologies \u2013 wind,mini-hydro and biomass- electric \u2013 are the least-cost option (on a levelized basis) for off-grid electrification applications, assuming availability of the renewable resource. Pico-hydro, small wind, and PV-wind hybrid technologies,in particular,are projected to be in the range of 15-25 cents/kWh, less than half the 30-40 cents/kWh for gasoline and diesel engine generators. The most expensive renewable energy technology (solar PV) is comparable in levelized electricity costs to the projected costs for gasoline or diesel engine generators, especially for small power applications (50-300W). \u2022 Several renewable energy technologies are potentially the least-cost option for mini-grid applications.Mini-grid applications are village- and district-level networks with loads between 5 kW and 500 kW that are not connected to a national grid. The assessment indicates that numerous renewable energy technologies (biomass, biogas, geothermal, wind and micro-hydro) are the potential least-cost generating option for mini-grids, assuming a sufficient renewable energy resource is available.Two biomass technologies \u2013 biogas digesters and biomass gasifiers \u2013 seem particularly promising,due to their high capacity factors and availability in size ranges matched to mini-grid loads. Geothermal also appears economical, recognizing that it is restricted to only those developing economies with easy-to-tap hydrothermal resources and no large field development costs. Because so many renewable energy sources are viable in this size range, mini-grid planners should thoroughly review their options to make the best selection. The levelized cost of energy was used to examine the relative costs of individual technologies compared to oil-based technologies.3 The economic assessment was performed for different operating conditions (full-time and limited operating hours in mini-grid and off-grid configurations) and different time periods (2004, 2010 and 2015) in order to incorporate projected cost reductions from the scaling up of emerging technologies. The study results make it possible to compare the levelized economic costs of electricity technologies over a broad range of deployment modes and demand levels, both at present and in the future. The forecast value of the future price in 2010 and 2015 is calculated by considering the decrease of the future price as a result of both technological innovation and mass production.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f9160a7f-9d4b-4d41-9d08-58021abf0a56": {"__data__": {"id_": "f9160a7f-9d4b-4d41-9d08-58021abf0a56", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7877d45b3156d2a7f2cb608994e2f92437fe92d3e1b5e0b1fdcf6320680b6a44"}, "2": {"node_id": "50bcd533-47c7-48e2-b1ca-2e02b90e7ff4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1efa92e378ec8b1a3191ce47ed1ea4e1a99c601b45f3d593abfbf61031354ac0"}}, "hash": "300ca621a4d33a51f0abddaeaa6de0dce2e5781ba218b656436aaa9de5c7feee", "text": "A forecast decrease in capital cost is done for each generation technology group,as shown in Table E-1,reflecting the relative maturity of each technology.

Economic cost equivalent to international competitive price of machines, materials and fuel were used.Transport costs were included and shown separately, and only labour expenses were assumed to differ between regions. \u2022 The local and regional emissions (e.g.,particulate, SO2 and NOx) were assumed to meet World Bank environmental safeguard requirements. The cost of land was not included in the analysis due to its site-specific nature. \u2022 Key uncertainties including fossil fuel costs, future technology cost and performance, and resource risks were systematically addressed using a probabilistic approach based on the \u201cCrystal Ball\u201dsoftware package. \u2022 Accommodating the Intermittency of RETs. When solar PV,wind PV and wind hybrids were in a mini-grid area or off-grid configuration, battery costs or backup generator costs were included in the costs of the power system as a way to smooth stochastic variations in the available resource and provide for a reliable power output. \u2022 Regional Adjustment. Location factors for the Asian region were determined, and analysis indicated that the variation in costs of engineering, equipment and materials was quite small when procurement was done under ICB (International Competitive Bidding) or comparable guidelines. The labour costs, however, varied from region to region, depending on GDP and per capita incomes. Appendix F 143 The methodology adopted for obtaining the ranking was two-pronged: 1. Capturing the perceptions of the group of energy experts in a brainstorming session on the classification of strategies from the perspective of various objectives. The three objectives considered are overall effectiveness (combining all the objectives listed above), cost of implementation and time required for implementation.Three classification levels \u2013 high, medium and low \u2013 were used. Through a consensus, each of the strategies were classified as high, medium or low. 2. Again through a consultative process and with a consensus, the weights for the three objectives were obtained. The weights assigned were 0.50 for overall effectiveness, 0.30 for cost of implementation (since all the countries are developing countries and cost is an important consideration), and 0.20 for time required for implementation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a42241bb-8316-4e2a-ae3d-25d3d4fd4e3d": {"__data__": {"id_": "a42241bb-8316-4e2a-ae3d-25d3d4fd4e3d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "27ede6aecbe18834cab9ea85a6bdf14fe4e4b4cd8bd4a53137720813404e175a"}, "2": {"node_id": "1599cad6-c80a-4e17-8f4c-d574d90956c7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-vulnerability-rising-oil-prices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8151f41d85fd938cb7ad5699d9142a1dbe72280e0a5e0320ee37f5efdea7a3ba"}}, "hash": "929a3e631dd4a7fd6f932fd50bdbd20e2971f7e657540a3f7d7599872a4dc2fe", "text": "Methodology of sub-strategy priorities Appendix F: 144 Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific Table G-1: Energy conversions To: Terajoule Gigacalorie Megatonne oil Million British Gigawatt- (TJ) (Gcal) (equiv) thermal units hour (Mtoe) (Mbtu) (GWh) From: Multiply by: Terajoule (TJ) 1 238.8 2.388 x 10-5 947.8 0.2778 Megatonne oil 4.1868 x 104 107 1 3.968 x 107 11,630 (equiv) (Mtoe) Million British 1.0551 x 10 -3 0.252 2.52 x 10-8 1 2.931 x 10-4 thermal units (Mbtu) Gigawatt-hour (GWh) 3.6 860 10 -5 3,412 1 Table G-2: Unit abbreviation b Billion bbl Barrel Btu British Thermal Units m/s Metre/second M2 square metre m3 cubic metre km2 square kilometre A Ampere kVA Kilo Volt-Ampere Wp Watt peak kW Kilowatt kWh Kilowatt-hour kWh/m2 Kilowatt-hour/square metre kgoe Kilogrammes oil equivalent MW Megawatt MWh Megawatt-hour GW Gigawatt t Tonne Table G-3: Unit prefix k kilo (103) M mega (106) G giga (109) T Tera (1012) P Peta (1015) Energy units,conversion factors and abbreviations Appendix G: Figures from IEA.

The paper also benefited from the comments of Ratnakar Adhikari, M\u00fcmtaz Keklik and Yumiko Yamamoto, and professional editing by Kay Kirby Dorji. This review of Asia-Pacific experience in trade policy and development draws on the research papers produced under the Asia-Pacific Trade and Investment Initiative and the summaries generated from those papers. This body of work has been presented and discussed in a series of consultations since 2003 involving stakeholders from over 15 Asia-Pacific countries as well as UNDP country offices and regional programmes including the Asia-Pacific Regional Human Development Report Initiative and the Macroeconomics of Poverty Reduction Programme. This paper was also presented in a workshop in Yverdon-les-Bains, 29 September to 1 October 2005. 5 Acronyms and Abbreviations AFTA AFTA AFTA AFTA AFTA ASEAN Free Trade Area AIDS AIDS AIDS AIDS AIDS Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome AMS AMS AMS AMS AMS Aggregate Measure of Support AOA AOA AOA", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ce4b115d-f6a0-40a1-87b5-746a2eaf9557": {"__data__": {"id_": "ce4b115d-f6a0-40a1-87b5-746a2eaf9557", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/people-trade-and-development-learning-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "People, Trade, and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/people-trade-and-development-learning-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9ed862f023e3bd1c8171b86aac2abe0499a25c01969dbe8cf458c831ac59fd54"}, "3": {"node_id": "6b69e407-1e6d-4e10-9128-ef7e3687ad2a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/people-trade-and-development-learning-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "30f5e7b24e0ab32039b8e36a51d542b3043b6034313f64fdfcdca25946f46116"}}, "hash": "51d7403471ef753d10659f81c00e988f3bd7365821c54d84a95b8287115e3be2", "text": "AOA AOA Agreement on Agriculture ASEAN ASEAN ASEAN ASEAN ASEAN Association of South East Asian Nations BITs BITs BITs BITs BITs Bilateral Investment Treaties CAP CAP CAP CAP CAP Common Agricultural policy CICUP CICUP CICUP CICUP CICUP Centre for International Comparisons at the University of Pennsylvania EU EU EU EU EU European Union FAO FAO FAO FAO FAO Food and Agriculture Organization FDI FDI FDI FDI FDI Foreign Direct Investment FTAs FTAs FTAs FTAs FTAs Free Trade Agreements GATT GATT GATT GATT GATT General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade GATS GATS GATS GATS GATS General Agreement on Trade in Services GDP GDP GDP GDP GDP Gross Domestic Product GNP GNP GNP GNP GNP Gross National Product HIV HIV HIV HIV HIV Human Immunodeficiency Virus ILO ILO ILO ILO ILO International Labour Organization IOM IOM IOM IOM IOM International Organization on Migration LDC LDC LDC LDC LDC Least Developed Country MDGs MDGs MDGs MDGs MDGs Millennium Development Goals MNP MNP MNP MNP MNP Movement of Natural Persons NAMA NAMA NAMA NAMA NAMA Non-Agricultural Market Access ODA ODA ODA ODA ODA Official Development Assistance OECD OECD OECD OECD OECD Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development PDR PDR PDR PDR PDR People\u2019s Democratic Republic RTAs RTAs RTAs RTAs RTAs Regional Trade Agreements SAFTA SAFTA SAFTA SAFTA SAFTA South Asian Free Trade Area SBTC SBTC SBTC SBTC SBTC Skilled Biased Technical Change SDT SDT SDT SDT SDT Special and Differential Treatment SMEs SMEs SMEs SMEs SMEs Small and Medium Enterprises 6 | People, Trade and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific Acronyms and Abbreviations contd.

Introduction Among the world\u2019s regions, Asia-Pacific is well-known as one in which many societies are managing to find ways to escape from poverty and underdevelopment. The paths out of deprivation have varied among countries; societies in the region employed a variety of political arrangements after starting off with dissimilar social and physical endowments. Moreover, within the experience of each country, development strategies often were revised in response to the changing global environment and the achieved level of development. Despite the success stories in East Asia, the human development challenge in Asia- Pacific remains as daunting as at the beginning of the 20th Century. In 2001, 431 million people in South Asia (31 percent of the population) and 271 million in East Asia (15 percent of the population) lived on less than US$1 a day (UN Millennium Project 2004). Levels of development range widely, with the richest society in the region enjoying a per-capita income more than 100 times that of the poorest. Of great consequence is that within many countries, extreme contrasts continue to exist in access to decent livelihoods, human dignity, and a meaningful role in society. Trade has always been a key part of Asia Pacific development strategies. In developmental terms, the trade strategies of successful countries in the region have been applied to move an economy up the ladder in the international division of labour. These will always involve, whether or not gains are shared equitably, raising productivity of numerous factors. Hypothetically, an economy could move up the ladder without undertaking human development. This might involve severe exploitation of the factors of production by a few. It also would be easy to imagine \u2013 as has indeed taken place \u2013 that this pattern of development would reach an upper bound, such as when non-renewable resources are exhausted (Diamond 2005).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6b69e407-1e6d-4e10-9128-ef7e3687ad2a": {"__data__": {"id_": "6b69e407-1e6d-4e10-9128-ef7e3687ad2a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/people-trade-and-development-learning-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "People, Trade, and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/people-trade-and-development-learning-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9ed862f023e3bd1c8171b86aac2abe0499a25c01969dbe8cf458c831ac59fd54"}, "2": {"node_id": "ce4b115d-f6a0-40a1-87b5-746a2eaf9557", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/people-trade-and-development-learning-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "51d7403471ef753d10659f81c00e988f3bd7365821c54d84a95b8287115e3be2"}}, "hash": "30f5e7b24e0ab32039b8e36a51d542b3043b6034313f64fdfcdca25946f46116", "text": "8 | People, Trade and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific In the second half of the 20th Century, successful countries in Asia- Pacific undertook a pattern of trade expansion that, even with clear faults, went hand-in-hand with human development; for the most part, trade and human development reinforced each other. These actual experiences assist us in understanding the human development impact of trade and trade reforms, whether at the domestic or international level. In particular, East Asian economies established the key role that external trade can play to raise the productivity of their people and to steadily absorb the unemployed and underemployed into higher-paying work (Bhagwati 2004).

Through this process, countries fashioned their international competitive advantages instead of passively depending upon inherited comparative advantages. Within a framework that sees external trade as the means by which countries alter their place in the international division of labour, high levels of human development tend to have a positive relationship with the country\u2019s effort to move up the development ladder and its international competitiveness. Societies can raise their level of human development in one of two ways: firstly, by pursuing economic growth as the top priority, under the presumption that growth will eventually translate into higher human development (and enhanced international competitiveness). Or they can devote their resources to directly raise human development even at the expense of growth, hoping that higher capabilities will lead to economic growth. We now need to more directly explore the connection between human development and trade. Trade has both direct impacts on human 9 development variables and impacts that are mediated through other variables. Economic growth is a key mediating1 variable. The analytical connection between human development and economic growth is well-trodden. A recent, and important, application is found in Ranis and Stewart (2005), drawing on a series of their own previous studies. Ranis and Stewart trace two alternative channels, one from economic growth to human development and the other from human development to economic growth. They differentiate between countries that follow a reasonably balanced path and those that follow \u201clopsided\u201d strategies that prioritise economic growth over human development or vice versa. They find, first of all, that neither lopsided strategy is sustainable. For example, \u201chuman development first\u201d strategies can run into fiscal constraints and balance of payments crises, while \u201ceconomic growth first\u201d strategies can reach limits of domestic supply of skilled labour and political instability. Secondly, however, they find that countries that overextend themselves in human development have a much better chance of weathering economic crises and resuming economic growth. Much has been made of the contrast between the development experiences of East Asia and South Asia. In human development terms, the contrast can be overdrawn, since both experiences demonstrate \u201chow favorable human development achievements \u2013 literacy, long, healthy lives of citizens, equitable distribution of assets, good public service, etc. \u2013 can provide suitable preconditions for economic growth, and how economic growth can in turn contribute to enhancing human development achievements further\u201d(Wagle 2003). While East Asia started with a considerably more favourable human development stock, 1 One important viewpoint is that economic growth is itself a key causative variable to successful expansion of external trade and international integration. If this is indeed the case, Rodrik suggests that international trade rules should not undermine the potential of developing countries to promote growth and utilise their policy space to do so (Rodrik 2001). 10 | People, Trade and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific subsequent advances in human development endowment in India permitted modest liberalisation reforms in the early 1980s and technology-driven international integration in the late 1990s to materialise as faster economic growth. That human development is the goal of all conscious efforts at social change and economic development is the analytical starting point of this review of Asia Pacific trade policy. Economic development has been a contributing factor to human development, even though the input has often been secured through socially painful efforts to secure human rights. Economic development generates the means to support expanded material well-being and freedom of choice. The manner by which the additional material means is generated and distributed in the course of development determines, to a great extent, how economic progress promotes human development. Historically, increased commerce between societies has gone hand-in-hand with economic development. What we consider in this volume are two intimately conjoined issues as it relates to the Asia-Pacific experience: \ufffd The role trade has played in the material progress of societies in the region; and \ufffd The way in which human development is being promoted or diminished, or has languished, from interaction between trade and economic growth These two aspects are intimately related because of our particular view of what constitutes human development. 11 II.

Historically, industrialisation begat urbanisation and the creation of a working class composed of individuals drawing income from their factory employment independent of patronage from the elite. This facilitated the emergence of an independent electorate in Western countries (Reinert 2005). In the 1960s and 1970s, East Asia\u2019s export drive relied heavily on mobilisation of female labour. For the women directly involved, the human development impact involved both gains and losses. In earning their own income independent of their families, many obtained greater personal freedom (Beneria 2003; Bhagwati 2004). However, because women were particularly important as a low-cost pool of labour for production in competitive export markets, enormous pressures have emerged to restrict the ability of these workers to participate in decisions on their working conditions (Beneria 2003; World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalization 2004). Women\u2019s responsibilities as caregivers, as stipulated by social norms, also have restricted women\u2019s participation in determining working conditions, since many can work work only part-time3. A human development approach evaluates both the costs and benefits of trade in terms of empowerment and promotes the search for trade strategies that minimise the costs and maximise the benefits (Fontana, Joekes, Masika 1998). 2 See UNDP Asia Trade Initiative (2003). 3 In many societies, even if women work full-time, they are often not perceived as serious professionals since their primary role is considered as a caregiver. 12 | People, Trade and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific Productivity Productivity Productivity Productivity Productivity Productivity involves the raising of human capabilities among members of society, both as an end in itself and as a means to raise the capability of society as a whole. This definition of productivity goes beyond the conventional one, which is usually reflected in declining required labour inputs or increasing outputs and which views the concept of productivity only as an end. In this view, productivity is also taken as a means. Productivity involves advances in health, education, and labour force capabilities. This requires two things (Islam 2001, p. 7): First, increasing incomes and protection from income volatility so that households can provide for the basic needs, such as nutrition, that are most efficiently provided within the household; second, robust markets and public institutions to provide those other basic needs, such as health and education, that cannot be provided by individual households. It is important to expand upon the crucial relationship between productivity and employment as key drivers to growth and development. In efforts to raise productivity, we must keep in mind that productivity increases are necessary but not sufficient for human development. It is possible to raise productivity, especially in the short- to medium-term, through declines in employment, in which case a single-minded effort to raise productivity has an adverse effect on employment and human development. Industrial development, buttressed by social programmes in health and education, played a critical role in raising productivity in the now- advanced countries4 (Reinert 2003b, p. 470-473; UNRISD 2005). For the latecomers in industrialisation, capital and technology imports are 4 Reinert (2003b) argues that, historically, economic development is activity-specific \u2013 i.e., it requires certain economic activities (Schumpeterian activities, as he calls them) that will raise the standard of living with better health and educational opportunities. UNRISD (2005) in country case studies underlines the role of social policies in the context of economic development in Asia. Kwon in UNRISD 2005, p.5, argues that economic development requires social policy. 13 critical to raising productivity (Chang 1994; Amsden 2001). By providing the foreign exchange and access to capital imports and technology, trade played a critical role in the success of newly industrialising countries in East Asia. While aggressively taking advantage of their lower wage costs to export less advanced goods, these countries consciously restructured and upgraded to higher technology and higher price goods and steadily broke out of their reliance on exporting commodities and cheap manufactures. This experience contrasts sharply with the colonial experience of many countries, which was characterised by continued low productivity exports on the part of the poorer country. The East Asia experience illustrates that a human development approach to trade is acutely sensitive to the questions of whether national and global trade policies are productivity-enhancing or -diminishing.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e7e519e-ea0f-4bab-bbc0-918d380aded3": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e7e519e-ea0f-4bab-bbc0-918d380aded3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/people-trade-and-development-learning-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "People, Trade, and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/people-trade-and-development-learning-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5b718067215e8c9965b373f5f1af22537040edc3a79ac8838d9d179fc1bbde6c"}, "2": {"node_id": "51692bb0-3ec6-467b-b6c6-3c49524acd6f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/people-trade-and-development-learning-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "005d2d8e801af72e826af6c6ced9542735c3ddb626838e41d30f7b3a4bd9cfa3"}}, "hash": "28b0fc5c0d173484abe78b52a5a3f19ec7bff2375f7bfb05828a76c4c68b9816", "text": "Equity Equity Equity Equity Equity Equity demands the progressive equalisation of access to opportunity for all members of society.

Highly unequal asset ownership, both in terms of physical and human assets, generally implies a limited social capacity for \u201ctrickle down,\u201d i.e., benefits from economic growth are unable to be shared widely and represent an obstacle to a more general advance in productivity in society. Expanded trade creates larger markets and new opportunities for income and employment. Markets by themselves rely solely on price-cost considerations and are unable to address issues of equity. One key channel of impact that trade has on equity is through its differential impact on different production sectors and on different capacities of labour. The intensification of world trade has generally been associated with skill-biased technical change (SBTC), benefiting, in terms of higher pay, skilled workers versus the unskilled, and in terms of higher margins 14 | People, Trade and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific over cost in more technologically advanced products. These influences have tended to exacerbate inequalities in place before trade expansion. A human development approach to trade recognises that trade by itself cannot address existing or induced inequities and promotes the search for complementary policies. Sustainability Sustainability Sustainability Sustainability Sustainability Sustainability is concerned with the durability of social gains and that these gains do not prevent subsequent generations from improving their own welfare. Environmental concerns are a part of sustainability, but equally important are concerns about human capabilities, such as health and education. Sustainability also concerns financial stability, political stability and social progress. Financial crises that undermine previous gains in growth belie sustainability. Sustainability also draws our attention to episodes of retreat from already achieved progress. Various indicators of health of a population, such as life expectancy at birth, maternal mortality, and the mortality of children younger than 5, are robust indicators of social gains because these embody longer-term processes over the whole population. Changes in the rate of improvement in these indicators are unmistakable signs of social progress or regress, or of catastrophes such as the outbreak of war, social unrest or, as in the case of most economies in the Eastern Europe, dislocations as a result of haphazard economic reform. Changes in the rates of improvements in these statistics are therefore early indicators of sustainability. These measures also embody the incidence of disparities in society; a society whose high average income is distributed unequally would tend to show poor performance on these indicators. The indicators reflect the sum total of the capabilities of individual households and of society. A key channel by which trade affects human development is through these changes in capabilities. When trade outcomes have considerable impact on livelihoods and income, then they can have a profound effect on household capability. When imports of 15 agricultural commodities, subsidised by industrial economies, threaten the livelihood of farmers, then these capabilities are undermined and sustainability is threatened. Trade rules also can affect a government\u2019s capability to provide health and manage domestic conflict. Asia-Pacific countries have not relied heavily on social welfare systems to provide social benefits, but have instead depended on steady growth and employment and on labour regulations in the public and private sectors5. Especially in Asia-Pacific, a human development approach to trade must pay particular attention to the impact of trade on growth, employment and livelihood, because in this region these are the key contributors to sustainability. Three other considerations apply to each of these aspects on human development. First, in the trade area, these four aspects interact closely. For example, empowering women working in export industries to improve their working conditions helps to promote equity. Workers enjoying better working conditions can in turn engage in greater self- investment to improve their productivity. In more successful exporting countries, such as the Republic of Korea, companies responded to pressure from increased labour costs by boosting labour productivity through investments in capital goods. Thus, at the level of society, equity can in turn engender productivity and sustainability. In the textile and clothing sector, efforts to improve cost competitiveness also could involve shifting the product mix, such as reducing reliance on low- quality exports.

Third, what is required is a progressive realisation of these goals, not immediate achievement. Changes in trade outcomes and rules therefore can be evaluated on whether, in the first place, these changes risk a retreat from gains already achieved. If human development is the goal, our framework is skeptical about so-called tradeoffs in development policy. Changes in trade outcomes need to be evaluated on the extent to which they promote one aspect at the expense of others, with the recognition that such tradeoffs generally represent a diminution of the whole. These basic elements of human development now provide the basis by which we can outline the different channels by which trade affects human development and, in turn, human development affects trade. 17 III. Trade Policy and the Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) As a practical plan to achieve the cumulated obligations assumed by Governments in the series of United Nations-sponsored World Summits since the 1980s, UN member countries declared their commitment to the Millennium Development Goals in September 2000. MDGs provide specific minimum targets to be met by the global community at specified dates. It has become customary for individual countries to seek to meet the global targets at the national level. These targets represent a concrete approach toward ensuring that sustainability, equity, productivity and empowerment are steadily realised. For example, by committing to halve poverty by 2015, countries need to make significant progress in productivity, equity and empowerment. By seeking to reduce child and maternal mortality, global authorities oblige themselves to maintain the postwar rates of improvement in these life indicators and achieve sustainability. The MDGs constitute eight Goals, which have been articulated into18 targets. Within these targets are 48 indicators, adopted by a consensus of experts from the United Nations Secretariat and IMF, OECD and the World Bank to measure progress towards the Goals (see Table 1). Under Goal 1, \u201cEradicate extreme poverty and hunger,\u201d for example, are two targets: (1) Halve, between 1980 and 2015, the proportion of people whose income is less than $1 a day and (2) Halve, between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of people who suffer from hunger. Some of the specific indicators for this Goal are the proportion of the population living below $1 per day, the share of the poorest quintile in national consumption, the prevalence of underweight children younger than 5 and the proportion of the population below the minimum level of dietary energy consumption. Other Goals are similarly broken out into targets and indicators (Table 1). 18 | People, Trade and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific Three6 economic variables play a key mediating role in achieving the MDGs: (1) economic growth, (2) employment, and (3) public sector capabilities. In turn, it is important to consider the acute impact that trade policy and international trade rules have on these three mediating variables and directly on the targets, where applicable. The key argument we make in this section is that countries should align their trade policies toward achieving the MDGs. One argument is that the MDGs are a state commitment, like existing state commitments on human rights. The more persuasive argument for aligning trade policies to MDGs is that if trade outcomes persistently undermine growth, employment and public sector capabilities, insisting on achieving MDGs (because of the manner in which they are defined) will amount to implementing social policies to make up for the toll \u2013 the negative impacts \u2013 that trade policies are inflicting. With the \u201cwrong\u201d trade policies, MDG-motivated policies can turn out to be either a very costly proposition, even if funded by international donors, or a Sisyphean effort of undoing harmful human development impacts from trade. It is useful to quickly explain the channels between these mediating variables \u2013 economic growth, employment and public sector capabilities \u2013 and achievement of the MDGs. In our view, public sector \u201ccapability\u201d is the aggregate of revenue capability, expenditure capacity and efficiency, as well as the technical and managerial capacities of public sector workers. The steady and positive movements in economic growth, employment and public sector capabilities are a necessary, albeit not sufficient, 6 Income distribution could be listed as a fourth intervening economic variable. However, given the practical and political constraints impinging on publicly led redistributive policies, income distribution is the outcome of the interaction among growth, employment and public resources in most medium-term situations. For example, high economic growth with poor employment growth, or even reductions in employment absorption, will worsen the income distribution.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ad122e3f-3768-4435-964d-c4b015b4208b": {"__data__": {"id_": "ad122e3f-3768-4435-964d-c4b015b4208b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/people-trade-and-development-learning-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "People, Trade, and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/people-trade-and-development-learning-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a4594a981eedc25727614be034462003e02128d0c5dbee12c63e91a729f31e03"}, "3": {"node_id": "b9a689e8-711c-4b79-bf67-b9fbd36ead2b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/people-trade-and-development-learning-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "32449b935a62c7be7b41b776049268d6401751c07e2b77203e6f7b53464c8fcb"}}, "hash": "e39a4aa851c56543d7f9d562180bcf218924fe539e1a434ccdbae24c0fd74514", "text": "Reduced public resources for education and health can worsen income distribution in the subsequent generation. 19 condition for meeting Goals 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The steady improvement of household incomes among the poor is a necessary condition to meeting Goal 1, the halving of poverty and hunger. The reduction in household poverty and hunger is a critical ingredient in meeting Goal 2 (achieving universal primary education), Goal 4 (reducing child mortality), and Goal 5 (improving maternal health). Improved household incomes and livelihood opportunities ensure that children go to school and that adequate nutrition sustains mothers and their children. In poor countries, the third mediating variable, public sector capabilities in partnership with private provision (the latter being itself dependent on growth in private incomes), is important in maintaining schools to provide primary education and access to health facilities to reduce child mortality and improve maternal health. Public health, infrastructure are themselves critical to Goal 6 (combating HIV/AIDs, malaria and other diseases). Improving incomes and adequate public sector capability are needed to meet Goal 7 (ensuring environmental sustainability) since environmental distress reflects externalities that markets cannot address and therefore require social intervention and often the outcome of the poor exploiting unpriced assets to which they have physical access. This leaves Goal 3 (promoting gender equality and empowering women) and Goal 8 (developing a global partnership for development). Promoting gender equality requires public and social advocacy, intervention and regulation, which may or may not be dependent on our three mediating variables. While more resources will facilitate the achievement of gender equality, societies need to address gender concerns in more direct ways. A growing body of research exists on the gendered impact of trade liberalisation7. That export-oriented industrialisation in many developing countries has led to an increase in women\u2019s participation in the labour force is a 7 There is extensive literature on this issue; see \u00c7a atay and Ert\u00fcrk (2004) for a review. 20 | People, Trade and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific stylised fact8. However, it is also well-established that women\u2019s employment is either concentrated in cheap manufactured goods sectors or in the informal labour force in these countries. In many export procesing zones (EPZs), where the majority of workers are women, the nature of employment is characterised by flexibility of labour contracts and longer working hours, along with low wages in unhealthy working conditions (UN 1999; Standing 1989, 1999)9. Particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where a majority of the population earns its livelihood from agricultural production, an overwhelming majority of small farmers are women and agricultural liberalisation has had adverse impacts on their livelihoods (Fontana et al. 1998, pp.17-19). In many developing countries, men tend to engage in production of cash crops while women engage in subsistence crops, including tending the home garden. As a result, trade liberalisation, which raises incomes from cash crops, tends to widen the economic and social achievement gap between women and men (Williams 2003, p. 66). Gender-asymmetric impacts10 of trade expansion have diverse implications across countries and regions. These impacts are conditional on the interaction between gender inequalities and trade and production arrangements. While in some cases gender inequalities places limits on 8 See Berik (2000) for a contrasting case in point. Taiwanese export-oriented manufacturing after 1980 showed a decline in women\u2019s employment and coincided with an increase in gender wage inequality. This study discusses the impact on gender wage inequality of Taiwan\u2019s restructuring during this period. While higher capital intensity, induced by export orientation in Taiwan over the period, improved both men\u2019s and women\u2019s wages, Berik (2000, p. 7-9) finds that a disproportionate number of women, compared to men, lost their jobs. The shift toward salaried jobs improved men\u2019s wages while reducing the wages of women. 9 On the other hand, in the developed countries, increased trade has gone hand-in-hand with a decline observed in women\u2019s employment in the manufacturing sector (Kucera and Milberg, (2000, p.18)). 10 See \u00c7a atay (2001) for a comprehensive discussion on the relationship between trade and gender inequalities and poverty. 21 increasing in exports, in other cases they become an instrument of international competitiveness (\u00c7agatay 2001, p.33).

The study also adds that if rich countries are serious about their commitment to the MDGs, they need to demonstrate this commitment through trade policies more conducive to development. Given that there is no direct relationship between trade and economic growth and also between trade and poverty reduction, one has to consider that any change in trade rules promising higher growth which ignores the complex interactions among the three would have adverse impacts, particularly on poor people. High tariff rates in the United States and Canada in the textiles and clothing sector, and on agricultural products in the EU and Japan, put people who are dependent on these sectors in the developing world at a disadvantage (Stern 2003, p. 2-3). Reducing agricultural protection \u2013 including trade-distorting tariffs, quotas, other export subsidies and anti-development tariff escalation and tariff peaks \u2013 is a most important development intervention on the part of developed countries. Some estimates even emphasise how crucial these tariff reductions would be on the developing countries\u2019 side: Phasing out 11 See Keklik (2003) for a discussion on the modalities of impact assessments of international trade. 22 | People, Trade and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific these measures would attract new investment and lead to increases in income of US$150 - $400 billion in developing countries in the five years after completing the reforms (Stern 2003, p.5). Critical steps towards this goal include the full conversion of production subsidies to income subsidies, along with the conversion of specific duties and tariff rate quotas to more transparent ad valorem tariffs. This would promote investment in export industries of developing countries. Strong efforts by industrial countries in tariff reduction in non- agricultural goods would provide access to developing countries currently subject to anti-development tariff peaks, escalation and quotas. Processed foods are particular victims of anti-development tariff escalation: Chilean fresh tomatoes come into the United States with a 2.8 percent duty; if the same tomatoes are dried and packaged, they pay 8.9 percent; however, salsa and ketchup exports into the United States pay an 11.6 percent tariff. While the tariff on cocoa beans in the EU is 0.5 percent, the tariff on chocolate is more than 30 percent. Labour-intensive manufacturers such as exporters of cotton T-shirts from China to the United States face similar escalation. To achieve the promise of the Doha Development Round, each country must take up its part of global responsibility to development. So far, the signs do not give cause for optimism. The other targets under Goal 8, which deal with the external debt problems of developing countries, are directly related to our three mediating variables \u2013 economic growth, employment and public sector capabilities \u2013 but are only tangentially related to trade, which is the focus of this paper. The results of recent research on trade policy need to be interpreted in terms of the potential impact of trade policy on MDGs. Trade liberalisation, or any other policy to increase the dependence of growth on external trade, has not been neutral across skills levels, gender and regions. Trade liberalisation usually benefits those with skills and capital, 23 which in most instances are beyond the capabilities of the poor (Vandermoortele 2003, p.11). For this reason, trade liberaliasation, in conjunction with stabilisation programmes that tend to curb the public sector\u2019s ability to boost demand and maintain social programmes, tend to leave the poor worse off. In many cases, the impact on the poor can be permanent, since trade liberalisation is intended to change permanently the kinds of sectors where different workers can participate economically. The impact is on the employment opportunities of the poorer segments of the population. Increased dependence on trade for growth also has often meant surges of imports, including those agricultural products on which many of the poor depend on their livelihood. Because of agricultural subsidies in industrial economies, these imports undercut domestic farm prices. A 2003 study states that 1.3 million Mexican farmers have lost their livelihoods after NAFTA took effect, a regional trade agreement that from Mexico\u2019s point of view constituted an accelerated process of liberalisation with two neighbouring industrial economies (Carnegie Endowment for International Peace 2003, p. 19). About 8.1 million in Mexico\u2019s active labour force worked in the agriculture sector in 1993; at the end of 2002, it was roughly 6.8 million. The report states that, though the total loss may not be attributed to NAFTA, \u201c(A)gricultural trade liberalisation linked to NAFTA is the signal most significant factor in the loss of agricultural jobs in Mexico\u201d (Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 2003, p. 20) Precipitous", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da8e0176-9061-49ca-8d25-3c5bf420a192": {"__data__": {"id_": "da8e0176-9061-49ca-8d25-3c5bf420a192", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/people-trade-and-development-learning-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "People, Trade, and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/people-trade-and-development-learning-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6f35ff2e45f7388b8c8aa564cbe4b6c96a29fd532d6b99a6df4a64bc5d3e2694"}}, "hash": "6f35ff2e45f7388b8c8aa564cbe4b6c96a29fd532d6b99a6df4a64bc5d3e2694", "text": "import openings likewise have drastic impacts on transition economies. Table 2 presents indices of key production sectors in Mongolia for the years 1989-1998. Since 1989, real production have been reduced to almost nil in key sectors, including those for which Mongolia might have been expected to have a comparative advantage, such as woolen fabric, overcoats and suits. After liberalisation, the only sectors that have significantly increased are those related to mining and the export of bird feathers. Outputs from the mining sector and commodity 24 | People, Trade and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific production, including bird feathers, have export markets. However, these sectors do not tend to absorb much employment in comparison to other kinds of products. These also do not lend themselves easily to broader production linkages with other sectors or to increased skill upgrading (\u201clearning by doing\u201d). It is not difficult to understand the impact on employment, the second key mediating variable, as a result of the drive for efficiency and productivity in Mongolia. Meeting MDG targets in such an economy will require a recovery of employment. At the macroeconomic level, import surges have tended to cause debt buildup and balance-of-payments crises. In most countries, such crises have hurt the poor and middle classes, who are unable to shift their assets out of the domestic currency. These crises also have led to additional fiscal stringency and cutbacks in social programmes. Trade reform and liberalisation have a direct link to public sector capability12 through reductions in trade tax revenue, which often are the largest and most reliable source of revenue in poor countries. Several theoretical studies find that tariff revenues increase with liberalisation if the initial tariff rate is higher than its revenue-maximizing level or if quantitative restrictions are replaced by tariffs so Governments capture the quota rents13; however, empirical evidence barely support these analyses. Baunsgaard and Keen (2004), using panel data covering 125 countries, find that while rich countries have been able to find other sources of revenues to make up for lost trade taxes, middle-income countries have recovered only 35 to 55 cents of revenue for every dollar lost from trade taxes, low-income countries have recovered almost none. By undercutting tax revenues, trade liberalisation creates vulnerabilities in public expenditure and capabilities that are necessary to meet Goals 2, 12 Morales (2005) reviews the different channels by which different aspects of trade reform affect fiscal policy. 13 See Winters et al. (2004, p. 104-105) for an extensive review of theoretical and empirical literature on this issue. 25 4, 5, 6 and 7. Counting only revenue losses as the sole cost of these tariff reductions would definitely underestimate actual possible losses. Revenue losses may be compensated by tax increases or by tightening Government budgets. However, the process of these compensations does not usually take into account their diverse impacts on different groups of constituents. These differential impacts usually conform to the vulnerabilities and deprivation among the marginalised and the poor14. Moreover, the hardening of intellectual property protections through trade sanctions under bilateral and regional trade agreements and under the World Trade Organization\u2019s Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) regime has raised the cost of essential medicine and imposes additional pressures on public sector capability. As emphasised in the previous section, trade policy and international trade rules have a crucial impact on human development. A serious commitment in achieving MDGs demands not only serious reform of trade policies of rich countries, but it also calls for a rethinking of prevailing approaches to development strategy in poor countries, which have tended to emphasise efficiency over growth, employment and public sector capability. Without such a rethinking, MDG programmes can become a technique for treating the symptoms of low growth, unemployment or jobless growth, or deteriorating public sector capability. The alternative is to redesign trade and macroeconomic policies so that they (1) do not risk any backsliding on MDG levels already achieved and (2) increase the probability of progressively achieving MDG targets. This is a preventative approach, if not an explicitly developmental one. MDGs provide specific measurable targets and indicators that can be monitored and linked up analytically to growth, employment and public sector capability. The interaction of these three variables with trade 14 See Elson and \u00c7a atay (2000) for a discussion on social content of macroeconomic policies. 26 | People, Trade and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific policies can, in turn, be understood in order to devise trade policies that achieve the MDGs.

Trade Liberalisation, Growth and Investment In this section, we would like to analyse trends in trade, growth and investment to reflect on the relationship of trade to development. We will also compare the Asian experience against that of other regions and draw lessons from these contrasts. Beginning in the 1980s, successive waves of trade liberalisation swept across developed and developing countries as elements of economic reform programs. This new policy emphasis in many countries consisted of an integrated mix of the dismantling of quantitative restrictions and foreign exchange allocation, the closure of state trading companies, and tariff reduction. Trade policy in the form of import liberalisation effectively replaced industrial policy16, and before the subsequent emphasis on pro-poor policies constituted the sum total of development strategy. The overriding principle of the new approach was that investment should be conditioned on the \u201cright prices.\u201d Only investment undertaken in response to the \u201cright prices\u201d would prove sustainable in the long run and independent of public subsidies. Import quotas, foreign exchange allocations, and high tariffs, not to mention direct government investment in production activities, distort the prices under which investment had been carried out in the past. The new approach sought a thoroughgoing restructuring of domestic industries toward those that would be internationally competitive and self-financing. This required attention to two issues: First, there was the question of the sequencing of the trade reforms and the length of period of adjustment; second, there was the question of whether investment would indeed respond to the new price structure. There are a number of studies in the literature exploring the question of what kind of liberalisation is better for economic growth. Among others, 16 See Greenaway (1993) for a review of the policy interventions. 36 | People, Trade and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific Berg et al. (1999) analyses the evolution of output and finds that faster liberalisation is better for growth. Faster adjustment provides additional impulse to growth (Berg et.al. 1996, p. 52), confirming the results of earlier studies on countries of the former Soviet Union (De Melo et al. 1996, p. 27; Aslund 1996, p. 304-305; Sachs 1996, p. 133). In the well- known debate about shock therapy versus gradualist of adjustment process, these authors argue in favor of rapid liberalisation. The analytical justification for rapid liberalisation leaned heavily on political considerations \u2013 that gradual liberalisation, while theoretically justified, could be undermined by powerful constituencies that would be hurt by liberalisation. The political counterargument was that gradual liberalisation sustained a constituency for reform. Theorising about the gradualist approach to liberalisation basically emerged from the unfavourable outcomes of actual transition experiences in former socialist countries. Lau, Qian and Roland (2000, p. 120-124), in considering the Chinese experience, construct a theoretical model of gradual market liberalisation. They specify a dual-track pricing mechanism approach for implementing an efficient Pareto-improving transition without losers. Their proposition is consistent with institutionalist approaches to economics, drawing attention to the importance of institutions in development. The basic argument in this literature brings to the fore that institutions matter; that institutions change incrementally, and because change is path-dependent, Governments that do not have full information about the path would be better off implementing reforms gradually17. Other studies consider the issue of the impact of external liberalisation on poverty reduction. Dollar (2001) argues that the only developing 17 Sachs, Woo and Yang (2000, p.13) provide a counter argument that states that information on the most efficient institutions are already out there via evolution in advanced countries, so latecomers should mimic these in an optimal period to reduce losses within a particular political environment.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "25fede28-15d7-4957-ad29-5b89411ff6b9": {"__data__": {"id_": "25fede28-15d7-4957-ad29-5b89411ff6b9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/people-trade-and-development-learning-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "People, Trade, and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/people-trade-and-development-learning-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ec90cd776fc81952ae0f76cc7f1585124c3ff5ce7c73e3514de9b2a8f47df416"}, "2": {"node_id": "3f207150-b488-4d1d-923c-8f94f2f85e1a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/people-trade-and-development-learning-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "73a557eaa52185861934ca11e4ee4c7d4a5c983fee935a0fdb4bb33e252a592d"}}, "hash": "c9b6d8a92bb171a83107047c4a942cf3577e53f3e2f2547943d6a4ab020fea20", "text": "37 countries that show faster growth and significant reduction in poverty \u2013 i.e., income poverty \u2013 are those that also have performed faster trade and investment liberalisation.

This unequalising impact intensified in 1980s and 1990s (Wade 2001, p. 8). Milanovic (2004) also finds adverse impacts of openness on the poor, by evaluating the impact on relative income shares of high and low deciles. This study argues that openness is only good for middle- and high-income countries, where the relative income of the poor and the middle class rises compared to the rich (Milanovic 2004, p. 13). The expected next question is: Does an unequal distribution of income have an impact on economic growth? Inequality generates the risk of contraining the growth of even the rich countries. A 2001 ILO paper suggests both theoretically and empirically that income distribution matters for growth associated with poverty reduction and that income distribution in turn matters for growth. The authors argue that when \u2018Growth is neutral to income distribution,\u2019 growth per se is not sufficient to reduce income inequality. They also find that: 1) greater distributional equality provides a favourable \u201cinitial condition\u201d for rapid and sustainable growth; 2) redistribution of current income and assets, or redistribution of an economy\u2019s growth increment, is the most effective form of poverty reduction for most countries; and 3) the mechanisms to achieve the redistributions are feasible for most countries. (Dagdeviren et al. 2001, p. 23). The study lists a policy agenda based on the model that 38 | People, Trade and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific includes progressive taxation, transfer payments, human resource development and country-specific infrastructure and public works policies (Dagdeviren et al. 2001, pp. 19-22). Given these unsettled debates, it would be helpful to look at the East Asian countries\u2019 experiences termed as \u201cEast Asian miracle\u201d in more depth. Lessons from a \u201csuccessful\u201d integration to the world economy also may give some idea on how to exploit potential interlinkages between trade liberalisation, growth and investment, in order to achieve economic development alongside human development goals. East Asia\u2019s Strategic Integration East Asia\u2019s Strategic Integration East Asia\u2019s Strategic Integration East Asia\u2019s Strategic Integration East Asia\u2019s Strategic Integration In East Asia, success in export-oriented industrialisation drew an increasing proportion of the labour force into manufacturing and depended on steadily improving agricultural productivity. Increased light manufacturing exports permitted a steady improvement in the conditions of work, especially in rural areas. As globalisation expanded in the 1980s, many Asian countries succeeded in drawing in assembly and low-skill export-oriented production to absorb domestic labour. Since the 1990s, this approach to international economic integration has become the norm. This approach can be contrasted with the earlier East Asia approach, which sought a strategic integration and steady improvements in livelihood and productivity for workers. Because this alternative strategy relies heavily on the attraction of low labour costs, increased competition among countries for foreign investment has seen the weakening of labour protections, especially in export processing zones, where enterprises tend to rely heavily on female labour. Trade liberalisation though enhanced women\u2019s employment opportunities coincided with wage discrimination against women, even in East Asia (Taiwan, Republic of Korea) because of increasing competition from international trade (Berik et al. 2004, p. 17). Beyond this fact, evidence also exists on liberalisation providing strong incentives to keep women\u2019s wages comparatively lower in order to attract foreign 39 direct investment and be competitive in international markets. Braunstein and Epstein (2002), looking at China\u2019s export processing zones, demonstrate this fact. These findings suggest the importance of a gendered analysis of wage inequality and underline the fact that the gender impacts of trade liberalisation provide a different and rarely told dimension of the East Asian miracle. It is also important to point out a key analytical difference between the East Asian strategy and the standard economic theory (often referred to as the Hecksher Ohlin Samuelson model), which has laid the basis for the strategy of low labou costs as the strategy for international economic integration.

The model has nothing to say about changes in total employment, which is an exogenous variable. The East Asian approach wrestled with the issue of raising total employment and productivity simultaneously. East Asian countries sought to eliminate poverty instead of positioning the economy for growth by sustaining it18. For this purpose, the strategy deployed industries that would temporarily be inefficient by world standards as long as it absorbed labour, especially from agriculture, where labour 18 For an alternative view, see Seguino (2000). Her empirical analysis, based on a data set of middle-income semi-industrialised economies with varying degrees of export orientation, indicates that across countries, and over time within countries, there is a positive link between gender wage inequality and growth. Gender-wage inequality works as a stimulating factor for investment (Seguino 2000, p.1221-23). 40 | People, Trade and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific working with fixed resources had low productivity. In surveying the application of the standard model during the age of trade liberalisation, Hoekman and Winters (2005) find that as predicted by the standard model, there are indeed no significant increases in total employment in liberalising countries, even as there is scattered evidence of efficiency gains. Trade is also associated with increased wage and income inequality within countries through two channels: (1) increased pressure for technological upgrading to attain international competitiveness, which tends to bid up the wages of skilled labour and (2) the (implicit) expansion of the unskilled pool of labour as more poor countries contribute their labour supply in worldwide production activities (Wood 1995, 1997). It is possible that the impact of trade liberalisation on wage inequality is peculiar to poorer countries, i.e., countries that have incomes below the world median income. Milanovic and Squire (2005) find that tariff reduction leads to higher inter-occupational (i.e., skill or education) premiums and inter-industry inequality in poorer countries. The Interaction of Investment and Trade Liberalisation The Interaction of Investment and Trade Liberalisation The Interaction of Investment and Trade Liberalisation The Interaction of Investment and Trade Liberalisation The Interaction of Investment and Trade Liberalisation It is estimated that two-thirds of achieved liberalisation was undertaken by countries on a unilateral basis, as opposed to a reciprocal manner with other countries. Tables 3 and 4 summarise trends in tariff averages for developing countries since the 1980s, for both unweighted and weighted averages respectively. Trade liberalisation involved not only tariff reductions, but also involved the dismantling of quantitative restrictions and the dismantling of state trading companies. Tariff changes therefore are an incomplete accounting of the extent of trade opening. Nevertheless, both tables indicate a clear and strong trend toward more liberalised trade worldwide since 1980. South, East, and Southeast Asia had the highest (weighted) average tariffs at the start of period and in the most recent period have an average tariff lower than other regions. In 2000, North Africa and Central America and the Caribbean exhibited the 41 highest average tariffs. Tables 3 and 4 suggest that Asian countries have liberalised as much as the rest of the world. Tables 5 and 6 present the trends of foreign trade share in GDP, as export and import shares respectively. While export shares in all regions in the world increased in the 1990s compared to the 1960s and 1970s, South, East and Southeast Asia display the highest change (Table 5). Table 5 also shows how crucial has been in the 1990s for countries in South, East and Southeast Asia, excluding China. Export share in GDP is as high as 43 percent in that decade (Table 5). The same tendency also is observed in import shares (Table 6). Again, South, East and Southeast Asia register the highest increases in the last three decades and, excluding China, trade volume comprised almost 85 percent of GDP in the region. While the volume of trade, i.e., the sum of exports and imports , as a share of GDP increased by 20 percent in the world (from 35 percent to 42 percent) in South, East and Southeast Asia, trade volume expanded its share to more than six times higher than world trade (31 percent to 73 percent) (Tables 5 and 6). Following extensive liberalisation policies, trade has become the dominant proportion of income worldwide.

The era of trade liberalisation coincided with lower economic growth rates in most regions and most countries (see Tables 7 and 8). For many countries, 1980 represents a watershed year. World per-capita GDP growth declined from 2.2 percent in the 1970s to 1.7 percent in the 1980s \u2013 and to zero in the 1990s (Table 7). These trends are confirmed in real GDP growth rates in Table 8. One element in the world average is the drastic fall in economic growth rates in Central and Eastern Europe during the chaotic transition away from central planning in the 1990s; however, in the 1980s these countries still experienced growth. Since the 1980s, Africa follows the worldwide decline in growth in overall GDP and in per-capita GDP. Latin America (grouped under \u201cAmerica\u201d in Tables 7 and 8, consisting of Central America, the Caribbean and South America), experienced a drastic decline in growth in the 1980s, the region\u2019s lost decade of the debt crisis; it has not recovered the growth rates of earlier periods. Per-capita growth rates in Asia contradict the overall trend and explain the recovery of per-capita growth rates for developing countries as a whole. The last row of Table 7 indicates that, without China\u2019s growth rates, Asia\u2019s growth rates also would exhibit a decline, albeit a more modest one. For Africa and Latin America in particular, the period of trade liberalisation has been associated with markedly reduced growth rates. Trade reforms in these regions were undertaken within broader reform efforts, which included privatisation and deregulation. Moreover, many countries in these two regions experienced balance-of-payments crises, debt restructuring and fiscal policy compression. During the same period, most Asian economies also were undergoing the same thoroughgoing policy reform processes, but for the most part, avoided the macroeconomic crises that accompanied these policy shifts in the other 49 regions. The one exception was the Asian financial crises, induced by capital account liberalisation, which swept through Southeast Asia and the Republic of Korea in 1997-98, from which the affected countries have now recovered. In searching for a proximate explanation for the different experience during the period of trade liberalisation/expansion, changes in the rate of investment suggest themselves. The 1980s package of reforms were oriented to expanding the role of the private sector in the economy, responding to improved price signals as a result of the dismantling of distortionary state policies. Investment rates not only have a direct and short-term impact on growth, but these also should reflect the efficacy of relying more heavily on the private sector in developmental terms.",

Among all developing countries, investment ratios fell somewhat, from 20.1 percent in the 1970s to 18.3 percent in the 1990s. There are, however, distinct contrasts between regions. African investment rates, which were not very high in the first place, fell from 14.7 percent in the 1970s to 8.4 percent in the 1990s. Latin American investment rates fell from 22.6 percent to 16.4 percent between the 1970s and 1990s. Asia is the only region, except for the grouping of developed countries, in which there is an increase in the investment ratio. It is critical to work out the nexus between the buildup in the external sector and investment in the Asian context. Aky\u00fcz (1999) emphasises the key role that domestic savings out of profits play. Exports and domestic investment provide the income growth that generates the profits. These profits can then be reinvested in response to the demand stimulus from exports and domestic investment themselves. However, there is no guarantee that higher profits from trade expansion would stimulate significantly higher domestic investment; this is how Rodrik (1999) interprets the case of Chile and Turkey in the 1980s. The state certainly has a role in securing property rights and preventing the buildup of macroeconomic imbalances that lead to economic crises. In the East Asian case, however, the state had a critical role in encouraging the mobilisation of super-normal profits (rents) and providing incentives to direct these to reinvestment (as opposed to consumption) and export production expansion. As Weiss (2005, p. 14) explains: Of the countries concerned, aspects of industrial policy were found in all cases except Hong Kong, China, with the most extensive set of interventions in Republic of Korea and Taipei, China; the least in Singapore, with Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia falling somewhere in between. The result in all cases was that profitability in manufacturing 52 | People, Trade and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific was raised relative to services and in most cases also relative to agriculture. This is far from unusual, since it is the standard outcome under import substitution regimes. The state\u2019s role went beyond securing property rights; it involved providing a secure environment for private investment into manufacturing and export expansion. The state becomes a key player in the operation of an \u201caccumulation regime\u201d (Liepitz 1998, p. 23), which can coordinate the restructuring of production through investment. While the classic Asian tigers were paragons of accumulation, the examples are not only historical. The current structural transformations occurring in China in the context of high growth partake of the same type of process and, by some interpretations, amount to no less than capitalist development (McNally 2004). In East Asia, \u201cgetting prices right\u201d has not been as important as expanding markets and growing investment. Public investment as a share of GDP for selected countries confirms positively these propositions. While in the 1980s public investment as a share of GDP shows huge declines in Argentina, Chile and Turkey; figures indicate increases in the Republic of Korea, Malaysia and Thailand (Table 10). Among others, Argentina\u2019s public investment ratio recorded the highest fall (46 percent) in the 1980s compared to the 1970s (from 9.11 percent to 4.90 percent).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a56e8b94-b018-4710-91da-6fa1727f52a6": {"__data__": {"id_": "a56e8b94-b018-4710-91da-6fa1727f52a6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/people-trade-and-development-learning-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "People, Trade, and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/people-trade-and-development-learning-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ea73824b3dfb9ce75f70d45e3b7dc71f3eeaa35a2c524a2b1bedb1048afdea12"}, "2": {"node_id": "60028bff-7c0e-4a59-b887-563ecfff2673", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/people-trade-and-development-learning-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8753fd57690ed9968b843bf1ac10e851fafc02fd59e4cef5bb128a5769ef9e22"}}, "hash": "c0685d550daa3b94ac2331702ce48f239f3819e66233ab29d01cbad4e69f52bb", "text": "For Chile and Turkey, concurrent declines are 38 percent and 11 percent respectively.

This role was not just in expanding the volume of exports solely, but also in policies aimed at progressive changes in the composition of export goods via technological upgrading and higher productivity levels. The share of capital goods in total exports supports these arguments. As seen in Figure 1, while in the late 1970s the annual average share of capital goods exports in total exports was lower than 5 percent in Thailand, around 10 percent in Malaysia and almost 20 percent in the Republic of Korea, by 2000 the figures increased dramatically, to higher than 30, 50 and 45 percent respectively. Similarly, in China, on average, around 8 percent of total exports were capital goods in the 1980s, which increased to more than 20 percent in 1990s. Furthermore, in the first half of the current decade the shares in all countries register much higher figures: more than 40 percent in Thailand, almost 60 percent in Malaysia, more than 60 percent in the Republic of Korea, and almost 40 percent in China. Thus, we can safely argue, as Figure 1 confirms, that countries in East 54 | People, Trade and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific Asia successfully shifted their exports to high-value added capital goods \u2013 i.e., intermediate goods \u2013 particularly in the 1990s, following strategic trade and industrial policies applied in the 1960s and 1970s. On the other hand, when we compare the figures in selected East Asian countries with Argentina, Chile or Turkey, we notice that more than 90 percent of total exports are non-capital goods in the 1980s. Capital goods shares show a rise in theh 1990s, but go beyond 10 percent only slightly in Argentina and Turkey, whereas they barely reach 6 percent of total exports in Chile. From 2000 to 2004, among the three only Turkey registers a higher figure (24 percent). We observe almost no change in this millennium compared to the 1990s in the cases of Chile and Argentina.

For instance, in Malaysia almost 40 percent of manufacturing exports by the end of the 1980s were high-technology products. Thailand and the Republic of Korea follow, at 18 and 17 percent respectively, whereas in Turkey the share was only 1.6 percent over the same years. One reason is that in Turkey an export-oriented regime was launched only in 1980. In the 1990s, the Republic of Korea and Thailand showed around a 30 percent increase compared to the 1980s and rose to 24 and 25 percent respectively. Over the same period, more than 45 percent of manufacturing exports were high-technology exports in Malaysia. Again, Turkey registers a very low figure, around 2 percent. Chile and Argentina followed Turkey at 3 and 6 percent. Compared to East Asian countries, these figures are too low. Almost all manufacturing exports were low-technology, labour-intensive goods, although these countries also fully liberalised their trade regimes at the beginning of the last decade. In considering the years between 2000 and 2003, China\u2019s high- technology exports share exhibits a big jump and more than doubles, to 22 percent from around 10 percent. The largest change after China was observed in the Turkish economy, which increased to almost 4 percent, yet still low in comparison to Malaysia (58 percent), Thailand (32 percent) and the Republic of Korea (32 percent). In Argentina and Chile, the corresponding figures are 9 and 4 percent respectively. Thus, Figures 1 and 2 demonstrate clearly the East Asian economies\u2019 strategy aimed at expanding exports, but these countries also achieved higher productivity via technological upgrading in their export sectors. The composition of export goods has changed drastically in Malaysia, the Republic of Korea, Thailand since the end of 1980s and, more recently, in China. In contrast to East Asian countries, other developing economies that also completed 57 liberalisation in the mid-1980s were locked into low-technology export products. A key distinguishing characteristic of East Asian economies has been the states\u2019 active trade and industrial strategy. Yet export-oriented regimes were launched with state interventions in other developing countries as well. Thus, a broader examination is required to evaluate the structural differences. The East Asian strategy cannot be seen as a major success in isolation to the characteristics of the international economic environment in which it occurred. Moreover, it would be ahistorical to derive easy lessons from East Asian experience. Nevertheless, we believe comparisons reveal at least what a strategic industrial policy is and what it is not. Also, emphasising crucial factors in success stories might be the first step for new successes. On the other hand, the East Asian strategy might be an appropriate reference point to assess the relative failures of other strategies, or those cases of no strategy. There is room for developing countries to replicate the strategy in a different form, depending on specific structural characteristics of their economies and international opportunities, if they are willing to seriously consider a more active role for the state. The success of the East Asian strategy relied upon rapid industrialisation and higher export potential and, hence, higher rates of economic growth. This brings us to a critical point: Is a strategic industrial policy enough for growth? This type of economic transformation does not guarantee that human development outcomes will be attained. What about the quality of growth? The East Asian economies, and recently China, had the starting advantage of high literacy and educational attainment at the start of growth. The Republic of Korea, meanwhile, is well known for its enormous investment in education during its growth process. Public spending per primary school-age student in Korea increased more than tenfold 58 | People, Trade and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific between 1970 and 1995 (Thomas et.al. 2000, p. 69-70). In 1995, 17 percent of GDP per capita was allocated to primary education spending. Considering the large number of students in primary schools, it would not be an overstatement to argue that even this figure underestimates the amount of public expenditure in education, particularly in primary education (tertiary education was mainly supported by private investment). More than 60 percent of total spending to education was allocated to primary education (Thomas et.al. 2000, p. 68). The report also notes that in the Republic Korea, households assume a 30 to 50 percent share of total expenditure for educational costs (Thomas et.al. 2000, p. 68-69). In this regard, as in the nexus between trade and investment, the role of the state has been indispensable in sustaining social expenditures. 59 V.

In many countries, the textile quota system confirmed and rigidified a production system in which, except for the contribution of low-cost labour, all other inputs were imported and very little attention was paid to increasing the domestic value contribution to exported goods or breaking out of the ruinous competition for international buyers seeking low-cost production. The elimination of the quota system at the end of 2004 is a watershed event for Asia\u2019s developing countries. Countries that had domestic capability to compete internationally or had built such a capacity during the quota period were expected to maintain or even increase their international participation in the sector. Countries whose only advantage had been in the provision of low-cost labour would lose their textile and 19 This section draws heavily from UNDP Asia Trade Initiative (2005). 60 | People, Trade and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific garment industries. Most especially disadvantaged are the Least Developed Countries, such as Bangladesh, Lao PDR and Nepal; these countries are doubly disadvantaged by the fact that their domestic markets are too small to support further investment in the industry. Other countries, such as the Philippines, which never developed an integrated capacity to produce textiles and garments, had been losing international market share even before the quota elimination (Jocson- Agoncillo 2004); the end of quotas is expected to only hasten the demise of these sectors. The losers are countries that relied only on their low labour costs to integrate internationally. Within these countries, female workers are particularly disadvantaged since they had been winners under the strategy of low labour costs. The gainers are countries that used the period of low-cost exports to invest domestically in integrating production, upgrading capital inputs and labour productivity. The removal of quotas should lead to an overall increase in exports of textiles and clothing from Asian countries. The global market for imports of textiles and clothing could reach US$ 600 billion by 2015, even assuming a modest growth rate of 5.3 percent per year for the next 12 years in the clothing sector and an even smaller growth rate of 3.2 percent in textiles. Conditional on sustained competitiveness, most Asian countries, taken in aggregate, stand to claim a growing portion of this ever-increasing sector. However, it is feared that the elimination of the remaining quotas may lead to major shifts in trade and investment flows across regions, provoking a global wave of consolidated, large-scale production in fewer places, with wholesale buyers shrinking the number of countries as sources of imports and outsourcing arrangements. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce estimates the countries of major sourcing to drop to 50 percent of current levels in 2005 and to 25 per cent by 2010. Moreover, expectations of benefits and losses within Asia are unevenly 61 spread, the smaller countries with poorer infrastructure and higher input costs likely losing out to bigger players. To some extent, this fear is exaggerated, as the expanding global textile and clothing market could provide opportunities for all suppliers, including those selling at different price levels and those specialising in market niches. Countries like China and India are seen as the biggest gainers in the post-quota scenario if one looks at their current share of clothing exports to non-quota markets.

In responding to the difficulties generated by the elimination of textile quotas, clever adaptations of this kind of approach are necessary. Countries need to design strategies to consolidate their market access beyond their ability to contribute low- cost labour. Cambodia, for example, consolidated its access to external garment markets by setting up a system by which the Government certifies exporters based on standards designed in cooperation with the International Labor Organization. These certifications affirm that these exports were produced in factories that conform to international labour standards. With the expiration of quotas, key international buyers have actually increased their purchases from Cambodia, because it helps them avoid the \u201csweatshop\u201d label in advanced-country markets. Instead of selling Cambodia as a source of cheap labour, Cambodia has sold itself as a reliable, reasonable-cost supplier because it enhances labour rights. Countries should explore other strategies to remake themselves into the inescapable supplier. Branding, getting into the design and fashion aspects of the industry, and enhancing domestic value-added through industrial upgrading where feasible, need to be addressed now. In facing 62 | People, Trade and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific this problem, countries should take the view that the world market begins at home, that winning the world market requires winning the domestic market first, with quality goods at a reasonable price (a standard that also applies in world markets). And winning world markets only through cheap labour that cannot afford to consume what it produces is a strategy that is increasingly non-viable, at least in the textile and clothing sector. In taking seriously their home markets, Asian countries need to develop productive, income-earning livelihoods for all their workers. For certain countries, this will also require a withdrawal (if possible, orderly) from the textile and clothing sector altogether, so that their citizens can move to more stable, income-earning work in other industries. This kind of adjustment will require conscious efforts and resources among the Government, the private sector and labour. A domestic strategy is a sine qua non to an international diplomatic strategy. A key element of such an international strategy is the granting of preferential access to garment and textile exports from LDCs, a group of countries that already recognized by industrial economies as deserving of special treatment. Preferential access can alleviate the dislocation of employment and provide the resources for adjustment required by these countries that would otherwise have to be raised from meagre LDC incomes. Asian countries can pursue three general kinds of strategies: (1) measures to deepen international market access, (2) measures to foster domestic competitiveness and export performance, and (3) measures to mitigate the impact of quota elimination on human development. Under measures to deepen international market access, Asian LDCs in particular need to seize the moral ground and to obligate developed countries to provide duty- and quota-free access for all their exports. This request is part of a broader Doha Ministerial mandate that required that Special and Differential Treatment (SDT) become \u201cmore precise, effective and operational.\u201d There has been little movement in this regard, 63 however. LDCs need to succeed in enshrining special and differential treatment as a governing principle of the WTO, not merely as exceptions to the general rules, so that they can accept obligations that are commensurate with their stage of development. SDT should become legally binding through the dispute settlement mechanism of the WTO. Other appropriate measures include requiring tighter disciplines (narrower grounds) on the use of anti-dumping and countervailing duties; incorporating the textile and clothing sector in all Generalized System of Preference schemes; removing quota restraints on countries currently in the process of joining the WTO; and engaging in mutually beneficial regional integration efforts. To foster domestic competitiveness and export performance, countries can intensify their efforts to facilitate trade; ease the processes of importing intermediate inputs to export products; adopt measures to reduce input costs on power, transport and key raw materials; promote in-country knowledge and capabilities about markets; create investment funds and consolidate credit support for small- and medium-scale industries; enhance labour productivity; invest in nurturing reputation, brands and images; and obtain technical and financial assistance for trade facilitation from developed countries in accordance with their commitment on Goal 8 of the Millennium Development Goals.

If entry quotas were increased by 3 percent of OECD countries\u2019 labour force, the global welfare gains will be US $158 to $200 billion per year20. In assessing the potential contribution of the Movement of Natural Persons (MNP) to human development, one can examine the improved employment opportunities, and the value of remittances for communities and families as a means of poverty alleviation and as a source of investment funds for SMEs. Total remittances for developing countries from their nationals working abroad exceeded US$50 billion in 2001. For many Asian countries, the remittances of the temporary migrants represent an important part of the GDP: Sri Lanka (6 percent), Bangladesh (4 percent), as well as an increasing percentage of total exports (in 1999, remittances amounted to 21 percent of exports in India, and 29 percent in Bangladesh). For the men and women of the developing countries, temporary migration is an opportunity to dramatically increase their earnings (more when less skilled). By diversifying sources of income, remittances reduce the vulnerability of the poor communities to domestic economic crises. It increases the wages of those remaining at home, especially when there is a surplus labour force or when the wage sector itself is in decline. In procyclical sectors, such as construction, it would allow the movement of workers to growing markets when the home country is in crisis. Remittances also can feed the extended family safety nets, thus securing the sustainability of their human development and enhancing their access to health and education when those are relatively costly. Moreover, remittances can be used to finance small local businesses, which can have a big impact in local communities. Temporary migration also provides people with the opportunity to 20 IOM-OECD (2003). 65 upgrade their skills, providing their home country with new knowledgte after their return. MNP improves returning migrants\u2019 future employment opportunities and also contributes to the overall competitiveness of the country and its ability to attract investment. These new capabilities are not only limited to economic activities; they also can have a political content, since sojourns abroad expose migrants to new ideas and social arrangements, thus promoting community empowerment. A recent World Bank report examining Philippine households\u2019 responses finds that increases in remittances enhances \u201chuman capital\u201d accumulation and entrepreneurship in \u201corigin\u201d households (households from whence the foreign worker originates) and examines Philippine households' responses to overseas members' economic shocks21. In some sectors, the temporary migration is predominantly female, facilitating the empowerment of women members of their communities. MNP is often essential for increasing the capability of developing-country enterprises to participate in international trade in many dynamic service sectors. This is particularly true of labour-intensive sectors like tourism, professional and business services, audio-visual services, construction and sectors requiring unskilled workers, as well as for high-technology sectors such as software and energy services. Temporary migration also can have undesirable social effects that should be addressed at both the international and national levels. From a human development perspective, the negative effects of MNP can include brain drain, increasing social inequality, the social consequences of the separation of family members, and the exploitation and abuse of workers; these require corrective action through national policies or bilateral agreements. Potential negative effects would differ between countries 21 The results of the study suggests that positive income shocks to migrants\u2019 earnings, such as changes in exchange rates, lead to greater child schooling, reduced child labour and increased educational expenditure in origin households. More favourable exchange rate shocks also raise hours worked in self-employment and lead to greater entry into relatively capital-intensive enterprises by migrants\u2019 origin households (Yang 2005, p.29). 66 | People, Trade and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific depending on a variety of factors, including educational levels and cultural differences.

Brain drain would normally result from permanent migration and not MNP, as defined in GATS. However, individuals tend to migrate permanently in order to maintain the income gains achieved initially through MNP and to reduce the uncertainty created by stringent access systems that do not discriminate in favour of MNP versus permanent migration, thus promoting brain drain. In this sense, the interested parties should promote the establishment of a GATS visa, in order to ensure and facilitate temporary access to markets. There is also an important category of labour migration that partakes of forced labour, the most publicly discussed category of which is trafficking for sex work. The ILO estimates the number of global victims of forced labour to be 12.3 million (ILO 2005). Compared to the world population, this estimate implies that there are 2 victims of forced labour per 1,000 people. Compared to the global work force, the estimate corresponds to 4 persons per 1,000 workers. ILO (2005) interprets these comparisons to mean that with the proper legislation and enforcement, a solution to the global problem is quite reachable. It estimates that 20 percent of all forced labour is controlled directly by the state or armed forces, and the other 80 percent by private agents. Forced commercial sexual exploitation accounts for 11 percent of all cases and 64 percent for economic exploitation. Five percent is the estimate for work that cannot be classified in any of these areas. International cooperation to provide labour protections in receiving countries and to install a global regime that would substantially eliminate forced labour is required. 67 The current structure of MNP commitments under GATS does not provide meaningful access to foreign labour markets and discriminates against the poor, exacerbating inequalities. The extent of commitments under Mode 4 has been quite limited and largely of a generic nature. Moreover, these commitments have only bound existing access for executive and technical personnel of trans-national corporations. They do not cover the various categories of professionals and workers where developing countries have a comparative advantage because of cost, educational or cultural factors, making their specialised workers attractive in world markets. Moreover, the majority of countries have maintained the right to use limitations in market access and Most Favoured Nation status in their GATS schedules of specific commitments under Mode 4. The use of Economic Needs Tests and licensing requirements is widespread, and temporary migrants suffer because of the lack of recognition of their professional qualifications. Guidelines related to the criteria, duration and procedures of application of these limitations, and the recognition of qualifications, should be developed multilaterally. GATS commitments tend to induce brain drain effects because individuals covered by these commitments are usually those who have greater facility in acquiring permanent resident status or citizenship in the importing countries. 68 | People, Trade and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific VI. Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Security Agriculture remains a mainstay of the Asian rural economy for incomes, employment, and nutrition and food security. Although its relative importance varies with countries, agriculture is a key sector in all countries, contributing to more than 25 percent of the GDP in South Asia and more than 15 percent in East Asia. More importantly, the majority of the Asian population \u2013 more than 57 percent \u2013 is employed in the agriculture sector. The disaggregated picture is even starker: In the poorest countries like Lao PDR and Nepal, the share of agriculture in GDP is more than 40 percent, while it employs around 80 percent of the labour force. In richer countries like Malaysia and Thailand, the GDP share of the sector is around 10 percent, but is still double the global average of 5 percent. It is evident that the degree of reliance on agriculture is quite systematically correlated with the depth of poverty. Thus, from the viewpoint of supporting livelihoods and empowering the poor in Asia \u2013 through incomes and employment \u2013 agriculture is paramount. Issues of nutrition and food security also are related to agriculture. Some 78 percent of malnourished children in the developing world live in Asia, and the FAO estimates that by 2010, Asia could be home to nearly 150 million malnourished children. From a human development perspective, malnutrition, hunger and poverty are unacceptable not only because they constrain people's capability to lead the kind of life they have reason to value and participate fully in socioeconomic activities, but widespread hunger also represents a morally unacceptable state in a world that has the knowledge and the resources to eradicate absolute poverty in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3dd6bbc7-ffa2-48e1-8222-6a3b1ce1806b": {"__data__": {"id_": "3dd6bbc7-ffa2-48e1-8222-6a3b1ce1806b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/people-trade-and-development-learning-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "People, Trade, and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/people-trade-and-development-learning-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6f3da9eb1d99a0863dd33129a89d50559a0ddafcdbf291b62a9d0b5e06200f09"}}, "hash": "6f3da9eb1d99a0863dd33129a89d50559a0ddafcdbf291b62a9d0b5e06200f09", "text": "a generation. The incidence of hunger and poverty is high in areas characterised by weak agricultural production systems and absence of effective control by poor people of resources, such as land ownership and tenure, and access to credit, public infrastructure and markets. National policies recognise the importance of a reformed and productive 69 agriculture sector, and also their autonomous ability to shape domestic outcomes. A direct route to rural poverty alleviation is through increases in agricultural productivity and better food distribution systems. Asian governments recognise that investments in infrastructure, research and extension services and other incentives, promote agriculture and agro- industries to create new jobs and incomes. In all the countries we have studied, agriculture remains at the forefront of domestic policy. In Bangladesh, reforms have focused on rationalising tariffs, liberalising investment in irrigation and trade in fertilizers and equipment, and seed delivery. In India, the rural economy is dominated by small subsistence farmers; anti-poverty policies target them, but there is a need to reform the incentive regime that directs public funds to subsidise power, water and fertilizers, while crowding out investments in irrigation and other public works. In Malaysia, the dichotomous structure of subsistence farmers and large export-oriented plantations demands balancing of benefits of export incomes, with vulnerability to influx of subsidised imports. In Viet Nam, the doi moi reforms continue, and the role of the state remains important in stabilising prices and managing distribution and trade of commodities through STEs, especially in upland areas where the private sector has no incentive to operate. But as the country prepares to accede to the WTO, some of these policies will have to be defended forcefully in the accession negotiations. Because the role of the state in agriculture will continue to be crucial in many parts of Asia, these shifts will need to happen in a way that does not compromise the state's ability to meet its rural development obligations. Trade has increased the access of poorer countries to highly subsidised agricultural products from developed countries. This increased access holds the promise of improving health outcomes in poor countries and the capacity to smooth out domestic food supply disruptions. However, the actual pattern of liberalisation of trade in agriculture since the 1990s has seen the enormous opening of agricultural markets in developing countries and in new member countries of the WTO (including China), 70 | People, Trade and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific unreciprocated by a comparable opening up in advanced country markets. First principles suggest that developing countries would have an in-built comparative advantage in international agricultural trade. When the pattern of liberalisation is heavily skewed against these countries, it closes the door of investment in these countries toward agricultural productivity increases and industrial processing of agricultural products. Developing countries also have more limited resources with which to subsidise their rural communities. Agricultural subsidies Agricultural subsidies Agricultural subsidies Agricultural subsidies Agricultural subsidies Subsidies by industrial nations to their agricultural outputs have depressed world prices and have often led to surges in imports, thereby undermining livelihoods and employment in the developing world. Unfair competition hurts legitimate exports from efficient, non- subsidised producers in developing countries. For instance, the heavy U.S.22 and EU support to their producers of edible oils has affected the prospects of Malaysia's most competitive and chief agricultural export earner, oil palm. Viet Namese prices for rice and green coffee beans also have declined sharply in recent years. Further, subsidy-driven overproduction has led to export dumping of products at prices lower than the cost of production. Dumping, however, is not only a North-South issue, but countries like Bangladesh also are equally wary of effects of neighbouring India flooding the regional market with subsidised reserves of rice and wheat. While cheap imports can be beneficial to poor countries in emergency situations, in developing Asian countries where 50 to 80 percent of the population are small or even subsistence farmers, the main concern is to 22 Bernardino (2005, p. 3) states that the United States, as the world\u2019s third-largest rice exporter, pays a subsidy of 72 percent of its cost of production.

Persistent trade deficits in food also undermine self-reliance in a strategic area and pose vulnerability issues during emergencies. Instead of undermining the livelihood of small farmers in developing countries with subsidised exports, advanced countries should support human development in developing countries by helping to create domestic productive capacities through technology and financial aid. Improvement in agricultural productivity is also dependent on labour productivity, so ODA should target investing in concerted public actions in education and training, health and nutrition, and infrastructure. Similarly, domestic support of various forms, either through market prices or fiscal handouts, also distorts production and trade. Agricultural subsidies have actually increased in the period since the Uruguay Round, and the recent U.S. Farm Act represents a major shift in the policies of the world's largest agricultural exporter towards greater subsidisation. While \"amber box\" type of support is faced with reduction commitments, developing countries have argued that \"blue\" and \"green\" box subsidies also should be disciplined.23 On a net basis, household incomes in developing countries are severely undermined by international agricultural trade flows because of imports of cheap agricultural commodities. International trade in goods produced from land also has spurred the production of cash crops, which are traded internationally, as opposed to food crops. This can provide additional sources of income for farmers and 23 See Dhar (2004, Section 6) for a discussion of various negotiating positions in reforming agricultural subsidies. 72 | People, Trade and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific the ability to diversify their crops.

The WTO Agreement on Agriculture (AOA) should incorporate a \u201cDevelopment Box;\u201d indeed, developing countries have sought to expand the existing special and differential provisions in the AOA to cover broader issues of interest to them by proposing such measures. These proposals deal with all the three pillars of the AOA \u2013 market access, domestic support and export subsidies. Because the right to food is inalienable, and food security is a major non-trade24 concern, developing countries propose that food security crops (special products) should be exempt from significant tariff reduction commitments. What determines a \u201cspecial product,\u201d and how many of them should be listed, are a matter of negotiation. 24 The right to adequate food must have a priority over all other rights. It is a basic human right, a life and death issue. Without enough food, human development and, beyond that, human survival fails. Trade policies recognising the concept of the right to food and food security would definitely help protect people from hunger, help eliminating poverty. The content of a right to adequate food is elaborated upon by the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, in a 1999 reading of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. There, it is stated that the right is realised \u201cwhen every man, woman and child, alone or in community with others, (has) physical and economic access at all times to adequate food or means for its procurement \u2026. availability of food in a quantity and (of a) quality sufficient to satisfy the dietary needs of individuals, free from adverse substances, and acceptable within a given culture \u2026. accessibility of such food in ways that are sustainable and that do not interfere with the enjoyment of other human rights.\u201d All these imply that the right to adequate food surpasses responsibility on states to respect, protect and fulfill this right similar to all other social and economic rights. This means that, as stated by an International Food Policy Research Institute report, states should not adopt measures that could ultimately prevent access to adequate food, that they should adopt measures to ensure that no individuals are deprived of their access to adequate food, and that they should proactively engage in activities to strengthen people\u2019s access to and use of resources, including means to ensure their livelihood and food security (IFPRI, 2004, p.2). 73 Similarly, flexible provision of special safeguards (SSG), now only available to 39 WTO members, to counter surges in the volume or prices of imports through tariffs or quantitative restrictions, must be available for developing countries to protect vulnerable populations.

Asian countries produce more than half of the world's fish. The fisheries sector offers employment to more than 25 million people, and exports account for nearly a quarter of the global volume. In developing countries in Asia, most of the fishing communities are small-scale (80 percent), with fishing mostly in coastal areas and using small fishing vessels of less than 5 gross tonnes. Many less developed Asian countries do not have major distant-water fleets, and their fisheries sector is not heavily commercialised. Most vessels lack communication, buoy and navigational security facilities; most are powered with small-capacity engines; and fishing is usually near-shore with traveling time and catches limited by the size of vessels. Most small-scale fishermen thus engage in day-to-day fishing, usually working as share-owners in nearby waters and relying on borrowed 74 | People, Trade and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific financing. Small-scale fishing contributes to an equitable distribution of resources while being a source of food and casual employment. Most do not own their own boats and instead work as crew. Many poor fishers also do not have access to agricultural land, credit and capital equipment, and the open seas offer an opportunity to the marginalised. Resource depletion as a result of commercial exploitation has hit the poor hardest. Productive fish exporters are successfully competing in world markets. Fisheries and aquaculture are both growing export-oriented sectors in parts of Asia, bringing in an increasing share of GNP. Export of shrimp is growing the fastest, and the linking of aquaculture to export markets has encouraged diversification of exportable species and a shift from generalised fishing to targeting of key species. Viet Nam's export of aquatic products exceeded US$2 billion in 2002, up by nearly 45 percent from 2000. In India, export of frozen shrimp accounts for more than 60 percent of total fisheries export receipts, surpassing US$1.2 billion; seafood is considered the most important primary product export, earning almost 3 percent of foreign exchange. In Thailand, fisheries bring in close to US$ 5 billion annually, which is 4 percent of its GDP. Global trade barriers and practices severely constrain market access opportunities. The average tariff on fish products in major markets (relatively higher in the EU and China than the United States and Japan) is not significantly higher than the average of 6 percent for manufactured products, but certain products face peak rates and tariff escalation hinders export of processed fish products. Highly strict sanitary and environmental concerns act as a non-tariff barrier. Sanitary and environmental issues that appear alternately as food safety, as well as eco-labeling requirements, have acted as non-tariff barriers. EU, for example, has adopted a policy of \"zero tolerance\" to fish products containing residual antibiotics chloramphenicol (CAP). The recasting of sanitary standards to take advantage of more powerful measuring instruments has effectively raised sanitary standards against fisheries exports from developing countries, without recourse to scientific justification for such increases in standards. The standard set has been 75 strict enough to lead to a radical plummeting of shrimp exports to the EU from major Asian exporters like India and Thailand, affecting the livelihoods of thousands. 76 | People, Trade and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific VII. Access to Basic Services Women\u2019s and men\u2019s livelihoods and the prospects of the next generation are directly affected by the household\u2019s access to education, health, water, energy and other services. Trade in services has become a key arena of international trade negotiation. The aim of these negotiations is to remove barriers to the supply of these services across national boundaries. In almost all cases, international provision involves the participation of international companies in these sectors. The gains from trade \u2013 of increased supply at higher quality \u2013 are the key potential benefits of these liberalisation efforts.

There is a wide variety of what would be deemed barriers to international provision of services \u2013 from visa requirements, to regulatory requirements, to ownership limits. Within the overall framework of liberalisation, countries negotiate to reduce these barriers in a reciprocal manner, even though it is clear that the most immediate commercial beneficiaries are based in the industrial economies. The services liberalisation effort is not directed at changing the public- private sector mix in the economy. However, developing countries tend to be characterised by the small size of their modern private sector, so that in these countries most of these services, which require a certain level of organisational and industrial capability, are publicly provisioned. A major concern of developing countries is the increased pressure to open up sectors that provide public goods and are currently Government-owned monopolies, such as water and energy services. While economists criticise many of these monopolies for inefficiency and for contributing to the budget deficit, there is concern that if public 77 goods are privatized, they will become more expensive and less accessible. Privatisation while aiming at efficiency could simply exacerbate the unequal distribution of income, which is a common characteristic in many developing countries. In India, for example, the Government started to privatise water but was forced to roll it back in response to protests (Center for International Environmental Law, 2002). Except for increased supply, and abstracting from deficiencies in distribution, the recent record of efforts to privatise key services, such as water, has not been exemplary. Private provision has tended to raise prices (although a certain proportion of these services are in the nature of public goods) even as private providers have found it difficult to collect from consumers and to cover their costs. Similar to trade liberalisation, services liberalisation has diverse gender impacts. Critiques of privatisation of basic services have point out that access to these services is limited to those who are able to pay (i.e., poor people, particularly poor women, who are not able to pay their bills face cutoffs in services). But the fact that women are the ones who usually substitute for the Governments\u2019 role in providing clean water, health care or education to children and the nursing of elderly people \u2013 i.e., the care economy \u2013 compensates for the absence of state social services. The private provision of clean drinking water, sanitation and other basic services must be regulated to address the health aspects of these services. Estimates reported in UNDP, RBF et al. (2003, p. 321) suggest that 3 million people, most of whom are children younger than 5, die annually in developing countries because of water-related diseases. In considering educational services, the imposition of user fees even at minimal levels frequently causes girls leave their schools first (Fosse 2001, p. 3). In a few well-publicized cases, private providers have been forced to withdraw because of the demonstrated commercial unviability of the project. 78 | People, Trade and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific International provision, and with the proper regulatory regime, can certainly assist countries in providing their citizens access to high- quality services, such as advanced training and education. Beyond the public goods aspects of the provision of these services, there are issues of the \u201cpublicness\u201d of the nature of many these goods, such as the transmission of citizenship responsibilities and culture through education for the young. Governments need to carefully consider these issues as they decide which specific obstacles to increased trade in services should be removed. Access to energy services Access to energy services Access to energy services Access to energy services Access to energy services Access to clean and reliable sources of energy is crucial for human development. Despite declining real costs, the lack of access to energy not only undermines the productivity of an estimated one-third of the world's people, but it also causes insecurity and hardship and often threatens health and future well-being, while exacerbating inequalities. More than 2 billion people rely almost completely on traditional energy sources. The health of women and the education of children are particularly affected. Any policy to promote human development must effectively address this challenge. Many developing countries in Asia have been opening up their energy service sectors to foreign investment and participation, but have entered into little commitment in the GATS. Such liberalisation has been aimed at enhancing exploration efforts, increasing production, improving transportation of energy and increasing efficiency at", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c97a4d3-7bda-47ec-961c-e6b7f0361af5": {"__data__": {"id_": "8c97a4d3-7bda-47ec-961c-e6b7f0361af5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/people-trade-and-development-learning-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "People, Trade, and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/people-trade-and-development-learning-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d822abdbf9d2880c98359642b2fcb3966abb749684a5aada434e19d6c73ca501"}}, "hash": "d822abdbf9d2880c98359642b2fcb3966abb749684a5aada434e19d6c73ca501", "text": "all levels, especially the distribution of energy in the form of electricity and gas. Seen from a human development perspective, access to cheaper, more efficient energy will enhance the productivity of people and enable them to compete in a globalised world. However, such liberalisation implies that Governments will no longer be able to apply direct measures in the energy sector in support of human development goals, but will have to pursue these goals through new regulatory structures and actions on private enterprises. 79 Liberalisation cannot by itself satisfy the other components of human development. The increased efficiency does not only not benefit those many poor who are off the grid, but it also leads to higher prices, which aggravates the plight of the poor and even creates more poor, through the downsizing of employment. Without compensatory measures and conditions on foreign investors, involving transfer of technology requirements, social obligations, and prohibition of anti-competitive practices, liberalisation can undermine rather than promote human development, particularly by exacerbating existing inequalities. In GATS terms, this means introducing appropriate conditions into the GATS commitments to ensure the Governments' policy space to introduce and, if necessary, adapt and amend such regulation so that any gains from liberalisation are passed on to poorer people, including those who do not have access to energy networks. Health services Health services Health services Health services Health services Health services represent a critical component of human development. The provision of health services is directly affected by trade policy through two channels: (1) the liberalisation of trade in services and (2) the hardening of the international regime on intellectual property rights. Thailand has notably taken advantage of opportunities to provide health services to foreigners traveling to Thailand for health procedures. Another mode is for the entry of foreign health providers and that of health insurance providers into developing countries. As in the case of other services, countries need to define the proper limits on the privatisation of these services, which invariably happens with increased provision by foreigners. Permitting foreign health insurance providers to participate in the domestic provision of health services often involves an implicit decision to de-emphasise the technical and least-cost supply-side aspects, as opposed to the financing and demand-side control of the sector (Mackintosh 2003). A simple example is that in many basic aspects of health provision, universal provision, as opposed to targeted provision, is in many instances, the least-cost option. Basic health services are not only a human right, but they also are a public good, and attaining public 80 | People, Trade and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific health objectives could be endangered if recast on a purely commercial basis. The inclusion of intellectual property protections within the disciplines of the WTO and bilateral trade agreements has raised global concerns about access to affordable medicines (Third World Network, 2003). Patent protection for pharmaceutical products and processes potentially can reduce competition from the generic production of medicines. All WTO members must adopt and enforce high standards of intellectual property rights protection, similar to the standards applied in developed countries. Combined with reduced state participation and regulation of health services, intellectual property protection has been known to lead to high prices, restricted access to medicines and the demise of domestic pharmaceutical production in developing countries. Moreover, because of heavy reliance on reverse engineering which patent protection makes illegal, domestic manufacturing of pharmaceutical products in developing countries could come to a halt. The multinational drug companies in about 10 countries own or control most of the pharmaceutical technologies and products through patents (Third World Network 2003). The 20-year patent protection required by the WTO TRIPS Agreement bestows upon a pharmaceutical company a monopoly over the production, marketing and pricing of patented medicines. No generic equivalent can come into the market until after 20 years. Protected against competition, drug companies can keep the price of the drug high during the protection period. In January 2005, the Indian Parliament updated its patent laws. The new system is intended to assist Indian pharmaceutical companies to protect their own inventions and align Indian law to the country's WTO commitments. The law tightens control over the production of generic versions of patented drugs. Because India is an important supplier to developing countries of antiretroviral drugs, these new rules will raise the cost of HIV/AIDS treatments worldwide. 81 The indirect channel through which trade policies affect health and other services is through their impact on fiscal resources.

The expenditure side of the fiscal system also is affected by trade policies: Efforts at trade facilitation have cost implications. Changes in the cost of drugs, and the cost of enforcement of patent regimes, can have significant impact on the level of Government expenditures. In all, Asian countries are fierce trading nations. Because services are now inevitably subject to trade negotiations and disciplines, it would be in the interest of Asian countries to explicitly take into account trade developments in the design and planning of their social programmes. More importantly, Asian countries need now to incorporate social considerations into their trade policy and trade negotiations to take advantage of international opportunities and safeguard against the negative impacts of the burgeoning trade in services. 82 | People, Trade and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific VIII. Social Resources for Investment Economic development is a social process. It requires an often extended (and in some highly successful countries, a concentrated) period of self- reinforcing investment in capital goods and skill-building, frequently at the expense of current consumption. Individual investors have to be willing to risk their resources in untested ventures, and Governments have to advance resources based on a calculated expectation of a private response. Investment is a social process because investment involves risk taking by a variety of independent actors in new activities whose return is uncertain, particularly in case of small domestic markets. There self- fulfilling optimistic expectations play a significant role in the behaviour of individual investors. Shifting demand from consumption to investment even by a single investor may lead to a \u201cbig push\u201d effect from a coordinated simultaneous investment by other individuals (Murphy et al. 1989, pp. 1004-1006). There is a big role for the state here, which requires an institutional capability to coordinate simultaneous attempts at investment across different sectors. Murphy et al. (1989) demonstrate theoretically how a single firm\u2019s investment decision, even though not profitable on its own, may attract other firms to do so and fosters a mutually profitable big-push impact in an economy. Successful Asian countries have managed this social process relatively well, often with institutional arrangements that would be considered primitive by Western standards. Successful countries also have managed the process of sequencing of reforms as the complexity of investment decisions increased. In the early stages of the process, Asian Governments have not only successfully used development banks but also have often controlled the whole financial sector for extended periods to ensure the availability of long-term investment funds beyond the short-term trade financing from commercial banks. During its 30-year success period just before the Asian crisis, Indonesia had an elaborate 83 selective credit allocation system that was the subject of constant criticism by Western economists. In fact, a large part of the speculative inflows that ultimately undermined the Indonesian banking system, and prepared the ground for its financial crisis, rushed in after the dismantling of these credit limits (Abdusalamov and Montes 1998). Having abandoned this system, the Indonesian Government could not reinstate limits on real estate investment and other speculative projects as foreign funds flowed into Asia in the mid-1990s. As in Thailand, domestic banks responded to their newfound external resources by rapidly bring into their portfolio more speculative projects. The implicit model underlying current thinking and policymaking with regard to liberalisation is that one gathers up a savings pool first and then allocates such a pool to projects that generate the best returns on the margin. A key motivation for the frantic rush with which non-member countries have sought to join the World Trade Organization has often been to send a signal to the world (where presumably an enormous pool of investible funds lies waiting to be tapped) and thereby motivate international investors. Often the existing structure of the trade and domestic production of candidate countries does not warrant a dash to join a body devoted to trade liberalization rather than investment promotion. Preparing an economy for hospitality to foreign investment generates significant demands on public resources that, at low levels of development, might have been invested instead in basic services at greater social return. The actual global experience in the last 15 years with regard to foreign investment flows is that this rush to join is unrequited. First, most of the global pool is invested in industrial economies and, second, of the funds that are invested in developing countries, at most five countries have benefited.

In Africa, it declines from 5 percent to 2 percent between the 1970s and 1990s, while in Latin America and the Caribbean, it decreases to 10 percent from 13 percent. When we look at the breakdown among sub-regions within Asia, we see diverse patterns again.

On the other hand, West Asia\u2019s share exhibits only a slight rise from 0.6 percent to 1 percent.

Greater access to a pool of investible funds from international sources is something to be desired, as are efforts to increase the pool of such financing domestically through the encouragement of private saving behaviour. However, investment decisions in a development context are mostly commitments of resources that are risked and saved at the same time. That is, savings happen because of the prospect of a good investment project. Hoff and Stiglitz (1999) suggest that savings rates may be positively related to income growth (instead of to the level of income). They also bring up the possibility that reductions in risk may be more important on savings decisions than on changes in real returns. This brings up a critical human development aspect of investment \u2013 the 87 nurturing of a domestic private sector and the role of the state to ensure that such a sector properly undertakes the role of accumulating productive capital (Lipietz 1998). Developing a domestic private sector Developing a domestic private sector Developing a domestic private sector Developing a domestic private sector Developing a domestic private sector The Asian experience has proven the critical role of a vibrant private sector. In the most recent important case, China, the emergence of new private production activities \u2013 even if nominally owned by state organs \u2013 is a key reason why foreign investors have found the country an attractive investment destination. The aphorism that foreigners would not invest in a country in which residents themselves are not investing applies. What is the role of state in helping to nurture a domestic private sector? The answer surely depends on the level of development and the historically inherited capabilities of the state and the local private sector. In countries that have been successful in overcoming underdevelopment, a domestic private sector was nurtured, whether by conscious policy (in many cases driven by appeals to nationalism) or as an almost unintended outcome of the political process. Trade policy has been a key aspect in the building up of a domestic private sector. Countries that are now industrialised, during their development phase, had industrial tariffs that were far higher than the current tariffs in developing countries or LDCs. The United States had average applied tariffs of 40 to 50 percent for much of the century from 1820 to 1920. In comparison, the average rate in 2001 in developing countries as a whole was 8.1 percent and in LDCs 13.6 percent (Aky\u00fcz 2005). State interventions in the trade regime create enormous advantages, in the form of profits above free-market levels to favoured elements of the private sector. These \u201crents,\u201d if not properly managed, can become entitlements and undermine entrepreneurial energies, with adverse consequences for productivity growth (Chang 1994, p. 42-43 and p. 83).

There is equally no dearth of corruption to accompany foreign investment projects to the benefit of developing country officials; this has, in turn, sparked demands to deregulate foreign investment entry. Why is the existence of a domestic private sector critical to development? It is critical because the permanent impact of development is in the increase in capabilities and productivity of an economy. This private, individual capacity has to be embodied somewhere. A domestic private sector, operating in areas beyond retail marketing, is the site where increases in national productivity can be rooted. Corruption and political abuse need to be addressed without sacrificing the existence of a sector where human productivity can be developed and permanently located. Economies that have insufficient locations of this type will tend to see their citizens seeking productive employment in foreign countries. Developing Asia-Pacific countries need to preserve their policy space for assisting their domestic private sector, even as international negotiations intensify to restrict such space. Bilateral and regional trade agreements Bilateral and regional trade agreements Bilateral and regional trade agreements Bilateral and regional trade agreements Bilateral and regional trade agreements At Doha (2001) it was agreed that \"recognizing the case for a multilateral framework to secure transparent, stable and predictable conditions for long-term cross-border investment, particularly foreign direct investment \u2026 negotiation will take place after the 5th session of the 89 Ministerial Conference on the basis of a decision to be taken, by explicit consensus, at that Session on modalities of negotiations.\" At the Fifth Ministerial Conference in Cancun, because of the successful resistance on the part of developing countries, further negotiations in the WTO on an investment treaty were terminated. However, investment restrictions have expanded enormously in bilateral and regional investment treaties. Although not a new phenomenon, since the establishment of the WTO and its \u201cSingle Undertaking,\u201d the number of Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) has increased dramatically25. Many of new waves of RTAs also extend beyond tariff liberalisation to include more intrusive obligations, especially on intellectual property rights, services and investment. The process is further complicated by the fact that traditionally RTAs were concluded among bordering countries with comparable levels of development, while the new wave of regionalism involves diverse countries located in different time zones26. The failure of the Cancun Ministerial Conference to move the multilateral negotiating process forward has intensified interest in bilateral and regional options for expansion of trade relations. Many developing countries have sought to partner with richer, Northern countries, reciprocating preferential access to their markets with similar concessions in different sectors. However, as RTAs tend to involve the freeing of \"substantially all\" trade and normally contain \"WTO-plus\" obligations, their impact on human development can be pronounced. Indeed, the RTAs seem to magnify the scope and intrusiveness of policy restraints and liberalisation commitments already covered under WTO obligations. The benefits arising from improved access to markets have to 25 \u201cAs of January 2005, 312 RTAs have been notified to WTO/GATT (of these, 170 are in force) and a further 65 are estimated to be operational although not yet notified\u201d (Crawford et Al., 2005, p.2-3). 26 \u201cSwimming in the Spaghetti Bowl: Challenges for Developing Countries under the New Regionalism,\u201d Luis Abugattas Majluf, UNCTAD, 2004. 90 | People, Trade and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific be weighed against reciprocal concessions made elsewhere, in terms of their combined impact on human development and livelihood prospects of poor citizens. A recent WTO discussion paper on RTAs argues that because RTAs are becoming increasingly complex, complicated rules of origin likewise makes trade more costly and complex. The study also argues that unless RTA rules are not accompanied by a concurrent multilateral system, they may jeopardise a balanced development of world trade. Elevated trade and investment diversion would marginalise the \u201cweakest\u201d countries (Crawford et al. 2005, p.16). This view supports earlier findings by Bhagwati and Panagariya (1996) and Venables (1999) where the former demonstrates that the growing significance of trade diversion (i.e., the rise in trade among RTA members at the expense of trade between RTA members and others) diverts trade from non-members and least-cost suppliers.

RTAs affect FDI flows through two channels: First, there are indirect effects through trade liberalisation; second, effects occur through changes in investment rules imposed within RTAs. How RTAs affect FDI depends on the total magnitude of these two effects (Blomstrom and Kokko 1997, p. 2-3). The study basically points out the fact that RTAs raise the potential for investment, as a result of a bigger market size. On evaluating the diverse implications on different member countries of MERCOSUR (Blomstrom and Kokko 1997, p. 29-30), they suggest additional provisions in RTAs to facilitate FDI. Other possible benefits of RTAs, from an investment point of view, are discussed in other studies as 91 well. Fernandez (1997, p. 27) states that RTAs might provide certainty and credibility as to the future policies and economic environment, which can increase private investment. By reducing uncertainties via commitment, signaling and insurance mechanisms, RTAs might serve to increase credibility and provide benefits to member economies. RTAs also have potential impacts on productivity and growth. Schiff et al. (2002) finds that both North-South and South-South research and development flows have a positive impact on total factor productivity. The study argues that RTAs are likely to favour the development of low- resesarch and development-intensity industries in the South and might retard the economic transformation of member countries to a high- research and development economy by reducing technology spillovers from the North (Schiff et al. 2002, p. 16). This result can be interpreted to imply that RTAs are good for growth, unless trade is limited within member countries. In other words, unless countries are locked into trading only with each other, then the potential for higher research and development flows leads to higher growth. RTAs might provide an environment for the members to sponsor their research and development expenditures jointly and form regional research and development clusters in the region. Because uncertainty matters much in research and development expenditures, why not share the risks or the benefits at the end? Another aspect is the welfare impact of RTAs, which also involve their political dimension. Schiff and Winters (1997, p. 29) argue that RTAs, as diplomacy, unambiguously increase welfare, given the condition that it reduces security tensions and conflict. However, Brown et al. (2005) take a contrary view, arguing that regional cooperation is no panacea for regional conflict (Brown et al. 2005, p. 14). RTAs cannot be taken as an automatic brake on conflict. In fact, regional integration, according to the authors, can actually create tensions and trigger conflict by creating adjustment costs, social dislocation and a widening of wealth inequalities.

Source: Pitigala (2005, p. 8), Table 2 93 Given these general theoretical arguments, it will be necessary to undertake more research on case-specific issues in Asia. The basic argument is that, if properly designed, B/RTAs are likely to provide opportunities for developing countries to extend human development capabilities, while avoiding possible drawbacks from trade liberalisation. In Asia, countries have been involved in regional integration for many years, including the regional system of tariff preferences, the Bangkok Agreement, and sub-regional processes like SAFTA and AFTA. Recently there has been intensification of efforts to deepen such ties through negotiation of bilateral FTAs, including within the framework of agreements between sub-regional groupings. China has become active in negotiating such FTAs, and countries like Japan, which have been historically aloof to RTAs, are reinvigorating their efforts. Asian countries also are negotiating FTAs with countries outside the region. Questions thus arise on how these new integration arrangements promote trade and development as well as benefit and impact on the poorer sections of society \u2013 and indeed, whether they are compatible to the letter and spirit of the multilateral trading system. South Asia is a sub-region where there has been a recent surge in interest in regional trading agreements; recent research indicates changes in the pattern of intra-regional trade in South Asia. Pitigala (2005, p. 8) provides a review of intra-regional trade shares in total trade in selected years from 1981 to 1998; Table 13 below is adapted from this study. The significant impacts of RTAs in the region also can be observed from figures in Table 13. In aggregate, South Asian intra-regional trade doubled in eight years (from 2.4 percent in 1990 to 4.9 percent in 1998). The figures first imply that the significance of intra-regional trade increased in all member countries while also reflecting the increased economic growth rates recently experienced in the sub-region. Second, compared to other sub-regions, South Asia\u2019s performance is very low in 94 | People, Trade and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific absolute terms27, but when we look at the impacts in each country, we observe that figures for Bhutan (from 10 percent to 72 percent) and Nepal (12 percent to 33 percent) demonstrate significant increases. Given the fact that these two countries are landlocked, this change might not be surprising, yet such a large increase would not be achieved without agreements with India. Thus, RTAs have the potential to expand trade opportunities for landlocked countries. The differing bargaining power and capabilities stemming from asymmetric political and economic strengths of nations are well-known drawbacks of regional trade agreements. Intra-regional import shares in Bangladesh, Maldives and Sri Lanka rise more than the export shares. One underlying reason, Pitigala (2005, p. 9) argues, is the imbalance as a consequence of India\u2019s maintaining a higher level of border protection relative to its neighbours. Such imbalances also may reflect dynamic effects generated by the differential level of export diversification among trading partners. India and Pakistan are cited as the only countries exporting a wide range of manufactured goods from automobiles to medicine, whereas other countries\u2019 exports are usually concentrated in a single sector, such as beans, rice or apparel28.

Some regional blocs include facilities for Movement of Natural Persons; ASEAN countries, for instance, are devising a framework that will encourage greater mobility of labour across borders by simplifying visa and licensing procedures, and promoting recognition of qualifications. Similarly, in sectors like agriculture, fisheries, and textiles and clothing, B/RTAs could offer improved market access, but in return for conditions and restrictions on national policies whose development merits are yet to be assessed. Agriculture agreements could require limited use of safeguard measures; fisheries could include ecolabeling and prevention of depletion of stocks; textiles and apparel could involve outward processing arrangements and other rules of origin that would inhibit textile trade among Asian countries, even undermining the competitiveness of the exporting country. FTAs and BTAs also could contain higher standards for intellectual property that exceed the minimum levels of protection that TRIPS mandates for patents, copyrights, trademarks and geographical indicators, possibly having an impact on sensitive issues of public health and technology transfer. Unless care is taken in the legal definitions, the danger also exists that nationals of countries other than those directly involved in the agreement would inadvertently benefit (and perhaps evade regulatory requirements) through subsidiaries incorporated in the parties involved. In considering the FTA option, particularly with developed countries outside the region, Asian countries must take into account that free trade in sectors of interest to them might in any case be achieved through the zero-for-zero formula in the Doha Round. The negotiation of FTAs 96 | People, Trade and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific appears to emerge from a different domestic political dynamic than those underlying multilateral rounds. At the same time, the use of FTAs by certain major powers to obtain strategic political objectives departs from the basic principle of the GATT/WTO system, which has always sought to depoliticise trade relations (Van Grasstek 2003). Based on a variety of recent experiences in negotiating RTAs, developing countries of this region need an effective and sophisticated strategy to avoid the dangers and exploit the opportunities in these kinds of agreements. Investment measures Investment measures Investment measures Investment measures Investment measures Many domestic investment measures have clear human development objectives that can be undermined by new multilateral disciplines. Proposed multilateral investment agreements tend to prohibit or restrict many investment policy measures currently available to developing countries. Such measures include the screening of entry of investment, limitations of control and ownership, performance requirements (e.g., transfer of technology, export performance, employment), and investment incentives. The real question is whether it is in the interest of Asian developing countries to accept such constraints that eliminate or restrict their use of specific investment measures currently at their disposal. Many investment measures that are targeted for restriction or prohibition would seem to have been conceived with clear human development goals in mind, such as protecting the environment, promoting the interests of disadvantaged social and ethnic groups, reducing gender and regional inequalities, providing stable and improved employment opportunities, enhancing skills and access to technologies, and facilitating access to world markets. For example, measures that seek to limit foreign ownership and control empower people to have more control over vital economic decisions that can affect their lives. Investment measures such as labour rights and employment performance requirements, property rights, pro-competition measures, social accountability of trans-national 97 corporations, and cultural exceptions are also central to empowerment. Other investment measures are aimed at promoting equitable access to opportunities, correcting for regional, ethnic and gender inequalities. These include regional and sectoral incentives and investment incentives for SMEs; employment- and gender-related performance requirements; and universal and public service requirements. In addition, other investment measures are aimed at ensuring a sustainable future through environmental requirements, expropriation law, investment safeguards, balance-of-payments requirements, and restrictions on short-term capital flow. Quite a few Asian countries have been vociferous opponents of incorporating multilateral obligations on investment into the WTO system. Some opposition even comes from countries that have been seen to have greatly benefited from FDI, and which are currently primary destinations for FDI. The idea that foreigners could exercise property rights in the hosting countries through the threat of trade sanctions has generated much political heat in these countries. Successful Asian experiences suggest that rapid development has been achieved through strategies that depend primarily on domestic investment. Foreign investment played a critical role in achieving specific goals as part of an overall strategy (Amsden and Chu 2003). The specific goals included rapid employment absorption, industrial \u201cupgrading,\u201d balance-of- payments contribution, technology transfer,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b42330ce-dd51-4b01-8913-3a358ad4efe7": {"__data__": {"id_": "b42330ce-dd51-4b01-8913-3a358ad4efe7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/people-trade-and-development-learning-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "People, Trade, and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/people-trade-and-development-learning-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "113c536693ca1b583bae5fe67df6ad92374a82e2dd0ca1e90b950d1b108bdfd6"}}, "hash": "113c536693ca1b583bae5fe67df6ad92374a82e2dd0ca1e90b950d1b108bdfd6", "text": "securing of raw materials supply, capturing of new foreign markets, and access to credit and brands of foreign investors.

Industrial tariffs and industrial policy Industrial tariffs and industrial policy Industrial tariffs and industrial policy Industrial tariffs and industrial policy Industrial tariffs and industrial policy Another means by which successful Asian societies historically mobilised resources for investment, mostly paid for by domestic consumers, is through the system of industrial tariffs and quantitative restrictions on 98 | People, Trade and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific imports. For efficiency and governance considerations, quantitative restrictions are now mostly applied to \u201csensitive\u201d products. Developing countries need the flexibility to set tariffs and change them as the level of development changes, in order to encourage investment in specific sectors of the economy. For example, labour-surplus countries could use tariffs to encourage labour-intensive manufactures and reduce these tariffs when wages increase. Aky\u00fcz (2005) warns that the more prominent proposals in the ongoing negotiations at the World Trade Organization on Non-Agricultural Market Access (NAMA) will banish this flexibility. These proposals have the potential implication of binding tariffs on a line-by-line basis that would be irreversible and have raised concerns about the viability of domestic investment in developing countries. In these proposals, developing countries are being asked, in effect, to cut their tariffs much more rapidly than the developed countries had done in the 30 years after the Second World War. 99 IX. Technological Upgrading and Innovation Innovation and the upgrading of the technical capacity embodied in produced goods has been a critical element of the Asia\u2019s success in securing productivity and wage growth and the sustainability of its participation in world markets. Successful Asian countries started off at low levels of technical capability. The interaction with the international economy provided these countries with the understanding of what would be required to upgrade production. International trade was used to import capital equipment and to purchase foreign technology. Successful countries also have regulated international investment to ensure that technology would be transferred to domestic users (Amsden 2001). In the case of the Republic of Korea, there was a specific bias against depending on foreign investment to gain access to foreign technology; instead, the state assisted private companies in acquiring foreign technology (Cassen and Lall 1996; Chang 1994), organising consortia to purchase technology and assisting in identifying which technologies to purchase. The Singaporean approach has depended more heavily on foreign investment, but even here, as the economy attempts to adapt more complicated technology, the state has set up companies to undertake research and development. A significant element of the learning from foreign direct investment that has benefited host economies derives from skill upgrading, through training of workers and their operational experience in actual production activities. Technical advances are often embodied in modifications and adaptations of plants and equipment (Lall 1998). The spread of knowledge has been more effective in countries where the national innovation system is structured to facilitate absorption. Developing economies cannot rely on foreign firms to undertake research and development in their own countries. The experience of Singapore, Ireland and Israel suggests that interventionist policies are required to 100 | People, Trade and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific ensure that research and development activities migrate from only production-related activities to applied research and development (Rasiah 2003). \u201cThere is convincing evidence that regulation on ownership conditions cannot simply be viewed to be inversely correlated with technological capability building. There is little evidence to suggest that foreign firms will relocate substantial innovation-related activities in developing economies, even in economies considered to offer equal treatment to local and foreign firms\u201d (Rasiah 2003, p. 9-10). The establishment of an international regime that would secure the transfer of technology has been a key demand of developing countries since the formation of the GATT. Recent developments, such as the absorption of intellectual property rights in the trade regime and restrictions on trade-related investment measures, have diminished the ability of national authorities to embark on technological upgrading and have increased their dependence on foreign firms for access to technology. 101 X. Conclusion For the countries of this region, the key issue is whether trade will continue to play a positive role in human development, as it did in successful East Asian countries. The East Asian model relied on a strategic role of the state in managing external trade; are international rules governing trade disallowing elements of this approach by unduly fettering state capacity?

The East Asian model, starting as it did from a relatively more egalitarian distribution of wealth, was characterised by relatively equitable growth, so that workers captured part of their productivity growth in their own income. Is the prevailing model dependent on the progressive fraying of the social fabric, underpinning an economy\u2019s international competitiveness from the sustainability of low wages and vulnerable employment? The key messages of the Asian experience are the following: The key messages of the Asian experience are the following: The key messages of the Asian experience are the following: The key messages of the Asian experience are the following: The key messages of the Asian experience are the following: Asian countries have demonstrated that trade and foreign investment can be mobilised to achieve human development. This has been achieved through a strategic, as opposed to a passive, approach to international integration. A passive approach, which relies heavily on low wages and cheaper raw materials, can condemn economies to their given place in the international division of production. An active, strategic approach consciously undertakes policies to drive a country\u2019s production activities toward higher levels of productivity, value-addition and higher wages. In the successful Asian cases, the record also is that human development has been critical in sustaining the growth process. These countries were able to secure a virtuous cycle between international economic integration and human development. The Asian countries have shown the possibility that, instead of international economic integration being a force for 102 | People, Trade and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific social disintegration, external trade and investment can lead to higher levels of social well-being and achievement. In Asia\u2019s successful exploitation of trade for development purposes, social intervention, primarily through state policies but also through partnerships with the private sector, has played a key role. Creating a domestic labour force and a private sector that, while initially requiring protection and state assistance, can compete internationally has been a key Asian approach. Successful countries in the region demonstrate that a robust domestic economy is indispensable to a productive and strategic integration with the global economy. Yet changes in international trade rules are proscribing many of the trade strategies that Asian countries used to achieve human development (UNDP, RBF, et al. 2003, p. 66). The policy space of developing countries is much more restricted than that which the currently developed countries (Chang 2002), or the early Asian industrialisers had (Chang and Green 2003). Flexibilities in regard to tariffs and investment regulation, which were critical to the Asian story, are being eroded. Even as there are potential benefits from foreign provision, trade rules are interfering with social responsibilities to ensure access to basic services by citizens of developing countries. Asian countries thus should integrate trade and social policy. Recent developments, particularly the elimination of textile quotas, represent a challenge to Asia\u2019s export-oriented integration with the global economy and will inflict significant job losses on some countries, while other countries in the region benefit. A set of approaches exists that countries should undertake to mitigate the negative impact and take advantage of the opportunities from the changes in international rules. First and foremost, LDCs should be afforded preferential access to external markets to ease their transition. Asian countries need to seize the opportunity of the quota elimination as an occasion to diversify their production trade structures away from overdependence on the textile 103 and clothing sectors. Asia is playing host to the next high point in trade negotiations: the WTO Ministerial meeting in Hong Kong in December 2005. This meeting takes place in the first year in which the quota system of textile and clothing ended. The Hong Kong meeting should be the occasion to realize the commitment of the Doha Ministerial Declaration, which required Special and Differential Treatment for LDCs to become \u201cmore precise, effective and operational.\u201d What is at stake in the current trade negotiations, both in the WTO and in other bilateral and regional arenas, is nothing less than the ability of Asian countries to pursue their human development commitments under the Millennium Development Goals and the aspirations of their own populations. 104 | People, Trade and Development: Learning from Asia-Pacific References Abdusalamov, Muhammad Ali and Manuel F.

Since its founding in 2002, the APTII has promoted innovative research and policy advice that seeks to define clear substantive linkages between trade and human development, and that is consistent with the objective of supporting the Millennium De- velopment Goals (MDGs). The APTII, striving to build on its previous work and achievements in this third and current phase of its work programme (2008-2011), aspires to make a significant contribution to policy dialogues by fostering re- gional trade and investment regimes that are consistent with human development goals in the region. A cen- tral challenge facing policy-makers is to facilitate patterns of inclusive regional integration that enable them to address specific development priorities and goals, particularly with reference to the development needs of least developed countries (LDCs), landlocked developing countries (LLDCs), and small island developing states (SIDS). The focus of APTII\u2019s current work programme, therefore, is on: 1) enhancing trade competitive- ness and capacity development to formulate employment-responsive and gender-responsive trade policies; and 2) strengthening the capacity to implement pro-poor regional integration strategies, including through key regional processes and/or mechanisms. In line with this focus, APTII will publish a series of studies and discussion papers highlighting the policy implications of the multifaceted dimensions of current trade trends and patterns, as well as their human development impact in the Asia Pacific region. vi Preface With the spread and deepening of the global financial crisis across the world, a number of issues are likely to be intensely debated in the coming months and years. Policy makers in the Asia Pacific region for instance need to think creatively about national, regional and global policy options addressing the inherent vulnerabilities in the region arising on account of the current nature and pattern of production and international trade in goods and services. Equally, the realization seems to be hitting home that a strategic approach to trade and investment liberalization efforts under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) is a critical ingredi- ent for resilience and prevention of the worst effects of boom-bust cycles across economies in the region. The APTII study on Policy Space and Investment Rules under GATS: Select Asian Experiences, highlights inter alia that there is a case for countries to adopt a calibrated approach to liberalization of GATS investment rules to harness development benefits. The Study brings out the various dimensions of policy space in the context of GATS and juxtaposes select Asian experiences on liberalization of investment rules. It argues that given the differences in stages of development and policy imperatives, it would be important for countries to both preserve and leverage the GATS flexibilities as the negotiations unfold in the future. Unbridled liberaliza- tion of the services, sector without a robust, credible and effective regulatory framework relevant especially for financial services needs to be revisited as a lesson learnt of the current economic crisis. The global crisis reminiscent of the Great Depression of the late nineteen twenties and thirties, is a signal call for countries to rethink the critical issues of regulation before liberalization and, as a response policy makers need to leverage and retain flexibilities and safeguards in services negotiation at the bilateral, regional and global levels. It is our hope that this policy paper will prove useful to governments, UNDP country offices, research institutions, civil society organizations and other stakeholders in the Asia Pacific region in furthering the debate on services liberalization with a human development orientation.

Governments in the region understand the need to utilize the growing contribution of the service sector as a site to generate employment opportunities, but are challenged with issues of liberalization of services, either autonomously or at bilateral, regional and multilateral levels. Attempts at liberalization of services are fraught with debates of how commitments at the said levels constrain the policy space of governments to regulate services for achieving objectives of human develop- ment. Policy space in this context is a reference to the scope for domestic policies of a government, especially in the areas of trade, investment and industrial development which is often framed by international disciplines, commitments and global market considerations. The rapidly expanding range and scope of trade policies at the bilateral, regional and international levels have critically impinged upon the availability and exercise of \u2018policy space\u2019 in developing countries in several interlinked ways. There is concern for how governments in Asia, especially those of Newly Acceding Countries (NACs), are utilizing the existing policy space under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) to schedule their commitments. This paper seeks to focus attention on the commitments made to the World Trade Organization (WTO) by select Asian countries, including some NACs, to liberalize investment flows across different service sectors through commercial presence in the territory of a Member State (Mode 3), in view of the unique relevance of these commitments from a policy space and human development perspective. \uf06c The study of GATS commitments made brings to light diverse approaches in utilising the flexibilities under the GATS architecture and undertaking liberalisation commitments. In general, the approaches seem to be based upon the stage of development of the services sector and tailoring to local needs and priorities in individual cases. Although the Study finds no readily discernable consistent pattern, the flexibility does permit an economic powerhouse like China to utilize the GATS framework to signal a level of restraint when opening key sectors (like banking), while permitting a country like Nepal to keep itself unbound for a series of financial services until the groundwork for opening up is prepared. \uf06c Overall, commitments made by selected countries at an autonomous level are often deeper, in com- parison to the commitments undertaken by them under GATS on the same set of services. This may be taken as indicative of the existence and utilization of appropriate space and flexibility for contextualising developmental policies to local needs and priorities. Executive summary x \uf06c Preliminary research suggests that the NACs may have been subject to greater pressures for liberalization of investment rules. There is a concern that most of the NACs have not taken recourse to the flexibilities embedded in the GATS architecture to schedule limitations even in sectors such as health, education and environment which are critical from the point of view of human development and therefore needing appropriate government regulation prior to liberalization commitments. In some instances, the sectors appear to have been opened up without the benefit of adequate experiences in setting up or maturing of the regulatory institutions. This has implications for policy space to operationalize developmental goals. It needs to be emphasized that in practice, reversal of the GATS commitments is virtually impos- sible without incurring significant and possibly unacceptable costs by the countries wishing to change the same under the existing WTO framework. Accordingly, in general, it would be preferable to adopt a cautious approach rather than locking oneself into binding commitments into the future especially on the question of provision of essential services.

For most countries including some least developed countries (LDCs)2, the services sector is now the biggest contributor to gross domestic product (GDP) and considered in- strumental in employment generation and enhancing human development outcomes.3 An efficient services sector, given its cross sector and economy-wide efficiency linkage is considered a prerequisite for attainment of international competitiveness and economic growth. The growing importance of the services sector has led some to argue that there are substantial gains from freeing up trade in services either autonomously or through bilateral, regional and multilateral chan- nels. Others have suggested a calibrated approach after due factoring in of costs and benefits. As is known, the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) sets forth the first ever set of multilateral disciplines for international trade in services. It has an inbuilt agenda of progressive liberalization (Article XIX) wherein Members enter into successive rounds of negotiations not later than five years from the date of entry into force of the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement. Negotiations in the services sector are ongoing in the Doha Round as well. The WTO\u2019s services sectoral list classifies services in 12 broad categories and includes education, health-related and social services, financial services, research and development, communication, retailing and transport services amongst others.4 Trade liberalization of the services sector covers practically all the services with limited exceptions. Again, trade in services is categorized to be carried through four different modes of supply as defined in Article I of the GATS.5 The rationale for the Study arises from the wide scope and breadth of the services sector targeted for liberalization and its potential impact on the ability of governments to tailor domestic policies for trade and investment while respecting international commitments and considering global markets. Such room for maneuver within the framework of multilateral commitments is also referred to as \u2018policy space\u2019. Policy space is continually challenged in the process of conforming to agreements like GATS for example, through the requirement that each Member State has to take necessary steps to ensure that regional, local and non- governmental bodies within its territory observe the commitments made. This often renders ineffectual their ability to pursue development goals. 1.

Policy space. 2 It needs to be appreciated that liberalization in services trade is fundamentally different and more complex than liberalization in goods trade. Simply put, while the latter primarily involve measures \u2018at the border\u2019, the former encompasses regulatory and government policy issues, or what are typically termed \u2018behind the border measures\u2019. Services trade liberalization, therefore, has multiple linkages and a much wider policy ambit and associated developmental impacts which are important to be factored in any liberalization episode. A focus on policy space implications for the current liberalization episodes in the services sector vis-\u00e0-vis the flexibilities which exist in the GATS is thus topical and relevant. The scope and coverage of GATS to include services supply side Mode 3 (through commercial presence in the territory of any other Member) has often been seen as an indirect attempt to set in place multilateral rules for investment on services in the light of previous failures on this count. Service supply through Mode 1 (cross-border movement of services) and Mode 4 (cross border movement of natural persons) are often linked to commercial presence and add to the economic importance of Mode 3.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dd37b5a1-5a85-4a13-b9c3-066ce44d6126": {"__data__": {"id_": "dd37b5a1-5a85-4a13-b9c3-066ce44d6126", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy Space and Investment Rules under GATS: Select Asian Experiences", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6b8b88155aec69bd0e9b3e4dfbc6d4c692952c4aa3ca9bc977586e498286bb5b"}, "2": {"node_id": "80c157da-2cbc-415e-a074-e4747c9bf7b2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f3cfda97027d19453977fd7ed9dc5ad786509a2c8e0f0d08df2ee7ca791edbab"}}, "hash": "9af85d4387920a8ba1f10cc8acea41fc6249debdde29786c5a57358178f3dae0", "text": "The list of multinational service providers eager to tap into the potential efficiencies of a developing country market has also been increasing over the past few years and such countries face mounting pressure to deliver on their international commitments to liberalize.

A key apprehension aris- ing on account of MAI was that the agreement would undermine the sovereign ability of governments to regulate investments to suit diverse development objectives. A similar attempt to include investments on to the agenda of the WTO was resisted strongly by the developing countries. Although the Agreement on Trade Related Investment Measures (TRIMs) was agreed to in the WTO to address the trade restrictive and distorting effects of investment measures, it is restricted to trade in goods and fell short of a comprehensive WTO regime for investments.6 However, the GATS agreement in effect has been seen as creating an additional window for liberalizing further investment flows via Mode 3 and place a scaled down version of a multilateral agreement on investments. The need for such an agreement especially from the point of view of the developed countries arises on account of the large flows of foreign direct investment (FDI) globally in the services sector. Cross border investment has been growing in magnitude and importance. FDI flows were in the order of US$ 1.2 trillion in 2006, with approximately US$ 325 billion going to developing countries.7 In terms of sectoral composition, half of the FDI flows went to the services sector in 20048, especially to banking, telecommunications and real estate; a trend facilitated by the process of liberalization and relaxation of foreign ownership requirements and privatization efforts whether driven autonomously or by the WTO.9 6 This theme has been discussed further in Chapter 3. Policy space. 7 World Bank (2007). 8 2004 is the most recent year for which the data on sectoral composition of FDI is available. 9 Ibid. 3 The objective of this Study is to focus attention on the liberalization commitments entered into by select Asian countries including by some Newly Acceding Countries (NACs) to the WTO in Mode 3 across different sectors. The context being that the liberalization of the services sector especially in Mode 3 has assumed a unique relevance from a policy space and human development perspective. In addition to making the analy- sis broader in scope, aside from the schedule of commitments entered into countries, revised offers10 of some countries and autonomous liberalization trends have also been incorporated into the analysis. Also, there are aspects of GATS which have raised questions about whether or not its implementa- tion would affect the ability of governments to provide and regulate essential services in the public interest. By way of illustration, health care, education and water and sanitation services, promotion of research and development, pursuit of balanced regional growth and the promotion of backward and forward linkages by prescribing local content requirements for industries with an influx of FDI and so on would be affected in myriad ways. These essential services are known to be underprovided in developing countries. Increased private sector participation is of limited help and value due to high costs which tends to exclude the poor and vulnerable and also poses a number of regulatory challenges.11 The issue of effective regulation in the services sector is critical since the \u2018production\u2019 and \u2018consumption\u2019 of services occurs simultaneously without any inter- vening opportunity to inspect, like in the case of goods. While GATS in principle does provide the flexibility of limiting the scope of liberalization commitments by scheduling limitations horizontally across sectors and by way of Most Favoured Nation (MFN) and National Treatment (NT) limitations and recognizes the rights of governments to regulate, a critical area of concern has been the actual practice in this regard: whether or not governments have in reality exercised and utilized the flexibilities embedded in the agreement and retained policy space to regulate effectively without fetters. Another issue of importance has been the question of opening up without a proper regulatory regime/apparatus in place and lack of previous experience in several areas which are new and evolving in nature. A push for liberalization in areas where a particular service sec- tor is yet to mature sans the regulatory framework is akin to putting the cart before the horse. The World Bank has documented how the process of financial liberalization which preceded a new legal and regulatory framework for prudent risk taking and market discipline \u2018led to a series of bank failures which caused losses to taxpayers and depositors equivalent to 7 percent of GDP in Zambia.\u2019 12 2.

The limitations of the Study however, need to be borne in mind. The scope of analysis of commitments is limited to Mode 3 and encompasses only select sectors/countries and is intended to offer a preliminary assessment. The Study does identify the need to undertake follow on country and sector specific research underpinned by data and information taking into account the experience of liberalization and challenges arising therein. Also, for most countries, documents on revised and updated offers in the ongoing negotiations continue to be restricted.13 Thus, as far as revised offers go, coverage is limited to countries where the revised offer docu- ments are available in the public domain. Lastly, data and information on the specific country context both in general and on the accession processes and dynamics have been obtained through desk research and often not sufficient to get a complete picture. 13 The study makes an attempt to review country schedules and autonomous commitments. 5 In a world characterized by different levels of development across countries and regions, the concept of policy space is seen as fundamental to the pursuit of development goals and in safeguarding the interests of developing countries in the international trading system. The need for policy space is well established on both theoretical and empirical counts. In many developing countries market failures are seen to persist, thereby providing a firm rationale for state intervention and regulation. Also, the East Asian development experiences and successes have demonstrated the utility of a state facilitated development policy approach.14 Despite this, it has been seen that the availability of policy space with developing countries has been shrink- ing steadily and rendered ineffectual so much so that their ability to pursue development goals itself has now been constrained. This has been especially so in the area of trade and industrial policies.15 Thus, for instance, some research findings suggest that more than 25 percent of all the WTO dispute settlement cases brought forth between 1995 and 2005 have in effect served to dismantle the policy space of developing countries.16 In the trading arena, the rapidly expanding range and scope of trade policies at the bilateral, regional and international levels have critically impinged upon the availability and exercise of policy space to devel- oping countries in several interlinked ways. For one, trade policy now encompasses rule making and new disciplines over and beyond the traditional areas covered under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) such as agriculture, services, intellectual property and investment. This implies a qualitative change for developing countries as rule making now involves domestic regulatory and legal systems which are embedded in the institutional infrastructure of the economy at national and sub-national levels having a wide ambit.17 For example, Article I. 3 (a) of the GATS stipulates that scope of the agreement encompasses measures taken by central, regional or local governments and authorities in a delegated capacity. Further, it mentions that in fulfilling its obligations and commitments under GATS, each Member is required to take such reasonable measures as may be available to it to ensure their observance by regional and local govern- ments and authorities and non-governmental bodies within its territory.18 Also, harmonization of rules and 3.
