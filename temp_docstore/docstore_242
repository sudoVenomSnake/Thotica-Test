Because schools and health posts are in the front line in the global war on malaria, tuberculosis, polio and HIV/AIDS, upgrading facilities, including the lodgings for education and health workers, is crucial to improving global health and reducing the very high mortality and morbidity rates from those diseases. 137 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences needs to be done for schools and health facilities on a scale of hundreds of thousands of installations throughout the developing world. A benefit that is widely perceived of the use of electric lighting at home is increased study and reading hours for children; there is also anecdotal evidence of improved school enrolment. In fact, in many areas, this is a frequently reported benefit of electrification. Studies have also found improved school performance by children in Fiji and Solomon Islands, and Bangladesh (Sauturaga 2004; Barkat et al. 2002). All the case studies (that provided improved lighting through microhydropower or through SHSs) carried out for this study reported that children were able to put in an additional 1-1.2 hours of study at home, once light was available. An important benefit reported by most users of electricity, especially teachers was that because of access to television, they were able to keep themselves better informed. The number of television sets was found to increase dramatically in all the case study locations after the advent of electricity. In Manikganj district of Bangladesh where Grameen Shakti has been selling solar home systems on credit, the number of radios and black-and-white televisions increased by 55 percent and 76 percent respectively after SHSs were introduced (Bangladesh country case study). MDG 3 \u2013 Gender equity When women gain access to energy services, it can have a marked effect on their lives, particularly with respect to freeing up their time by relieving then of some of the unending drudgery that characterizes the daily lives of poor families. Therefore, it contributes to improved literacy among women, greater income generation by women and more community activities led by women. Many microenterprises, typically run by women, become viable when there is access to a reliable modern energy source. Public lighting improves women\u2019s safety and encourages evening community and commercial activities. Clean cooking fuels minimize indoor air pollution and the associated morbidity and mortality of women. Women are at greatest risk from indoor air pollution because of their gender roles, household responsibilities and behaviour (for example, cooking and spending a lot of time indoors). When women participate in energy projects and develop more confidence through training or through gaining income, this can give them a greater voice in the household and even the community. Either through training, and thus increasing their skills, or by actively involving then in the project, women can take up new roles, get more of a say in households and communities, and may even take up leadership positions (Bryce and Soo 2004; Khuller 2002). In the Solomon Islands, women were trained in microhydropower technology, which gave them a feeling of pride from knowing how electricity was generated and distributed. They also participated in the village hydropower management committee and began to collect and bank the monthly electricity tariff. As a result, they gained the respect of village men as well as their encouragement to take up new initiatives (Bryce and Soo 2004). In some cases, energy services even contribute towards changing gender relations within households and the community. This is observed especially in cases where women earn income as a result of new energy access and become co-providers for the family, and men become more involved in domestic tasks (Berthaud et al. 2004; Lao Women\u2019s Union 2001). Income opportunities for women in a PV-lamp cooperative induced their husbands to share household duties (ESMAP 2004). In a microhydropower project in Nepal, men became involved in household tasks such as carrying grain to the nearest mill or looking after babies while women were being trained (Mahat 2004a; Rana- Deuba 2001). Sharing of household chores such as ironing became more acceptable to men in Sri Lanka after the households were electrified (Masse and Ratnayake 2003). In the Nepal case study, it was seen that once biogas plants were used for cooking, men and other family members became more willing to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "36154260-4d80-44a0-88a0-7a25dbc0be13": {"__data__": {"id_": "36154260-4d80-44a0-88a0-7a25dbc0be13", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "99a6156dbaa0293e168f8445098bb13c1da16733b39b728c99e1ab4afe28d661"}}, "hash": "99a6156dbaa0293e168f8445098bb13c1da16733b39b728c99e1ab4afe28d661", "text": "lend a hand in kitchen tasks. With electrification, major time savings occur in grinding and milling activities. In Nepal, it was reported that after the installation of a microhydropower plant, the total time spent in milling and grinding, including travel and waiting time, fell (Mahat 2004a). The waiting time was drastically reduced because processing was speedy unlike the traditional water mill. The evidence shows a rather mixed picture of the impact that improved energy services have on gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. Electrification and other modern fuels do not appear to lead immediately to increased leisure time for women. In most of the studies reviewed, women extended their working hours or used time saved to improve their productive or reproductive work outputs. There is some evidence that women in electrified households do spend more time watching television and listening to the radio and in several studies this was found to result in their increased empowerment. Insufficient research has been done on energy access and women\u2019s reading and literacy, to draw firm conclusions. 138 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences MDGS 4, 5, and 6 \u2013 Health The 570 million households that continue to depend on traditional biomass for their energy needs are exposed to high levels of indoor air pollution. Conservative estimates of global mortality from indoor air pollution caused by solid fuels show that between 1.5 and 2 million deaths were attributed to this cause in 2000. The deaths are concentrated among women and children in poorer households and rural populations. Improving access to clean, modern fuels, such as biogas, can lead to fewer deaths from this cause. There is abundant evidence that cooking with improved cook stoves can reduce the incidence of devastating airborne respiratory infection in children below five years of age. Increasing energy supplies to rural clinics, generally heat, lighting and refrigeration, improves the quality of health services delivery as, for example, vaccines can be refrigerated and lighting allows medical emergencies after sunset to be treated. Where babies are now delivered by the light of kerosene wick lanterns, use of bright electric lights will contribute to reduced infant mortality and mortality to women from childbirth. As discussed earlier, energy also improves literacy and this in turn has a significant impact on health issues. Public communication remains an integral part of the fight against major diseases, especially HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. In Indonesia, some 5,500 clinics have replaced refrigerators powered by kerosene and diesel with those that are solar powered; globally, the Cold Chain Program has provided solar-powered refrigerators in remote areas of Africa and Asia; the USAID programme on solar light for Africa has provided power and light to 1,500 facilities in rural East Africa. Those installations permit preservation of vaccines because of high reliability and eliminate the need for kerosene and LPG for refrigerators. However, it has to be recognized that there are many factors besides refrigeration that determine the success of vaccination campaigns, and no studies were identified that linked the availability of power directly with increased numbers of immunized children. At the household and community levels, electrification appears to work in a variety of ways to improve health, including through increased food production resulting from irrigation and income from other activities enabled by electrification. A study based on a large sample survey in Bangladesh found that households with electricity were more likely to seek assistance from medically competent persons and more likely to have ante-natal and post-natal check ups and receive vaccinations (Barkat et al. 2002). Infant mortality in electrified households was 42.7 per 1,000 live births compared with 53.8 for non-electrified households in electrified villages and 57.8 for households in non-electrified villages. This is 25 percent less than the national infant mortality rate and 35 percent less than the rural average. MDG 7 \u2013 Environmental sustainability Renewable energy systems produce little or no air or water pollution and their use can prevent or reduce land degradation and habitat destruction from mining and traditional fuel gathering. Regarding water, improved energy access, especially from renewable energy, can improve the quantity of water available by allowing the use of electrified pumps that can access hitherto untapped water supplies. In addition, improved energy availability can enhance the quality of the water supply by treating the available water resources (for example, through boiling and filtering) to make them safe for drinking. One of the RET projects that has quantified environmental benefits is the CFSP in Cambodia. Market analyses and sales figures of ICS producers show a total of more than 70,000 ICS-using families in the third year of the CFSP programme.

The areas of charcoal supply are not necessarily where ICS users live, so the benefits of reduced deforestation are not felt directly by them. CFSP is assessing the feasibility of establishing energy plantations to further reduce cutting of the national forest. 139 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Box 7-5 Empowering rural women \u2013 lessons from REDP The Rural Energy Development Programme of Nepal, initiated in 1996, aims to enhance rural livelihoods through the installation of microhydropower systems. Expansion of sustainable rural energy systems is seen as an entry point for economic development and poverty alleviation. The programme stresses community mobilization, bottom-up participatory planning and decentralized decision making. Productive income-generating activities are targeted as the intended end uses of the energy supplied, and skill training is provided to promote agricultural and home-based businesses. The project ensures equity and empowerment of both women and men from every target household through the establishment of separate women\u2019s and men\u2019s community organizations, which form the basic functional unit of the programme. The equal opportunities offered have had a visible and positive impact in mobilizing women and integrating them into mainstream activities. The women in community organizations have a distinct voice in local affairs and their capability for independent and collective action has increased. Two out of the five microhydropower schemes in a remote district in the far west of Nepal (an area where women have the lowest social status) are chaired by women. The project has directly resulted in reduced drudgery in household tasks and an increase in productive and community roles (Rana-Deuba 2001). Energy access and energy security for the poor In this section, we discuss the issues of meeting subsistence-level energy needs. The renewables that have been widely utilized to meet the basic needs of the poor include: \u2022 Home lighting and communications through solar PV lanterns and home systems and solar PV and small hydropower micro-grids; and \u2022 Cooking and home lighting through biogas plants and improved cook stoves. Table 7-5 presents an estimation of the quantities of energy required for various applications by rural households in India. For the case studies, the issue of energy access was examined in terms of how effective the various policy measures and financing mechanisms have been in terms of improving energy access for the poor. This was assessed by studying: Table 7-5 Energy and rural household applications in India Category Type of requirement Impacts Approximate en- ergy requirement Subsistence Electricity for lighting and other domestic requirements, particularly for entertainment Improved living standard, educational status, fostering lighting-based income generating activities 150 W/h Water for drinking Meeting the minimum requirement for drinking and hygiene 3.75 kW/village Productive Water pumping for crop irrigation Increased food production with increased income 7.00 kW/village Small-scale industry Increased income 5.0 kW/village Empowerment and quality of life Street lighting Meeting requirement of safety, health and social interaction 0.5 kW/village Primary health care 150 W/h 250 W Source: TERI 2005 140 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences \u2022 The ownership pattern of RETs to establish whether RETs are really reaching the poorer segments of the communities or not;

The levelized energy cost is dominated, for renewables, by the initial capital costs, and it is those initial costs that are a barrier to direct purchase of the equipment. Mechanisms to provide low-interest long- term financing for energy services that use renewables can make the energy services affordable and are essential for the large-scale use of renewables to serve the poor and less well-off members of society. Access to RETs Data collected in the primary surveys show that while small hydropower systems did improve the access of the poor to energy services, solar home systems are being accessed only by the relatively better-off households (table 7-6). The only case study on improved cook stoves in Cambodia indicates that ICSs were being accessed by relatively better-off households. In Madi, in the district of Chitwan in Nepal, where the only case study covering biogas plants was conducted, incomes of households using biogas was found to be almost three times higher than incomes of non-user households. 141 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Box 7-6 Measures to extend RETs to the poor led by the private sector In Nepal, private sector operators have taken on the responsibility for including the poor among the beneficiaries of their projects. In the Andhikhola Hydel and Rural Electrification Project (AHREP) in western Nepal and in the Jhankre Rural Electrification and Development Project (JREDP), which are both minihydropower schemes, out of 60 electrified households in the sample, 20 or one third were found to have incomes below the national poverty line. Clearly, AHREP\u2019s and JREDP\u2019s rural electrification efforts have succeeded in reaching those most in need. To make the electricity affordable to even the poorest of the poor, a cut-out system (fixed charge) was adopted. The cut-out system is made up of different capacities starting from 25 watts, and works out to be much cheaper than the metered tariff for very low income consumers. This tariff is designed to allow the very poor to pay for only one bulb at prices below what they were paying for kerosene. The cost to the company is limited by not having to read the meter every month. Tariff system of AHREP and JREDP for the cut-out system Cut-out capacity (watts) 25 50 100 250 400 Rate per month (NRs) 19 39 66 116 179 Additional measures are the availability of tayari wiring or a ready-made wiring harness that can be assembled at a workshop and fitted into the house. This provides basic but safe house wiring in katcha or not strongly-built houses where it is not possible to have properly installed house wiring. The cut-out is also much less expensive than installing a meter. An employee of AHREP claimed that they have provided electricity to the poor with a total expenditure of NRs 680, inclusive of all services and materials. This is quite small compared with Nepal Electricity Authority\u2019s connection cost of about NRs 2,500. As no meter reading is required, such systems also help reduce the utility\u2019s monitoring and administrative costs. JREDP has provided energy meters at subsidized rates affordable to even the poor. Butwal Power Company has demonstrated that if initial costs can be reduced and the basic minimum charge per month can be brought down to allow just one bulb subscription, even the poorest households find that their electricity costs are lower than when they were using kerosene for lighting. In the Nepal case study, while the average income of microhydropower users was found to be NRs 71,197, many of the user households had annual incomes as low as NRs 10,000.68 Seventy-seven percent of the respondents who had access to power from microhydropower plants had incomes of less than US$1 per day, while 21 percent had incomes below the poverty line. Two factors made it possible for the poor to access electricity: first, the poor participated in the project by contributing labour \u2013 \u201csweat equity\u201d \u2013 and smaller monetary contributions, and the tariff was only NRs 60 per month, equivalent to the cost of 1.3 litres of kerosene; and second, in some villages, the community instituted \u201cinclusive\u201d cost-sharing mechanisms such that families with higher incomes invested a larger amount than poorer households.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6b8fbad7-7f46-44ba-9749-484de296d507": {"__data__": {"id_": "6b8fbad7-7f46-44ba-9749-484de296d507", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1b4bb017a3776c1a75819efa5489657aa62e9b13e3b43854bffbbdb1a6047fdd"}, "2": {"node_id": "14b12ee6-0d3a-44b5-b4a5-0fe868e19c5c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1a1bcd73cf7cdfb9b52d61ac7ae17c7196de5e7f4460603fbd85462ccfd4a2bd"}}, "hash": "46b08b700334d5e542f2a63f229edba0cb1680efe34cca09ad3df964062ce2e7", "text": "The mechanisms to ensure inclusiveness have to do with community cohesiveness and governance systems rather than with renewables.

Khmer Solar is passing on its US$100,000 loan from the Triodos Renewable Energy for Development Fund by offering a credit programme on SHS purchases by residents of Battambang Province. Under the programme, customers may pay in full for the 40-85 Wp systems within six months at no interest, or in one year at 5 percent annual interest. There are two indictors that the loans are being accessed by the relatively well off. Firstly, by design, the project is being implemented in Battambang, a rice-growing area; the credit programme allows people to purchase an SHS prior to the harvest.

The loan seems to 142 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences have been very effective in drawing people in to purchase an SHS, but those using it are still mostly able to pay the full cost relatively quickly. The Cambodian case study focused on improved cook stoves, which are costlier than traditional ones. Even though income disparities could not be captured, a difference was observed in the asset ownership, between ICS owners and others. ICSs can be purchased for US$2-US$4 depending on the size, and an average family spends about US$7 per month on charcoal. Since the use of ICSs can help reduce fuel costs by an average of 22 percent, approximately US$1.50 per month can be saved by ICS users, paying back their initial investment in 2-4 months. In general, users of ICSs tend to be concentrated in urban and peri-urban areas, while traditional stove users are mainly in rural, un-electrified areas. As a result, the use of diesel gensets is higher among non-users. In contrast, the use of rice cookers is higher among ICS users as the cookers needs reliable (grid) electricity. More ICS users own cars, motors, gas stoves and rice cookers, while the ownership of television sets and other less valuable assets like bicycles is about the same. The survey revealed that in spite of the higher cost, ICSs are desired by the poor, though this group is still limited in what it can afford and finds loans difficult to access owing to high interest rates. Energy security One of the common advantages of RETs, encountered in all the case studies, is a lowering of dependence on fossil fuels and imported energy sources, especially kerosene and dry cells. This is particularly significant in places such as the Pacific island countries which are heavily dependent on imported petroleum. Because of rapidly increasing costs of petroleum products, the replacement of a few litres of kerosene for lighting can save significant amounts of money in households, and more importantly, reduce the uncertainties involved in procuring kerosene oil. The same situation prevails in remote mountain communities in Nepal where the cost of kerosene is much higher than in the cities because of the added cost of transportation. Furthermore, there is no reliability of access especially during the monsoon season when roads are blocked and bridges washed away. The field survey in Nepal indicated that after electrification, each household saved on average 4 litres of kerosene per month (or approximately NRs 200 per month). The vulnerability of the poor with respect to uncertain supplies relates not only to quantity shortages but also to the failure of the public distribution system, which is the primary means of supplying kerosene oil to the poor, to reach the poorest. Because kerosene is considered to be the fuel of the poor, many Governments keep its taxation low so that it remains affordable. In reality, what ensues in most cases is quite different from the intended consequences. Apart from distorting economic signals to consumers, the large price differential between kerosene and vehicular fuel makes adulteration an attractive proposition. Furthermore, the benefit of lower kerosene prices is often not confined to the poor. It has been estimated that almost half of the subsidized kerosene in Nepal is used by hotels and restaurants in urban areas rather than going to the rural areas for which it was meant. In such situations, a saving of a few litres of kerosene every month can mean a lot to poor households.

This seems to be an attractive proposition since a one-time subsidy for an RET can provide relief from recurrent subsidies for kerosene. TERI has proposed this for India. Recently the Government of Nepal set aside some funds to provide white LED lighting powered by small 3-watt panels to all households in the remote Karnali Zone which suffers from high prices and unreliable supplies of kerosene. Sustainability of the markets for renewable energy products and services There are major challenges in the sustainability of rural energy markets created and served by the private sector. Because of typically remote and dispersed locations, the costs of investment as well as routine maintenance are high for PV, microhydropower and biogas systems. Many RE projects have received significant donor financing for the investment costs. Yet the tariffs charged to the rural poor often cannot cover even the operation and maintenance costs. Profitability is elusive unless government agencies provide the financial, institutional and policy incentives for the private sector to act on behalf of the Government in extending infrastructure services to the poor. Within the Asian and Pacific region, a wide range of measures have been put in place to ensure the sustainability of renewable energy projects. One commonly adopted strategy is to establish community-based management systems that oversee the operations and maintenance, as well as tariff collection. The Jhankre Rural Electrification and Development Project in Nepal has constituted a six-member management committee (all elected from among VDC members) that decides the rural 143 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences electrification and community development plans and priorities in coordination with the project. Local participation has been commendable in performing project activities. Technical know-how, materials and skilled personnel are provided from the project side, while the community provides unskilled labour and support, rights of way and so on. The Nepal case study also demonstrates how the setting up of a strong nodal institution, AEPC, can contribute to the market development process, building the confidence of the private sector, and functioning as an intermediary institution between the operational level (NGOs or private promoters) and the policy-making level. A good example of a donor-led market development process, leading to a sustainable private sector business, is the case of Rahimafrooz in Bangladesh. An important outcome of the REREDP was the recognition by private sector entities, such as Rahimafrooz, that the renewable energy sector in Bangladesh is a very lucrative one and along with making profits, can meet many of the social objectives of the Government, thus giving more support to such activities. Based on the success of the REREDP programme, Rahimafrooz, on its own initiative, is planning to offer smaller systems (approximately 10 watts), ranging in cost from Tk 5,000 \u2013 Tk 7,000 (approximately US$69 \u2013 US$107) in an effort to reach a larger audience. In addition to the smaller systems, other products that may be offered include compact fluorescent (CFL) and torchiere fluorescent (TFL) lamps and fixed 6, 10 and 18 watt LED lamps. Rahimafrooz has estimated that there are about 9.2 million households in the country that constitute a market for LED-based lighting systems but will not be able to afford the SHSs promoted under REREDP. At present, the company is exploring financing options, including the possibility of payment through instalments . A similar approach is being adopted by the Cambodia Fuelwood Savings Project, which provides technical assistance and enterprise development support to private manufacturers to produce and market improved stoves. The programme is, however, facing some bottlenecks in expansion. The primary challenge comes from the stove manufacturers most of whom are reluctant to expand their businesses, as they are reluctant to hire additional staff outside the family, want to avoid unwanted attention from local authorities, and face capital constraints in acquiring new equipment and raw materials. CFSP is trying to address this challenge by setting up a training centre that would train new stove producers and build the financial and managerial capacity of those already producing the stoves. In addition to increasing the number of trained stove producers, the institute will produce an estimated 2,000 stoves per month once running at full capacity. This will increase total ICS production in Cambodia by 50 percent. Quality control is another sustainability issue that the CFSP is likely to face as it expands. Cambodia thus far seems to have this obstacle under control, as production is concentrated in the group of stove builders trained by", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ad41ea25-761e-4a8d-a934-9bc60a8e87bd": {"__data__": {"id_": "ad41ea25-761e-4a8d-a934-9bc60a8e87bd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "08aa846efdad26eb02826b606b53bc3c742a20ae32bc2b0228881ff4cf28d3ac"}}, "hash": "08aa846efdad26eb02826b606b53bc3c742a20ae32bc2b0228881ff4cf28d3ac", "text": "CFSP and will likely remain so for some time, though this group will grow with the planned training centre. Under the model of Government-enabled market development (discussed in chapter 6), public funds are utilized to provide a partial subsidy and to leverage high quality systems, as for example, in the case of AEPC Nepal, BSP Nepal, REREDP Bangladesh and RERED Sri Lanka. In all those projects, the objective has been to provide subsidies to \u201cprime the pump\u201d and there is an implicit assumption that the subsidies will be reduced and the market will take over the process. The initial subsidy investments were made as much to support market linkages (company establishment, retail networks) as to buy down the cost. Once the market network is in place and business volume has increased, the cost of supplying new systems is reduced. The project plays a facilitating role, while letting the free market operate. It provides support in the form of generic promotional campaigns, setting technical specifications and warranty and service requirements, but competitors are free to set prices and adopt their own marketing strategies. This should establish a sustainable model for future supply. The overall performance of RET delivery models led by the private sector has been mixed. The key sustainability elements for various technology delivery models are summarized in Table 7-7. Lessons learned Both anecdotal and survey evidence indicates that the use of renewables can help to reduce poverty in many circumstances. However, those kinds of poverty reduction impacts have not yet occurred at truly substantial scales, enough to make a real difference to the overall energy-poverty situation. Important lessons with respect to the contribution of RETs towards poverty reduction are discussed below. 144 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Table 7-7 Sustainability of RET delivery models Microhydropower-based electrification, with com- munity Saving in energy expenditure Improvement in quality of life Direct income genera- tion benefits Access High.

Technical sustainability High. Local people are trained to operate and service the hydropower plants High. The level of technology is simple to use and maintain with local skills.

Renewables offer important social and quality of life benefits. Renewables offer a variety of social benefits from lighting, television and radio powered by solar home systems, mini-grids and biogas, and even some economic benefits from reduced kerosene and candle use. Solar home systems provide benefits that increase household welfare and quality of life, including improved lighting for children\u2019s education, adult study, evening cottage industry, as well as television and radio. However, in a review of its experience, the German international technological cooperation organization, GTZ, said that so far there is little evidence that SHSs have an impact on poverty alleviation. GTZ concluded that rural households do not buy solar home systems for reduced energy costs, but rather for improved services like longer television viewing and better lighting quality. Biogas and improved cook stoves reduce expenditures for fuelwood, either in time or in money, as well as create jobs.

A summary of the various quality of life benefits accorded by RETs is presented in Table 7-8. 145 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Box 7-7 A flawed renewable energy initiative in the Solomon Islands The Irri microhydropower system has been in place for the last 23 years in the Solomon Islands in the Pacific.69 The rated capacity of the plant was 12 kW and it provided electricity to 30 households (approximately 400 watts per household). Even though there are no data on actual power usage, the capacity appeared more than sufficient to meet the needs of households, as well as a small saw mill and wood shop that were installed after the power plant was commissioned. Initially, some households reported using electricity for income production when the hydropower system worked, however there is no evidence that the overall economic development of the village has benefited from the system in the years since it was installed. Indeed, some village elders consider the village to be worse off today than before the hydropower installation. From a poverty alleviation standpoint, there is no compelling evidence that the hydropower installation made any difference one way or the other. The saw mill and the wood shop closed very soon because of lack of markets. Today most households have no access to clean water or proper sanitation and the general condition of the village and of the villager\u2019s lives is said by the villagers themselves to have changed little. Merely having access to energy has not been a significant stimulus to either economic or social improvement for households in Irri though the perception of the villagers is that some benefits have accrued; if nothing else, there seems to be at least a perception of progress that was not present before the hydropower installation. In the two decades following the hydropower installation, there has been almost no investment by the community in either larger appliances or in income-generating activities that depend on electricity. The reason for this lack of development appears to be the result of factors other than energy access including, but probably not limited to, market access problems, unreliability of the power supply, lack of business skills and lack of access to finance for income activity development.

The main problems facing efforts for poverty reduction through renewables do not appear to be a lack of access to energy but rather a lack of access to markets, limited capital resources for production investment and a widespread lack of the management skills needed to properly allocate available resources. Certainly energy is a factor but only one of many that need to come together if a poverty reduction programme is to succeed. This has been experienced time and again throughout Asia and the Pacific. For there to be genuine poverty reduction, a total development package needs to be prepared that includes energy access but also the following (Fishbein 2003): \u2022 Knowledge and skill for small businesses, households and farmers on how to use new- found electrical and motive power for profitable enterprise; \u2022 Technical and financial management capacity of small businesses, households and farmers, including availability of credit and microcredit to finance productive tools and equipment; \u2022 A policy and institutional environment conducive to business development, willingness to promote decentralized services, and so on; \u2022 Access to markets for additional or new goods produced or services offered as a result of new electrical, heat or motive power; and \u2022 Availability of a minimum of other complementary infrastructure services, such as transport, water supply and ICT services. There are few RET programmes with specific poverty reduction goals and those that exist are largely donor-funded and not commercially sustainable. However, many of them provide models for sustainable widespread application if public-private partnerships can be established that enable the private sector to work effectively. The programmes most likely to be successful are those that work to improve energy service provision for the rural poor using energy sources such as charcoal, wood, batteries or diesel, which are already in use, such as improved cook stove projects. There is a significant information gap, however, when it comes to energy-poverty linkages, and many \u201cenergy\u201d projects do not track poverty impacts while \u201cpoverty\u201d projects do not tap into the potential contributions of RETs. Nepal is one of the few countries that have a number of large poverty-oriented renewable energy programmes that have strong private sector participation as well. They are the UNDP-initiated REDP, the BSP, the improved water mills programme and the DANIDA-supported Energy Sector Assistance Program Leveraging and facilitating corporate social responsibility Private sector initiatives that spring from commitments to corporate social responsibility can contribute to helping the poor to improve their well being and income, but the initiatives are limited by the resources of the individual companies and by their need to remain profitable. United Nations agencies, multilateral development banks, private foundations, international and local religious organizations and others are expanding the reach and impact of those initiatives by supporting companies and NGOs that have such commitments. In some of the most effective larger efforts of this kind, NGOs are the financial intermediaries between the companies offering renewable energy systems and services and the customers, including poor rural families and community organizations. NGOs often establish and support self-help groups that are able to take on collective responsibility for purchases, including bulk buying RE equipment and devices. 147 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences (a) Bangladesh \u2013 Grameen Shakti and IDCOL In Bangladesh, Grameen Shakti has sold and installed over 65,000 solar home-systems in rural areas, with important benefits for users. It is the largest installer of SHSs in Bangladesh. These PV systems provide lighting, communications (especially via mobile phone charging) and television, and have led to increased opportunities for employment. Users purchase their systems on microcredit with affordable terms, tailored to their specific needs. Funding for the microcredit system comes from the World Bank and GEF via IDCOL. IDCOL in turn provides Grameen Shakti with both subsidies and concessional loans. The cash pool from credit repayments will enable Grameen Shakti to continue the scheme when the subsidy, which is being phased out, ceases in 2008. Grameen Shakti has initiated a network of technology centres throughout Bangladesh to manage the installation and maintenance of solar home systems. Focusing on technicians who know local customs, it has trained 2,000 technicians, most of them women. Grameen Shakti believes that the potential exists to install one million systems by 2015.

SELCO has pointed out that poor people are able to afford modern energy services \u2013 and that PV is actually cheaper for the poor in comparison with kerosene lamps and dry cell batteries. Lack of initial capital is a major obstacle and SELCO does not provide credit or loans, but it has developed good working relationships with local banks and microcredit organizations. This has given finance organizations the confidence to provide credit for PV systems, as well as an understanding of the payment terms which different owners may need. Some users work directly with the finance organizations, others work through self-help groups that provide additional security that a loan will be repaid. An immediate benefit to users is the provision of clean, good-quality light and electricity for small appliances. Good light improves morale and opportunities in ways that are difficult to quantify but easy to observe. Children and adults have the opportunity to read and to study, domestic tasks are Profitability is central to private sector activities and market strategies require going after the most profitable markets first. Public sector, donor and NGO support for the private sector can help it to undertake specific initiatives that address poverty alleviation needs explicitly and the private sector can contribute to poverty reduction and to social and economic development while maintaining sufficient profitability. Corporate social responsibility is an important theme for some companies and this can help in terms of private sector contributions to poverty alleviation. In an address to the World Economic Forum on 31 January 1999, the former Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, challenged business leaders to join an international initiative \u2013 the Global Compact \u2013 that would bring companies together with agencies of the United Nations, labour and civil society to support universal environmental and social principles. The Global Compact\u2019s operational phase was launched at United Nations Headquarters in New York on 26 July 2000. Today, thousands of companies from all regions of the world, international labour and civil society organizations are engaged in the Global Compact, working to advance 10 universal principles in the areas of human rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption. Through the power of collective action, the United Nations Global Compact seeks to promote responsible corporate citizenship so that business can be part of the solution to the challenges of globalization. In this way, the private sector \u2013 in partnership with other social actors \u2013 can help realize the Secretary-General\u2019s vision of a more sustainable and inclusive global economy.

Vendors avoid the smell, heat and fire hazards of kerosene lamps. For both homes and street vendors, the reliability of the PV systems is a major benefit. While there may be a few days each year in the monsoon season where there is insufficient light output, this is in a region where the electricity grids fail for an average of four hours per day. In the Belthangadi region in Karnataka, SELCO\u2019s principal partner is the NGO Shri Ksetra Dharmastala Rural Development Project (SKDRDP), which runs a network of 5,000 self-help groups. The groups meet to support members in domestic and farming matters and make regular savings. If a member wants a loan, the group decides whether it is an appropriate purchase, and the group as a whole takes out the loan. Although there is great enthusiasm to purchase SHSs in this way, the groups make sure that members have covered more basic needs, such as like wells or farming equipment, before they invest in an SHS. Most of the 3,000 solar home systems that the local SELCO service centre has installed have been for members of self-help groups. Communities have a key role to play in enabling access to energy services for the poor. Community-managed small hydropower plants can be quite effective in improving access of the poor to modern energy. The Nepal rural electrification case studies are good examples of how the communities have taken it upon themselves to ensure that their poorer members are able to take advantage of community infrastructure. This type of social cohesion may be one of the most effective ways in which the poor can benefit from renewable energy systems that are accessed by an off-grid community that has a range of income levels.

For this to happen, awareness campaigns have to be launched at the community level, including demonstration projects, for potential users to judge the capability of each technology. Solar PV technologies have provided access to basic electricity services for the poor. Solar home systems permit replacement of kerosene lamps and of car batteries that are externally charged. Small PV systems provide an entry-level, limited electricity service of good quality. A global study of SHS installations is reported to have calculated that about half of all installations covered in the study fell in the 35-54W range and that 93 percent of the systems installed were used for powering lights alone or for running lights, DC television sets and radios for a few hours every day (Kapadia 2004). SHSs and portable battery or high-efficiency lighting units provide considerable health benefits by eliminating kerosene lights with their harmful emissions and other hazards. They can also facilitate some small-scale, income-enhancing opportunities such as keeping shops open, or carrying out activities such as basket weaving or sewing in the evening, and charging cellular phones for rural communications businesses. Small PV systems can also provide the electricity that can improve the quality of handmade items such as clothing and furniture significantly and, at the same time, reduce the time spent in their production substantially, by providing both the power for small hand tools and electric sewing machines, as well as the light that permits night work and provides focused, bright illumination for hand work. The poorest members of society may be able to afford just a small rechargeable battery or LED lighting unit; the less poor can access larger systems through access to microcredit loans that can support PV units for microenterprises. (A very wide range of PV-powered productive activities that can employ the poor and social services that can benefit the poor was discussed in chapter 3.) Facilitating the links among renewable energy, private investment and pov- erty reduction None of the policies related to the production and application of renewable energy technologies in the Asian and Pacific region provide or support explicit linkages with enhancing access for the poor to modern energy services. Specific initiatives are presented here and in chapter 8 that support the explicit linking of renewable energy applications to increased incomes and improved social conditions among the poor, while also sustaining greater gender equality in access and opportunity. UNDP\u2019s project experience, including its support (via ESMAP) of the Global Village Energy Partnership and the Global Network on Energy and Sustainable Development provides substantial evidence for approaches that do make these linkages explicit and effective. Some of the recommendations below and in the following chapter reflect this project experience and growing knowledge base. 149 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences The successful commercialization of RETs worldwide has made renewable energy components and systems available in the marketplaces of most countries in the Asia and Pacific region. Universal access to modern energy services from renewables will be paced by increased incomes for the poor and greater affordability of the energy equipment and services. Other pathways to increased energy services access for the poor will be through community-based systems and subsidized systems. A \u201ccommercialization plus\u201d approach would include more targeted subsidies for the poor; linking commercialization models with productive end uses; cross-subsidies from the grid or petroleum sales for more sustainable sources of subsidy; or transferring kerosene subsidies to RETs. While this paper focuses on identifying and making explicit the links between increased use of RETs and measurable progress towards the MDGs, achievement of the MDGs in any particular area will be a collective activity, in which, for example, improvement in access to decent health services and resulting health quality will make it possible for people to learn more effectively and to work with greater energy and efficiency. It is often not possible to identify a unique cause-and-effect link between RET applications and improvement in the conditions reflected in the MDGs because the entire process is collective and systemic. The following discussion focuses on ways to increase modern energy services access for the poor, through RETs where they are appropriate, and in support of social and economic development. i. Designing effective subsidies Well-designed and appropriate subsidies can help economically sound investments become financially viable. Subsidies that are applied inappropriately, such as give-away programmes or equipment have had adverse effects on renewable energy markets in several countries. Such subsidies rather discourage entrepreneurs and raise expectations among consumers that", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5d0565a3-d7e7-49dd-8d58-ce0f35d7f88d": {"__data__": {"id_": "5d0565a3-d7e7-49dd-8d58-ce0f35d7f88d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "983f2983d1095ca150f099c128ad959ed42c29371b57cbb898bd546d39d93d22"}}, "hash": "983f2983d1095ca150f099c128ad959ed42c29371b57cbb898bd546d39d93d22", "text": "cannot be met. Beneficiaries often have little or no ownership, which results in unsustainable projects. A common failure is the assumption that facilities for the maintenance and repair of installed equipment will be established or exist over the long term after the project ends. Another challenge is that rural electricity or liquid fuel subsidies, intended to help the poor, may not reach them. They can adversely affect the consumers who use lower-cost, sustainable energy alternatives. Besides, often a general concern of technology-specific subsidies relates to whether it can be ensured that subsidies reach the poor and not just middle-income groups. Based on experience, subsidy schemes that are economically rational, performance-based and time-bound are likely to be effective. Reducing up-front costs is preferable to paying for operational costs, because the funds for subsidizing operating costs in the long-term can be inherently uncertain. ii. Supporting innovation Preparing sustainable energy projects often requires additional analytical and policy studies at a preliminary stage, making the preparation costs for \u201cfirst-off\u201d projects in a country high. These have then declined through experience. Consequently, trust funds and GEF assistance to cover project preparation expenses have been utilized in many World Bank projects. Because additional investments are crucial to developing a broad range of energy alternatives and the costs are outside the Bank\u2019s normal business operations, partnerships with donors facilitate this work (World Bank 2004). Specific recommendations regarding scaling up support for innovation in renewable energy applications for poverty alleviation and increased gender equality in access to opportunity are given in chapter 8. iii. Strengthening cross-sector linkages with energy services The fundamental challenge is to integrate energy into non-energy sectors. Rural energy services provision needs to be closely coordinated with income generation, SME promotion, health, education, telecommunicatons and water supply programmes. Also essential are initiatives that help provide renewable energy equipment to microenterprises, with resulting increased incomes. While there are many individual examples of this (for example, sewing and tailoring using PV-powered sewing machines in Bangladesh and India), they are rarely the result of coherent programmes that address the needs of microenterprises, including for energy services. One exception that is notable by its relative rarity is the promotion of PV-powered telecommunications kiosks that are profitable and owned by women. Although initiated by Grameen Shakti in Bangladesh, this particular type of PV-powered microenterprise has been appearing elsewhere in Asia, as well as in Africa and Latin America. In most of the Asian and Pacific region and, indeed, worldwide in the developing countries, there is inadequate operational knowledge as to how to incorporate energy (and other infrastructure 150 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences investments) into agricultural, health, water and other similar sector projects. Most development practitioners do not understand the full range of energy options available to them in rural areas. It is a challenge for the renewable energy community to help the larger development community, which is committed to poverty reduction, integrate energy products and services into their programmes. The broad alliance that needs to be created to make this happen must include those actors that are best at cross-sectoral linkages on the ground. The most important categories of these integrators include the following: a.\ufffdMicrofinance\ufffdinstitutions\ufffd(MFIs). Microfinance institutions have a globally recognized role in reducing poverty. They are already financing millions of poor people around the world to invest in microenterprises. More recently SEEDS in Sri Lanka and other innovative MFIs have begun to finance the purchase of solar home systems and other renewable energy technologies. Their knowledge of the enterprise sector \u2013 particularly the microenterprises that are of most interest to the poor \u2013 makes them uniquely knowledgeable about the best points to integrate energy products into income generation for the poor. While the renewable energy community has begun to approach MFIs to provide credit facilities for rural consumers to purchase RETs, it has yet to invest significantly in increasing their capabilities to integrate energy into a broad range of productive, income-generating activities. Grameen Shakti in Bangladesh has the rather unique position of being a renewable energy provider with its roots in microcredit through its parent company, Grameen Bank. It has shown how the poor can use energy services to increase their incomes through microenterprises as vendors of phone services, fruit sellers, tailors and barbers. b. Agencies promoting SMEs. There is a large community of development organizations including the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the International Labour Organization (ILO), development banks, bilateral donors, and NGOs, that are supporting SMEs to increase their productivity. A few efforts have started along the lines of cleaner production and energy efficiency to improve the long term sustainability of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "94fb34a9-b2de-4417-9e3f-d379bc8b144b": {"__data__": {"id_": "94fb34a9-b2de-4417-9e3f-d379bc8b144b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9dd7efeaab4f5dd360dc64552bcda0f1fe4e4faf01ee6c1f88ce6e9bbe8472e8"}}, "hash": "9dd7efeaab4f5dd360dc64552bcda0f1fe4e4faf01ee6c1f88ce6e9bbe8472e8", "text": "those enterprises. SMEs are widely recognized as being the way employment will be created in developing countries. There is an opportunity to expand on this engagement and in a methodical way integrate energy options (including the role of RETs such as solar thermal, biomass cogeneration, self generation of wind and hydropower) into programmes that support SMEs. Those options can increase the energy security of SMEs and improve their productivity enabling them to expand production and employ more people. c.Promotion of microenterprise with renewable energy. Some microcredit institutions provide technical and financial help to individual entrepreneurs among the poor, as well as to small community groups (largely to women) to assist them in developing microenterprises that can increase their incomes. UNDP has established an extensive system in West Africa, starting in Mali, to enable groups of rural women to lease or own multi-function platforms that allow them to expand their agricultural production, reduce time required for formerly manual tasks such as grain grinding, and to achieve new social status through their incomes. Biomass-based cogeneration of heat and electricity provided the power for a small farmers\u2019 rural coconut cooperative in the Philippines, powering the production of high-value goods from coconuts and employing members from over 120 very poor rural families. This is another type of multi-function platform with potential for wide replication and diffusion. The approach is one that UNDP could help to replicate among the poor (Weingart 2003). d. NGOs. Many NGOs have the experience, capacity and direct contact with local communities to bring rural infrastructure services to them while developing community ownership of the facilities. Many of the most effective NGOs are small, with ten to thirty staff members, often including volunteers. They represent a crucial pool of knowledge, know-how, experience and community connection. Many of them work in an inherently cross-sectoral manner, working to bring electricity, clean fuels, potable water, health and educational services, as well as communications options to communities. New ways to empower such NGOs further and broaden their reach need to be found and this must be done in concert with the NGOs themselves as well as the communities they serve, to ensure that the efforts of the international donor and lending community will really contribute to a broadened and accelerated impact of NGO engagement. 151 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences e. Renewable energy vendors. Private sector vendors of RETs have sprung up in response to market expansion. The vendors are the first point of contact for both consumers and development organizations that wish to purchase energy systems. As a result they are on the front line as integrators of energy products with the energy needs of a diverse range of sectors. Very often creating packages of products that can meet the needs of a particular community of users, for example, in the tourism, information technology or agriculture sectors, requires skills that private companies may not have and investment in research and development that they cannot afford in the face of uncertain returns. Support to vendors to improve their skills and investment support to develop their product line to include full packages of products is likely to have high returns in terms of a significant expansion of the uses to which RETs can be put. f. Community-based energy projects. Community-based RETs, such as microhydropower, provide an entry point for holistic development that integrates energy supply with income generation as well as with improvement in health, education and the environment. In addition, those systems also provide energy access to the full community including the poor. Despite their proven performance in a number of countries in Asia and the Pacific, the models have not been scaled up to their full potential. Approaches such as the Renewable Energy Development Prgramme in Nepal and the Aga Khan Rural Support Programme in Pakistan are only slowly being replicated in other countries in the region. This needs to be accelerated so that hundreds of thousands of communities that could benefit from those systems can do so. g. Local and national governments. Governments have a clear role to play as integrators. Government agencies working in industry, agriculture, health and education need to better their understanding of the range of options that RETs provide them in making their programmes more effective. Local government can plan energy investments to provide good integration with other economic activities. Central government has a role at the policy level. h. Development banks. The World Bank and ADB invest large sums of money into a range of rural development projects \u2013 including SMEs, industry, agriculture and forestry. Both of those banks have exceeded their recent commitments", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f1ea80f5-6c25-42a4-91ef-0937d19c14a3": {"__data__": {"id_": "f1ea80f5-6c25-42a4-91ef-0937d19c14a3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1be719883abd0ecf224d3866b308a1a45680ae5b8417cef6a4069c28d216296e"}, "3": {"node_id": "31c550bd-31f0-4ffd-a79d-8c3aed119679", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5553cbf5bfc4b274a7b0af61bb2f5fb6e374f72ae0430a5c63ac67ed708cbf4f"}}, "hash": "c9530ce6da65d496e0a58f70a3755cdc44ae91a81492dfa1a4f444241bea7b9e", "text": "to increase investments in RETs since the Bonn 2004 renewable energies conference and they are working to expand the linkage of RETs into their non-energy projects. i. Other United Nations agencies. United Nations agencies work in many of the areas discussed such as agriculture (FAO), industry (UNIDO, ILO), health [World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF)] and education [United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)]. In most cases, these agencies have had and still have active programmes that use renewables to support their mission objectives. Broadening their work and using it as a basis for training and wider information dissemination will be useful in expanding cross-sectoral energy and development initiatives. iv.\ufffdImproving\ufffdthe\ufffdquality\ufffdand\ufffdavailability\ufffdof\ufffdinformation Improved and more comprehensive information is needed at all levels about renewable energy resources, technologies, their costs and effectiveness for relevant stakeholders including potential investors in grid-connected plants, communities and households, financiers and Governments. Improved analytical tools for valuing distributed power supply, intermittent energy resources such as wind, externality benefits and costs and energy portfolio risk, for example, are also needed. Better information on energy efficiency potential and market data would be valuable but too often are not readily available (World Bank 2004). v. Expanding the Engagement of NGOs Elements of this strategy will include the following: \u2022 Expansion and expanded regionalization of such innovative programmes as the Development Marketplace of the World Bank71, including increasing substantially the number and amount of awards for energy-centric, cross-sectoral initiatives and organizations; 152 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences \u2022 Development of documentation and guidelines on a set of best practices for integration of modern energy services with community services and economic development investments and operations; and \u2022 Support for training programmes in the region to permit NGO staff to expand and deepen their capacities, including programmes to train new staff members of the NGOs. vi. Capacity building and training The development community needs to expand its support for capacity building and training activities to contribute to establishing solid, sustainable bases of local capacity for expanding energy services. Support should also be extended to establishing the enabling environment needed for sustaining and scaling up renewable energy applications. International\ufffdalliances\ufffdpromoting\ufffdrenewable\ufffdenergy\ufffdfor\ufffdpoverty\ufffdalleviation International alliances that work to integrate RETs into non-energy development programmes with potential for poverty reduction and empowerment of women need to be expanded, strengthened, and replicated. Such alliances and organizations include the Global Village Energy Partnership and the Global Network on Energy for Sustainable Development, a UNEP-facilitated knowledge network72 of developing country centres of excellence and network partners. GVEP is an established \u201cplatform\u201d for expanding investments in effective use of modern energy services for social and economic development. Creation of a new global fund that mirrors the GEF, but that is focused on the energy- poverty-gender nexus could facilitate substantial scaling up in the application of RETs to poverty alleviation and gender equality. GVEP is presented in more detail below because of its global reach and its strong roots in programmes of UNDP, World Bank, NGOs, industry and Governments. Although funding of those alliances is growing, it remains uncertain for the long term and it is inadequate given the scope of their missions, limiting the extent to which they can facilitate vital linkages among renewables, gender and poverty reduction. New institutional approaches and mechanisms may be needed as well. Institutions that are best placed to be the integrators between the energy sector and potential income-generating sectors for the poor need to be supported by Governments and donors and their capacity built up. The most promising integrators are microfinance institutions, institutions charged with strengthening SMEs, NGOs and community-based organizations working at the community level, as well as private sector vendors of RETs. Encouraging innovation in renewable energy applications for development Encouragement of innovation and increased awareness of the best models for integrating energy with poverty reducing applications could be accomplished through establishment of national annual award programmes as conducted by the Ashden Trust in the United Kingdom at the global level. The World Bank\u2019s Development Marketplace programme is now being replicated in a few developing countries and regions (Philippines, Morocco and West Africa), but needs further replication and broader financial support. The Development Marketplace is a competitive grant programme that funds creative, small-scale development projects that deliver results and have the potential to be expanded or replicated. Awards have been made in over 60 countries to innovative projects that have lasting benefits for the poor.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "31c550bd-31f0-4ffd-a79d-8c3aed119679": {"__data__": {"id_": "31c550bd-31f0-4ffd-a79d-8c3aed119679", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1be719883abd0ecf224d3866b308a1a45680ae5b8417cef6a4069c28d216296e"}, "2": {"node_id": "f1ea80f5-6c25-42a4-91ef-0937d19c14a3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c9530ce6da65d496e0a58f70a3755cdc44ae91a81492dfa1a4f444241bea7b9e"}}, "hash": "5553cbf5bfc4b274a7b0af61bb2f5fb6e374f72ae0430a5c63ac67ed708cbf4f", "text": "The winning programmes, projects and organizations include those applying renewable energy to poverty alleviation and development activities, but energy-related awards are a small fraction of the overall awards.

It builds on past experiences to develop and implement rapidly scalable service delivery models that have the potential to increase access to electricity in client countries by several orders of magnitude. A toolkit has been developed for scaling up rural energy access and a preliminary version is available on the GVEP web site (Cabraal and Wang 2005). Both grid-connected and off-grid power systems are included, and the initiative incorporates both non-renewable and renewable energy options. The project complements the development of the roadmap by creating the tools necessary to assist Bank staff and member country personnel in improving the design and implementation of energy access projects. 153 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences The Global Village Energy Partnership In 1993, a workshop was convened at the United States National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) with 33 representatives from the private sector, government agencies, development organizations, non-government organizations and research institutions to discuss the issues of applying renewable energy in a sustainable manner to international rural development. One of the summary recommendations was that NREL could assist in the renewable energy for rural electrification effort by developing and supplying six related activities: resource assessment; comparative analysis and modeling; performance monitoring and analysis; pilot project development; Internet-based project data; and communications and training. In 1994, in response to this recommendation, NREL launched its Village Power Program consisting of those activities that cut across NREL technologies and disciplines (Flowers 1998). By 1998, NREL was active in 20 countries, with pilot projects in 12 of those countries. At this time the technologies included PV, wind, biomass and hybrids. The rural applications include home lighting and communications, water pumping, schools and health posts, battery-charging stations, ecotourism and village systems. The pilot projects are central to the renewable energy village power development through the demonstration of three aspects essential to replication and implementation of the projects on a significant scale. The three aspects are technical functionality, economic competitiveness and institutional sustainability. It is important to note that the pilot projects from which NREL\u2019s experience has been gained were funded and, in many cases, developed by other organizations and agencies. NREL\u2019s roles included technical assistance and/or project management. Village Power conferences were convened by NREL in 1994 and 1997. The first meeting had less than 50 participants but by the year 1998 the programme had expanded significantly (Flowers 2000). The World Bank and UNDP (through ESMAP) and others co-sponsored the next two international village power conferences, held in 1998 and 2000 at the World Bank, with over 600 participants at each. After the Village Power 2000 Conference, organizations including the World Bank and UNDP through ESMAP, bilateral donors, NREL, Winrock and private companies collaborated to set up a 10-year programme to increase modern energy access, the Global Village Energy Partnership, and an E-Village consultation was carried out involving over 100 organizations worldwide to gain input on the objectives and work programme of the Partnership. In 2004, the hosting of the Partnership was taken over by Practical Action, based in Rugby in the United Kingdom, with ESMAP remaining as one of GVEP\u2019s most active Partners. In 2005, the GVEP Partnership Board created a new legal entity called GVEP International to increase funding opportunities and in July 2006, with a new management team taking over the tasks of the former technical secretariat, GVEP\u2019s offices were relocated to London. In 2006, GVEP added a new dimension to its activities by providing financial support, capacity building and technical assistance to energy SMEs in developing countries. With funding from the Russian Government, GVEP intends to set up two Regional Funds in West and East Africa to build local energy supply chains and foster economic development from the bottom up.

(2002) reported an average time saving of 0.16 hours from the use of ICSs in India; Keizer (1993) reported a time saving of 2.5 hours from use of biogas; Maharjan (2005) reported a time saving of up to 3 hours by use of biogas plants in Nepal; Eastconsult (2004) reported time saving of almost an hour in the hills of Nepal from use of biogas plants; Ratnayake (2000) reported time saving of up to 3.5 hours from use of biogas plants in Sri Lanka; Barnes and Sen (2003) reported no fuelwood had to be collected after the use of biogas plants. Savings are especially high in fuel-scarce areas where women are forced to spend as much as 8-10 hours foraging for fuelwood in the absence of modern energy services. In the fuelwood-scarce area of Rupandehi in Nepal, the average time saved in collecting fuelwood was as high as 5.6 hours per day (Keizer 1993). If one adds to this the time saved in cooking and cleaning, total time savings brought about by use of biogas plants amounts to 6 to 7 hours per day. Anderson (1992), Joint UNDP/World Bank Energy Sector Management Assistance Programme (ESMAP) (2003) and Liu (1993) reported on time saved in cooking; Opdam (1997) and Ratnayake (2000) reported on time saved in cleaning through the use of biogas in Nepal and Sri Lanka, respectively. 63 See Anderson (1992); Ali (2002); Barnett et al.

The recommendations are further elaborated for the different oil price scenarios generated by the recent UNDP study (see chapters 3 and 5) as well as for other developing countries in the Asia and Pacific region. The specific roles for UNDP in supporting regional developing countries to implement those recommendations are discussed in the penultimate section, while the last section presents an overall summary on the development of RETs in the region. Summary of what is happening Renewable energy technologies, other than large hydropower73 and traditional uses of biomass, produce less than 1 percent of total primary global energy consumed. This belies the historically unprecedented growth in investment in the production and use of RETs over the past decade. Annual private investment in production facilities for renewable energy equipment and in RE projects was 157 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences at significant levels even before the dramatic increase in the prices of petroleum after 2003. The investment has more than doubled since the price increases, and sustained high fuel prices can be expected to maintain the high growth rates in RET investment in the coming years. Roughly one dollar in four invested in the power sector in 2005 was invested in a RET. Investment in RETs increased by close to 27 percent in 2005 from a year earlier compared with 2-3 percent growth for investment in fossil-fuel-based power generation and large hydropower. In 2006 and 2007, investment in RETs had increased by close to 45 percent and 29 percent from a year earlier. Biofuels represent another area that has seen rapid growth in recent years. Worldwide ethanol production from sugar cane increased by 8 percent in 2005 while biodiesel production grew by 66 percent, albeit from a much smaller base (about 5 percent of ethanol production, by volume). The focus and major concern of this report is to map the options for private sector investment in alternative energy projects and programmes to meet the MDG goals of countries in Asia and the Pacific. Developing countries account for around 44 percent of renewable power capacity worldwide. Although the growth in RET investment in developing countries is only half the global rate, it is at historically high levels. The rate will increase as the lead developing countries, particularly China and India, have begun to invest heavily in the last few years in the two fastest-growing RETs \u2013 wind power and solar PV. Grid-connected renewables account for much of the investment volume. The success of the lead developing countries in increasing the percentage of renewable power on their grids is being replicated in a small number of other developing countries in the Asian and Pacific region that have established enabling regulatory and investment environments that include such features as standard power purchase agreements, feed-in tariffs, net metering, and the availability of bank financing. Investment in RETs is very uneven, however, with many of the smaller and less able countries far behind the larger", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f349857b-0189-480d-8273-b6da5413b673": {"__data__": {"id_": "f349857b-0189-480d-8273-b6da5413b673", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "649a594b38dfc701adc409b495b7882682a612693d0949f5489fc1cdf57c095a"}}, "hash": "649a594b38dfc701adc409b495b7882682a612693d0949f5489fc1cdf57c095a", "text": "lead countries in investing in renewable energy. The same is true for biofuels.74 The main drivers for investment in RETs and bioenergy in Asian and Pacific countries are concerns about energy security and the very high recent prices of petroleum. The larger developing countries that are most linked to global fuel markets have taken the biggest steps on the energy security front by investing in RETs. The supportive regulatory environments that they have put in place follow from commitments that many of those countries have made for meeting a certain percentage of their energy needs from renewable energy sources. In addition to energy security it is likely that concerns about local environmental pollution are in part driving investment in renewable energy technologies Although it cannot yet be considered a major driver, the Clean Development Mechanism is increasingly being used to improve the cost competitiveness of RET investments in developing countries. Investment in grid-connected RE systems contributes to countries of Asia and the Pacific meeting their MDGs and reducing poverty. Employment in most countries is largely generated by SMEs. Efficient and profitable operation of SMEs requires reliable, high-quality power from the grid. Adding lower- cost power on the grid from RETs at prices isolated from petroleum prices increases the probability of higher availability of power. Not to be discounted is the fact that most developing countries are perpetually short of investment for grid power. Grid-intertied RETs, particularly those based on small hydropower, wind and biomass, have proven to be attractive for private investment \u2013 thus providing additional investment and more power availability on the grid. Sufficient power availability on the grid is also a pre-condition to expansion of rural electrification. A number of studies have shown the positive impacts of access to grid power in terms of poverty reduction and meeting of MDGs. Where grid power is available, it generally provides electricity at the lowest price for rural users, especially in countries where lifeline tariffs are available for consumers purchasing less than a fixed low amount of energy (kWh) each month. However, it may not be the least-cost option, since rural access to grid extension is typically subsidized and power reliability and quality are often compromised. Availability of grid power has resulted in expansion of ground water irrigation, increased agricultural production and productivity and the powering of many productive uses. Given suitable ongoing incentives, the private sector has shown that it will invest in RETs and provide additional power for the grid, which can then be distributed through rural electrification. The poor are often unable to access or benefit from rural electrification efforts and some of the reforms in the power sector appear to have reduced access for the poor. This has been documented in studies by GNESD and other global studies (although this is not the focus of the present report). A number of private sector and community-based models, which provide options for increasing access for the poor, are now available for cost-effective expansion of grid-based rural electrification. They deserve to be scaled up but this study has not explored those options. 158 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Despite rapid urbanization taking place in countries of Asia and the Pacific, the majority of the poor continue to live in rural areas Off-grid distributed energy services represent the only realistic options for the majority of this population to access modern energy services in the near to medium term. Distributed energy services are being extended to the rural poor, in particular, by private sector investment. However, private sector investment that could potentially increase energy access for the poor and help in meeting MDG targets is a small fraction of the total global private investment going into the renewable energy sector, with most such investment destined for grid-intertied applications. In the past decade there have been a number of initiatives led by the private sector that are increasing access to energy for unserved rural populations through market-based models. The most successful involve private companies supplying RETs at the household level within an enabling market environment created with public sector support. Examples of this model are household biogas systems promoted by the BSP in Nepal and dissemination of solar PV home systems through RERED in Sri Lanka and REREDP in Bangladesh. Public sector funds are typically used to increase awareness, standardize technology, provide subsidies for systems and to enforce quality control. The models, which are based on commercialization and enterprise promotion, have led to tens of thousands of systems and, in some cases, more than 100,000 systems being installed in those countries.

Promotion through private sector markets has also worked well for improved cook stoves with hundreds of thousands of systems being installed in some urban and peri-urban markets, such as Sri Lanka and India and now also starting in Cambodia and Nepal. Artisans have been encouraged to manufacture stoves as a means of livelihood. In some markets, the penetration of the fuel efficient stoves has been close to 100 percent. NGOs supported some of the early training, standardization and quality control. Commercialization models have some intersections with poverty. The manufacturing and marketing networks of household systems have created employment. In the case of improved stoves, the number of those employed is substantial. In Nepal, BSP estimates that some 11,000 jobs have been created in the construction of household biogas plants. Solar home systems have less value added in-country than biogas and ICS but still create a significant number of local jobs in terms of local manufacture of some components and especially in the sales network and repair of systems. In general, the poor are rarely first adopters of new energy services as they are less able to take risks than the non-poor and less poor. When the equipment is affordable and returns are attractive, the poor will adopt new energy technologies when the costs are sufficiently low to permit outright purchase or financing is available for them. Improved cook stoves provide high returns on investment to users and in the better-developed markets the urban poor have purchased them (Cambodia, Sri Lanka) to reduce costs of cooking fuels \u2013 charcoal, firewood and kerosene. The poor have been much less able to afford the more expensive household-level RETs like solar PV and biogas. Microfinance has helped to deepen the reach of those technologies to some extent. There is also evidence that market expansion and competition among suppliers is bringing prices down. A report on BSP Nepal calculated that prices of household biogas digesters in Nepal had come down by 30 percent in real terms in 10 years. Increased manufacturing volumes and supply are steadily bringing down the prices of solar home systems, except for a negative trend in 2004 when solar-grade silicon wafers were in short supply. The poor would derive the greatest benefit from those RETs if they could be used to increase their income and hence reduce their poverty. There is anecdotal evidence that in a number of cases, solar PV lighting is being used to increase incomes by allowing shopkeepers to keep their shops open longer and helping kiosks carry out business in the evening with solar lanterns. There is also evidence that extended lighting hours have been used to increase production of handicrafts for the market. Pure commercialization models are, however, generally weak in helping the poor integrate energy into their livelihoods. Entrepreneurs with ongoing enterprises, who are likely to have already been thinking about how additional hours of lighting could be used, are most able to use solar PV lighting for increasing their incomes. Similarly, many such entrepreneurs know what they would do to improve the quality and quantity of production and services if electricity was available to them. Vendors do not take responsibility for supporting buyers to generate income from the use of their purchases. Under the market-based models, vendors sell systems to those that can afford them, leaving out the poor who cannot immediately afford the systems without having their incomes enhanced. Innovative vendors such as Grameen Shakti in Bangladesh have put in the extra effort to support purchasers of solar lighting systems integrate them with their livelihoods. This comes more easily to organizations like Grameen Shakti, which as a result of its links with the Grameen Bank has a very strong understanding 159 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences of microenterprises that are within the reach of the poor, as well as the opportunities to integrate energy into the value chain of those enterprises. Helping to expand this model is an area where increased support from United Nations agencies could be effective. A model that shows promise for providing energy access for the poor is based on community participation. Examples include a large number of community-based microhydropower projects supported by the Small Grants Programme of GEF/UNDP in a number of countries in Asia and the Pacific. Those models have demonstrated that energy services can be provided in an inclusive manner to all community members.

These mini-grids are generally large enough to provide not only lighting but can power small industry needs such as grain grinding and milling, lumber milling and other activities, as discussed in chapter 3. They can also provide electricity for health posts, schools, telecommunications, public lighting and many other services essential for social development and achieving the MDGs. Many of the projects reduce the time and effort taken by women and children and create new employment opportunities in rural areas. The holistic approach that characterizes them has been found to be effective in integrating energy interventions with income generation, livelihood opportunities and gender considerations. The approach thus shows promise in meeting the MDGs. Promotion of community-based projects requires social cohesion, community mobilization and support to communities to be successful, which will require additional investment. The major trends that point the way to increased investment in developing countries in RETs and greater access for the poor are listed below. Feeding in renewable electricity to the grid The countries where renewable-energy-based electricity is being integrated with existing power grids include China, India, Malaysia, Nepal, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand and in those countries green IPPs have been encouraged by policies supporting feed-in tariffs, standard PPAs and net metering. Growth in commercial renewable energy development is helped by commitments made by a number of countries, including in the Asia and Pacific region, to meet a certain percentage of their power needs through renewables.75 Other countries have encouraged green IPPs as a way to reduce dependence on imported fuels, as well as to encourage private sector investment in the power sector. The main renewable energy technologies benefiting from green IPPs so far are small hydropower (China, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka), biomass energy (China, India, Malaysia, Thailand), wind energy (China, India, Philippines) and geothermal energy (Philippines). In Asia, PV rooftop programmes, the fastest-growing renewable energy sector in the world, have been led by Japan and to a small extent adopted in Singapore but not by developing countries in the Asian and Pacific region to date. The progress in grid-connected renewables is very uneven, with most of the investment occurring in a small number of countries where Governments and utilities have established clear regulations and financial incentives for the purchase of power from renewable energy IPPs. Sustainable development implications of biofuels Biofuels have gained widespread interest, popularity and investment with the recent sustained high prices of petroleum. By contributing to transportation fuels and in some cases power generation, biofuels can reduce the risk many countries face of escalating fossil fuel costs in transportation and electricity, which then translate into overall increases in inflation rates throughout the economy. Commercial development of bioethanol, which in the developing world was limited to Brazil has spread to China, India and other developing countries in Asia and the Pacific with large agricultural populations (such as Indonesia, Philippines and Thailand). Biofuels are of particular interest to some Pacific island nations from an energy security perspective. Those islands are suffering high fuel costs because of their small size and high transport costs to the more remote islands. They grow an abundance of palm and coconut that can provide oils that can be used as fuels or converted into true biodiesel fuels. Both Indonesia and Malaysia, which together dominate world supplies of palm oil, are expanding production of biodiesel fuels from palm oil. In addition to contributing somewhat to energy security and mitigating high transportation-cost \u2013 induced inflation, biofuels present an opportunity for rural areas to increase incomes through farming fuel-producing crops and becoming exporters of fuel rather than importers. There is however a risk in many countries that conversion of rural land for bioenergy crop production will result in reduced food security for rural residents and will threaten fragile land and watersheds. Unmanaged conversion of forests to biofuel plantations might be happening now. Large-scale expansion of corporate farms can also result in labour conflicts with local residents. The example of the Solomon Islands, 160 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences documented in the country study , shows that while production can be expanded on existing plots to produce enough fuel for local needs without encroaching on agricultural land, corporate expansion of plantations can result in labour disputes with destabilizing impacts on the country. The study reported that the importing of large numbers of cheap Malaitan labourers to work on the palm oil plantations of Guadalcanal was one of the main causes of the 1999 ethnic tensions.

Production of oil crops by smallholder farmers and farmer\u2019s cooperatives might provide a solution to this problem. Commercialization of household renewable energy technologies Successful scaling up of markets for solar home systems in Sri Lanka (RERED), Bangladesh (REREDP) and household biogas plants in Nepal (BSP), among other examples, has demonstrated that there are commercialization models that work and that can be replicated across countries. Those models appear to work for different household energy technologies as well. The basic model consists of a national programme that provides initial subsidies, standardizes the technology and enforces quality control; private companies that market the systems in competitive markets; and consumer finance that is made available for cash-poor households. They are based on private-public partnerships, building on the comparative advantage of the private sector to work efficiently within market discipline, and provision of public funds to support the establishment of market networks and to buy down costs to users. The central organization that manages the programme uses subsidies to leverage high quality systems, which in turn ensure the continuity of support for the programme. The subsidy is designed to be decreased over time, an approach referred to as \u201csmart\u201d subsidies. Those successful commercialization models are, by their own admission, not focused on poverty; their aim is market expansion and they are interested in reaching the largest numbers of consumers that can afford the technologies. Governments, with assistance from donors in some cases, can expand the systems to poorer communities and families, through subsidies to the private sector, as was done by GEF in the case of Indonesia. It is estimated that some 220 million improved stoves are in use compared with a total of 570 million biomass cooking stoves being used worldwide (REN21 2006). The successful commercialization approaches that have worked with ICS programmes in the past can be built upon to reach the remaining households that continue to use solid biomass for cooking in traditional stoves. Programmes that have successfully supported artisans to mass produce efficient ceramic stoves that use charcoal or firewood for urban and peri-urban users and to establish the market network through which the stoves can be sold have worked well in Sri Lanka and Kenya and are now being replicated in Cambodia. The market for biomass stoves for the urban poor in Sri Lanka was expanded by ITDG and other NGOs in the 1990s through a model that encouraged artisans to get into business as mass producers of stoves and to market them through normal market channels. Those models have achieved installation in the millions worldwide. The evidence from Cambodia is that the reduced fuel expenditure can recover the cost of the stoves in a few months. Such high returns on investment will be attractive to the poor. In rural areas of Nepal the approach of empowering women to build improved smokeless stoves in clients\u2019 homes as a microenterprise for a fee has been successful in installing around 160,000 units in five years. This model too has potential for large-scale expansion and replication. Community-based energy projects Community-based microhydropower and small hydropower systems provide affordable power to rural communities. Examples are seen in Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines and Sri Lanka. Mini- grids powered by microhydropower and minihydropower can be designed to provide not only lighting but also milling services and power for small industries. Microhydropower projects have the added advantage that with sufficient social preparation they tend to be inclusive, providing services to the poor as well. The project experiences of REDP in Nepal and AKRSP in Pakistan show that with social mobilization and some technical support, communities themselves come up with creative ways to be inclusive. One common solution is to allow low-income households to contribute labor in lieu of cash payments. Another involves voluntary financial contributions from each house towards construction where the better-off households are expected to contribute significantly more than others. Social mobilization and capacity-building support to communities requires additional investment. This is generally provided by NGOs in microhydropower projects. The GEF Small Grants Programme provides funding for community-owned microhydropower and watershed management projects in many countries. The added advantage of a nationwide approach such as REDP or one that covers a region within a country as with AKRSP in the northern areas of Pakistan is one of consistent methodology throughout many projects and the ability to integrate energy systems into overall rural development in the region.

Building of the energy project also augments social capital in the community on which can be built any number of future development activities. Renewable energy for productive end uses The inability of investment in renewable energy to increase incomes of the poor and reduce poverty is one of the major challenges limiting large scale-up efforts to increase the market for RETs. The successful commercialization models described in this report point the way for rural populations to purchase RETs through an efficient market mechanism. However, the ability of the poor to purchase systems will be limited by lack of resources. The poor have many needs for their limited incomes and making energy services available for purchase will not necessarily increase their access to RETs, even with the availability of some government subsidies or microcredit, if the RETs cannot be used to increase their incomes. Larger energy systems, such as community-based microhydropower or electrification based on biomass gasification, provide sufficient power for mills and small industries and can generate some employment for the poor. Holistic energy supply models such as those promoted by REDP and enlightened vendors such as Grameen Shakti provide support to the poor to use the extended hours of work made possible by electrical lighting to engage in income-generating activities. Microcredit allows the poor to borrow funds for the equipment and raw materials needed for launching or expanding their enterprise. Availability of financing further allows the poor to subscribe to the additional energy they would need to engage in productive activities. International alliances that work to integrate RETs into non-energy development programmes with poverty reduction potential need to be expanded and strengthened. Such alliances and organizations include the Global Village Energy Programme and the Global Network on Energy for Sustainable Development. Their funding is fragile and uncertain relative to the scope of their missions, limiting the extent to which they can facilitate the vital linkages among renewables, gender and poverty reduction. New institutional approaches appear needed as well. Institutions that are best placed to be the integrators between the energy sector and potential income-generating sectors for the poor need to be supported by Governments and donors and their capacities built up. The most promising integrators on the ground are microfinance institutions, institutions charged with strengthening SMEs, NGOs and community-based organizations working at the community level, as well as private sector vendors of RETs. Encouragement of innovation and increased awareness of the best models for integrating energy with poverty-reducing applications could also be accomplished through establishment of national annual award programmes as done by the Ashden Trust at the global level. Renewable energy for high value public services High value public services powered by RETs (solar-powered refrigeration, solar PV or microhydropower for telecommunications, distance learning, Internet connectivity and others as discussed in chapter3) can effectively reach large numbers of people, including the poor, using small amounts of power. The Pacific island countries have a number of well-proven distance-learning programmes which are powered by high-quality solar PV systems. The private sector can provide the power systems and backup support for them. The private sector often provides mobile telephone services for which the towers need reliable power that can be provided by solar PV when they are located off-grid. Financing of RETs Supplier Finance \u2013 Availability of financing has been shown to boost investment in RETs for households, communities and microenterprises. Larger-scale financing is essential for the private sector to invest in grid-connected RETs or in importing a shipment of solar PV panels. Donor support has been used effectively in many countries by private developers for market development and trail-blazing costs of early pioneers. Those examples are subsequently picked up by the local markets and attract competitors \u2013 expanding the market for energy services ever more. Environmental investors such as E+Co have focused on providing debt, equity and creative mezzanine financing to entrepreneurs in many developing countries to help them establish clean-energy-based enterprises. The rapid growth of the grid-connected small hydropower and solar home systems markets in Sri Lanka since 1997 and the solar home systems market in Bangladesh since 2003 can both be attributed to their respective World Bank/GEF-funded projects that provided financing to suppliers and project developers. This has been important to the commercialization approach in both countries. In spite of those activities, most commercial banks and national development banks lack the experience, staff and specific mechanisms to finance renewable energy ventures, both on the production and application sides.

Although financing cannot make RETs such as SHSs and biogas affordable for the very poor who consider them expensive, it can substantially increase the market for those products among households which can afford them with payments spread out over two or three years. Coming from the Grameen Bank family, the birthplace of microfinance, Grameen Shakti in Bangladesh offered microcredit for SHSs right from the beginning. One of the participating credit institutions under the RERED programme, SEEDS, now has loans for SHSs contributing a remarkable 30 percent to its lending portfolio. Microfinance does not happen automatically for RETs. Both Bangladesh and Sri Lanka had a long tradition of microfinance before the growth of the solar market and this existing financing mechanism was able to incorporate RETs as a loan product. In countries that have a less well established microfinance network, financing for RETS is much more difficult. While some countries have a large number of MFIs engaged in providing microfinance for RETs, others have barely any. In Nepal only 25 percent of the SHSs and biogas digesters are financed. Efforts to get local banks and MFIs to provide financing to RETs have recently increased the percentage of plants financed. In Cambodia the only consumer finance available for solar home systems is through Khmer Solar, the local solar supply company that has a line of credit from Triodos, the Dutch social investment bank which has made investments in a number of microfinance institutions in Asia and Africa to encourage them to provide loans for SHSs and other RETs in their local markets. Finance is also often lacking for rural entrepreneurs that would like to make use of the energy available from RETs, power from microhydropower systems or lighting with SHSs to establish or expand productive enterprises. Carbon financing for RETs \u2013 Renewable energy CDM projects constitute some 62 percent of the pipeline of projects worldwide76, but only 33 percent of the CERs generated. One reason for this is that RETs abate relatively modest amounts of greenhouse gases compared with their high initial costs. Although CDM revenue would not be the dominant source of revenue for renewable energy projects, it is increasingly becoming important in enhancing the return on projects, typically adding 1-5 percent to the IRR for commercial renewable energy projects depending on the technology used and the prices received for the CERs. In Asia, the market for CDM projects is dominated by China (46 percent) and India (37 percent) with smaller volumes of registered and pipeline projects from Malaysia (5 percent), Indonesia (3 percent), Philippines (3 percent), South Korea (2 percent), Thailand (2 percent), Viet Nam (1 percent), Sri Lanka (1 percent) and other countries (1 percent). Renewable energy CDM projects in Asia and the Pacific largely consist of grid-connected RETs with wind (16 percent), biomass energy (16 percent), hydropower (1 percent) and geothermal (1 percent) being the main technologies of total number of projects in Asia. Off-grid RETs constitute a minority of registered and pipeline projects so far and consist of biogas (6 percent) and solar (1 percent) projects as of 1 April 2008 (UNEP Risoe 2008). Solar PV projects tend to have relatively small CDM revenues as they only substitute for lighting fuel. Carbon abatement from biogas projects, ICSs or solar cookers can be high when they substitute for unsustainably harvested biomass. This category of renewable energy projects generally has high MDG benefits since the projects directly reduce dependence on solid fuels for cooking \u2013 reducing indoor smoke and the time spent by women in children in collecting biomass fuel. At the moment, projects that strongly contribute to MDG targets do not in general receive any preferential treatment by the CDM Executive Board. The mainstream carbon market does not value credits from projects with high MDG benefits sufficiently either, although there is a small but growing voluntary market that will pay higher prices for emission reduction units with higher social benefits. Both situations need to be improved significantly if the CDM is to provide a boost to renewable energy projects that score high on the MDG scale. Future directions Developing countries in Asia and the Pacific need support to facilitate increased investment in the production and use of RE equipment and services, and that includes specific initiatives to link renewables with pro-poor development activities.

Cambodia \u2022 Prepare a target for renewables. Put in place laws for net metering. \u2022 Give legal recognition to Rural Energy Enterprises (REEs) and encourage them to invest in RETs. \u2022 Make financing available to users and energy enterprises through the proposed Renewable Energy Fund (REF) and provide them financing at favourable terms to adopt RETs. \u2022 Invest revenues from the fuel tax on RETs rather than on other public investment. Indonesia \u2022 Put in policies and regulations to realize the renewable energy targets set by the Government. \u2022 Institute policies for feed-in tariffs and net metering. \u2022 Establish mandates on biofuels. \u2022 Power generation plants should be obliged to improve access for the poor. \u2022 Mobilize financing for renewables for the poor through a tax on fossil fuels. \u2022 Encourage multi-stakeholder participation towards a widely-accepted policy framework. \u2022 Integrate energy and rural development projects and programmes. Nepal \u2022 Turn into an Act the recently announced Rural Energy Policy \u2013 with its focus on access to modern energy for women, dalits, indigenous people and the poor. \u2022 Further strengthen and give continuity to the feed-in tariffs for small hydropower and other RETs to supply the grid. \u2022 Channel the subsidies currently going into petroleum products into increasing RET access so as to do away with the need to subsidize kerosene fuel in rural areas for lighting. \u2022 Update subsidy policies so RETs are more accessible to the poor. Remove subsidies from more accessible areas (as indicated in the Policy). \u2022 Expand the REDP holistic approach to rural development through social mobilization to other community-based energy technologies including community rural electrification from the grid. \u2022 Integrate the increasingly available RETs in rural areas with agriculture, tourism and other income-generating sectors in rural areas. Philip- pines \u2022 Clarify and remove uncertainty in policies and regulations for private investors to invest in RETs. Community projects and those in remote locations should be exempt from registration fees and processing of certificates of compliance. \u2022 Relax pre-development contracting and production sharing by government from RE sources that are not extractive (wind and solar) to encourage small renewable energy investors. \u2022 Assure no political intervention and no rescinding of contracts of energy sector investors. \u2022 Allow banking of energy on the grid. \u2022 Reduce royalties on geothermal projects. Investment tax credit \u2022 Set up clear feed-in tariffs and net metering. \u2022 Develop biofuels for powering productive end uses in rural areas producing them.

Both countries had adopted policies favourable to investment in renewable energy even before the oil price increases starting in 2003. The appetite of those two countries for energy is growing so rapidly that they are developing all sources of energy including renewables, nuclear energy and fossil fuels. They are also importing substantial amounts of oil and natural gas. More can be done to accelerate renewable energy investment in those countries, particularly in anticipation of the higher oil price scenarios, \u201csupply shock\u201d and \u201cpeak oil\u201d. Even under the \u201cenergy security\u201d scenario private sector investment in RETs is likely to continue at current levels as a result of the established investment momentum. Although China is a world leader in increasing access to energy services in rural areas through renewables, there still remain millions of poor without access to modern energy in that country. More can be done in both countries, under all oil price scenarios, to increase energy access for the poor to help them climb out of poverty through the use of renewable energy. Among Group II countries, Sri Lanka and Thailand are following the trend set by China and India in creating the environment for aggressive investment in renewables, and in some cases biofuels, under the \u201cbaseline\u201d scenario. Group II countries are highly dependent on oil imports and renewable energy investment contributes to their energy security. Philippines has invested in geothermal energy and biofuels. It has a Presidential mandate in place for blending of biofuels (2 percent cocobiodiesel with petrodiesel fuel for road transport). Viet Nam has also begun to attract investment in renewable energy. Group II countries can further accelerate investment in renewables under the \u201csupply shock\u201d and \u201cpeak oil\u201d scenarios with proper policies and public investment. International investment is likely to be attracted to those countries for the development of biofuels for both local consumption 165 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences and export under the \u201cpeak oil\u201d scenario and perhaps to a limited extent under the \u201csupply shock\u201d and \u201cbaseline\u201d scenarios as well. Much more can be done in Group II countries, under all oil price scenarios, to increase energy access for the poor to help them climb out of poverty through the use of renewable energy. Group III countries, with the exception of Malaysia, have generally been slow to invest in renewables and biofuels. The first reaction of countries that have untapped fossil fuel resources to oil price increases is to invest in exploration of those fuels first. The priority of countries in this group will be to increase investment into exploration for oil and gas under the \u201cbaseline\u201d, \u201csupply shock\u201d and \u201cpeak oil\u201d scenarios for both export earnings and domestic use. Bangladesh and Pakistan are likely to invest in new natural gas fields in response to high oil prices. In addition to expanding exploration for oil and gas, Indonesia appears to be increasing its use of coal with a recent announcement from PLN soliciting investment in 10,000 MW of coal-based generation in response to oil price increases. The availability of fossil fuel resources in their own countries or at a low price across their borders from a neighbour creates a disincentive in those countries to invest substantially in RETs. Group III countries need encouragement not to wait until the \u201csupply shock\u201d and \u201cpeak oil\u201d scenarios to adopt the recommendations for increasing investment in renewables. With the exception of Malaysia, access to electricity and other modern energy sources remains limited for the rural poor in those countries. Renewable energy is often the least-cost option to provide access to energy for the rural poor in most Group III countries. Malaysia provides a good model for countries in the group both in terms of introducing an ambitious biofuels mandate and setting up the MESITA fund for investing in renewable energy as well as rural electrification and energy efficiency.

Group IV countries are landlocked and largely rural with low per capita energy use. They also tend to have hydropower resources but often not the investment or technical expertise needed to develop them, while their neighbours often have fast-growing energy needs and the ability to make the necessary investment. Under the \u201cbaseline\u201d and \u201csupply shock\u201d scenarios, and certainly under \u201cpeak oil\u201d, investment is likely to be attracted to those countries for development of hydropower to export to energy-hungry neighbours. Investment in biofuels for export is unlikely to be attractive in the landlocked countries. The low price of grid electricity often acts as a disincentive to encourage investment in other RETs for both on \u2013 and off-grid applications. Both Bhutan and Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic have seen limited private investment in RETs since the price of grid electricity is below market rates. Bhutan has shown how revenue from hydropower exports can be used to achieve extensive rural electrification and to make social investments benefiting the poor. The example from Nepal shows that the private sector can be attracted for both off-grid and grid-intertied RETs with favourable policies and public investments. As countries with mountainous topographies, off-grid renewables are often the most cost-effective way to increase the access to electricity and other energy services for remote communities in Group IV countries. There is a need for significant improvement in Group IV countries, under all oil price scenarios, to increase energy access for the poor to help them climb out of poverty through the use of renewable energy. Group V countries particularly the Pacific island countries, but also Afghanistan and Cambodia, lack technological or investment capability and the policies needed to attract external investment for developing biofuels, wind energy and hydropower which could reduce their dependence on imported petroleum. Most of those countries depend on imported diesel to a large extent to produce electricity, such as many Pacific islands that are virtually 100 percent dependent on diesel generation. They suffer tariff increases when petroleum prices increase. This should provide those countries with the greatest incentives to invest in RETs. Unfortunately, it may take the \u201cpeak oil\u201d scenario to manifest itself before those countries come out of their paralysis to put in the necessary policies and regulations and take the steps needed to attract investment in renewables. It is only under the \u201cpeak oil\u201d scenario that serious international investment might be attracted to those countries for investment in biofuels for export. Countries in this group need the most amount of support to adopt appropriate policies and make the necessary public investment under the \u201cbaseline\u201d scenario without waiting for the \u201csupply shock\u201d or \u201cpeak oil\u201d scenarios to unfold. Substantial support from UNDP and other donors will be needed to encourage those countries to take the necessary steps to increase investment into grid-connected RETs, off-grid renewables and biofuels to increase energy access for the poor to help them climb out of poverty through the use of renewable energy. Table 8-3 below provides policy recommendations in countries of the Asia and Pacific region to promote private investment in renewable energy and also to increase energy access for the poor through the use of renewables. The recommendations are ranked on a scale of 1 to 5 in terms of their likely effectiveness and cost to society as follows: 5 \u2013 highly effective and low cost; 4 \u2013 highly effective but high cost; 3 \u2013 medium effective and low cost; 2 \u2013 medium effective but high cost; and 1 \u2013 ineffective. Recommendations are provided for each of the five groups of countries listed above 166 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences for each of the four oil price scenarios. The main policy recommendations are divided into three general categories: \u2022 Policy and regulatory (policies and acts, regulations, targets and timetables, and mandates); \u2022 Fiscal and financial incentives (investment incentives such as direct capital subsidies or tax deductions, reduced duties); and \u2022 Public investment (grants for research, development and demonstration; institutional and human resource development, and preferential finance).

Strategic recommendations In addition to addressing energy security concerns, ways need to be found for energy investments to contribute to the attainment of a country\u2019s MDG goals. In the light of global experience, as well as experience in lead countries of the region, some future directions for developing countries in Asia and the Pacific could be as follows: (a) Create the environment for increased investment in grid-connected RETs Most countries in the Asian and Pacific region have substantially more renewable energy resources that can be commercially exploited under current economic conditions than those they have tapped so far. The experience of countries with a large number of clean-energy IPPs is that the major pre-conditions for significant investment in grid-connected RETs can be quite easily identified and instituted in other countries. Countries that have achieved the largest investment volumes have transparent and well-advertised mechanisms for connecting small generators to the grid. They have financially attractive feed-in tariffs for green IPPs, standard PPAs to reduce transaction costs and net metering to encourage industries to generate surplus power. In addition, those countries have banks and other financial institutions that will provide credit to projects often on a \u201cproject finance\u201d basis, where the project itself can act as collateral. In order for grid-connected RETs to contribute directly to poverty reduction those projects need to be mandated to provide some of the power produced to the local community (if there is no access) and to share benefits with local people, particularly in the case of biomass projects (with producers of the raw materials), wind energy and small hydropower (through royalties shared with adjacent communities and local government). 172 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Furthermore, there is a need to level the playing field to allow renewables to compete fairly with conventional fossil-based systems. Higher oil prices are creating major problems for countries that subsidize those fuels, threatening economic growth if the subsidies are kept in place and consumer outrage if they are not. Conventional energy sources also impose external costs on the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bd0180f4-411e-4069-b880-51ce335bbbaf": {"__data__": {"id_": "bd0180f4-411e-4069-b880-51ce335bbbaf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3c9b5b5e301fe002b65feac61cf3c588fce97fa090c3225c3cf0f8b40ce3f00a"}}, "hash": "3c9b5b5e301fe002b65feac61cf3c588fce97fa090c3225c3cf0f8b40ce3f00a", "text": "environment and human health, which can be internalized with levies and taxes, as some countries in Europe are doing through carbon taxes to internalize the cost of greenhouse gas emissions. Just as many of the costs of conventional energy are not internalized, markets and policies often fail to internalize the myriad positive externalities \u2013 improvements in healthcare, education, communications and employment \u2013 that can result from bringing electricity to underserved areas. Community leaders, local residents, and project developers should seek to explicitly identify such benefits. Identifying the costs and benefits would also improve with reliable methodologies for quantifying externalities. (b) Increase investment in biofuels, but cautiously Biofuels, both ethanol and bio-diesel, can be attractive in terms of energy security for those countries that have large agricultural sectors or those landlocked or island nations for whom the supply of petroleum fuels is irregular and transporting petroleum can be quite expensive. An additional benefit of expansion or development of bioenergy crops will be generation of rural employment. Around 1 million people are reportedly employed in all aspects of the Brazilian ethanol industry. Developing countries in Asia and the Pacific will need technical support to understand the trade off better between energy and food security as a result of substitution of grains by bioenergy crops. They might also need support to test out community \u2013 or cooperative-based models to farm bioenergy crops that will provide an alternative to the growth of corporate energy farms being seen in a number of countries. If designed well, those models can be more equitable in terms of sharing the benefits of this new commercial crop and avoiding some of the conflicts that often come with corporate farming. The exercise in expanding and strengthening of biofuels programmes in order that the poor should get a greater share of the benefits should start with an evaluation and assessment of current experiences and policies, including models and practical tools currently used in national, regional and international organizations in areas such as land-use planning, evaluation of biofuels potential and impacts on food security and commodity prices. In most developing countries there is a need to strengthen decision-making capacities so as to tap into the above-mentioned opportunities while avoiding potentially important negative impacts in various fields linked to rural livelihoods, equitable economic development and the environment. (c) Expand models for commercialization of household-level RETs and make them more accessible for the poor While market-based supply of household solar home systems and biogas has achieved successes in a number of Asian and Pacific countries, those models are not widely available elsewhere. This can be remedied by increasing awareness among government officials and prospective private sector investors and donor organizations about the business model behind those investments. Expansion of microfinance and vendor consumer finance service mechanisms will help deepen the market to reach customers that cannot afford to pay cash for the systems. The established market networks that are today providing the more expensive systems to the non-poor can begin to market lower-cost products that are more affordable for the poor, for example, solar lanterns and white LED lighting devices. Many countries have subsidies for the larger systems but not for the smaller systems that the poor could find more affordable. Subsidies need to be rationalized to support the poor rather than the non-poor. Access of the poor to large energy systems, which they can use for increasing income but cannot afford for consumption, must also be increased. This can be done by assisting the poor to take on enterprises and income-generating activities assisted by energy systems. The recommendation below on productive end uses describes this more fully. In most countries energy is principally a private business, but providing energy access for rural areas has traditionally been considered a government responsibility. Indeed, Governments already subsidize the extension of electricity grids and provide the poor with subsidized petroleum fuels. They could similarly give support for renewable energy technologies \u2013 while linking them with wider rural development and poverty eradication initiatives. Governments could also support reliable assessments of renewable resources so as to encourage investment. 173 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences (d) Replicate scale-up of community-based energy systems Although community-based RETs have been shown to provide low-cost energy in an equitable manner in a number of countries in Asia and the Pacific, the Solomon Islands country study presents an unfortunately common example of where communities can receive little benefit from an unreliable microhydropower project that can take more effort to maintain and operate than the benefit it delivers.

Support is needed from Governments and the donor community to scale up community-based approaches beyond individual communities to cover larger regions. Not only will this allow standardization of methodology and thus lower transaction costs and better chances of success, it will also permit the integration of the energy systems into the rural economic development of the whole region. Although the REDP approach has been established for 10 years, and has had an impact at the national level, it has not been widely replicated outside Nepal. Similarly, the AKRSP model from northern Pakistan is only slowly being replicated in the other Central Asian countries such as Afghanistan and Tajikistan. The community-based energy systems model has applications beyond microhydropower. Community participation is now actively being pursued for grid-based rural electrification in Karnataka and Orissa in India, as well as in Nepal. Involving the community has been found to reduce pilferage and improve efficiency of tariff collection. One renewable energy technology on the horizon that could benefit from community ownership and management is electrification using biomass gasification. Thermal applications of biomass gasification have already been commercialized with many small industries using gasifiers to provide process heat. Use of producer gas in modified diesel generators to produce electricity is being developed by a number of private companies and research organizations as an option for community-based electrification. Once the technology bugs are eliminated, biomass gasification for electrification could be ubiquitous in many communities of Asia and the Pacific that are able to grow a surplus of biomass in areas that do not have access to hydropower resources. This is a technology that is being developed rapidly in China and India and is also being tried out in a number of other countries including Cambodia and Sri Lanka. The social mobilization methodology developed by REDP and others would provide an excellent basis to organize communities around the installation and sustainable operation of gasifier-based electrification. Renewable energy services must be coupled with existing development activities for water, health, education and entrepreneurship, which can also be made more effective through those services. In particular, they should address the needs of women, by offering security and income, saving labour and improving health. (e) Target new initiatives to utilize renewable energy for productive end uses Complementary programmes can be added to existing commercialization approaches to increase incomes of users of RETs. The slurry from biogas plants can significantly increase agricultural production, for example. In China it is reported that for many farming communities the major benefit of the biogas digesters is the slurry followed by cooking gas. In Nepal, slurry from biogas has not yet been effectively used to increase incomes. BSP has added a slurry extension component to its project in order to encourage farmers to manage the slurry better both to increase their own agricultural production and also to sell fertilizer to organic farms or city gardeners. Grameen Shakti has been a pioneer in supporting enterprises along with the supply of solar home systems. Solar energy is used to charge mobile phones so earning income for phone ladies selling communications services. It also provides lights for kiosks that can sell their wares until later in the evening as well as for barber shops and tailors who can extend working hours, among others. National programmes that promote SHSs need to be strongly encouraged to add a component of income generation. Renewable energy technologies can spur the creation of microenterprises by engaging local people, particularly the poor, in harnessing energy and in providing energy services. Renewable energy fights poverty most effectively when linked with income generation in both producing and using the energy \u2013 though the energy also has to meet essential human needs for cooking, lighting, heating and water supply. 174 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences (f) Increase the use of renewable energy for high value public services There is much room to expand the use of RETs to power high-value public services (vaccine refrigeration, telecommunications, distance learning and Internet connectivity). The participation of the private sector in providing some of the services can be increased in the interests of sustainability. The best examples are telephony and Internet connectivity being provided by the private sector for a fee. (g) Increase availability of RET finance Banks throughout Asia and the Pacific need to be encouraged to provide financing for RETs.

Similarly, microfinance institutions can be encouraged to add household RETs to their portfolios. Finance must be made available not just for the generation of energy but also to enterprises that will use the energy to generate income and provide employment. Promotion of RETs without support to encourage productive end uses loses the opportunity to increase income and reduce poverty. In the future, productive end uses will need to be financed as part of a total package available for rural energy systems. Microfinance institutions need to be encouraged to play a coordinating role to encourage integration of the energy input and income-generating activities at the household level. Supplying rural energy services often means dealing with a large number of small transactions dispersed over a wide area. This problem can be addressed with innovative financing mechanisms including microcredit \u2013 whether from the energy company, its dealers, microfinance institutions or community-based organizations. The mechanisms can be linked with specially designed credit lines through larger financial institutions, potentially backed by the Government. The new financing mechanisms also include micro-rental or fee-for-service approaches, where all or part of the equipment remains the property of the company and customers make regular payments for its use. One example is a utility-style concession in which a concessionaire owns the system, charges a monthly fee and is responsible for the service. (h) Strengthen the role of carbon financing for RETs The CDM Executive Board needs to be encouraged to provide preferential treatment for high MDG- impact RET projects by simplifying the baseline and monitoring methodologies. This will reduce transaction costs and make it attractive for many project developers to pursue RET projects under the CDM. Furthermore, the market for carbon credits from projects with high poverty reduction and local environmental benefits needs to be developed further by bundling a number of small projects with high MDG benefits and marketing them to buyers. In order to give priority to projects with high MDG impacts, indicators need to be developed to determine which projects have a high MDG index and a methodology for monitoring such projects needs to be developed as well. (i) Changes in project monitoring procedures In most RET programmes, the monitoring systems typically measure strictly quantifiable information, such as the number of new electricity connections, number of villages covered or number of renewable energy systems installed. They are not designed to measure poverty and gender-specific impacts. Project planning and monitoring protocols that are poverty and gender sensitive need to be developed and tested in a number of large projects within the region and their widespread usage encouraged. Such protocols could also be used by socially conscious buyers of carbon credits to pay higher prices for CER units from projects that also score high on the MDG index. Future role of UNDP An important role for UNDP is to assist Asian and Pacific countries put in place regulations and establish a policy environment for attracting private investment in grid-connected RETs. The energy security implications could potentially be quite large, particularly in countries that are heavily dependent on imported petroleum fuels for their existing electricity generation and for new capacity addition. This includes the Pacific island countries. Relatively simple changes in regulations such as establishment of feed-in tariffs, net metering, standard PPAs and facilities such as power transmission \u201cwheeling\u201d (selling power to a third party via the utility\u2019s transmission lines) and \u201cbanking\u201d (generating power for later consumption) can result in large mobilization of investment in countries with sufficient resources. Additional support will be needed to increase the capability and awareness of both utility officials and prospective IPPs to implement those changes effectively. Smaller Pacific island countries and countries without depth of experience in renewables, such as Cambodia, will need technical support and pilot projects as well. 175 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences UNDP can have a role in assisting partner countries in Asia and the Pacific study the implications of increasing biofuel production on food security and other issues for local communities, to increase awareness of technologies to produce biofuels on a small scale at the community level and to work with communities to establish models for smallholder farming of oil-producing crops suitable for biodiesel production and local processing and marketing. There is a role for UNDP to broaden the appreciation of the household RET commercialization model. Countries such as Cambodia, where there is currently a small market for solar home systems and credit is available from only one of the vendors, could be ripe for a replication of this commercialization model on a national scale. The model may be suitable for", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "40470660-dc91-422d-8caa-b8e972ca6deb": {"__data__": {"id_": "40470660-dc91-422d-8caa-b8e972ca6deb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6315eab5c86b6f9487b7e39fdbf07e63129bb39a437b95a87af0bace4dac49d8"}}, "hash": "6315eab5c86b6f9487b7e39fdbf07e63129bb39a437b95a87af0bace4dac49d8", "text": "Indonesia, Viet Nam and other countries in Asia as well as for the Pacific island countries. UNDP can also encourage existing and future commercialization programmes to include a pro-poor strategy. This might include increasing availability of microfinance in those markets where consumer finance is not available for RETs, establishing strong links with productive uses of energy, promoting pro-poor technologies such as lower power systems using white LED lights as part of solar PV systems. Through the GEF Small Grants Programme, UNDP has promoted community-managed, mini-grid systems mostly using microhydropower in a number of Asian and Pacific countries. UNDP also launched the award-winning Rural Energy Development Programme in Nepal. Community-based energy systems have been found to provide access to electricity and motive power for the poor. In a number of instances they have also provided power for productive end uses. UNDP has a role in making those models better known, in scaling them up and replicating them in new countries. REDP\u2019s experience of scaling up community-based energy systems to a national level programme, and integrating the systems with district-level energy planning, is also worthy of replication. Linking energy supply with productive end uses has proved to be a challenge for RETs worldwide. UNDP might be able to create a critical mass of projects across its energy project portfolio that are linked strongly with productive use applications and track them systematically for their poverty impacts. One possible entry point could be to promote RET usage in women-operated small enterprises and microenterprises. The UNDP-supported multi-function platform initiative in West Africa, though not specifically a renewable energy initiative, has demonstrated how both renewable fuels (vegetable oils and biodiesel) and petrodiesel can be used in focused ways to increase agricultural revenues and to empower rural women in the farming sector. A large number of women in the Asia and Pacific region are found working in sectors concentrated around a narrow range of energy-intensive activities such as food processing and service sector activities with relatively low rates of return. Because the central economic activity in the rural areas of Asia and the Pacific is in food production via agriculture and fishing, expanding partnerships among UNDP, IFAD and FAO to strengthen the links between modern energy access and productive activities should be pursued. UNDP can play a role in building up the capacity of microfinance institutions in the Asian and Pacific region and mobilizing funds for them to lend for consumer finance of RETs if necessary. Expanding the role of MFIs to integrate productive and income-generating activities with RET investments, including the provision of credit to both, could be an effective approach. Existing institutions in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia and Viet Nam that provide finance for SMEs can also be encouraged to include RETs in their portfolios. UNDP can play a role in supporting partner country Governments to advocate at the Conference of Parties of the UNFCCC to bring attention to the challenges faced by RETs in competing as CDM projects. In particular, highlighting the sustainable benefits of smaller RETs that provide substantial MDG benefits to rural communities without access to energy services can result in their preferential treatment. TLaunching of the MDG CDM facility by UNDP aims at will increasinge the attractiveness of developing RET projects with high MDG impacts as CDM projects. An additional contribution that UNDP can make is to establish methodologies and tool kits for better integration of MDG targets into the design of RET projects and to develop indicators for monitoring achievement of those targets. In most RET programmes, the monitoring systems typically measure strictly quantifiable information. They are not designed to measure poverty \u2013 and gender-specific impacts. It would be very useful for UNDP to take the lead in developing project planning and monitoring protocols that are poverty and gender sensitive and encourage their widespread usage. 176 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Proposed UNDP activities in countries of Asia and the Pacific can be summarized as follows: Awareness and advocacy: \u2022 to put in place regulations favourable to grid-connected RETs; \u2022 to mandate blending of biofuels into gasoline and diesel fuels in countries that have potential; \u2022 to replicate more widely successful commercialization models for household energy technologies; \u2022 to replicate successful community-based energy system models; \u2022 to replicate more widely models such as REDP which have been able to integrate community energy systems with district economic development; and \u2022 to get preferential treatment for CDM projects that have high MDG impacts, in terms of simplified baseline and monitoring methodologies.

This has led to increasing concern about the adverse impact of such an expansion on food security,as well as the conversion of forests into biofuels 75 Some of those commitments are as follows: China \u2013 10 percent of electric power capacity and 5 percent of primary energy by 2010, 10 percent of primary energy by 2020; India \u2013 10 percent of new power capacity during 2003-12; Malaysia \u2013 5 percent of electricity by 2005; Philippines \u2013 4.7 GW total existing capacity by 2013; and Thailand \u2013 8 percent of total primary energy by 2011. 76 The pipeline is dominated by projects which abate industrial gases such as hydrofluorocarbons with extremely high global warming potential, as well as other projects that abate nitrous oxide or methane from landfill sites, both of which also have high warming potential. 180 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences References ADB (Asian Development Bank). 2006.

Introduction In an increasing number of countries, UNDP is requested to assist in the development of the policy framework for fiscal decentralisation through advice and piloting of mechanisms for the financing of services and infrastructure at the local level. Both the empowerment of communities by fiscally strengthening their local governments and the entire system of sub-national government finance are an integral part of the policies and strategies needed for achieving the MDGs. This primer is intended to provide an introduction to the main principles of fiscal decentralisation, to examine linkages between poverty reduction and fiscal decentralisation, to briefly describe major comparative experiences, and to clarify UNDP\u2019s approaches and entry points. It should be read in conjunction with the UNDP Practice Notes on Decentralization, Local Governance and Urban/Rural Development and Public Administration Reform, which provide an overview of the broader issues and UNDP\u2019s position on these. The primer has been developed as a joint effort of the members of the global UNDP community of decentralised governance practitioners in the country offices, regional centres and headquarters. The primer has also benefited from the input provided by a range of UNDP practitionersi in the drafting process and during an e-discussion on the global Democratic Governance, Decentralization and Local Governance, and Poverty Practice Networks. In addition, a number of external fiscal decentralisation expertsii have made valuable contributions. It covers the entire decentralisation and local governance practice of UNDP and includes the experiences of the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) programmes. As an agency under the UNDP umbrella, UNCDF is involved in assistance to fiscal decentralisation in a range of LDCs through the provision of capital investment funding to local governments and through upstream policy support. A separate primer is being developed on the linkages between central government reform and decentralisation. This primer will deal more comprehensively with the planning and budgeting processes, oversight and accountability, the legislative framework, and technical support from the centre to the periphery, issues which will not be covered in the present document. Suggestions for further enriching this note are welcome. Please address them to Gita Welch, the Democratic Governance Practice Leader, and Henrik Fredborg Larsen, Policy Advisor on Decentralisation and Local Governance, and lead author of the fiscal decentralisation primer. 1 UNDP Primer: Fiscal Decentralisation and Poverty Reduction II. The Issue and its Dimensions 1. Contextualising Fiscal Decentralisation The government sector of virtually every country consists of more than one level of government. Typically, a country has a central government that exercises jurisdiction over the entire national territory. In addition, virtually all countries have one or more levels of sub-national governments, which only exercise jurisdiction over a particular region, district or locality. Intergovernmental fiscal relations and fiscal decentralisation deal with how public expenditure is organised between these different levels of government and how it is financed. Fiscal decentralisation thus constitutes the public finance dimension to decentralisation in general, defining how and in what way expenditures and revenues are organised between and across different levels of government in the national polity. The precise nature of intergovernmental fiscal relations and fiscal decentralisation policy in any given country varies depending on how sub-national government and administration is organised. Where decentralisation reforms lead to genuinely local government, as is increasingly the case in most countries, this implies that sub-national authorities enjoy considerable autonomy from central government but that they are accountable to local citizens for the public goods and services that they deliver. For such local governments to fully deliver the potential benefits of decentralisation (see section below on poverty reduction), however, they need to be fiscally empowered. Fiscal decentralisation, then, can be conceptualised as the empowerment of communities and citizens by fiscally empowering their local governments.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6bbdb1c8-31de-4704-8125-8bcaf4da446a": {"__data__": {"id_": "6bbdb1c8-31de-4704-8125-8bcaf4da446a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/fiscal-decentralisation-and-poverty-reduction", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Fiscal Decentralisation and Poverty Reduction", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/fiscal-decentralisation-and-poverty-reduction", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "72b7cc842362d48c52b261d73e06ac64df31620824c08a58daf01317043ea31e"}, "2": {"node_id": "366d9993-97c8-4465-8e0b-187f14966e78", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/fiscal-decentralisation-and-poverty-reduction", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f2c25cb361b475012f6282d8c87389ded813375734f38cd95eda6d9ee259cbb8"}}, "hash": "fac52e306952d5b12d438904598d10198ad916d8ac73e8648c71b97b3887cb5c", "text": "In such a context, fiscal decentralisation is often more narrowly conceptualised as fiscal devolution \u2013 and this primer is predominantly concerned with this form of fiscal decentralisationiii.

As such, the assignment of expenditure (or \u2018functional\u2019) responsibilities is considered the first \u201cpillar\u201d of fiscal decentralisation reform (see further in section 2 below). Fiscal decentralisation, however, is not only a question of transferring resources to the different levels of local government. It is also about the extent to which local governments are empowered, about how much authority and control they exercise over the use and management of devolved financial resources, measured in terms of their control over (i) the provision of the basket of local services for which they are responsible; (ii) the level of local taxes and revenues (base, rates and collection); and (iii) the grant resources with which they finance the delivery of local public services. It is important to note that fiscal decentralisation by itself is not enough to truly empower local communities and to achieve pro-poor outcomes. While local power over the purse is important, successful fiscal decentralisation goes hand in hand with political and administrative decentralisation. First, unless local governments are politically empowered by having democratically elected and representative local councils, local communities and citizens will not be able to hold their local governments accountable. Second, unless local governments have administrative control over the services they are supposed to deliver (for instance, by having effective control over the local government staff that deliver local services), local governments are not truly empowered to serve their communities. In addition, the creation of an enabling environment for local government (of which fiscal decentralisation is a core element) will often need to be complemented by support for capacity development, for the strengthening of inclusive systems for local public expenditure management, and for robust accountability mechanisms. Finally, successful fiscal decentralisation also requires a meaningful dialogue between local and central governments, an appropriate set of legal and institutional arrangements for local government management, and a system of incentives. 2 UNDP Primer: Fiscal Decentralisation and Poverty Reduction 2. Principles of Fiscal Decentralisation Although fiscal decentralisation covers a broad policy area, it can be looked at in terms of four basic building blocks or \u201cpillars\u201d, as follows: 1. The assignment of expenditure responsibilities to different government levels: what are the functions and expenditure responsibilities of each level of government? 2. The assignment of tax and revenue sources to different government levels: once sub-national governments are assigned certain expenditure responsibilities, which tax or non-tax revenue sources will be made available to sub-national governments in order to meet those responsibilities? 3. Intergovernmental fiscal transfers: in addition to assigning revenue sources, central governments may provide regional and local governments with additional resources through a system of intergovernmental fiscal transfers or grants. 4. Sub-national borrowing: local governments can borrow (in a variety of ways) to finance revenue shortfalls. This section provides a brief summary of each of these four \u201cpillars\u201d of fiscal decentralisation. Each of these pillars is discussed in greater detail in background readings and in online resource material developed by UNDP/UNCDF together with the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies at Georgia State University. Expenditure responsibilities The assignment of functional or expenditure responsibilities is the first \u201cpillar\u201d of fiscal decentralisation simply because it defines who does what \u2013 which functions are assigned to different levels in the overall system of government in a given country. There is no single \u201cbest\u201d assignment of expenditure responsibilities among different government levels, and the expenditure assignment choices made in different countries depend, among other factors, on a range of historical and political circumstances. In addition, assigning expenditure responsibilities is often \u201cmulti- dimensional\u201d in nature, in that different levels of government may need to be simultaneously involved in the same broad service delivery area (such as primary education), but in different ways (e.g. local government being responsible for the direct provision of primary education services, and central government in defining curricula and overseeing standards)iv. However, the key principle in determining which level of government should do what in a fiscally decentralised system of government is known as the \u201csubsidiarity principle\u201d. This principle suggests that government functions should be assigned to the lowest level of government that is capable of efficiently undertaking this function (such as providing a good or service) \u2013 if a small local government can efficiently provide pre-school services, then it should \u2013 according to the subsidiarity principle \u2013 be assigned that responsibility. Generally, this principle results in a situation where, as far as possible, the area where the benefits of a government service are felt coincides with the government boundaries at each", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cc732ad7-afd3-46d9-bb88-8ee212fdfa54": {"__data__": {"id_": "cc732ad7-afd3-46d9-bb88-8ee212fdfa54", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/fiscal-decentralisation-and-poverty-reduction", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Fiscal Decentralisation and Poverty Reduction", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/fiscal-decentralisation-and-poverty-reduction", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f3b586a55b7315ef12c1983a31191a4bf0adb12185fbf02ca5471c6c202ad7bb"}}, "hash": "f3b586a55b7315ef12c1983a31191a4bf0adb12185fbf02ca5471c6c202ad7bb", "text": "level of government. For instance, since national defence benefits people in the national territory of a country, this expenditure function should be a national affair funded by the central government. However, since the benefits from a local park are mostly felt by local residents, the responsibility for local parks should be placed with local governments. The subsidiarity principle suggests that three types of functions are best performed or funded by central (and not local) governments: (1) provision of public goods and services that benefit the entire nation (e.g. defence); (2) income redistribution or social policies: because firstly, sub-national governments \u2013 by their very nature \u2013 are simply not able to address income differentials between regions (which are often quite substantial) and, secondly, if local governments did engage in income redistribution, wealthy households and firms 3 UNDP Primer: Fiscal Decentralisation and Poverty Reduction would have an incentive to move away from sub-national jurisdictions that engaged in such income redistribution; (3) government activities that involve spill-overs or \u201cexternalities\u201d between local governments: sub-national governments would provide inefficient levels of certain public services if these activities involve spill-over benefits (or costs) in neighbouring jurisdictions. For instance, while residents of a locality would be the primary beneficiaries of local immunization programmes, surrounding local governments would also benefit from this immunization programme by reducing their risk of contagious diseases spilling over from the neighbouring jurisdiction. Thus, if local public health were to be left solely to the discretion of local governments, localities would likely under-fund these programmes because the local cost/benefit analysis would not take into account the benefits that accrue to the residents of neighbouring localities or to the nation as a whole. Something that is perhaps worth noting with regard to the assignment of expenditure responsibilities (as well as revenue collecting powers) is that the process can be \u201casymmetrical\u201d \u2013 thus, more responsibilities can be assigned to certain local governments (e.g. urban municipalities with relatively few \u201ccapacity\u201d constraints) than to others (e.g. rural local governments, where \u201ccapacity\u201d may be a serious issue). This type of asymmetry explicitly recognises that the absorptive capacity of local governments at the same level may be different. \u2192 See further materials in the detailed primer on assignment of expenditure responsibilities and resources in section IV Revenue assignments Once the assignment of expenditure responsibility has been determined, the second key question is: what revenue sources are assigned to sub-national governmentsv ? Obviously, an important determinant of the assignment of revenue sources to sub-national governments is the assignment of expenditure responsibilities, giving rise to the adage that finance should follow function. However, it should be stressed that in most countries, local governments cannot feasibly be assigned revenue sources matching their expenditure assignments. In addition, it is important to consider which revenues sources specifically make sound local government revenue sources, since some taxes are better suited for local governments while others are better left to national governments. For instance, local governments should be assigned stable sources of revenue. Local taxes should also be easy to administer and it should be easy to separate the tax base between different local jurisdictions. Also, it is preferable if local taxes broadly correspond to the benefits received by local residents from local government services. As a result, examples of appropriate local revenue sources include: \u2022 real estate property taxes; \u2022 retail sales taxes; \u2022 business fees; \u2022 regional personal income taxes; \u2022 motor vehicle fees, and; \u2022 user charges. Revenue sources that are often bad local taxes \u2013 but good central government taxes \u2013 include the value- added tax (VAT), corporate income taxes, and trade (import/export) taxes. One problem regarding the assignment of revenue sources in many countries is that while sub-national governments need to have at least some revenue discretion in order to fully benefit from fiscal 4 UNDP Primer: Fiscal Decentralisation and Poverty Reduction decentralisation reforms, central governments often seem unwilling to provide a significant degree of real revenue autonomy to sub-national governments \u2013 e.g. in setting tax rates or pursuing defaulters. In addition, revenue decentralisation often causes increased sub-national fiscal inequality \u2013 with wealthier regions being able to collect more revenues than poorer ones. In these cases, equalisation grants or other intergovernmental fiscal transfer schemes become necessary to ensure that sub-national governments have adequate revenues to fulfil their expenditure responsibilities. \u2192 See further materials in the detailed primer on revenue assignments and resources in section IV.

The term \u201ctransfer\u201d is often used interchangeably with the term \u201cgrant.\u201d In some countries, transfers may also be known under different names, such as \u201csubventions\u201d or \u201clocal government subsidies.\u201d Transfers can be used for a wide variety of purposes. They can be used to ensure: \u2022 \u201cvertical\u201d fiscal balance (providing additional resources to the local level, so that there is a balance between the fiscal needs and resources available to different levels of government); \u2022 \u201chorizontal\u201d fiscal balance (ensuring fiscal balance in resource allocations between government units at the same level of government); \u2022 the funding of specific national priorities; or \u2022 that the effects of inter-regional spill-overs or externalities are counter-acted. Transfers can also be used to compensate sub-national governments for complying with central government mandates or implementing central government programmes that are delegated to the sub-national level. Unfortunately, and despite many good fiscal policy applications for intergovernmental transfers, in practice transfers are also often used simply to assure central government control over local government activities through grant conditions. Intergovernmental transfers come in a wide variety of forms depending on the purpose for which they are used and can be classified or categorised in a number of ways. Common dimensions along which to consider different transfer mechanisms include: (i) the determination of the total size of the transfer pool (i.e. how and on what basis the intergovernmental transfer pool is defined); (ii) the determination of the distribution of the resources between qualifying local government jurisdictions (i.e. how and on what basis allocations to local governments are calculated); and (iii) the guidelines and conditionalities imposed for the use of funds that are transferred to the local level. Although the manner in which an intergovernmental fiscal transfer system is structured and the method used to divide its funds among eligible sub-national governments can vary based on the policy objectives that the transfer seeks to achieve, international experience indicates a number of universal principles and practices that should be observed in designing appropriate transfer systems. These universally accepted principles of transfer design include: \u2022 Providing revenue adequacy: A transfer formula should, as far as possible, provide a source of adequate resources to local governments. 5 UNDP Primer: Fiscal Decentralisation and Poverty Reduction \u2022 Preserving budget autonomy: A transfer system should preserve budget autonomy at the sub- national level within the constraints provided by national priorities. Within such constraints, local government authorities need to retain the power to determine their own budgets. \u2022 Enhancing equity and fairness: The transfer mechanism should support a fair allocation of resources. \u2022 Stability: Transfers should be provided in a predictable manner over time. \u2022 Simplicity and transparency: Transfer formulas should be simple and transparent, and should pursue one objective at a time. \u2022 Incentive compatibility: The transfer system should not create negative incentives for local revenue mobilization, and should not induce inefficient expenditure choices. \u2022 Focus on service delivery: Transfer formulas should focus on the demand (clients or outputs) rather than the supply (inputs and infrastructure) of local government services. \u2022 Avoid equal shares: Reliance on the \u201cequal shares\u201d principle (whereby all local governments at the same level, whatever their size or characteristics, receive the same size of transfer) as a major allocation factor should be avoided in the design of an allocation formula. \u2022 Avoid sudden large changes: The transfer system should avoid sudden large changes in funding for local governments during the introduction of the new transfer mechanism. \u2022 Grants should be announced in a timely manner corresponding to the local budget cycle. \u2192 See further materials in the detailed primer on intergovernmental fiscal transfers and resources in section IV. Sub-national borrowing The final pillar of fiscal decentralisation is a logical corollary to the first three pillars. A local government\u2019s fiscal balance can be defined as the difference between its expenditure responsibilities, on the one hand, and its own source revenues and transfers on the other hand. If any local government expenditure needs are not properly balanced with the resources available to it, this could result in sub-national deficits and the incurrence of debt. Local borrowing might be appropriate for certain types of local spending, such as responsible borrowing for long-term capital development projects, but generally not for recurrent spending. Local borrowing is also frequently constrained by the lack of local government creditworthiness in many developing countries, especially amongst rural local governments. The presence of a well-defined local government framework for borrowing and issuing bonds is crucial in order to assure a hard budget constraint", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f7bdcf74-79d9-4741-8cdd-3fc9f202e498": {"__data__": {"id_": "f7bdcf74-79d9-4741-8cdd-3fc9f202e498", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/fiscal-decentralisation-and-poverty-reduction", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Fiscal Decentralisation and Poverty Reduction", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/fiscal-decentralisation-and-poverty-reduction", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c8083bdea000fad53ed9a62c3c00158e555d508858110594bb1e59f48359901f"}, "3": {"node_id": "950df9e1-ad60-4fd6-9eff-b58c1512e3dd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/fiscal-decentralisation-and-poverty-reduction", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7194e931a0ca9fd0eb5ce9a24465b15db0cdb658b8d845fc4de2029de50fb006"}}, "hash": "994ed1a738efa08fc15793b4b948c085f1d5d36ae9693fdd34886529efbe5ca7", "text": "for local governments. Unless local borrowing is appropriately addressed and regulated, local governments might end up overextending themselves financially and end up in arrears. Since local governments are part of the public sector, it is often presumed (correctly or incorrectly) that the central government will fund local deficits or guarantee local government arrears. As long as the central government is presumed to financially bail out local governments, perverse incentives exist for local governments to run budget deficits. In addition, because excessive sub-national borrowing or the risk of major defaults can have important ramifications for macroeconomic conditions (e.g. in driving up interest rates) and the ability of the central government to rely on fiscal policy as a tool to manage macro-economic conditions, central governments often require sub-national governments to balance their budgets or tightly regulate their ability to borrow. \u2192 See further resources in section IV 6 UNDP Primer: Fiscal Decentralisation and Poverty Reduction 3. Fiscal Decentralisation and Poverty Reduction: Links to the MDGs Before examining in more detail the linkages between fiscal decentralisation and poverty reduction, it is important to very briefly outline the broader relationship between decentralisation in general and poverty reduction. As mentioned earlier, it is generally assumed that by bringing decision-making about the provision of public goods and services closer to citizens, decentralisation allows poor people to voice themselves more clearly, facilitates communication and information flows between local policy-makers and their constituents, and fosters improved accountability. These assumptions need to hold true for decentralisation to \u201cdeliver the goods\u201d, so to speak \u2013 and this may not always be the case, for a variety of reasonsvi. It would be safe to say that the jury is still out on whether and to what extent decentralisation in general contributes to poverty reduction (see Jutting etal. 2004 and Jutting etal. 2005). A number of important studies and think-pieces (among others, see Moore and Putzel 1999; Crook and Sverisson 1999) have underlined that decentralisation, in and of itself, is not synonymous with poverty reduction \u2013 and that a wide range of \u201cexternal\u201d factors (e.g. central government\u2019s political commitment to poverty reduction, overall literacy rates, the strength and effectiveness of central government institutions and functions, gender sensitivity in public expenditure management, etc.) determine whether the outcomes of decentralisation are pro-poor or not. However, if the assumptions do hold, an appropriately crafted set of intergovernmental fiscal relations constitutes an essential pre-requisite for translating the promise of decentralisation into the reality of poverty reduction. Simply stated, what local government offers \u2013 better opportunities for public participation, improved transparency, and greater accountability \u2013 will only lead to pro-poor services and outcomes if: (i) local government does what it is best suited to doing (and not what it is ill-equipped to manage or deliver); (ii) it has access to the fiscal resources with which to finance local public service delivery; and (iii) the financial resources needed by local government are made available in equitable and non-regressive ways. As such, fiscal decentralisation is an important cross-cutting thematic area with major implications for poverty reductionvii and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Fiscal decentralisation enters into countries\u2019 poverty alleviation strategies in a number of ways. On the basis of the \u201csubsidiarity\u201d principle (discussed above), sub-national governments are often given the responsibility for managing many \u201cpro-poor\u201d priority sectors, including primary and secondary education, primary health care, agricultural extension, water and sanitation services, and local roads and public infrastructure. In many countries, responsibilities for reducing income poverty and improving food security are also assigned to the local government level, since it is assumed that the proximity of local government officials to the target groups reduces the information and transaction costs associated with identifying the poor and thus puts them in a better position to deliver pro-poor services. Local governments, then, are generally in a good position to provide many of the key pro-poor public services that can contribute directly to attaining MDGs 1- 7. Proponents of decentralisation believe that sub-national governments are generally in a better position than the central government to identify local needs (including those of the poor) and to deliver public services accordingly. However, when exploring the relationship between fiscal decentralisation and poverty reduction it needs to be remembered that there are certain things that local governments are badly placed to do as part of a poverty alleviation strategy.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "950df9e1-ad60-4fd6-9eff-b58c1512e3dd": {"__data__": {"id_": "950df9e1-ad60-4fd6-9eff-b58c1512e3dd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/fiscal-decentralisation-and-poverty-reduction", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Fiscal Decentralisation and Poverty Reduction", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/fiscal-decentralisation-and-poverty-reduction", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c8083bdea000fad53ed9a62c3c00158e555d508858110594bb1e59f48359901f"}, "2": {"node_id": "f7bdcf74-79d9-4741-8cdd-3fc9f202e498", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/fiscal-decentralisation-and-poverty-reduction", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "994ed1a738efa08fc15793b4b948c085f1d5d36ae9693fdd34886529efbe5ca7"}}, "hash": "7194e931a0ca9fd0eb5ce9a24465b15db0cdb658b8d845fc4de2029de50fb006", "text": "As noted in the previous section, the \u201csubsidiarity\u201d principle strongly suggests that income redistribution policies aimed at alleviating poverty should not be the responsibility of local governments, as they are poorly placed to carry out this function effectively.

In short, to ensure sound coordination as well as equitable development across regional 7 UNDP Primer: Fiscal Decentralisation and Poverty Reduction and local governments, a strong and effective central government and well-developed institutional framework for intergovernmental fiscal relations are needed. That said, local governments have a significant role to play in the delivery of pro-poor public services. As already noted, many \u2013 if not most \u2013 public services that are closely associated with poverty alleviation are generally believed to be best delivered by local governments. Incidence studies (which examine who benefits from public services), for example, show that local sectors, such as education and certain public health services, are indeed among the most pro-poor areas of public spending (Martinez-Vazquez, 2001). However, the link between local resource availability and service delivery outcomes is not necessarily uniform across regions and local governments (Hofman and Guerra, 2004). This is because some local governments use the resources at their disposal more efficiently than others, thereby highlighting the importance of local participation and accountability in assuring pro-poor outcomes. Local governments, then, can be assigned functional responsibilities for a wide range of pro-poor public services, which they are well-placed to provide in an efficient and responsive manner. That said, the issue then becomes one of understanding how local governments can best finance such service delivery functions in ways that positively foster pro-poor outcomes (and avoid regressive ones). The following sections of this primer therefore look at the second and third pillars (revenues and transfers) of fiscal decentralisation to see how they relate to poverty reduction issues. The revenue dimension of fiscal decentralisation has a strong bearing on the ability of and incentives faced by local government to address basic service delivery needsviii. A high degree of revenue decentralisation or revenue autonomy, for example, is generally not associated with improvements in the equitable distribution of public resources. This is particularly true in LDCs, where rural (as opposed to urban) local governments often have an extremely limited tax base, as well as a weak tax administration capacity. In such circumstances, requiring local governments to rely on own-source revenues would substantially increase inequalities between local jurisdictions, although this can be off set through the design of appropriate grant or transfer schemes (e.g. by introducing equalisation grants to poor jurisdictionsix). In addition to addressing inter-regional revenue disparities, there is also a need to critically analyse the impact of revenue collection on poverty at the local level. Incidence studies (which look at who pays revenues financing public services) conducted in a number of countries have found that the collection of taxes and, in particular, of user fees is often regressivex. However, the impact of revenue assignments on income redistribution should not be over- stated. Martinez-Vazquez (2001), for example, concludes that pro-poor outcomes are achieved predominantly through spending policies, rather than through revenue assignments. Nonetheless, some degree of revenue autonomy on the part of local governments may positively contribute to pro-poor outcomes. Firstly, own-source revenues are usually important sources of discretionary expenditure for local governments \u2013 and this may allow them to respond effectively to very local needs and problems, thus accruing the \u201callocative efficiencies\u201d that decentralisation is supposed to encourage. Transfers, on the other hand, are often tied or conditional, and thus do not provide for a great deal of local government discretion in deciding how they are to be used \u2013 this reduces the likelihood of \u201callocative efficiencies\u201d being achieved. Secondly, a degree of revenue autonomy can provide local governments with incentives to attract private sector investment (and thus stimulate economic growth), because they will benefit from any revenue increases associated with a growing economy. Insofar as economic growth is pro- poor, then, local government revenue autonomy may be seen as leading to poverty reduction. However, there are clearly potential trade-offs here for the reasons suggested in the preceding paragraph. In contrast, the design of intergovernmental fiscal transfer systems can have a significant impact on the ability of local governments to contribute to strategic MDG policies, as local governments in developing economies typically receive as much as 80-90% of their resources from transfers: 8 UNDP Primer: Fiscal Decentralisation and Poverty Reduction \u2022 First, the size of the overall transfer pool is a significant determinant of the ability of local governments to engage in pro-poor spending.

Despite having explicit poverty reduction policies, the actual redistributional impact of the fiscal transfer system in some countries may in fact be counter-equalizing (see for instance, Boex 2003). A recent review of international practices shows that the outcomes of fiscal transfer systems vary from equalising (as intended) to politically motivated and counter-equalising (Boex and Martinez-Vazquez, 2004). Thus, the relationship between decentralisation and poverty may not depend on the degree of decentralisation, but rather on whether decentralisation is pursued in an equalising manner. \u2022 The third dimension of designing a transfer scheme is how local governments spend the transfer resources. Even when the horizontal allocation mechanism (such as the transfer formula) is equalising, this does not necessarily mean that resources are spent in a pro-poor manner at the local level; transfer resources may be captured by local elites (Crook, 2003). Central governments often try to regulate the local use of transfer funds through conditionalities, budget guidelines and minimum service standardsxi, but this may also limit the ability of local governments to address poverty issues. There is clearly a need for open local budget processes, participatory and inclusive planning procedures, and so forth in order to foster pro-poor local government spending (see Practice Note on Decentralization, Local Governance and Urban/Rural Development). Furthermore, systems of performance-based allocations may help improve the accountability, transparency, inclusiveness and pro-poor nature of local government public expenditure managementxii. 9 UNDP Primer: Fiscal Decentralisation and Poverty Reduction III. UNDP\u2019s Approach and Possible Entry Points 1. UNDP\u2019s approach for support to fiscal decentralisation Since 1998, UNDP has advocated for integrating human rights with development through the use of a Human Rights Based Approach (HRBA) to its development programmesxiii. In essence, HRBA applies the international human rights framework (the universal declaration on human rights, the international covenants and other international tools) to development programmes. Focusing on human rights attains two main goals: (i) it provides a normative framework for policies and programmesxiv and (ii) it defines a basis for minimum legitimate demands by \u201cclaim-holders\u201d and obligations on the part of \u201cduty-bearers\u201d. HRBA also ensures accountability of the state, its organs and individuals (\u201cduty bearers\u201d) that are obliged \u2013 under the international legal framework \u2013 to guarantee protection of and respect for basic rights. Finally, HRBA develops the capacity of the claim holders (including the most vulnerable and poorest segments of the population) to have their entitlements recognised and fulfilled, as well as the capacity of duty-bearers to meet their obligations. UNDP applies a human rights based methodology to decentralisation and local governancexv. In the specific case of fiscal decentralisation, this translates into the following main points, which together define the key entry points for UNDP: \u2022 Clear assignment of functional (expenditure) responsibilities across different levels of central and local government is fundamental to the identification of duty bearers and their respective obligations. \u2022 Assignment of responsibilities to local governments without the corresponding provision of adequate financial resources should be avoided since this would limit the capacity of local governments to meet their obligations. \u2022 Special consideration should be given to the human rights implications of fiscal decentralisation reforms, in terms of analysing whether public services are improved and rights better protected. \u2022 Any assessment of a reform of intergovernmental fiscal relations should include an analysis of its likely impact on the poorest and most vulnerable groups, as well as on inter-regional disparities (see section II on the linkages between fiscal decentralisation and poverty reduction).

Where appropriate, UNDP support is structured around two complementary broad sets of instruments for effecting change in the policy framework for fiscal decentralisation and pro-poor service delivery: \u2022 The strategic use of UNDP downstream activities to pilot mechanisms for the financing of services and infrastructure at the local level with trialling and support for the development of operational procedures (e.g. guidelines, regulations, etc.). Such pilot projects aim at (i) addressing explicit \u2018policy 10 UNDP Primer: Fiscal Decentralisation and Poverty Reduction issues\u2019 by testing improved and innovative procedures and practices at the local level; (ii) working through local government institutions so as to improve these \u201cfrom within\u201d, rather than creating parallel systems or resource flows; and (iii) being \u201cowned\u201d by national policy making bodies, thereby allowing \u201cpolicy-relevant\u201d lessons to be monitored, documented and disseminated within and by these bodies. \u2022 Pilot projects at the local level are complemented by upstream advisory and advocacy activities. These activities are aimed more directly at those institutions involved in policy making and oversight, or in formulating recommendations for change. As such, these activities generate (or respond to) opportunities to reform policies by: (i) informing the policy debate, through documenting the implications of current policy or practice, drawing the lessons learned from the pilot portfolio, and/or identifying policy options; (ii) building the capacities of key national stakeholders for policy analysis, formulation and oversight; and (iii) promoting strategic dialogue and collaboration between development partners. Within this broad framework, entry points for UNDP assistance and emerging challenges are outlined below. The capital development funding provided by UNCDF programmes offers an entry point for piloting financing mechanisms and for delivering related upstream support, and the examples below include UNCDF programme support in LDCs. 2. UNDP entry points in support of fiscal decentralisation Integrating fiscal decentralisation in strategies for achieving the MDGs Any planning for achieving the MDGs (e.g. in the context of PRSPs) needs to address the role of local governments in these strategic interventions. Should specific interventions (e.g. the delivery of certain services or public infrastructure) be delivered by local governments, by deconcentrated structures of central government ministries or by semi-autonomous agencies that form a parallel mechanism? As such, the entire system of sub-national government finance (the assignment of expenditure responsibilities, the assignment of revenue sources, the definition of intergovernmental fiscal transfers and the sub-national borrowing framework) should be considered as an integral part of the policies and strategies for achieving the MDGs. The choice of overall strategy involves at least two major decisions. Firstly, a strategy for the choice and combination of approaches to local development is needed. Here, a distinction can be made between (i) decentralised sectoral approaches, (ii) direct community support approaches and (iii) local government approachesxvi and financing should be provided accordingly within the national framework for fiscal decentralisation. Secondly, having decided on the mix of approaches and, hence, expenditure assignments to local government, the type of funding/grants (government and donor) would have to be decided. Many of the \u2018targeted\u2019 programmes identified in poverty reduction strategies tend to suffer from a number of the weaknesses highlighted in the previous section, notably in defining the framework for horizontal allocation, by limiting the discretionary decision-making powers of local governments and by relying on funding mechanisms for the sub-national level that are based on ad hoc decisions and/or reimbursement of approved expenditures. As mentioned in Section II, financing redistributive policies should be mainly the responsibility of central (rather than local) government because of the national nature of income redistribution issues. Despite this general policy prescription, sub-national governments in many developing and transitional countries undertake significant redistributive activities. Hence, strategic decisions are also concerned with specifying which poverty alleviation activities local governments should not engage in. Comparative examples on integrating fiscal decentralisation into strategies for achieving the MDGs include the following countries: 11 UNDP Primer: Fiscal Decentralisation and Poverty Reduction \u2022 In Nepal, UNDP supported the efforts to strengthen the linkages between the MDGs and the PRSP/National Development Plan by applying the Millennium Project\u2019s needs-based approach [link].

Improving information bases and flows One possible \u2013 and very general \u2013 entry point is to simply support the development of better information about issues linked to fiscal decentralisation and poverty reduction. Although this is perhaps self-evident, without robust information, policy-makers will be unable (i) to know whether fiscal decentralisation is pro- poor and contributing to the attainment of MDGs, (ii) to determine the spatial distribution of poverty (and thus design appropriate equalisation measures), or (iii) to measure progress. UNDP can, then, contribute to strengthening the linkages between fiscal decentralisation and poverty reduction by improving the quality and quantity of information that is available to policy makers and other stakeholders. An example of this kind of support includes: \u2022 In China, UNDP is supporting reforms to the local government budget classification system, making it more transparent and easier to track pro-poor expenditures. Analysing the impact on the Poor and Disadvantaged Groups: Incidence Studies, Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys (PETS) and Public Expenditure Reviews (PERs) In the analysis of options for fiscal decentralisation, UNDP can play a key role by supporting a pro-poor policy perspective. Whereas a set of principles and policy considerations forms the basis for defining expenditure assignments and the means for financing them (revenues, grants and borrowing), there remains a need for specific analysis of the outcomes with respect to poverty. UNDP has a proven track record in addressing poverty issues in decentralised governance, as well as in the analysis and assessment of the pro-poor dimensions to fiscal decentralisation policy and practice. Fiscal Incidence Studies and Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys (PETS) are powerful tools for analysing the pro-poor outcomes of fiscal decentralisation. Expenditure incidence studies are used to quantify the actual benefits received by the poor from different (central and local government) expenditure programmes. Incidence studies thus help guide the decision on which public programmes \u2013 and which levels of government \u2013 are best positioned to provide pro-poor services. PETS, applied specifically within a context of fiscal decentralisation, are used to track the share of grants (and other resources) reaching schools, health clinics and other services with a high impact on poverty. The methodology is also used to analyse the actual allocations made by local governments with discretionary decision-making powers as compared to previous allocations made by central government and/or non-devolved service providers (such as line ministries). Examples of influential PETS and Incidence Studies include: \u2022 PETS conducted in Uganda which encouraged central and local government to make changes in the utilisation of grants and the flow of information. See also Ritva and Svensson (2001). \u2022 Alderman (1998) showed that local governments in Albania \u2013 through a conditional transfer scheme \u2013 were in a position to provide social assistance in a more effective and more pro-poor manner than the central government. 12 UNDP Primer: Fiscal Decentralisation and Poverty Reduction \u2022 An incidence study of intergovernmental transfers in Tanzania (Boex, 2003) demonstrated that the central government \u2013 through its system of discretionary grants \u2013 was allocating local government resources in a dis-equalising manner (with wealthier local governments receiving greater transfers). This study helped justify the introduction of a more equitable system of formula-based block grants. \u2022 In Nigeria, PETS was one of the tools used to develop a Benchmarking Exercise that examines and analyses the capacity of States in four areas (policy, communications and transparency, fiscal and budget management, and service delivery), all of which have a significant bearing on local poverty reduction efforts. Supporting sub-national Public Expenditure Reviews (PERs) is another way of highlighting the pro-poor outcomes of fiscal decentralisation policies and for informing pro-poor policy reforms. Sub-national PERs allow stakeholders to see how and on what local governments spend and how they finance such expenditure. \u2022 In China, UNDP\u2019s \u201cCapacity Building to Support Pro-Poor Fiscal Reform\u201d Project undertakes sub- national PERs that try to analyse whether and how county-level expenditures and revenues are pro- poor or not, with a view to informing fiscal decentralisation policy reforms in China as a whole. These PERs aim to better understand whether county administrative expenditures are disproportionately high, how expenditures are financed, and whether counties are able to access sufficient resources to meet their wide range of expenditure assignments.

Recent studies, for example, have shown that poor people often spend a disproportionately larger share of their income (than the less poor) in paying local taxes and user fees. This may indicate that local user fees need to be made more progressivexvii. However, care should be taken not to throw out the proverbial baby (the benefits of local revenue autonomy) with the bathwater (inequitable outcomes). Instead, and whenever possible, equity concerns should be addressed through improvements in the local revenue system (for instance, through local property tax exemptions for poor households) or other creative local revenue solutions (such as the introduction of differential user fee structures, such that poorer households pay lower user fees). A special case of inequitable local resource mobilisation lies in the conventional practice of requiring \u2018community contributions\u2019 to match outside investment funding \u2013 here too there is some evidence that the outcomes may often be regressive (see Vietnam study cited below). UNDP\u2019s focus on improving local revenue mobilisation is shifting towards a more sophisticated analysis and understanding of local revenue issues, rather than simply concentrating on revenue administration. For instance, it is becoming increasingly clear that the poor quality of local government services is often a key contributing factor to persistent local tax evasion, and that improving service delivery may therefore be a pre-condition for successfully strengthening local government revenues. Increasing attention is also being paid to the nature of the relationship between taxpayers and local government, and to ways of establishing better dialogue and greater trust between them. Another constraint to adequate local revenue mobilisation (which has received more attention in recent years) is the fragmented nature and structure of sub-national taxes, licenses and user fees, which often limits local government revenues to minor, low-yielding sources that are relatively costly to administer. Relevant country examples in the areas mentioned above include: \u2022 Study of taxpayers\u2019 decisions on whether to pay or evade local taxes in Tanzania. \u2022 Facilitating dialogue between local taxpayers and municipal authorities with support from UNV in Ghana. 13 UNDP Primer: Fiscal Decentralisation and Poverty Reduction \u2022 Overview of new utility policies introduced in the Municipality of Budapest (Hungary) during the 1990s, including social subsidies for utility charges through a self-funded, need-based Compensation Fund. \u2022 Studies of revenue (and expenditure) assignments in Serbia, Macedonia, Croatia, Georgia and Armenia. \u2022 Study of the impact of user fees in Vietnam. \u2022 Support for improving revenue mobilisation in Malawi. \u2022 Support for rationalising and reforming property tax regimes in China. \u2022 Various studies in Uganda. \u2022 See also Lessons Learned on Donor Support to Decentralisation and Local Governance (OECD 2004) for findings in various countries. Linking local planning to decentralized financing As noted earlier, the potential pro-poor benefits of decentralisation are unlikely to be reaped unless the system of local government finance is systematically tied to a sound system of community participation and citizen involvement in local planning and budgeting. Conversely, if they are to be effective and efficient, participatory local planning processes should be budget-based and firmly embedded in the framework of local government finance. In many of the 100-odd countries where it provides support for decentralisation and local governance, UNDP has established a strong track record in supporting participatory planning with assistance provided for policy development, for developing mechanisms for meaningful popular participation at the sub-regional level, and for ensuring civil society/community group involvement and consultations in local government public expenditure management. Indeed, this focus on participation and inclusion is consistent with the HRBA that underpins UNDP\u2019s work in the area of decentralisation and local governance \u2013 citizens, as claim-holders, have the right to participate in and to be informed of local planning. UNDP supports efforts to improve linkages between needs assessments at the grass-roots level and planning at higher levels of local government, and increasingly to link planning to finance in order to ensure implementation and the sustainable management of services in support of the MDGs. This entails support to develop the national framework for fiscal decentralisation as well as to strengthen local government capacity for budgeting and the management of devolved resources, including specific measures for pro-poor budgeting.

UNDP facilitates the participatory processes and provides technical input for reviewing 14 UNDP Primer: Fiscal Decentralisation and Poverty Reduction intergovernmental fiscal transfer systems with the aim of making them as pro-poor and equitable as possible. Country examples include: \u2022 The intergovernmental fiscal transfers study conducted for the Government of Malawi. \u2022 Support for the development of an allocation formula for district grants in Nepal. \u2022 Support for the development and implementation of a formula-based system of intergovernmental grants in Tanzania. \u2022 Support for the development of a new fiscal transfer system in Uganda. \u2022 Support for an overall analysis of fiscal decentralisation issues (including intergovernmental fiscal transfers) in several central and eastern European countries. Developing fiscal incentives to improve the performance of local governments While central governments generally expect local governments to contribute to achieving certain national policy objectives, the system of local government finance is not always aligned with these policy objectives. In fact, poorly designed financing systems can provide local governments with incentives to behave inefficientlyxix. The development of systems for performance-based allocations of intergovernmental fiscal transfers has proven to be a key instrument for encouraging sound financial behaviour by local governments and for improving the service delivery outcomes of devolved functions, including making these increasingly pro-poor. In a number of countries, UNDP/UNCDF have assisted central and local partners in developing performance-based approaches to fiscal transfers. This approach usually combines two instruments: \u2022 minimum conditions, which typically link local governments\u2019 compliance with basic requirements (as defined by laws and official regulations) to their access to grants; and \u2022 performance measures, which are applied to provide additional \u2018top up\u2019 grant allocations to the extent that local governments have met broader policy goals (such as poverty reduction). Steffensen and Larsen (2005) provide a useful overview and comparative analysis of these performance- based funding instruments. The capital development grants and technical support provided by UNCDF programmes have, in many cases, provided an entry point for developing such performance-based approaches to fiscal transfers, and country examples include: \u2022 In Mali, minimum conditions were tested for access to annual block grants from the Local Development Fund, and performance assessments take place within two broad categories, with the possibility of obtaining an additional block grant allocation (French only). \u2022 The Anseba Local Development Fund in Eritrea contained a set of minimum conditions introduced and applied progressively in years 1 and 2 of the pilot programme. Performance criteria are applied to reward good technical performance and pro-poor outcomes (see the programme document and operations manual). \u2022 Local government access to the District Development Fund in Uganda was conditional upon compliance with a set of minimum conditions and the country now has one of the most sophisticated systems for performance-based allocations, allowing annual grants to vary +/- 20 percent. \u2022 In Ethiopia, the access of the woredas to capital funding is based on satisfactory compliance with a number of minimum conditions. \u2022 In Nepal, and based on experience in Uganda and elsewhere, the Government and UNDP/UNCDF are currently piloting a model of minimum conditions and performance criteria through the Decentralised Financing and Development Programme. 15 UNDP Primer: Fiscal Decentralisation and Poverty Reduction \u2022 In Bangladesh, the Government and UNDP/UNCDF have been piloting a mechanism whereby union parishads receive block grants for the first time, subject to their meeting basic standards of management and governance. This approach is now being replicated by on a wider scale by the Government. Support for Fiscal Decentralisation Reform Processes and Consultations Cutting across the above-mentioned support for various elements of the fiscal decentralisation framework, UNDP also facilitates the work of fora of national stakeholders on fiscal decentralisation issues. In a number of countries, specific assistance is provided for fiscal commissions as the main institutions for facilitating a dialogue on fiscal decentralisation, strengthening national ownership of fiscal decentralisation reforms and developing an appropriate national framework for local government finance. In accordance with HRBA, a finance commission which is constitutionally mandated to determine the allocation of central revenues to provinces, and from provinces to local bodies, on the basis of transparent norms, helps ensure that universalism is not compromised, and that there is no inequality and discrimination based on e.g. ethnic, religious or political party considerations. As a core part of this support, UNDP advocates for, and helps facilitate, broad-based national and local consultations on issues related to fiscal decentralisation. Such consultations not only reinforce the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "228ef915-00a3-4b63-8cba-0e1a2a3182e9": {"__data__": {"id_": "228ef915-00a3-4b63-8cba-0e1a2a3182e9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/fiscal-decentralisation-and-poverty-reduction", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Fiscal Decentralisation and Poverty Reduction", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/fiscal-decentralisation-and-poverty-reduction", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "046fd8d10fecd53600dfb6a98811f166b243ea1e33a8b062400739299eca1dec"}}, "hash": "046fd8d10fecd53600dfb6a98811f166b243ea1e33a8b062400739299eca1dec", "text": "ownership and transparency of any policy process, but also increase the likelihood of poverty being seen as an issue and of pro-poor considerations being factored into fiscal decentralisation policy. UNDP also assists governments in ensuring that information about fiscal decentralisation policy-making and policies is made available to the public. Support is provided for decentralisation reviews and for facilitating discussions between governments and donors on policy options, including in the area of fiscal decentralisation. UNDP assistance can take a variety of forms: support for the policy process, help in formulating and drafting implementation plans and road maps, and \u2013 in many cases \u2013 support for reviewing various concrete options. Country examples include: \u2022 Support for developing the institutional capacity of the fiscal commission in Sri Lanka. \u2022 Support to the Local Bodies\u2019 Fiscal Commission in Nepal to formulate a fiscal decentralisation road map and implement the individual components. Facilitating dialogue among bilateral donors and international financial institutions International agencies and bilateral donors are currently engaged in promoting political and economic stability in many countries, some of which have been beset by, or even born out of ethnic and civil strife. There are inevitable tensions between the political and economic reforms which the various bilateral donors and international financial institutions promote. Depending on the government\u2019s own ability to coordinate international agencies, UNDP can play an important role by facilitating dialogue between the government, bilateral donors, and international financial institutions to break down the barriers to effective fiscal decentralisation. Most development partners (including UNDP) are typically concerned with issues of pro-poor development, governance and political stability. A high priority is often accorded to decentralisation as a way of diluting the concentration of political power, providing some degree of local autonomy for disaffected minorities, and improving the accountability of local public services. This implies some devolution of taxing and spending power. In contrast, other agencies are chiefly concerned with achieving macro-economic stability, involving \u2013 inter alia \u2013 the reduction of fiscal deficits and associated public sector debt, and the rationalisation of tax systems to remove disincentives for enterprise development and job creation. These objectives are typically pursued through a tight centralisation of taxing and spending powers, overseen by ministries of finance. 16 UNDP Primer: Fiscal Decentralisation and Poverty Reduction At first sight, these economic and political objectives are seemingly incompatible, leading to conflicting pressures on governments from the international community. As such, ensuring a constructive dialogue between development partners and international agencies (to see whether and how far different political and economic agendas can be reconciled) is extremely important to the success of any decentralisation policy. 3. Links to other Practices How does UNDP\u2019s work on fiscal decentralisation within the Democratic Governance Practice (the second of UNDP\u2019s five practices) relate to the four other Practice areas? In addition to the links between fiscal decentralisation and the efforts to achieve the MDGs and reduce human poverty (the first of UNDP\u2019s five practices), which have been discussed in detail in this primer, there are a number of issues that relate to the remaining three practices. Energy and Environment for Sustainable Development The impact of fiscal decentralisation on the environment is a key issue to include in any analysis. The sharing of revenues from the taxation of natural resource exploitation and use is closely related to environmental issues. This has an impact on the capacity to finance services and, hence, on poverty as well as on the exploitation of the natural resources. There is no easy or correct answer to the \u2018right\u2019 way of sharing natural resource taxes, but some policy directions seem clear. Firstly, the central government is in the best position to tax natural resources, since it has the major appropriate instruments of taxation and the tax administration advantage. Secondly, there should be some sharing with federal and local governments, if only because of the need to compensate them for the costs associated with natural resource use/exploitation in their jurisdictions. The key issues to be addressed include: (i) what is an appropriate division of revenues between central and local government (vertical sharing) ? (ii) how should revenues related to natural resource use/exploitation be distributed among local governments (horizontal sharing) ? (iii) should local governments be allowed to tax extractive industries (see further in Bahl and Tumennasan 2002) ? Crisis Prevention and Recovery Fiscal autonomy and the more specific issue of sharing of local revenues are at the heart of many conflicts of a regional or local nature and are often an integral part of many peace and regional autonomy agreements.

Responding to HIV/AIDS Major opportunities for addressing the global HIV/AIDS epidemic exist at the local level with a need for community intervention as well as a role for local governments. Hence, any planning for achieving the MDG target on HIV/AIDS involves the same concerns with respect to fiscal decentralisation as outlined above (see further www.worldbank.org/urban/hivaids/handbook/handbook.pdf). 17 UNDP Primer: Fiscal Decentralisation and Poverty Reduction IV.

Deconcentration means a transfer of responsibilities, powers and resources from the central government (ministries and agencies) to field offices at the local and regional level, thereby becoming closer to the citizens while remaining a part of the central government system. The staff is fully accountable to the centre, and the regional/local administrations typically have no or very limited discretion on how the services are provided and there are no independent local revenue sources, i.e. the regional/local bodies are seen as service delivery arms of the centre. Delegation is an intermediate form, where the centre retains more control over service delivery, the financing of these services and staffing matters. The centre can withdraw and overrule the local governments within areas of delegation and the local governments, although they may be led by locally elected politicians, are fully or partially accountable to the centre. iv The assignment of expenditure responsibility has a multi-dimensional nature: the assignment of an expenditure responsibility can be broken down into four attributes, including the responsibility to (i) produce, (ii) provide, (iii) finance, and (iv) set policy standards and regulate a certain government function. For example, while local governments are often deemed to be in the best position to provide primary education, primary schooling can be produced either by local governments themselves, or by private schools in their jurisdiction. Likewise, higher-level governments often share the responsibility of financing and regulating local primary education. Central governments often regulate and (co-)finance primary education since there are significant equity issues involved in access to education, and because many of the benefits from primary education accrue to the nation as a whole. When the responsibilities to produce, provide, finance and set policy standards/regulate a certain government function do not all fall within the jurisdiction of a single level of government, institutions and processes need to be set up in order to assure that different levels of government work together effectively. v Like expenditure assignments, revenue assignments are multi-dimensional. A comprehensive definition of a revenue assignment considers which government level: (1) legislates a tax; (2) defines the tax base (and exemptions); (3) determines the tax rate; (4) collects/administers the tax; and (5) receives the revenues from the tax ?

Poverty reduction as analysed in this guidance note refers to non-money-metric measures of poverty. As indicated in this section, local authorities can intervene in generating incomes. However, in most countries local authorities are mainly responsible for delivering basic social services (basic education, health services, water/sanitation services etc). So in a majority of countries local bodies can play an important role in reducing the non-money metric dimensions of poverty. viii See e.g. J. Steffensen and P. Tidemand: Synthesis Report: A Comparative Analysis of Decentralisation in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, 2004. 23 UNDP Primer: Fiscal Decentralisation and Poverty Reduction ix To the extent that national revenues are typically collected in only a few wealthy regions and then distributed across the entire national territory (either through central government spending or through intergovernmental transfers), revenue centralisation can improve fiscal redistribution. x See e.g. Fiscal Decentralisation Strategy \u2013 The Way Forward, on Uganda, http://www.molg.go.ug and further in the next section on UNDP entry points). xi In order to assure a sound transfer mechanism, it is important to balance grant conditionalities with local flexibility. It is further important to assure that the service standards imposed on local governments are realistic and affordable given the available resources to the local level.

Likewise an equalization transfer that is based on sub-national revenue collections provides a perverse incentive to reduce sub-national revenues. 24", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5351c4a8-f807-4919-9141-0aa4bd381d0f": {"__data__": {"id_": "5351c4a8-f807-4919-9141-0aa4bd381d0f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/flying-colours-broken-threads", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Flying Colours, Broken Threads", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/flying-colours-broken-threads", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7125ee8ddb89d15ec54e37f9fe257c50560a8f1d408adb9fbaf26a7fbcbb3e97"}, "3": {"node_id": "e3d4a78f-c961-4a2c-bce4-ed8bd971f74f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/flying-colours-broken-threads", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "990955fccbb19f40b6ef70eef4142a59e41e6425f24abcb2b715b75a914ccda0"}}, "hash": "a86b825225e4b0a9099fa5f7af72ccbc7054c0a2c3c5037d63bfa6f949e42097", "text": "Flying Colours, Broken Threads: TRACKING REPORT One Year of Evidence from Asia after the Phase-out of Textiles and Clothing Quotas Asia-Pacific Trade and Investment Initiative UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo December 2005 (Revised January 2006) Ratnakar Adhikari Yumiko Yamamoto Published by UNDP Asia-Pacific Trade and Investment Initiative* Layout and Design by A&D Advertising, Colombo Printed in Sri Lanka \u00a9 UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre in Colombo, December 2005 Cover Photo by Reuters First Edition ISBN 955-1031-10-5 * The opinions expressed in this Report do not necessarily reflect those of UNDP.

Introduction The textiles and clothing (T&C) sector hosts a substantial share of manufacturing jobs in many developing countries in Asia. Millions of people, most of them women, now work in the sector, and many were elevated from a subsistence level due to employment opportunities offered by this sector. It also is a sector that contributed to greater export performance of developing countries, thus generating foreign exchange earnings. Full implementation of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) on 1 January 2005 ended 40 years of quota-based trade in the sector, \u201cmanaged\u201d through non-transparent bilateral deals known as the Multi Fibre Arrangement (MFA). These deals violated the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4b569ca0-076b-413d-975e-0ca667e0153e": {"__data__": {"id_": "4b569ca0-076b-413d-975e-0ca667e0153e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/flying-colours-broken-threads", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Flying Colours, Broken Threads", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/flying-colours-broken-threads", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "218150d5df79650ee8771c38d4516d47fc4728e34bba9ba28d54caf67bcc6a8c"}, "3": {"node_id": "be4a12df-e7db-4337-ade4-c0b797005f5c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/flying-colours-broken-threads", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fcdf8a8c1662b0f5543c57f3a2d693904639ec8e2ebcca9fc6f23917edf85169"}}, "hash": "fcca2515961ce9c72b8d5f7fad99bc9065d7d848154c0ae9ac16089f8ae042a5", "text": "two fundamental principles of the WTO: most favoured nation (MFN),1 and limits on imposition of quantitative restrictions.2 Now that the T&C sector has become a part of the regular WTO discipline like other goods, no derogation shall be allowed to this sector. Quota limits, when they existed, directly restrained the exports of large developing countries. Many Least Developed Countries (LDCs) that had been able to expand production and obtain access to major markets under the MFA now face the prospect of major structural and socio-economic dislocation. The elimination of quotas has been expected to lead to major shifts in trade and investment flows. As competition in this sector intensifies, the most competitive players are likely to further consolidate their positions at the expense of the least competitive ones. It is feared that this will result in significant employment loss in countries belonging to the latter category, where enhancing competitiveness has remained elusive. In order to assess the human development impact of quota elimination, the UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo (UNDP RCC) launched a Textiles and Clothing Trade Flows Tracking System in 12 selected Asian countries (hereafter, the \u201cAsian 12\u201d) in May 2005. The Asian 12 consists of: Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (PDR), Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Viet Nam. These countries can be grouped into four categories: (1) countries with large production capability in both textile and apparel production (China, India); (2) countries that have limited production capability in both textile and apparel production (Indonesia, Pakistan, Thailand, Viet Nam); (3) middle-income countries that mainly have apparel production capability (Philippines, Sri Lanka); and (4) LDCs (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Nepal). In cooperation with national consultants in participating countries, UNDP RCC established the tracking system with the objectives of monitoring trade flows as well as key variables including shifts in employment patterns and international price trends in the T&C sector. Reports analysing the data and highlighting major trends are being published quarterly. This initiative complements a sub-project at UNDP RCC that aims at 1 Article I of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 2 Article XI of GATT. One Year of Evidence from Asia after the Phase-out of Textiles and Clothing Quotas 8 identifying national and regional policy options to address the possible negative economic and social impacts of the phasing out of quotas in 12 countries. A Tracking Report titled Trade Flows and Recent Developments in Textiles and Clothing in the Asia-Pacific was published in September 2005 and presented at the Geneva Dialogue on Trade Policy and Human Development, co-organised by UNDP RCC and held in Yverdon-les-Bains, Switzerland from 29 September to 1 October 2005. Based on suggestions from resource persons and participants at the Geneva Dialogue, an updated, revised version of the Report was published in October 2005. The publication was the first attempt to make the Report public, with a view to provoking wider discussion on the human development implications of the phasing out of T&C quotas. This Report, when first published in December 2005, updated several information contained in September/October Report, including analyses of several policy questions on the basis of most recent data and information available. The report is based on import data \u2013 from two major markets, namely the United States (US) and European Union (EU) for a period of nine months after the phase out of quotas (January \u2013 September 2005) \u2013 as well as countries trade data, where available.3 Another important value addition to this report is that it also incorporates, where appropriate, findings from the field visits conducted by the authors in four LDCs \u2013 Bangladesh, Cambodia, Lao PDR and Nepal \u2013between October and December 2005. The report was further updated in January 2006 to incorporate the decisions made at the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference of the WTO and comments and suggestions made by the participants during a Panel on Textile and Clothing: One Year of Evidence from Asia organised by UNDP RCC in Hong Kong on 16 December 2005. Other relevant data, such as employment, flows of investment into the T&C sector, the level of technology transfer and the skill levels of workers, are hard to obtain at the disaggregated level. Therefore, a full description of human development implications of the phasing out of quotas is not possible yet.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "be4a12df-e7db-4337-ade4-c0b797005f5c": {"__data__": {"id_": "be4a12df-e7db-4337-ade4-c0b797005f5c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/flying-colours-broken-threads", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Flying Colours, Broken Threads", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/flying-colours-broken-threads", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "218150d5df79650ee8771c38d4516d47fc4728e34bba9ba28d54caf67bcc6a8c"}, "2": {"node_id": "4b569ca0-076b-413d-975e-0ca667e0153e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/flying-colours-broken-threads", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fcca2515961ce9c72b8d5f7fad99bc9065d7d848154c0ae9ac16089f8ae042a5"}}, "hash": "fcdf8a8c1662b0f5543c57f3a2d693904639ec8e2ebcca9fc6f23917edf85169", "text": "Given these difficulties, the UNDP RCC has already initiated a firm-level survey in Bangladesh, in collaboration with the UNDP Country Office in Dhaka; this model may be replicated in other countries as well.

The Report is organised as follows: Chapter II discusses the general trend in Asia\u2019s share of US and EU imports of T&C products. Chapter III deals with some of policy concerns emanating from the recent development in the T&C trade, while Chapter IV analyses successful case studies from three countries (Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Thailand) to overcome the challenges posed by the phasing out of T&C quotas. This chapter also tries to draw key lessons for other developing countries as well as LDCs. The final chapter concludes the discussions and provides recommendations on the way forward. 3 The combined share of the US and EU imports of T&C products was 58.47 percent of global imports of these products in 2003 (see http://www.itcb.org/Documents/ITCB-TD03.pdf). However, these markets absorb a substantial share of the T&C exports from the majority of \u201cAsian 12\u201d. Since trade statistics in most of these countries are not regularly updated it is difficult to find recent data from all the countries. It is even more difficult to get the data for the similar periods to facilitate valid comparison. Flying Colours, Broken Threads 9 II. Asia\u2019s Share of US and EU Imports of T&C Products: General Trend Asia\u2019s Share of US and EU imports Asia\u2019s share of US and EU imports of T&C products continued to increase in the first nine months of the post-Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) regime. In 2004, about 42 percent of total US and EU imports were from the Asian 12; now, these countries\u2019 share accounts for more than half of US and EU imports of T&C products. Tables A-1a and A-1b show percentage shares of the Asian 12 and other regions that have trade agreements with the United States for imports of T&C products for the period of 2003, 2004, January-September 2004 and January-September 2005. Similarly, percentage shares of the Asian 12 and top trading partners for EU imports of T&C, textiles, and clothing products are displayed in Tables A-2a, A-2b, and A-2c respectively. A comparison of import figures for the first three quarters of 2005 with the corresponding period in 2004 shows that the share of US imports from the Asian 12 increased from 41.5 percent to 50.3 percent in value terms and from 41.9 percent to 50.5 percent in volume terms (Tables A-1a and A-1b). In contrast, regions that have trade agreements with the United States have lost their shares in US imports of T&C products, in spite of their preferential market access. The share of Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) countries plus Mexico in the US market declined from 21.5 percent to 19.2 percent in value terms and from 22.2 percent to 20.0 percent in volume terms. Shares of CBI plus Mexico were 23.0 percent and 22.7 percent in value and volume terms respectively in 2003. The share of African countries under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) \u2013 which are the beneficiaries of generous preferential market access in the United States \u2013 also declined from 2.0 to 1.6 percent in value terms and from 1.6 percent to 1.3 percent in volume terms. The share of the Asian 12 in EU imports is even larger than US imports (Table A-2a). During the period January-September 2004, the share of the Asian 12 in EU imports of T&C products was 45.2 percent in value terms and 48.5 percent in volume terms. For the same period of 2005, the share has increased to 52.0 percent in value terms and 54.1 percent in volume terms. The surge in imports from the Asian 12 is more pronounced in clothing products than in textiles (Tables A-2b and A-2c). While overall EU imports of clothing products increased by 5.4 percent in value terms and 9.4 percent in volume terms in the first three quarters of 2005 as compared to the same period of 2004, the growth rate of EU imports from the Asian 12 exceeded 20 percent in both value and volume terms.

China\u2019s share to total US imports of T&C products, already about 15 percent in 2003, continues to increase. More than a quarter of all US T&C imports in the \ufb01rst three quarters of 2005 came from China. Similarly, EU imports of T&C products from China rose from 21 percent in January-September 2004 to 28-30 percent in 2005. However, moderate increases in China\u2019s share in EU imports of textiles indicate that the growth of China\u2019s exports of clothing products is overwhelming. In the \ufb01rst three quarters of 2005, China\u2019s shares in EU imports of textiles were 18.2 percent in value terms and 14.3 percent in volume terms, whereas China\u2019s share in EU imports of clothing products are 32.9 percent in value terms and 39.8 percent in volume terms. Chinese exports now account for 60 percent of the Asian 12 clothing exports to the EU. Among the Asian 12, Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan also increased their exports to the United States as well as their shares of US imports of T&C products. However, among these countries, only India managed to increase its exports of clothing products to the EU at the same time. EU imports of textiles from India slightly declined.4 Besides China and India, all other Asian 12 countries experienced declines in their exports of clothing products to the EU. Among other top trade partners of the EU, only Turkey succeeded to protect its previous gains so far, thanks to its steady rise in clothing exports to the EU. Turkey, the second- largest T&C trade partner of the EU after China, increased its exports of clothing products to the EU by 4.1 percent in value terms and 3.2 percent in volume terms. Similar to the case of India however, EU imports of textiles from Turkey slightly declined. EU imports of clothing products from other EU trade partners (Romania, Tunisia, Morocco) experienced nearly a 10 percent decline. The fall in EU imports from other Asian countries (Hong Kong SAR, South Korea) are more severe. For example, EU imports of clothing products from South Korea plummeted by more than 50 percent in both value and volume terms. US and EU imports from Lao PDR, Nepal, the Philippines and Viet Nam, as well as these four countries\u2019 share in US and EU imports, declined in both value and volume terms. The declining trend in US imports of T&C products from these countries had started even before the elimination of quotas on 1 January 2005, but this is a matter of serious concern. Reduction rates of Lao PDR and Nepal in the US market and that of the Philippines in the EU market, in percentage terms, are all double-digit - as high as 40 percent in the \ufb01rst nine months of 2005 compared to the same period of 2004. 4 Table A-4d shows that a large decline in the volume of EU imports of textiles from India stems from man made staple \ufb01bres (HS 55). In terms of value, EU imports declined by 15 million Euro in cotton textiles (HS 52) and 30 million Euro in man made staple \ufb01bres. Flying Colours, Broken Threads 11 Products Liberalised in 2005 EU imports of T&C products liberalised in 2005 are summarised in Table A-3, which indicates that the phase-out of the end-loaded quotas has contributed to increased trade, with the increasing share of the EU T&C market being captured by Asian countries. To the extent that quota restrictions had an impact on large potential exporters, an increase in exports was expected after the removal of quotas. However, the only beneficiaries of liberalisation among the Asian 12 are China and India. In the first three quarters of 2005, EU imports of Chinese T&C products liberalised in 2005 increased by 144.7 percent in volume terms compared to the same period of 2004. Despite a 20 percent decline in the average unit prices of Chinese products, the value of EU imports rose by 95.2 percent. In 2004 Turkey was the largest exporter to the EU in the categories of T&C products that were liberalised in 2005. Although EU imports of such products from Turkey also increased in both value and volume terms, China is now the leading exporter of T&C products liberalised in 2005, due to a surge of Chinese imports. India, like the case of Turkey, also increased its share of EU imports of T&C products liberalised in 2005 both in value and volume terms, as well as in average unit prices. The elimination of quotas did not bring increases in the volume of exports to other countries in the EU market.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8b375a7f-f43b-49ae-a29d-b584a32d40e7": {"__data__": {"id_": "8b375a7f-f43b-49ae-a29d-b584a32d40e7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/flying-colours-broken-threads", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Flying Colours, Broken Threads", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/flying-colours-broken-threads", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fcd76ab77b67e66faf1e5f26733cf3ff26593a0efcdf9bc5a60481c6431404fe"}}, "hash": "fcd76ab77b67e66faf1e5f26733cf3ff26593a0efcdf9bc5a60481c6431404fe", "text": "III. Policy Implications In this section, we attempt to discuss policy issues relevant from a human development perspective as far as the T&C sector of the Asian 12 is concerned. While some directly emanate from the analysis of data, others draw on recent developments in the sector as documented in the literature or on the basis of discussions with stakeholders during visits by the authors to four Asian LDCs (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Nepal). Impact on Employment and Poverty \u201c[L]eading factories pay above-average wages on good contracts, achieve high productivity, and so require little or no overtime, but these examples are the exception, not the norm\u201d (Oxfam, 2004: 58). The overall volume as well as value of exports from China and India increased in both the US and EU markets with higher volume of exports expected to lead to employment growth. Increases in volume also could be possible with improved labour productivity and technology upgrading, even if the number of workers remains the same. However, since the figures being compared in this report are between two consecutive years, the developing countries in question are not expected to make a massive leap in productivity within such a short time span. Because data on employment are hard to come by, taking export volume as a proxy for employment we will not be hugely off the mark. Such a clear-cut picture does not emerge in the case of countries like Pakistan and Indonesia, which have seen their exports to the US market increase but suffered setbacks in the EU market. For example, Pakistan\u2019s exports to the United States increased by 10.2 One Year of Evidence from Asia after the Phase-out of Textiles and Clothing Quotas 12 percent in value terms and 13.4 percent in volume, but exports to the EU declined by 12.8 percent and 2.7 percent respectively (Table A-4h). In the case of Indonesia, exports to the United States increased by 16.7 percent in value terms and 13.4 percent in volume terms, while exports to the EU declined \u2013 17.5 percent in value and 11.1 percent in volume (Table A-4e). It is equally difficult to draw any inferences on the employment situation in a country like Bangladesh, which has been able to hold on to its past gain in terms of overall value of exports (Table A-4a), but has seen overall volume decline by 3.4 percent during the first three quarters of 2005 against the same period of 2004. It can, therefore, be suspected that there have been some employment losses in Bangladesh. There is yet another factor that has to be considered because employment intensity of the two sub-sectors, namely knitted and woven garments, differ markedly. The woven garment sector, which falls under the Chapter 62 of the Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System (HS), is labour-intensive and not highly demanding in terms of skills requirements. Accordingly, it employs huge numbers of unskilled labour, most of them women. Therefore, the percentage of women working in the woven sector is much higher than that in the knitted garment sector (HS 61). Bangladeshi employment losses are likely to fall upon women because the overall volume of US and EU woven garment imports declined by about 6 percent in the first nine months of 2005. Two LDCs analysed by this tracking report, Nepal and Lao PDR, saw both value and volume of its exports decline in both important markets. According to a news report quoting the Garment Association of Nepal, Nepalese garment exports to the US market \u2013 where 80 percent of such Nepalese exports are destined \u2013 declined by 42 percent during the 11 months period of 2005, compared to the corresponding period last year.5 As a result, more than 60 percent of garment factories have closed and nearly 50,000 people have lost jobs. A number of meetings held in Nepal with various stakeholders in October 2005, including the government, private sector, trade unions and civil society followed by a factory visit, confirmed this trend in the context of Nepal. Currently, only 15-30 factories are estimated to be operating. Even among those firms, hundreds of workers already have been laid off. As a result, the size of operation is very slim compared to that of 2004. Many garment workers, especially women, are contract workers, and Nepalese garment workers were no exception. In developing countries and LDCs where alternate sources of employment are difficult to find, and where safety nets such as unemployment insurance are non-existent or not implemented in earnest, these contract workers suddenly fall into poverty if they lose their jobs.

Recent studies (e.g., Balakrishnan, 2002) indicate that more female workers have no choice but to accept informal and home-based work, which entails fewer legal rights and benefits than the formal sector. In the case of Lao PDR, there were 57 garment factories and 39 small sub-contract factories (Tan, 2005), where about 27,000 people, mostly young women from rural 5 The report is available from Kantipur Online, http://www.kantipuronline.com/kolnews.php?&nid=59106 Flying Colours, Broken Threads 13 villages, were working and sending remittances to their families. So far, a few factories have shut down. In cities, employment opportunities for women who are ethnic minorities and/or with less education are limited. Low factory wages have contributed to an increase in prostitution: Many female factory workers feel compelled to earn extra money for remittance by moonlighting in restaurants or nightclubs where they may be sexually exploited by customers.6 Women garment workers face the cultural stigma of being considered promiscuous. While the migration to neighbouring countries, especially Thailand is on the rise, growing trade in the region bring foreign truck drivers and traders to Lao PDR. Currently HIV/AIDS prevalence is still low overall (UNAIDS, 2005). However, growing population mobility between this small landlocked country and five much larger neighbours with more serious epidemics implies that this low rate will not continue for long. Even in countries where export growth has been robust, a painful story is that increased exports do not necessarily translate into better wages or working conditions. For example, as documented by Verma (2005) in the case of India, employment increased by 113 percent in the second half of 1990s, while export of textiles increased by 143 percent. Per- capita incomes in this sector, by contrast, increased by a mere 20 percent, due to a huge population of unemployed people \u2013 who were willing to work at any wage level. Employment also has become increasingly casualised over the time. More jobs have been created for women, but conditions of employment have not improved and in some cases, may even have worsened (Jha and Karthikeyan, 2003). Another factor responsible for this trend, which is becoming more visible in the quota-free world, is that increased pressure to reduce production costs so as to remain competitive tends to make entrepreneurs compromise on wage and working conditions. Evidence from Bangladesh, Philippines and India suggest that Governments there have either introduced, or are in the process of, amending legislation to exempt the garment sector from minimum wage requirements or allow women to work in night shifts, under certain conditions (ILO, 2005: 35). In China, where export growth has been impressive, the situation is not very different. Guangdong province of southern coastal China is an industrial hub producing for global consumption of ready made garments (RMGs). Millions in this province are temporary rural migrant workers. According to Chinese labour laws, a five-day work week should not exceed 40 hours, with a limit of overtime work of 36 hours each month. However, these employment contracts have involved hundreds hours of overtime work, with payment of wages in arrears and underpayment for female migrant garment workers from rural villages (Chan 2005a, 2005b). One reason garment workers are forced to work for long hours (90 to 120 hours a week), is to meet \u201cjust-in-time\u201d delivery of products and shorter lead times from buyers (Oxfam, 2004). As a result of long hours of work without a rest day, female workers in garment sectors face poor health conditions. Chan (2005b) discusses that the number of labour disputes, as well as the number of employees involved in labour disputes, has increased over time; by 2002, there were 184,116 arbitrated cases. The more workers learn about labor laws in the process of collective bargaining, the higher wages and better working conditions are demanded. Comments from female garment workers involved in a collective protest to obtain back pay confirms the 6 CEDAW report cited in ADB (2004).

Even so it is argued that the average monthly earnings of Dhaka garment workers were roughly double the monthly per capita \u201cpoverty line\u201d income (725 Takas in urban areas and 635 Takas in rural areas in 2000); however, the same survey shows that 23 percent of Dhaka garment workers have experienced food shortages in the past year. A comparison of hourly wages among EPZ garment workers, Dhaka garment workers, self-employed workers, and other wage workers in domestic service or at construction sites is not possible, since the hours of work are unknown from these survey results. However, effects on health is more frequently cited as the main drawback of employment by Dhaka garment workers (24 percent) than self-employed workers (14 percent) and EPZ garment workers (9 percent). This might imply the long hours of work and/or an unhealthy work environment. Regarding working conditions, only 1 percent of Dhaka garment workers have received contract letters, whereas 64 percent of EPZ garment workers have received it. Female garment workers in Dhaka city factories are extremely vulnerable during the downturn of production and are likely to be the first to be laid off. Turning to Cambodia, that country seems to be doing much better on the employment front compared to Bangladesh, because not only did total exports increase by 8 percent in value terms, but the volume of its exports increased by 30 percent in the first nine months of 2005 (Table A-4b). Cambodia\u2019s strides into the T&C sector, like in the case of most other LDCs, were fuelled by quota restrictions imposed on other Asian countries. This sector was successful in attracting a large amount of foreign direct investment (FDI),8 mainly from East Asian countries, with FDI totaling US$ 27.6 million in 2002. Export volume increased from US$20 million in 1995 to US$1.5 billion in 2004 and employment in the clothing industry amounted to 270,000 workers in 2005 (ILO, 2005a: 21). New data show, as of November 2005, 43 factories had opened this year, 279,000 were employed as agreement workers, and wages had remained constant at about $72 per month (Wasson, 2005). The country is heavily dependent on exports of clothing products, which constitute 80 percent of total merchandise exports. Up to 85-90 percent of these workers are women supporting between 1 million and 1.5 million family members by sending 10 to 40 percent of their income home regularly (ILO, 2005a; Fitzgerald, 2004; Sim, 2004; USAID, 2005b). In a less diversified economy like Cambodia\u2019s, garment workers have few alternative employment opportunities. Any losses in employment could therefore have a chain 7 As per Bangladesh\u2019s macroeconomic assessment of 2004 conducted by ADB, inflation (measured by consumer price index) rate was 5.8 percent for 2004 and is forecast to 7 percent in 2005, 6 percent in 2006 and 5 percent in 2007.

Fortunately, the situation has not deteriorated as per the data available for the first three quarters of 2005. Overall, T&C exports from the Asian 12, led by China, are doing well so far. However, thousands of workers already have lost jobs in Nepal and Lao PDR, where the quota elimination has severely hit. In other countries where jobs are still kept, the growth of production and exports often does not benefit workers in terms of wages and working conditions; rather conditions worsen. Countries where low labour costs represent the prime competitive advantage start getting squeezed out of the game. As in the case of Cambodia (discussed later), improving labour standards can have a positive impact on export growth of T&C products. Empowering female workers in export industries to improve their working conditions helps to promote equity, and equity can in turn engender productivity and sustainability (UNDP RCC, 2005a).

The market power of buyers appears huge; it may have even given them the leverage to extract concessions from suppliers, in the form of reduced prices, and to pocket the difference without passing lower prices on to consumers. As per the data of the EU (see Table A-3), in the first nine months of the quota-free world average prices reduced by 5.1 percent for products liberalised in 2005, yet retail prices for garments have remained stable, with only fractional changes up or down since the beginning of 2005 (European Commission, 2005). It also appears that the quota rent, or Export Tariff Equivalents (ETE), discussed below in the context of price competition, is now transferred to retailers. A further investigation into the existence of abuse of market power, if any, from an industrial organisation perspective will help design a suitable competition-policy response to this problem. Because of this power, it is the buyers\u2019 preference that is going to shape market response in the exporting countries. Although price and quality used to be the only two variables, buyer preferences these days represent an interplay of various factors, of which five remain important.9 Cost factor: The cost of final delivery of goods into the warehouse of the buyer is what primarily interests the majority of buyers. Some countries may have the cost advantage 9 See also Kelegama and Weeraratne (2005): 330. One Year of Evidence from Asia after the Phase-out of Textiles and Clothing Quotas 16 due to cheap labour,10 but may have higher costs of delivery due to bureaucratic red tape, dilapidated infrastructure and/or lack of trade facilitation measures. These countries may not be the first choice of buyers. There are, however, exceptions to this rule: For example, those buyers who are extremely conscious about brand image and cater to the clientele who are not price-sensitive may not worry much about the cost factor. Critical mass: Buyers will be reluctant to place orders with producers with a small share in the world market. According to this view, countries like India and China, with large integrated production capacity and the ability to deliver huge quantity, are likely to be preferred by buyers. In Asia-Pacific a very few countries like China, India and Pakistan will be the prime beneficiaries if this scenario prevails. Supporting this hypothesis, the US Department of Commerce estimates the number of countries from which major items will be sourced will drop by 50 percent in 2005, and to 25 percent of current levels by 2010 (UNDP RCC, 2005b: 23). Risk spreading: A possible scenario opposing the critical mass sentiment is the risk- spreading argument. Buyers, desirous to maintain uninterrupted supply, would like to diversify the sources from which they import T&C products. Since events such as terrorist attacks, spread of contagious diseases like SARS and avian flu, or even reimposition of quota, could significantly disrupt the smooth flow of products, buyers could prefer to source products from several locations. For example, according to the US International Trade Commission: \u201cTo reduce the risk of sourcing from only one country, the US importers also plan to expand trade relationships with other low-cost countries alternative to China\u201d (USITC, 2004). Total solution providers: Buyers\u2019 preferences are likely to be tilted in favour of suppliers that can cover all stages of the value chain in production, ranging from product design to input sourcing, manufacturing, packaging and shipping of the final product. This is because buyers do not want to coordinate several activities and engage their precious human resources in the follow-up of various stages of the process. Though this would mean that countries with the ready availability of domestic inputs and human resources are likely to meet this requirement, countries that can \u201cslice up\u201d the value chain, organising production in various countries depending on the level of specialisation also can be winners in this scenario. Ethical concerns: Though this is an emerging area, pressures from consumer groups in industrialised countries, including boycotting of products manufactured in sweatshops or in environmentally-unfriendly way have brought ethical concerns into the decision- making matrix of the buyers. Most buyers have themselves developed a \u201ccode of conduct\u201d that they want all their suppliers to comply with. This includes issues such as working conditions, workers\u2019 health and safety, minimum wages, maximum working hours and overtime.

Moreover, from the human development perspective, it is neither ethical nor desirable to improve export performance by maintaining low wages (or poverty). Flying Colours, Broken Threads 17 visibly displayed for the sake of transparency. Nonetheless, though national laws and international conventions deal with these issues, most developing countries have not implemented them, either due to the pressure from industry groups or simply lack of resources. However, Cambodia, an LDC, has successfully made improved labour standards as its \u201cunique selling proposition\u201d (USP) in the industrialised-countries market, which will be discussed later. Lao PDR, another LDC, is planning to make environmental standards (such as eco-labels) as its USP for the EU market.11 It should be noted, however, that having a USP does not guarantee that export orders will last forever. For example, the Nepalese RMG factory that authors visited had not received any orders from major US retailers since the first quarter of 2005 although it had been following the \u201ccode of conduct\u201d given by retailers for several years. Often being a sub- contractor or having an international agent receive consolidated orders works as a disadvantage because lack of loyalty puts producers in a weaker position while bargaining with retailers. The sudden withdrawal of retailers from garment production in Nepal is also confirmed at the factories that previously had direct ordering systems with US retailers. Extent of Price Competition When quota restrictions were in place, the export prices of textile and clothing products were higher from countries restrained by quotas. The ETE12 of the quotas on textile and clothing for China and India were as high as 33-34 percent (Nordas, 2004). This provided sufficient cushion to accept orders from the buyers in the post-quota era at prices significantly lower than those prevailing until the end of 2004. Asian countries \u2013 which are the highest performers in the post-quota regime \u2013 were most restricted by quotas, comprising eight out of 10 countries most restricted by textile quotas and all 10 countries most restricted by clothing quotas (ILO, 2005a:4). Due to increased competition in the post-quota regime, prices have fallen sharply in the case of most of these countries. It was predicted that countries with higher ETE would be able to resort to price undercutting13 without their bottom line being affected. Although it is difficult to discern a particular trend, an analysis of EU import data for the period January \u2013 September 2005 suggests that prices have fallen on the whole by 5.1 percent. 11 Based on the discussions of the authors with the officials of International Trade Centre, 23 November 2005. 12 In the literature, the measure that is most widely used to infer about the restrictiveness of an MFA quota is known as the \u201cexport tax equivalent\u201d (ETE). An export quota may be considered as an export tax in its restrictive impact on exports. In order to export, a firm in a quota constrained country has to purchase a quota and the price of a quota per unit of exports is then equivalent in its impact to an export tax of the same magnitude. The more restrictive a quota is, the higher the tax will be. In other words, The ETE represents a rent as a per cent of the price of the export product. See Razzaque (2005): 30. 13 Lower prices in markets without quotas do not imply that total revenues decline. They could even increase with increased output \u2013 and possibly employment.

For example, in the case of Pakistan, average unit prices of T&C exports of major commodity are available (Table A-5). Average unit prices of cotton and cotton yarn exports in September 2005 declined by 3.2 percent and 5.9 percent respectively from a year ago. In a comparison of July-September 2004 with the same period of 2005, a reduction in these products is more severe. Average unit prices of cotton and cotton yarn exports fell by 15.8 percent and 9.5 percent respectively. Average unit price of synthetic textile also declined by more than 9 percent from 2004. Second, the reduction in unit price may not be due solely to increased competition and the existence of quota rent. Prices for certain category of products might have declined due to change in market conditions in the importing country (such as changes in fashion), or simply to changes in designs or patterns of the products in the same category.14 Moreover, the decrease in prices could have resulted from increased efficiency at the firm level (e.g., increased productivity of labour) and/or macro level (increased trade facilitation measures). A look at the US market, at least in two categories of products, offers a similar picture. For example, Viet Nam, Thailand and China were able to significantly lower the prices of polyester filament fabric (light weight). Chinese prices at $0.50 per square meter, were 32.5 percent lower in 2005 than for the same nine months of 2004. Similarly, Indian prices in \u201cother synthetic filament fabrics\u201d were extremely low, at just $0.17 per square metre, falling over 90 percent.15 Due to lack of information on the cost structure of these companies, it is difficult to ascertain whether firms are simply reducing prices within the 14 For example, two shirts belonging to same HS code (even at 12 digit level) can have different costs, depending on the use of materials, design and time spent on stitching them. 15 EmergingTextiles.com (2005a), http://www.emergingtextiles.com/?q=art&s=051121Dmark&r=free, Flying Colours, Broken Threads 19 ETEs of their earlier quotas, or whether price reductions have started eating into profit margins. Other reports point out that heightened competition has resulted in cuts of up to 47 percent in prices, such as in the case of EU import of pullover sweaters (USAID, 2005). When such cut-throat competition becomes the order of the day, countries to be worst hit are those that did not have higher quota rent in the first place. Since the imposition of quotas was directly correlated to the competitiveness of the country, it is the least competitive exporters that will be affected by falling prices. Most LDCs fall into this category. Threats of Trade Remedy Measures Highly competitive suppliers like China, India and Pakistan can be subjected to trade remedy measures such as anti-dumping, countervailing and safeguard measures in order to contain their domination in certain markets. Incorporated into the multilateral trading system to create a level playing field for domestic industries by protecting them against \u201cunfair\u201d foreign competition, these instruments have been captured by the protectionist lobby in the industrialised countries. Developing countries too have now started using these measures for protectionist purposes. Of the three types of trade remedy measures, anti-dumping is the most pernicious because of the ease with which it can be applied. Moreover, anti-dumping measures can be applied to targeted firms in targeted countries, almost with absolute impunity. T&C products have been and will continue to be the major target of anti-dumping investigations. Bed linen has been one of the most targeted products by the EU, with exports from India, Pakistan, Turkey and Thailand already facing the brunt. One reasons for the decline in Pakistan\u2019s export under HS 63 to the EU market has been the continued imposition anti-dumping duty on the bed linen.16 The volume of EU imports of bed linen (HS 630210-630239) from Pakistan in the first nine months of 2005 against the same period of 2004 declined by 2.2 percent.17 Realising the potential threat of China as a major exporter of T&C in the post-quota era, WTO member countries got three unconventional provisions ingeniously incorporated in the latter\u2019s Protocol of Accession to the WTO.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "85e70b8b-e566-42c9-bc43-28dde4f00ce2": {"__data__": {"id_": "85e70b8b-e566-42c9-bc43-28dde4f00ce2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/flying-colours-broken-threads", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Flying Colours, Broken Threads", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/flying-colours-broken-threads", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ee5ec58b0802ffefeed2fca0b3428664516f74737901a609e3af8a3b7a1563b3"}, "2": {"node_id": "05679634-5a2e-4cf6-8bc3-ef93778c79e8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/flying-colours-broken-threads", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "315563606c8a884a1863a50b1a272352a9481e56d3ed2ba664db9ee9230b8101"}}, "hash": "0a802d9c8d565cc4be3e8ab1cd199fb3d9fb03ba824c7e4da14da943cb584347", "text": "As per the first provision, WTO members can restrict the import of China\u2019s T&C products, should its imports cause serious market disruption.

While the United States has re-imposed quota on seven items in May 2005 itself, EU also initiated action, which almost resulted in a major trade war. However, a last minute deal was struck with China on 10 June 2005 to limit 10 categories of Chinese T&C exports to the EU to between 8 and 12.5 percent growth above a specified base period until 2008. The EU eventually dropped its intention to impose import restrictions against Chinese textiles (Shrestha, 2005). To avoid frequent resort to safeguards measures, which had infused elements of uncertainty for US buyers as well as Chinese exporters, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) and Chinese Trade Minister reached a broad agreement on textile trade on 8 November 2005. The Agreement lasts through the life of the China WTO Textile Safeguard, i.e., 31 December 2008, covers 34 products and contains quotas that begin at low levels (USTR, 2005a; USTR 2005b). The Agreement, which went into effect on 1 January 2006, imposes tighter quota restriction on \u201ccore\u201d apparel products.19 Over the life of the Agreement, China can export 3.2 percent more of the covered products to the United States than if safeguards were invoked on all covered products for all three years.

The Agreement also proposes smooth transition.20 This Agreement may have a destabilising effect for the Chinese T&C sector. However, marginal gains are likely to accrue to the preference-receiving countries of Africa and Central America and the Caribbean, as well as to India, the distant second in the T&C race and a potential target for other trade remedial actions. Those preference-receiving developing countries and LDCs, that are jubilant over the re-imposition of quota on Chinese products, should understand that such measures are likely to provide only temporary relief to them and that they themselves could face such measures, once they attain a critical mass. While countries like Argentina and Turkey also have imposed such measures against Chinese imports, Brazil has introduced a procedure for safeguard petitions aimed at \u201cstemming runaway growth of Chinese apparel and textile imports into the country.\u201d21 Criticising the reimposition of quota on Chinese garments because of its long-term implications, Ahmad (2005a) argues that this could set an extremely bad precedent: \u201cHistory tells us that quotas on one successful country today can mean quotas on the other next year, and on still others in the years hence.\u201d The tendency toward the use of trade remedy measures for protectionist purposes, if unchecked through clearly defined rules, can be expected to accelerate with serious implications, among others, for the trade in T&C products. The mandated review of anti- value of exports was only was 3.2 percent, whereas following non-market economies principle as the basis for arriving at estimated normal value of exports resulted in dumping margin of 40 percent on an average. 19 Seven \u201ccore\u201d apparel products are cotton knitted shirts, man-made fiber knitted shirts, woven shirts, cotton trousers, man-made fiber trousers, brassieres, and underwear. 20 For further details see USTR (2005b).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c0e0ede8-d4ca-4f1c-8eef-9e2583314172": {"__data__": {"id_": "c0e0ede8-d4ca-4f1c-8eef-9e2583314172", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/flying-colours-broken-threads", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Flying Colours, Broken Threads", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/flying-colours-broken-threads", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "83079baf43a5bc34e129db414af094551eac66f3c4b622566f3df8eb3c4ef55a"}, "2": {"node_id": "fe9bf9cf-4248-4768-ba9c-5fdfbe55b585", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/flying-colours-broken-threads", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e81260c1bdfcebd992afd8ad29e321ce863266f9d8734503afa47fe7ae4569af"}}, "hash": "215ba67eaf4c5b69c90180bccd5aa94a080fdd2aa370f301da122952e4d21ec3", "text": "20 For further details see USTR (2005b). 21 EmergingTextiles.com (2005b), http://www.emergingtextiles.com/?q=art&s=051124Atrad&r=free Flying Colours, Broken Threads 21 dumping and subsidies rules as a part of the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) have not produced any result so far.

Vertical Integration and Linkages Vertical integration signifies the existence of an integrated supply chain from the stage of cotton production, to yarn production, to fabric production, to the clothing industry, to transportation and other trade support facilities. In the context of T&C, existence of vertical integration tends to confer an advantage to the exporting firms. However, it also is necessary to understand that not all countries have the capacity and resources to integrate their supply chain vertically. For example, most West African countries, which grow cotton in abundance, do not have a strong textile industry. Countries like China, India, Thailand, Indonesia and Viet Nam have an integrated supply chain of textiles as well as clothing and are able to source a significant portion of raw materials from within the country. This helps them not only lower the costs of production due to reduced transportation costs of raw materials but also reduce the lead time. Reduction in lead time provides the twin advantages of being able to meet the delivery order, thereby enhancing credibility as a reliable source, and reducing the working capital requirement, which also means reduced bank interest for some. However, the existence of huge textile manufacturing capacity does not necessarily mean that the country also is competitive on exports of clothing products. For example, Pakistan\u2019s export profile suggests that 47.7 percent of its exports are textiles and made-up textile articles such as bed linens, while exports of clothing products are only 26.3 22 WTO (2005b), Paragraph 10 and 11 of Annex D. One Year of Evidence from Asia after the Phase-out of Textiles and Clothing Quotas 22 percent. In the case of China, textile exports constitute 6.3 percent of total exports, whereas clothing accounts for much more, i.e., 11.9 percent (ILO, 2005a: 5). As the example of developing countries such as Hong Kong SAR, South Korea or Taiwan shows, the lack of domestic inputs does not necessarily translate into competitive disadvantages. In the early stage of the sector\u2019s development, these countries relied heavily on imports of raw materials and textiles (WTO, 2005a). IMF (2004) stresses that lack of domestic inputs in a sector like T&C need not always disadvantage the apparel trade, so long as inputs can be accessed at world prices with short lead times. In a market- dynamic sector such as T&C, a lesson from Pakistan and China is that states should allow garment exporters an undistorted choice between using local and imported fabrics. China, which produces both cotton and textiles, uses only 45 percent of domestic fabric for clothing exports (UNDP RCC, 2005b). As per recent figures, while the total exports of T&C products of China were US$61.12 billion in 2004, its import of fabrics and other raw materials was close to $20 billion (ILO, 2005a). Proximity Factor With the trend toward \u201clean retailing,\u201d producers that can provide quick turnaround time enjoy an important competitive advantage. Most studies argue that proximity to large markets [e.g., Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean countries to the US and Turkey, and Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEC) to the EU] is a key factor to ensure quick turnaround (WTO, 2005a: 5). Emphasizing the promptness in delivery as a key factor to remain afloat in the post-quota era, Abernathy and Weil (2004) argue that the proximity advantage will grow even greater as retailers raise the bar higher on the responsiveness and flexibility required of their suppliers. However, it is necessary to see whether if this is so even at a disaggregated level.

On the other hand, for replenishment products such as men\u2019s jeans, it would seem that producers closely located to the world\u2019s major markets are on solid footing (Abernathy, Volpe and Weil, 2004). There is no evidence to prove that proximity alone helps. For example, Mexico and Caribbean countries have been losing market share in the United States recently. Between 2001 and 2004, Mexico\u2019s apparel imports to the United States declined from 14.2 percent to 8.9 percent. This trend is continuing, with Mexico\u2019s exports of apparel to the United States declining by 5.9 percent in value terms and 8.7 percent in volume terms.23 Moreover, several East European countries in close proximity to European markets have been losing market share there. Comparing the T&C exports of five selected East European countries, it can be observed Romania\u2019s exports declined by 8.6 percent, Bulgaria\u2019s by 0.6 percent, Belarus\u2019 by 6.5 percent and Ukraine by 7.3 percent, while the 23 Authors\u2019 calculation based on data from USITC Interactive Tariff and Trade DataWeb. Flying Colours, Broken Threads 23 decline in Croatia exports were to the tune of 12.3 percent. The figure for Serbia and Montenegro is even more appalling at 46.3 percent.24 Turkey, another country relatively close to the European market, managed to increase its exports of clothing product to the EU in first nine months of the post-quota era by 4.1 percent in value terms and 3.2 percent in volume terms (Table A-4c). However, this performance also can be ascribed in part to the preferential market access in the EU market as well as to the enhanced competitiveness of the Turkish T&C sector. The above analysis points toward a rather limited role of proximity in shaping and influencing buyers\u2019 decision. It might continue to be important in a limited range of products, but overall significance is gradually reducing due to decreasing communications costs, shipping transit time, and improved efficiency of trade-related services, which tend to erode possible advantages. This is shown by the illustrious performance by the majority of the Asian countries in the post-quota era. Trade Agreements and Preferences Free trade agreements (FTAs), incorporated in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) as a means to facilitate trade between geographically contiguous countries, now represent a complex maze of cross-continental agreements, often designed to suit the interests of sectoral lobbies, including T&C. FTAs are more liberal than the multilateral trading system espoused by the WTO. They involve deeper tariff cuts \u2013 sometimes reaching even close to zero. Since T&C products are one of the most heavily protected sectors in industrialised countries, with the average tariff as high as 32 percent on clothing, an FTA with a country like the United States make sense for developing countries eying America\u2019s ever-growing T&C market. Because benefits accorded to the FTA partner need not be accorded to any other WTO members,25 the incentive for developing countries to capture markets by excluding others from such benefits tends to be high. For example, most developing countries having FTAs with the United States increased the volume of their trade in T&C manifold in the past. For example, Mexico\u2019s T&C exports to the United States increased by more than 12-fold between 1990 and 2002. The example of Jordan is even more compelling: After signing an FTA with the United States in 2001, its exports rose to US$669 million in three years, an increase of 1,477 percent. Most Central American countries that signed the new United States-Dominican Republic Central American Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) in May 2004, are excited about the prospects of being able to gain preferential market access to the United States.

The most prominent are: a) duty- free and quota-free market access provided by the EU to all LDCs under \u201cEverything but Arms\u201d (EBA) initiative; b) preferential market access provided by the EU to African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries under Cotonou Agreement; c) preference provided to the African countries by the United States under AGOA; and d) preferential access provided by the United States, Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Agreement (CBPTA) to Caribbean countries; and e) Canadian GSP. Out of these preferential arrangements, only two \u2013 EU\u2019s EBA initiative and Canada\u2019s preferential trading arrangements - are generalised in the sense that they confer advantages to all LDCs.26 Although the United States also provides GSP for LDCs, the same does not include T&C products. For all practical purpose, therefore, T&C products originating from Asian LDCs do not enjoy any preferential access to the US market. While the examples of Jordan and Mexico and several African countries and Caribbean countries are worth highlighting, it is necessary to understand that they benefited in part because of the quota restriction imposed on highly competitive Asian countries. With the end of quotas, Mexico is now exposed to direct competition with China and continues to lose market share in the US market. The share of Mexico and CBI and that of AGOA countries in the US T&C imports declined as discussed earlier (Table A-1a). Some AGOA-eligible countries developed garment export industries that did not exist before AGOA\u2019s enactment in 2000. Asian companies opened up textile and clothing factories in sub-Saharan Africa by aiming at expansion of exports to the US market under AGOA. However, many investors, including Asian, fled Sub-Saharan Africa countries with the end of MFA. For example, six of Lesotho\u2019s 50 clothes factories shut down in Lesotho in December 2004, leaving 6,650 workers jobless overnight, without being informed or paid. Owners of those factories were from Taiwan, China, Malaysia and Mauritius.27 In Namibia, the Malaysian-owned garment factory shut down in April 2005 (Rolfe and Woodward, 2005). In Swaziland, nearly 75 percent of textile factories say they have no firm orders since March 2005 (Wines, 2005). One disadvantage that these countries face is their pegged currency exchange rate to South Africa\u2019s rand. Since 2002, the rand has appreciated against the US dollar, driven by a boom in commodities like gold; this makes countries\u2019 exports more expensive. However, other obstacles for exports that AGOA member nations face are concentration on low 26 Canadian GSP for the LDCs does not accord duty-free treatment to Myanmar. 27 BBC News Online, 12 January 2005. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4169587.stm Flying Colours, Broken Threads 25 value-added production, lack of local supply linkages, high transport costs, erratic and expensive electricity, poor infrastructure and relatively low worker productivity (Rolfe and Woodward, 2005). These are common issues among Asian countries as well. Since the United States re-imposed quotas on Chinese T&C imports, exports from AGOA countries, as well as other countries having preferential access to the US market, may revive. AGOA countries need to build stronger local supply linkages because garment makers must make or buy their fabrics in sub-Saharan African countries, if not purchasing them from the United States, to continue enjoying duty-free access to the United States after September 2007. Other examples of countries with preferential access that are not doing well can be found in Asia itself. Four Asian LDCs, namely, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Lao PDR and Nepal, are losing their market share in the EU despite EBA. For example, EU imports of T&C products from Bangladesh declined by 8.5 in value terms and 13.8 percent in volume this year (Table A-4a). Similarly, Cambodia\u2019s exports to the EU market declined by 13.5 percent in value and 8.2 percent in volume terms (Table A-4b). The figures for Lao PDR were also similar, with 7.2 percent decline in value terms and 7.1 percent decline in volume terms (Table A-4f).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "60f5b6d1-0c5e-4188-9a60-4d20f40e0ec0": {"__data__": {"id_": "60f5b6d1-0c5e-4188-9a60-4d20f40e0ec0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/flying-colours-broken-threads", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Flying Colours, Broken Threads", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/flying-colours-broken-threads", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4d5a43b0de8efb51c184fbdd151b6e85d4f6faafc05792584f80db8f6ac9b223"}, "2": {"node_id": "d928c6cc-1187-438b-80ad-5355713e024c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/flying-colours-broken-threads", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "72fe65afbbadf5d5e82421470afacb53265b5a2dc09d32937d5fa78615fbf35d"}}, "hash": "66526a2c0c8f47a56b9b21d15ff14eaa5373265dff438164c4b75b6202cf6fd3", "text": "Nepal\u2019s performance has been even more depressing, as the decline in T&C exports to the EU market were 9.8 percent in value and 14.2 percent in volume (Table A-4g).

One Year of Evidence from Asia after the Phase-out of Textiles and Clothing Quotas 26 Box 1: Enduring Enigma of Rules of Origin Started with the objective of preventing trade deflection and promoting the creation of a vertically integrated sector in beneficiary countries, Rules of Origin (ROO) has become a protectionist tool in the hands of the donor countries to prevent imports. Developed countries provide preferential access with one hand, but at the same time they impose rigid ROO requirements and take away the benefits. ROO may distort the choices of producers from beneficiary countries, leading them to use inputs of less efficient producers or constraining their methods of production through technical requirements, or both. Beyond administrative costs, producers who wish to satisfy ROO thus may incur the cost of using a sub-optimal mix of inputs. Further, there is no evidence to suggest to that ROO has helped beneficiary countries in creating vertical integration (WTO, 2005a: 55). The major fallout of ROO is that this requirement is very cumbersome, inefficient and resource- demanding. It is costly and complex to administer. For example, the administrative costs of certifying origin in European Free Trade Area (EFTA) range from 3 percent to 5 percent value of export transactions.28 Similarly, the administrative costs of providing the documentary evidence to support the certificate of origin under the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA) are in the region of 1.8 percent of the value of exports. The distorted impact of the rules, resulting from the need to use local and higher-cost inputs to qualify, may be equivalent to an average duty of around 4.3 percent (World Bank, 2004). The world is not without options, provided there is a willingness on the part of the GSP donor countries to modify their ROO requirements. Some useful initiatives are already in place. Two examples of flexible ROO are: a) a lower-value-added requirement, say 25 percent; and b) allowing for single-stage transformation. Another way to maintain the rigid ROO, but allow for cumulation, i.e., treating inputs derived from a very large number of countries as originating in the exporting country. Canada has taken the lead on this matter. For example, in the case of T&C, the Canadian scheme allows cumulation amongst all developing countries, including most efficient producers like China and India, with a 25 percent value-added requirement (Adhikari, 2005). Increase in exports of LDCs in the aftermath of the reform is a testament to the fact that ROO reform could be a powerful instrument to enhance exports from LDCs.29 The ROO under the EBA is probably the most onerous, which requires that at least two finishing operations - a double transformation - occur in the exporting country to qualify for duty free-access. Since LDCs do not have an industrial base to produce textiles and have to rely on imported raw materials, they are not likely to qualify. This, in part, explains the reason why the preference utilisation rate for EBA (as measured against simple average tariff lines) was merely 37.8 percent in 2003, and the country-specific clothing preferences of the Asian LDCs in 2004 were: 33.8 percent for Bangladesh; 30.9 percent for Cambodia; and 65.8 percent for Nepal (WTO, 2005a: 51, 53). One way to ease the burden on LDC exporters is a process called \u201cregional cumulation,\u201d i.e., allowing countries within a regional trading arrangement to use raw materials from 28 Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) report cited in Adhikari (2005). 29 For example, Bangladesh\u2019s exports to Canada surged by 3.3 time and those of Cambodia increased by 7.1 times. Export value index for Bangladesh showed a jump from 112.5 in 2002 to 370.8 in two-year period ending 2004. Figures for Cambodia are even more impressive \u2013 it went up from 348.7 in 2002 to 2,469.7 in 2004. See WTO (2005a): 69. Flying Colours, Broken Threads 27 other countries within the arrangement.

There are two plausible explanations: First, it could be that the costs of compliance, even with relaxed rules, are prohibitive. Second, there is a possibility of buyers dictating the terms of sourcing the inputs, providing little room of maneuverability for the producers. Therefore, exporters continue to pay the prevailing (MFN) tariffs. It is not surprising to note that at least a third of all LDC exports pay MFN tariffs due to restrictive ROO (Inama, 2001). Although SAARC countries have requested the European Union to extend SAARC cumulation to \u201cSAARC-plus-ASEAN-super- cumulation\u201d this request is still under discussion. Therefore, it is premature to make any informed analysis on the basis of a possible breakthrough on this issue Duty-free, Quota-free Market Access While discussing duty-free, quota-free market access for LDCs, it is necessary to look at two distinct but interrelated issues. First is the issue of predictability of market access. Numerous conditions attached to preferential market access provided to LDCs \u2013 graduation clauses such as ceiling and caps, finite duration, and other conditions, sometimes going beyond trade-related issues \u2013 results in uncertainty of access. Since most schemes are unilateral and voluntary, they can be withdrawn by donor countries at will. Uncertainty regarding the conditions of access to major markets could represent a serious obstacle to potential investors in T&C sectors in the LDCs (WTO, 2005a: 69). The second issue relates to the discriminatory treatment provided by the two major economies to two groups of LDCs as mentioned above. Asian LDCs do not enjoy preferential access in the US market at all, while access to the EU market is subject to stringent ROO requirements. Asian LDCs, therefore, face double jeopardy \u2013 of not being able to compete with giant neighbours like China, India, Indonesia and Pakistan on equal terms (i.e., by paying MFN tariffs), as well as not being able to compete with other LDCs, which receive preferences from both the United States and EU under extremely favourable terms. Consequently, exports of Asian LDCs continue to face high tariffs in the US market. Cambodia paid US$152 million in import duties to the United States in 2002, compared the duties paid by Norway of US$24 million for exports five times higher (UNDP RCC, 30 For certain textile and clothing products, but subject to quantitative limits, Cambodia, Laos and Nepal have requested and been granted a derogation from the rules for certain textiles and clothing products such that originating inputs from any countries belonging to the SAARC, ASEAN or the ACP can count as originating materials. See Brenton (2003). One Year of Evidence from Asia after the Phase-out of Textiles and Clothing Quotas 28 2005b). In recent years, Bangladesh has paid over more than US$300 million in US duties, compared to duties paid by France of US$330 million for exports 13 times higher (Rahman, 2005). These are highly regressive transfers that outstrip the bilateral foreign aid these poor countries receive (UNDP RCC, 2005b). The situation on the ground is desperate, calling for desperate measures. RMG entrepreneurs in Nepal, interviewed by the authors during a field visit in October 2005, informed that those who have not closed their factories were hopeful about survival if they are provided duty-free access to the US market, and they were waiting for the same. If such facilities are not granted, they will close their factories because they cannot afford to hold on to their premises by continuing to incur the minimum fixed overheads. During a field visit to Lao PDR conducted by the authors in November 2005, most stakeholders demanded duty-free and quota-free market access from the industrialised countries so as to enable their garment industry to survive in the face of increased competition. Stakeholders contacted in Bangladesh and Cambodia during the field visits were equally vocal about the need to provide fair and equitable treatment to Asian LDCs. The only way to solve the problems mentioned above is not only to provide duty-free, quota- free market access to all LDCs, covering all their products, but also to make it binding them at the WTO to reduce uncertainty and ensure predictability of market access. However, this has indeed been a long-drawn-out, often highly frustrating, battle that LDCs have been fighting since 1992 without much success (See Box 2).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5de5288d-f35b-4495-814c-a71e38fbb799": {"__data__": {"id_": "5de5288d-f35b-4495-814c-a71e38fbb799", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/flying-colours-broken-threads", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Flying Colours, Broken Threads", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/flying-colours-broken-threads", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "79d390ee9a8e8227411c923c877540bcb5c0046fc539c8294fadb638dd732331"}, "2": {"node_id": "74018cbd-e5b0-48d5-8dd5-d09aa6d3a1da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/flying-colours-broken-threads", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "efeb067ca9d42258055bce995ea7ff38daa5d4646245c7b6d17ddd5702931af4"}}, "hash": "87820320b71bdb06b984fde158153def7fdd38eb98985884327126bdfee4744c", "text": "Flying Colours, Broken Threads 29 Box 2: LDCs\u2019 Battle for Duty-free and Quota-free Market Access In 1992, at UNCTAD VIII, the Cartagena Commitment urged that exports from LDCs be guaranteed duty-free access to major markets, but the idea was stillborn", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fbcd1949-76fd-4566-9239-805877e374c5": {"__data__": {"id_": "fbcd1949-76fd-4566-9239-805877e374c5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/flying-colours-broken-threads", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Flying Colours, Broken Threads", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/flying-colours-broken-threads", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "720f783b7c58eba254307110e7d119fc39af174c6043a6b1a88520cbb2eea5a1"}, "3": {"node_id": "264f1b4b-1c90-40ce-b0c5-6ed9e8e8f6a2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/flying-colours-broken-threads", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d78da3ee893caf540ab8069c94e2450bf117d286a17ce43c64227ab6e30c29f5"}}, "hash": "e4055161498f081c24fb392a02fda09fba13a6bd5b7cffdf48f136feb6c7eb7d", "text": "(Ricupero, 1999). The idea was reintroduced in the Singapore Ministerial Meeting of the WTO in December 1996, when the then-Director-General of WTO made a plea to the members to consider the proposal seriously; nonetheless, there was lukewarm response to his proposal. Finally, a Ministerial Declaration came out with a non-committal language. During preparation for the Third WTO Ministerial Conference in Seattle held in November- December 1999, the EU formally launched a proposal directed at \u201centering into a commitment to ensure duty-free market access not later than at the end of the new round of negotiations for essentially all products exported by the LDCs.\u201d Following the failure of the Seattle Ministerial Conference, the proposal for granting duty-free and/or quota-free access for \u201cessentially all\u201d products was discussed in the context of various international fora and included in the UNCTAD X Bangkok Plan of Action (Inama, 2002: 85). This issue received further impetus during the Millennium Summit held in September 2000, which adopted the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Goal 8 of the MDGs makes \u201caddressing the special needs of the LDCs, includes tariff- and quota-free access for LDC exports,\u201d as one of the targets to be achieved by 2015. Two months before the Third UN Conference of Least Developed Countries (UNLDC-III) Conference, the EU launched its \u201cEverything But Arms\u201d (EBA) initiative. Following this, the need to provide duty- free, quota-free market access to LDCs was clearly highlighted in the Brussels Plan of Action, adopted by UNDLC\u2013III in May 2001. When the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) was adopted in November 2001 by the Fourth WTO Ministerial Conference, Ministers committed themselves to the objective of duty-free, quota-free market access for products originating from LDCs (Paragraph 42 of DDA). Even after several years of negotiations, the issue has not resolved in a way that is going to be beneficial to the LDCs. Due to much-touted promises for \u201cearly harvest\u201d on DDA for the LDCs, a major breakthrough during the Sixth WTO Ministerial Conference of the WTO in Hong Kong in December 2005 was anticipated. However, diluting the spirit of earlier discussions, including the one undertaken at the Special Session of Committee on Trade and Development, the Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration allows developed countries to permit duty free quota free access for LDC products to only 97 percent of their tariff lines.31 This is a major setback to the T&C sector of Asian LDCs because the major items that would fall outside the \u201ccovered list\u201d will be precisely these items. According to Ahmad (2005b), an ardent critique of EU/US trade policy on T&C, these countries keep tariff on T&C products high, provide preferential market access to select countries, require preference-receiving countries to purchase inputs from their countries in order to qualify for the rules of origin requirements, thereby creating a captive market 31 Although the declaration starts on a positive note stating that developed countries shall and developing countries should \u201cProvide duty-free and quota-free market access on a lasting basis, for all products originating from all LDCs by 2008 or no later than the start of the implementation period in a manner that ensures stability, security and predictability\u201d [Paragraph 36 (a) i ]. However, as per the next Paragraph \u201cMembers facing difficulties at this time to provide market access as set out above shall provide duty-free and quota-free market access for at least 97 per cent of products originating from LDCs \u2026\u201d [Paragraph 36 (a) ii]. See WTO (2005b), Annex F. One Year of Evidence from Asia after the Phase-out of Textiles and Clothing Quotas 30 for their upstream industries (yarn, fabrics and accessories).32 All this is done at the insistence of their respective T&C lobbies, which are very powerful. For example, the US T&C lobby led by National Council of Textiles Associations (NCTO) was actively engaged in thwarting the LDC proposal. Its major fear has been that countries like Bangladesh and Cambodia, which are competitive in T&C products could flood the US market with their products if zero tariff access is provided to them. The NCTO immediately opposed the idea of extending duty free treatment to Asian LDCs, particularly because the latter can use the raw materials from the most competitive sources like China.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "264f1b4b-1c90-40ce-b0c5-6ed9e8e8f6a2": {"__data__": {"id_": "264f1b4b-1c90-40ce-b0c5-6ed9e8e8f6a2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/flying-colours-broken-threads", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Flying Colours, Broken Threads", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/flying-colours-broken-threads", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "720f783b7c58eba254307110e7d119fc39af174c6043a6b1a88520cbb2eea5a1"}, "2": {"node_id": "fbcd1949-76fd-4566-9239-805877e374c5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/flying-colours-broken-threads", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e4055161498f081c24fb392a02fda09fba13a6bd5b7cffdf48f136feb6c7eb7d"}}, "hash": "d78da3ee893caf540ab8069c94e2450bf117d286a17ce43c64227ab6e30c29f5", "text": "This is where a second line of reasoning appears, which is if these facilities are provided within the WTO framework, it would not be possible for the United States to dictate the rules of origin and compel them to use US fabrics.

Though the July Package agreed by the General Council of the WTO on 1 August 2004 lays down a broad framework for negotiations on industrial tariffs under non- agricultural market access (NAMA), talks on establishing modalities for negotiations are not progressing because of disagreement over which formula for the reduction of tariffs should be used.

While sectoral liberalisation is not likely to occur before the core modalities are finalised, developing countries are not likely to agree to the idea of initiating tariffs negotiations under this mode. This is because of the fear that their T&C industry, which too is highly protected, also could be threatened by cheap imports from more competitive countries like China. Bound tariffs on T&C products are very high in emerging economies like India, Malaysia and Pakistan, and most of them have bound their tariffs sparingly. For example, as per the Schedules of Concessions submitted to the WTO,37 India has bound tariffs on only 216 items under the list covered by the Agreement on Textile and Clothing (ATC); the simple average of these tariffs is 38.6 percent. Malaysia\u2019s schedule of concession does not reflect any binding on T&C tariff lines, which means that it can raise the tariff to even astronomical levels if circumstances so dictate. Similarly, Pakistan\u2019s schedule of commitment shows that simple average bound rates on T&C tariff lines is 43.8 percent. In parallel, however, textile lobbies are calling for separate talks, referred to as the \u201cSpecial Textile Sectoral,\u201d which is different than the normal sectoral mentioned above. Separate talks are believed to be the best way forward to discussing textile tariffs, by coalitions such as Euratex and Global Alliance for Fair Textile Trade, a worldwide coalition of more than 90 exporting textile and apparel companies. They propose that all countries reduce, harmonise and bind their customs duties on textile and apparel at a maximum of 15 percent for finished products.38 Two schools of thoughts are emerging on the issue of preference erosion. The preference- receiving countries, particularly LDCs, feel that they will be put under tremendous competitive pressure if steep cuts are made on T&C MFN tariffs. As noted above when the preference margin is reduced or eliminated, they will not be able to hold on with more competitive countries like China and India.

However, the report also points out clearly that textile and clothing are the two major sectors in which preference erosions are likely to be more severe. IV. Case Studies In the long run, competitiveness is the most critical factor that will determine the success of any country. This is because buyers constantly look to find the cheapest source of supply - and with competitive pressure intensifying, it is only fair to expect them to behave the way they do. This also explains, in part, the reason why there are waves of adjustment taking place even in highly competitive countries. For example, Pakistan invested heavily on the modernisation of its textile mills in order to enhance its competitiveness in textile production. The import of capital equipment (textile machinery) during the past four years is testimony to its attempt toward the modernising the industry (see Table 2). Table 2: Import of Textile Machinery in Pakistan Year Million US$ Percentage change 1999-2000 210.9 28.6 2000-01 370.2 75.5 2001-02 406.9 9.9 2002-03 531.9 30.7 2003-04 (July-April) 455.0 - Source: Government of Pakistan, cited in Din (2005):77 Pakistan also has formulated a long-term development strategy to \u201cfacilitate the transformation of the textile sector into a strong, dynamic and internationally competitive industry led by the private sector (Din, 2005).\u201d Similarly, Governments of Bangladesh, Philippines and India have relaxed or are in the process of relaxing their labour laws to face competitive challenges. Other countries are planning to develop EPZs and make changes in the regulatory environment in order to facilitate exports. Others have planned ahead, anticipating the challenges, to diversify their markets, invested on image building or started focusing on niche products and achieved success. Of the various strategies adopted so far, three such strategies, which have become successful in countries where they have been applied, are presented below in the form of case studies. Improved Labour Standard \u2013 A Case of Cambodia Cambodia\u2019s access to the US market from 1999 to 2004 was contingent on its record of compliance with labour standards, with the quota rates increased every year based on successful compliance. In order to satisfy this requirement, Cambodia adopted a corporate social responsibility programme in collaboration with the International Labour Organisation (ILO), known as Better Factories Cambodia (formerly known as the ILO Garment Sector Project). Begun in 2001 to help Cambodia\u2019s garment sector achieve and maintain improvements in working conditions, the project monitors and reports on working conditions in Cambodian garment factories according to national and Flying Colours, Broken Threads 33 international standards, helps factories to improve their productivity, and works with the Government and international buyers to ensure a rigorous and transparent cycle of improvement. The main objective of the programme is to help Cambodian garment factories constantly improve the conditions of labour by strictly adhering to national labour legislation as well as international conventions Cambodia has signed as a member of the ILO. The project follows a targeted programme of setting minimum standards as agreed by the decision of a tripartite (Government, private sector and trade union), monitoring compliance and providing advisory support and capacity building training to stakeholders to help compliance (ILO 2005a, ILO 2005b). Box 3: Better Factories Cambodia and the Other Side of the Coin The latest report of Better Factories Cambodia, covering 34 garment factories, has noted significant improvement in labour conditions in the garment factories. The report found no evidence of forced or child labour \u2013 based on age-verifying documents.

While the 1997 Cambodian Labour Code stipulates that all garment factories are required to have health care facilities on the premises or access to primary health care for their workers, most often it is workers\u2019 responsibility. Workers must pay for treatment out of their wages; therefore most prefer to avoid formal health care. About 40 percent of workers surveyed said that their health expenses are as expensive as housing costs (Sim, 2004: 43-46). Because the information under this project is made public on the ILO website, with the consent of the factories monitored, it provides an independent source of information for retailers. Buyers seem to have made use of such information while making sourcing decisions. As per a buyers\u2019 survey conducted by the Foreign Investment Advisory Services (2004) of the World Bank Group, more than 60 per cent of buyers interviewed said compliance with labour standards was of equal or more importance compared to considerations of price, quality and lead times. The survey also found that Cambodia\u2019s labour standards were seen as higher than other Asian countries (Bangladesh, China, Thailand and Viet Nam). It also was revealed that 60 percent of the buyers planned to increase their garment purchases from Cambodia, while none said they would cut back. As per the information provided by the ILO, during the first quarter of 2005 Cambodia was not only able to increase the share of its exports to the US market in seasonally adjusted terms, but also was able to maintain levels of employment in the sector while factories consolidated. For example, the percentage of factories with more than 5,000 workers has increased from 3 percent in 2004 to 7.3 percent in 2005 (ILO, 2005a: 36, 39). The US import figures for the first nine months of 2005 confirm that Cambodia\u2019s exports to the United States have increased by 17.4 percent in value terms and 17.1 percent in One Year of Evidence from Asia after the Phase-out of Textiles and Clothing Quotas 34 volume terms (Table A-4b). The strategy that worked in the US market does not seem to have worked in the EU however; such a trend is not visible in the EU market. Since Cambodia\u2019s export to the US market is 3.2 times higher than its exports to the EU, increased US exports should be seen as an indicator of the buyers\u2019 appreciation of efforts to improve labour standards. This is a model worth replicating in other countries, particularly the LDCs, which face severe competitive disadvantages due to their inherent weaknesses on several fronts. However, it is necessary to take the private sector \u2013 garment manufacturers and/or exporters \u2013 into confidence before initiating such a programme, because it is likely to view any programme that could affect the bottom line with suspicion. It may be easier to convince the private sector by arguing that almost all EU and US buyers want to ensure that their suppliers strictly adhere to core labour standards. Despite all this, Governments and international community including ILO and civil society have not been able to replicate Cambodian models in other developing countries and LDCs so far. One argument that is often advanced by the skeptics concerns the futility of replicating the model in other LDCs, because, as the argument goes, if all the LDCs have similar labour standards, the same may not remain an important factor influencing buyers\u2019 decision. However, from a human development perspective, this should be considered a welcome development. While a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d operationalises the fallacy of composition, a \u201crace to the top\u201d among poor countries to improve their labour standards concomitantly has the potential to overcome this fallacy, because it enlarges their own markets. The experience of Sri Lanka, which is not an LDC, has not been very encouraging, though. Based on considerable improvement in labour standards and its record of compliance with eight Core Labour Conventions of the ILO, Sri Lanka made a formal request to the EU seeking additional GSP benefits under the \u201clabour clause\u201d of EU GSP. After an independent evaluation, EU granted the incentives under the clause with effect from 1 February 2004. This allows Sri Lankan 40 to 60 percent reductions in normal GSP tariffs. However, whatever limited evidence is available suggests that Sri Lanka has not been able to increase its exports to the EU market despite such preferences39.

Focus on Niche Product \u2013 A Case of Sri Lanka Sri Lanka is considered an early entrant among developing countries that established export-oriented T&C factories as long ago as the first half of 1980s. During this early period, due to an incentive programme initiated by the Government, the T&C sector witnessed a surge in FDI. The contribution of the clothing (apparel) sector to overall production and exports is more than 90 percent (Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, 2005). Despite several attempts made to promote the textile sector, it has not picked up. With imports from countries like China, India, Thailand, Indonesia and India increasing, there 39 See Weeraratne (2005) Flying Colours, Broken Threads 35 is a limited possibility for Sri Lanka to make any significant headway in expanding its textile sector. As per recent data (2003), 354,000 people are engaged in 830 clothing factories in Sri Lanka. This sector contributed to 62.3 percent of total industrial export earnings and 48.8 percent of total exports in 2004. In terms of markets, Sri Lankan T&C products are destined to the US market and 37 percent to the EU. During the first half of the current decade, T&C sector emerged from a short period of negative export growth to positive growth in 2003 (Kelegama and Weeraratne, 2005). Since the Sri Lankan T&C sector is not considered highly competitive due to several factors - higher wages, low productivity of workers, high cost of utilities and lack of backward linkages - private entrepreneurs realised they should focus on niche products in order to create an opportunity for themselves. Taking advantage of the relatively high level of education of the workers,40 coupled with fast learning aptitude, Sri Lanka started focusing on a distinct segment of apparel, i.e., women\u2019s undergarments. As per the available data, Sri Lankan exports of three product categories (women's or girls' cotton briefs and panties, women's or girls' panties of man- made fibres and brassieres of all types) have achieved healthy growth. These categories saw growth in both the EU and US market in 2004, but in the first nine months of 2005 there has been a dramatic surge of exports (909.9 percent) in the US market, particularly in the first category, and healthy growth in other two categories. Exceptional growth of exports of cotton panties was not only observed in value terms, but also in volume terms, where it grew by 685 percent. However, exports to the EU declined by 22.9 percent and 18.3 percent respectively in the first two categories. Nonetheless, due to 18.8 percent growth achieved on brassieres\u2019 exports, the overall exports of these niche products declined by only 1.2 percent in the EU market.

If other Asian countries may not be able to replicate this model easily, mainly because of the lack of educated and skilled human resources, many other niche products, such as \u201cgreen\u201d clothing and accessories made of natural fibres (such as hemp, raw silk, cotton etc.) to cater to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "98652606-dbec-4e2e-8dc8-d292c2a021cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "98652606-dbec-4e2e-8dc8-d292c2a021cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/flying-colours-broken-threads", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Flying Colours, Broken Threads", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/flying-colours-broken-threads", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "187fd8779e4442183967f78f461656594d5973d0ee8d190dd2ffe71f3b831c7e"}, "3": {"node_id": "c5dcefd1-bb8d-411f-891e-55fe7ea8f8c6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/flying-colours-broken-threads", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6a04aec8c473eec2c2d69ee7d889bca13932da00fed1065c359f9123c5ced20c"}}, "hash": "04bf991ff1946dce8642b7b154bf2ef9f46fc63300bba862d68c3c8b4990627b", "text": "the growing demands of \u201cgreen consumerism\u201d in industrialised countries, or exports of handmade products with traditional design are possible. Focus on South-South Trade \u2013 A Case of Thailand Thailand was able to increase its exports of garment products to the United States, however, its exports to the EU market declined during the first nine months of 2005 (Table A-6a). Thai exports of fabrics to its big markets, such as the United States, EU, China, and Japan, declined in the first eight months of 2005 as compared to the same period of 2004. This may in part be due to competition from the most efficient players like China and India after quotas were eliminated. However, Thailand, as a member of ASEAN Free Trade Agreement, was able to export to its immediate neighbours to make up for the losses it incurred in other big markets. Figures provided on Table A-6a show at least two interesting trends. First, Thailand does not just rely on one or two major markets, like most developing countries. It exported T&C products worth US$1.2 billion to \u201cother\u201d countries \u2013 which may include South Asian and African countries. Second, it has become a supplier of fabrics to all other ASEAN countries, as seen by the profile of its fabric exports. Except for Singapore and Brunei, which do not have strong T&C sectors, all other member countries of ASEAN have increased their imports from Thailand. The EU\u2019s policy of allowing for ASEAN cumulation to achieve ROO requirements under the EBA seems also to have indirectly helped Thailand. Since its immediate LDC neighbours such as Lao PDR and Cambodia do not have well-developed textile and other accessories manufacturing set up, the EU\u2019s requirement to use fabrics from ASEAN to qualify for ROO requirements provides a captive market for Thai textiles. Likewise, export diversification in the case of garments is quite impressive, and there are lessons to be learned for other Asian developing countries. While it might be possible for other ASEAN developing countries like Indonesia and Viet Nam to follow the same trajectory, LDCs like Cambodia and Lao PDR probably will have to wait for several years to make this happen. Due to relatively a liberalised and hassle- free preferential trade regime within ASEAN, increasing intra-regional trade to make up for losses in multilateral trade seems feasible, but in the SAARC region that is not possible because regional trade liberalisation efforts are yet to take concrete shape (UNDP RCC, 2005c). However, having India and Pakistan as cotton fibres and textiles supplies may help other South Asian countries\u2019 exports of cotton garment products to the EU under EBA. Flying Colours, Broken Threads 37 If regional trade is not possible for the South Asian countries, what is the potential for South-South trade for them? Or what is the potential for South-South trade in general, if at all? As mentioned above, the tariffs rates on T&C in developing countries are much higher than prevailing rates in industrialised countries. However, developing countries do not want to reduce their tariff barriers to all countries due to the fear of de- industrialisation and consequent job losses. Worse still, a climate of mutual suspicion tends to cloud the prospects for South-South trade, even among the highly competitive players. Besides protecting the industry, the textile sector is protected for one more reason, i.e., to ensure vertical integration in the country. This not only helps developing countries meet the stringent ROO of preferential trading arrangements, but also helps them strengthen backward linkage of the clothing sector with the rest of the economy. These are the very factors responsible for the slow progress under Generalised System of Trade Preferences (GSTP), established on 19 April 1989 under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) with the objective of promoting South-South trade. So far, 44 countries have become members of this Agreement, out of which only 24 countries have exchanged tariff concessions. However, of late developing countries have exhibited a renewed sense of urgency to enhance South-South trade cooperation, which is indeed a positive sign. The Sao Paulo Consensus, which was agreed to during the Eleventh Session on UNCTAD has provided impetus to this process. The Consensus emphasises that UNCTAD should also continue its support for the revitalisation and greater utilisation of the GSTP among Developing Countries and other initiatives that stimulate South-South trade (UNCTAD, 2004a: Paragraph 97).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c5dcefd1-bb8d-411f-891e-55fe7ea8f8c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "c5dcefd1-bb8d-411f-891e-55fe7ea8f8c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/flying-colours-broken-threads", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Flying Colours, Broken Threads", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/flying-colours-broken-threads", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "187fd8779e4442183967f78f461656594d5973d0ee8d190dd2ffe71f3b831c7e"}, "2": {"node_id": "98652606-dbec-4e2e-8dc8-d292c2a021cf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/flying-colours-broken-threads", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "04bf991ff1946dce8642b7b154bf2ef9f46fc63300bba862d68c3c8b4990627b"}}, "hash": "6a04aec8c473eec2c2d69ee7d889bca13932da00fed1065c359f9123c5ced20c", "text": "Accordingly, developing-country ministers meeting in S\u00e3o Paulo for UNCTAD XI launched the third round of trade negotiations under the GSTP (UNCTAD, 2004b).

V. Conclusions and the Way Forward Since Asia was the major loser under T&C quotas due to the severity of quota restrictions, it was only fair to expect the region to gain from the complete phase-out of quotas. T&C import data from the EU and US sources for the first three quarters of 2005 suggest that Asia\u2019s share in EU and US imports has exceeded 50 percent. However, as in other cases where consolidated data are analysed at the aggregate level, \u201ctyranny of averages\u201d holds true in this case too. Recent data suggest that China is the only true gainer, with India running a distant second. At the other extreme, Nepal has been a true loser in the game and is currently surrounded by a gloomy scenario, with its exports to the EU and US market in the past nine months declined by 19.3 percent in value terms. One Year of Evidence from Asia after the Phase-out of Textiles and Clothing Quotas 38 Between these two extremes fall a number of the Asian 12 countries analysed in this report, most of which have been able to hold on to their past gains, and some making significant strides despite doubts cast on their ability to withstand the shock of the quota phase-out. Two LDCs \u2013 Bangladesh and Cambodia \u2013 have surprised researchers and policy makers alike by achieving impressive growth even during the post-quota era. While full employment data on Bangladesh are not available, with lingering suspicion that reduced overall volume of exports may have led to job losses, it is nowhere close to the predicted doomsday scenario. Cambodia has shown impressive gain, with the latest figures pointing towards the increase in employment by 9,000 workers in November 2005, compared to figures one year ago. Countries like India, Pakistan, Indonesia and Thailand \u2013 which have vertically integrated production structures and are considered important players in the global T&C market \u2013 continue to command respectable positions. However, the merits of vertical integration are often found to be overstated as shown in the past by the examples of Hong Kong SAR, Taiwan and South Korea, and recently by the examples of China and Pakistan. Among the Asian 12, India is the only country that can be considered self-reliant and almost complete in value-chain, with import intensity just at 1.5 percent (UNDP RCC, 2005b). However, the growth of the Indian T&C sector cannot solely be ascribed to this feature of Indian economy, although there is no counter-factual evidence available to prove otherwise. Sri Lanka too has been able to increase its overall garment exports, despite decrease in export to the EU market. This should not be a matter of concern for the Island, because except for China and India, every country\u2019s exports tracked in this Report declined in the EU market, both in value and volume terms. However, four countries in the region \u2013 Lao PDR, Philippines, Nepal and Viet Nam have seen their exports to both important destinations reduce not only in value but also volume terms. Why are some countries doing better, compared to others? Three Asian countries stand out in terms of strategies adopted during the period immediately preceding the elimination of quotas, and in the aftermath. Cambodia\u2019s \u201ccorporate social responsibility\u201d campaign and improved labour standards seem to have paid off well, and other LDCs in the region can learn from Cambodia\u2019s success. Given that ILO, which is the lead agency to implement the project, is planning to replicate this model in other countries, this provides an excellent opportunity. Sri Lanka\u2019s enviable performance in the exports of niche products is worth replicating too. Though it is admittedly difficult, with proper training and skill development programmes this model also can be successfully reproduced. Yet another relatively under-exploited sector, i.e., catering to the growing \u201cgreen consumers\u201d by promoting environment- friendly T&C products also should be explored by Asian developing countries. Thailand\u2019s approach of diversifying its markets by focusing more on South-South trade and intra-regional trade to make up for lost European and Japanese markets is equally laudable for ASEAN countries. However, countries in South Asia will not be able to replicate this model in the near future because of the formidable barriers that still exists for intra-regional trade. Prospects for enhancing exports to other developing countries are extremely limited due several barriers that exit on South-South trade. While GSTP offers Flying Colours, Broken Threads 39 a window of opportunity, it is underutlised so far. Asian developing countries are better advised to use GSTP and other regional as well as bilateral forums to expand South-South trade.

However, the recent examples of the decline in trade volume of Mexico and CBI countries to the US and CEEC to the EU, are useful caveats worth considering before making any judgment. Similarly, excessive reliance on preferential market access to industrialised countries could be dangerous, as seen from the examples of the decline in exports of AGOA countries. However, the \u201cexclusionary practice\u201d and granting of \u201cselective preferences\u201d should not continue unabated. The only way to mitigate the costs of exclusion is to provide preferences to all countries in similar socio-economic conditions. No justification exists for not extending to Asian and Pacific LDCs similar treatment as available to others. The only certain and predictable way to do this is to provide binding duty-free, quota-free market access for all the products originating from all LDCs. Recently concluded Hong Kong Ministerial Conference of the WTO was a missed opportunity, where WTO members only committed to provide duty-free, quota-free market access for only 97 per cent products originating in LDCs. The recent imposition of T&C quotas by the United States and EU on Chinese T&C products, invoking stringent conditions attached to China\u2019s Protocol of Accession to the WTO, speaks volumes regarding the free trade rhetoric. These measures could have a temporary palliative impact, particularly in African and Caribbean countries that are the recipients of generous preferential market access both in the United States and EU. They are likely to make gain, whereas poor Asian and Pacific LDCs will not. However, the other side of the coin is that these measures have set unwarranted precedents, with the phasing out of quotas being replaced by numerous trade remedy measures, including anti- dumping and countervailing measures. In the long run, competitiveness is the ultimate touchstone to measure the success of any country. The prevailing price war is indicative of the ability of countries to part with quota rent for the sake of securing greater markets. In a free market economy, when liberalisation takes place, the quota rent should go to the consumers, in the absence of market powers among other players. However, this is not what is happening, because consumer prices in the industrialised countries have not really gone down, despite massive reduction in export prices. Where have all the quota rent gone then? They seem to have gone to the retailers (buyers of T&C products), who hold the market power. However, this is an area that needs to be further investigated from industrial organisation perspective. Competition in this sector has put further pressure on relatively smaller countries without vertically integrated production structures, trade facilitation services and skills enhancement training programmes. The problem is further compounded by dilapidated infrastructure and the high cost of doing business, as well as limited access to credit. If they are fortunate, these countries will have three more years to survive, now that quota One Year of Evidence from Asia after the Phase-out of Textiles and Clothing Quotas 40 have been imposed on China. However, during this period they should try to diversify into niche market as well as improve their supply capacity. Since they lack the resources for this, they should seek and obtain technical assistance. Three agendas are therefore important to pursue at the international level. First, meaningful technical assistance \u2013 whether in the form of \u201cAid for Trade\u201d or through the \u201cEnhanced Integrated Framework\u201d as agreed in the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference of the WTO \u2013 should be provided to address supply side constraints and improve the competitiveness of marginal players. Second, Asian LDCs should be provided with terms of market access no less favourable than those provided to their African counterparts. Since DDA is a single undertaking and nothing could be considered agreed unless everything is agreed, LDCs should stay the course and make several attempts before the conclusion of the DDA to obtain this facility. Third, the use of trade remedy measures should be brought under the strict disciplines of the multilateral trading order by tightening the loose ends, which have served none other than protectionist forces. WTO ministerial has failed to address this concern to the satisfaction of the countries which are the real victims of such practices. These countries should continue to press for the expeditious resolution of this problem, at least before completion of the DDA.

Climate change is emerging as a critical global issue with the potential to cause further devastation to developing countries already suffering social, political, environmental and economic hardships. The fact that women and the poor are being disproportionally affected magni\ufb01es the importance of climate change as a regional issue for UNDP, requiring urgent attention, cooperation, resources and action. The vulnerability of women to the effects of climate change is largely due to their dependence on natural resources, their responsibility for water and food procurement and their increased risk exposure during times of disasters and severe weather crises. In response, UNDP has begun to set clear gender- speci\ufb01c goals and performance targets for integrating climate change impacts in its focus areas. UNDP is also actively promoting adaptation to climate change by supporting governments and stakeholders to analyze and identify gender-speci\ufb01c impacts and protection measures. The annual Gender CoP meeting provided a timely opportunity to address these issues. Through its focus as a learning event, the CoP enabled an upgrading of skills in gender issues within the environment-sustainable development focus area of UNDP's work across Asia and the Paci\ufb01c.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "119b838c-efc9-407e-b386-b01865810d0b": {"__data__": {"id_": "119b838c-efc9-407e-b386-b01865810d0b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-climate-change-impact-and-adaptation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender and Climate Change: Impact and Adaptation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-climate-change-impact-and-adaptation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f7958045681e8bec6f76e825419d004f19031c3fb048faf0cb22bcbd37d1de7c"}, "2": {"node_id": "7b057425-91ef-4a56-8f48-075165146210", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-climate-change-impact-and-adaptation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "49b141b82cd0cec477ecedaa232fe590c632827e27dca4ac304c74ba0077c7ba"}}, "hash": "43224e74ce1979cda784c9661af0f7c122de34a3ead27023c01e4e53970c8799", "text": "It facilitated the sharing of experiences, lessons learnt and best practices in developing and implementing gender initiatives on climate change between UNDP country of\ufb01ce (CO) staff.

The value of the workshop lay in the sharing of experiences on the key dynamics that link gender and the environment, the existing challenges to mainstreaming gender within climate change projects, as well as the opportunities for future work. This report consolidates such experiences, and is a by-product of the discussions and inputs provided by participants during the workshop. 3 I) Gender and climate change \u2013 Why it matters a gender-sensitive approach. This failure not only generates concerns in terms of respect for gender equity, it also leads to shortcomings in the ef\ufb01ciency and ef\ufb01ca- cy of climate-related adaptation and miti- gation measures and instruments. Vulnerability to climate change can exacerbate the impacts of non-climatic stressors such as increased migration, rapid urbanization, uncertain energy security, unsustainable management of natural resources and the loss of traditional coping mechanisms. Responding to climate change is not simply a matter of reducing the amount of greenhouse gas emissions into the earth\u2019s atmosphere, but is also about helping countries to build adaptive capacity and develop a sense of preparedness to reduce its negative impacts. In order to achieve this, it is important to understand the framework of analysis for gender and climate change that addresses vulnerabilities, adaptation, mitigation and the manner in which engagement can take place. Compared to men, women are affected differently, and often more severely by climate change and associated natural disasters such as \ufb02oods, droughts, cyclones and storms. This is largely because men and women are bound by distinct socio-economic roles and responsibilities that give rise to differences 1. Gendered impacts of climate change Gender issues have been rarely ad- dressed, particularly in relation to climate change impact in global climate change initiatives and policy meetings. Debates have focused primarily on mitigation efforts (reduction of carbon emissions and other greenhouse gases), and on the as- sociated actions required by governments and institutions to mitigate climate change. Insuf\ufb01cient attention has been paid to climate change adaptation strategies \u2013 actions taken for and by people, to prepare and make changes to protect themselves against climate change. Adaptive actions are taken to reduce the threat to food supply, health and well-being, livelihoods and security. Women\u2019s roles are not adequately recognized or accounted for in climate change mitigation and adapta- tion efforts, in national and global climate change negotiation talks or in the context of natural disasters in\ufb02uenced or exacer- bated by climate change. Despite the guiding principles within the United Nations (UN) system to incor- porate gender considerations, climate change policy-making (most visibly, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC) has failed to adopt 4 in vulnerability and ability to cope with these climate change consequences. Women, particularly in least-developed Countries (LDCs) are disproportionately vulnerable because of their: \ufffd dependence on bio-fuels and other natural resources; \ufffd responsibility for water procurement and household care; \ufffd role in securing food and fuel; \ufffd predominant presence in low- technology agriculture; and \ufffd greater exposure to risk in crisis and severe weather events that may have been in\ufb02uenced or impacted by climate change. Consequently, vulnerable groups \u2013 especially poor women \u2013 are likely to be faced with problems such as food insecurity, loss of livelihood, hardships due to environmental degradation that lead to displacement and a host of other potentially devastating economic and social consequences. It is poor women who are most vulnerable and will bear the adaptation burden despite their comparatively insigni\ufb01cant contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to these vulnerabilities women are still underrepresented in decision-making with respect to plans and actions to mitigate, and adapt to, climate change. The dependency on biomass as the main fuel source in the rural areas of most developing countries means that women and children, as primary end-users, are at the receiving end of energy shortages and energy use-related pollution impacts. Women also suffer more due to their restricted mobility and lack of exposure to training and information. This is particularly evident in relation to warnings about, dangers of, and courses of actions to take in response to, natural calamities that may have been in\ufb02uenced or impacted by climate change. Furthermore, disasters, irrespective of their causes, generally accentuate discrimination, and women may not receive equal aid bene\ufb01ts that predominantly target male household heads.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "091e70da-a550-41d6-a0f7-d8dae8aae990": {"__data__": {"id_": "091e70da-a550-41d6-a0f7-d8dae8aae990", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-climate-change-impact-and-adaptation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender and Climate Change: Impact and Adaptation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-climate-change-impact-and-adaptation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4b7685a71ccdaa45c1e596a16b50016cea947b0874cba8f4e5b054d8124e030e"}, "2": {"node_id": "417cee1b-7820-4a0a-b6af-df58c4209a89", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-climate-change-impact-and-adaptation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9d6a12e0c1bbd56ad0e15dba69d0afbc3301cbfe7bd54ad33b6eb07f9e0c6044"}}, "hash": "5265c40c989e9e95e510bf86e6758f467f7b6b0ac6bd6360a123c5d7e5178986", "text": "In addition, con\ufb02ict situations such as Afghanistan amplify the impacts of natural disasters such as severe winters and earthquakes, because the damage caused remains after the con\ufb02ict is resolved.

In order to respond to climate crises in situations of con\ufb02ict it is important to establish humanitarian gender responses from the context of climate change, have clear protocols on responding to environmental disasters in con\ufb02ict settings and, most importantly, on how to prevent con\ufb02ict under recurring effects of climate change. And \ufb01nally, gender perspectives on climate change, in terms of agriculture and food and water security in different ecosys- tems, should be considered while devel- oping recommendations and strategies for the long-, medium- and short-term. Since the climate is changing rapidly, the policy approach should be \ufb02exible enough to adapt as new climate change-related information and knowledge becomes available. Women need to be meaning- fully involved, not only as bene\ufb01ciaries but also in the decision-making process especially in the areas of adaptation and mitigation. Understanding how the different social roles and economic status of men and women affect, and are affected differently by climate change will improve actions taken to reduce vulnerability and combat climate change, particularly in the developing world. 5 2. Climate change and gender linkages in mitigation Climate change mitigation is: \u201can anthropo- genic intervention to reduce the sources of greenhouse gases or enhance their sinks.\u201d It concentrates on either controlling the emis- sions of greenhouse gases or capturing and sequestering those emissions.2 Mitigation actions have largely focused on reduction of industrial greenhouse gas emissions, but also include the practice of energy ef\ufb01ciency and the application of renewable energy in commercial and residential sectors. The role of women in such climate change mitigation strategies has received little attention, as actions have been perceived to be either technical or scienti\ufb01c in nature and where including a gender perspective has not been a priority. However, as climate change is partly the result of human behaviour and affects all people, mitigation strategies must consider the gendered patterns of energy use in order to be effective. Women can play an important role in promoting mitigation measures such as: \ufffd the practice of energy ef\ufb01ciency in households and community-based industries; \ufffd renewable energy (including hydro- electric power) applications in rural households and communities; \ufffd afforestation and reforestation activities; and \ufffd waste minimization and recycling. 2 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2001) 2.1 The role of women in mitigation actions In many communities in develop- ing countries gathering, transporting and purchasing household fuels is the responsibility of women. This becomes increasingly dif\ufb01cult with dwindling avail- ability of food and biomass energy resources. Women without access to modern forms of energy are exposed to indoor air pollution and related health problems such as bronchitis, asthma and miscarriage. Access to non-polluting fuels that do not damage peoples\u2019 health should be an important element of mitiga- tion programmes. But it is essential that such considerations be integrated in an effective manner and with proper consul- tation regarding their effect on women. The policies, technological changes and instruments being proposed to mitigate carbon emissions must use and develop both gender-sensitive criteria and indicators to ensure their impacts do not bypass or negatively affect women. However, there are concerns that as women switch to modern fuels, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions will increase and expose women to the price \ufb02uctuation and scarcity associated with resources such as oil. These alterations could further harm rural women who have little in\ufb02uence on foreign exchange imbalances, fossil fuel scarcity or excessive greenhouse gas emissions. This highlights why wealth is an important variable in consideration of the impact of gender on climate change. For example, a rural poor person in India emits only 100\u2013300 kg of CO2 per year, as compared to 2,000 kg emitted by an urban rich person in India, or 15,000 kg as the average emitted per capita per year in the United States of America. 6 2.2 Potential gender entry points in mitigation activities Gender can be integrated into climate- change mitigation activities through clean development mechanisms (CDM).

The role of, and bene\ufb01ts to, women in CDM projects can be highlighted in the project design documents of CDM projects. They should be recommended to designated national authorities as among the criteria for gauging the socioeconomic impacts of the proposed CDM projects when being reviewed and approved. CDM projects that are community-based offer indirect \ufb01nancial opportunities to women, but support has to be provided so that such opportunities are more accessible. CDM projects are largely developed by private companies where gender issues are usually neglected due to considerations of a \ufb01nancial, technical or logistical nature that result from lack of gender awareness. Therefore, it is important to integrate a gender perspective into climate change processes, instruments, mechanisms and developments so that it is included by all parties in all sectors. 2.3 Gender and climate change policy development Gender mainstreaming is also needed in the ongoing policy dialogue processes, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Conference of Parties (COP) and various discussions relating to vulnerability, adaptation and mitigation. Climate change bodies like the Subsidiary Body for Scienti\ufb01c and Technological Advice (SBSTA) and especially the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) should ensure that gender equality receives adequate attention. Countries involved in future COP meetings should conduct gender-speci\ufb01c discussions with balanced gender participation. UNFCCC should also ensure consideration of gender equality issues in the design of CDM projects, as well as UNFCCC-sponsored projects on technology transfer and capacity building and other related initiatives. Gender considerations need to be incorporated into the National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) activities of LDCs. Stakeholders in advocating and implementing actions to address vulnerability and adaptation to climate change issues need to be consulted on integrating gender equality issues. Furthermore the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and specialized UN agencies should begin to ensure gender mainstreaming into climate change mitigation. Governments and the private sector should be made responsible for integrating gender concerns into such climate change programmes, as they are major participants in the development process.3 3 Information on UNDP-GEF programmes can be found at: http://www.undp.org/gef/about/gefsec.html 7 Global Environment Facility (GEF)3 The UNDP GEF helps developing coun- tries fund projects and programmes that bring about global environmental bene\ufb01ts in several focus areas such as climate change. 3. Climate change and gender linkages in adaptation The IPCC de\ufb01nes climate change adaptation as \u201cadjustments in ecological, social or economic systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli and their effects or impacts. This term refers to changes in processes, practices and structures to moderate potential damages to or bene\ufb01t from opportunities associated with climate change\u201d.4 Climate change impacts \u2013 such as rising sea levels, increases in ambient temperatures and increased variability in rainfall \u2013 can exacerbate the incidence of forest \ufb01res and loss of natural diversity. The effects of these changes \ufb01lter down to men and women and ultimately impact more profoundly on rural women who depend on their environment for their livelihood. Land clearance for agriculture, forestry and commercial purposes is causing deforestation of natural ecosystems, restricting access to traditional forestry products and placing women increasingly under strain as a large amount of their time is spent trekking in search of diminishing fuel wood resources. Women\u2019s dependency on agriculture, forests and biofuels increase their exposure to climate change and illustrates the large role women 4 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2001) play in the management of resources and how their contribution to and participation will affect the ultimate success of resource management initiatives. 3.1 Adaptation to the environmental impacts of climate change If climate change also means that there is less agricultural land available, and the productive capacity of available land is decreased, then the need to increase agricultural productivity to stimulate growth becomes all the more pressing. Climate change is predicted to reduce crop yields and food production in regions throughout the world, particularly the tropics. Women, as subsistence farmers in the developing countries in these areas are responsible for 70\u201380 percent of household food production. Traditional food supply sources, both agricultural and forest products may become more unpredictable and scarce due to climate change thus disproportionately affecting women.

The severe impact of climate change on the environment is becoming more evident. Droughts, \ufb02oods and cyclones are much more frequent and intense than previously recorded. It is important to be 8 prepared with safety nets and contingency options, such as drought resistant crop varieties and soil conservation measures. Environmental protection as a part of sustainable development is imperative for reducing climate change impacts. 3.2 The social and economic considerations of adaptation Female-headed households left behind as men migrate as a result of extreme events and disasters are often the poorest; as wives of seasonal migrants may not receive remittances or have alternative sources of income. The workloads of these women, their children and the elderly, increase signi\ufb01cantly as a result of male out-migration, which is likely to expand as climate change related impacts escalate. In the coastal areas, when lands are inundated and infrastructure is damaged due to SLR, large-scale migration takes place, leading to extra hardships for women. There are many other negative impacts associated with such movement of people including the increased risk of HIV infection among women from husbands who migrated in search of employment. Additionally, where there is increased male out-migration due to resource shortages and unreliable job markets caused by climate change, women are left behind with additional agricultural and household duties. Poor women\u2019s lack of access to and control over natural resources, technologies and credit mean that they have fewer resources to cope with seasonal, episodic weather and natural disasters. Consequently, traditional roles are reinforced, girls\u2019 education suffers, and women\u2019s ability to diversify their livelihoods (and therefore their capacity to access income-generating jobs) is diminished. More women than men work in the informal sector and in small enterprises, which are often the worst hit, and the least likely to recover from the effects of disasters because of their low levels of capital accumulation, lower assets, and weaker access to credit and information. Furthermore women are further constrained by discriminatory land and inheritance rights, and limited access to credit and other agricultural extension services. Climate change may affect health in a variety of ways. Increases in the number and intensity of storm events may test existing water management systems and additionally high rainfall increases the risk of outbreaks of water-borne diseases and may also reduce availability of drinking water. Reductions or changes in agricultural production and food availability results in malnutrition and disturbance of traditional balanced diets. The impacts of \ufb02ooding are particularly severe in areas of environmental degradation, and where basic public health infrastructure, including sanitation and hygiene, is lacking. Finally, climate change causes resource shortages and market instability, which impacts highly on women. A distinction between increases in income and women\u2019s empowerment should be made, measuring important indicators such as income, time and decision-making power. The collection and use of gender-disaggregated data is imperative in promoting the gendered dimensions in developing both climate change adaptation and mitigation policies/models. Reduction in women\u2019s drudgery for fuel supply needs to be addressed. Women need to diversify the energy resources they use, and actions to facilitate the introduction of alternative fuels for household energy consumption could well constitute an essential part of climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. 9 3.3 Adaptation and disasters Women and girls are more vulnerable to disaster situations due to a lack of skills and training required for survival. For example, women accounted for 55\u201370 percent of tsunami deaths in Banda Aceh, Indonesia; in the worst affected village in North Aceh district, Kuala Cangkoy 80 percent of the deaths were women. During the 2003 European heat wave, 70 percent of deaths were women. Also, \ufb02oods frequently claim far more female victims because their mobility is restricted and they have not been taught to swim. When Bangladesh was hit by a devastating cyclone and \ufb02ood in 1991, the death rate was reportedly \ufb01ve times higher among women. While all of the above examples cannot be attributed to climate change, it is important to recognize the vulnerability differences that exist between men and women in disaster situations. This applies not only to the events themselves but how they are then addressed, as evidence shows the increased threats to the security and dignity of women and girls, particularly in emergency shelters used after a disaster. Such differences in vulnerability, and in adaptive opportunities, should be acknowledged in the disaster adaptation process to address gender inequality and to ensure successful climate change adaptation policies and measures. 4.

UNDP is helping develop national capacities to secure the MDGs by strengthening existing or adopting new policies and practices in the context of climate change and its associated impacts. UNDP has been an active player in the \ufb01eld of climate change since the early 1990s. Recognizing the need to lower the risks that climate change poses to hard-won development gains made by developing countries, the goal of UNDP is to align human development and climate change responses with a particular focus on the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable communities and countries. Some of its strategies include pursuing policy- and agenda-setting; experience-sharing and training activities; establishing a system of experts to assist countries to access, integrate and sequence different sources of \ufb01nancing; and evaluating alternative mitigation and adaptation options. UNDP climate change strategy priorities integrate climate change into UN and UNDP development assistance at the global, regional and national levels. These include: supporting design of policies and action plans, promoting early adaptation as well as long-term strategies, and directing investment towards low carbon technologies and practices. UNDP assistance to developing countries can help them choose energy paths that would provide low carbon sources of power. 10 UNDP has repeatedly called for the integration of gender perspectives in all initiatives to address environmental issues at the national, sub-national and global levels, and this call has been explicitly extended to the issue of climate change. UNDP\u2019s work on governance, gender, corporate social responsibility and capacity development strengthens the capacity of national and local institutions in building resilience to climate change. Moreover, the poverty reduction work of UNDP also strengthens linkages between climate risk management and poverty reduction by mainstreaming climate change into national Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers. Gender Equality Strategy (GES) 2008\u20132011 UNDP aims to deepen its work on gender in its focal areas of poverty reduction, democratic governance, crisis prevention and recovery, and environment and sustainable development. The GES promotes adaptation to climate change through identi\ufb01cation and analysis of gender speci\ufb01c impact and measures, through women\u2019s knowledge and participation in mitigation and adaptation policies at all levels and through establishing a stronger evidence base on the gendered impact of climate change. The basic strategy of UNDP is to scale- up adaptation and mitigation actions of countries to assist them in successfully addressing the climate change challenge and achieve the MDGs. UNDP aims to provide support to governments for policy and \ufb01nancing that re\ufb02ect both men and women\u2019s priorities and needs, and through analyzing and identifying gender-speci\ufb01c impacts and protection measures for environmental changes and disasters. It will focus on policy change and institutional strengthening through activities such as training for policy-makers, on national assessments of policy options, and on market development/transformation for lower carbon technologies and sustainable land management. At the sub-national level it will focus on activities such as establishing Climate Change Action Plans to address mitigation and adaptation at the provincial level. At the community level, UNDP will focus on gender-related activities such as increasing access to sustainable sources of energy in rural areas, and developing the capacities of communities to make their livelihoods more resilient in the face of climate change. UNDP also aims to provide guidance on gender-speci\ufb01c concerns to intergovernmental bodies as they further develop policies and programmes in climate change. In all these efforts, the key partners are GEF, United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat), International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and Women and Environment Development (WEDO). 4.1 Addressing gender concerns in climate change projects UNDP has been increasingly active in supporting innovative climate change adaptation projects across a range of sectors and countries. GEF climate change mitigation projects mainly address the removal of barriers to energy ef\ufb01ciency, renewable energy and sustainable transport in order to facilitate greenhouse gas emission reduction. Though such projects aim to ensure compliance with UNDP goals and values and harness the local experience/knowledge of both men and women, gender issues have previously been inadvertently neglected. One reason for this is that men from the energy and \ufb01nance sectors have traditionally dominated decision-making positions 11 and have not prioritized gender. The fact that stakeholders and project proponents are not gender-sensitive or simply do not understand the gender equity aspects of Climate Change and energy projects has also contributed to this situation. However this is slowly changing. UNDP has committed to safeguarding gender goals and values in its MDG Carbon Facility projects.5 Examples of UNDP gender and energy projects5 \ufffd Bangladesh: A project was", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "710c654d-696f-4822-a649-f5b6e302bbbe": {"__data__": {"id_": "710c654d-696f-4822-a649-f5b6e302bbbe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-climate-change-impact-and-adaptation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender and Climate Change: Impact and Adaptation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-climate-change-impact-and-adaptation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "311d0791e0e077d97ca7d4f7d5de825eaefd0c447df95d5e1a3fa826d70fbb61"}, "3": {"node_id": "3d874d6a-ecd1-47e5-82f3-e3a7b2e922a2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-climate-change-impact-and-adaptation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2bfa716639605d374403e14e1e3c9f740b1536f35ffdbff5f39b9e64d8ddeae8"}}, "hash": "1b1f94229ff47c86e05dd39a32cec65367372fb1b046dd6f5ca060e2f59c01cf", "text": "designed to train women to become solar household systems entrepreneurs, responsible for both assembling and selling the systems through a cooperative-run energy centre. \ufffd Nepal: A community-based micro- hydro project was developed alongside the provision of solar home systems, bio-gas and improved cooking stoves that generate a variety of energy services such as lighting, communications and clean water. \ufffd Cambodia: The \ufb01rst member-owned rural community energy cooperatives were established in 2005 that operates electri\ufb01cation and distribution systems. As one of the ten GEF Implementing Agencies, UNDP has been providing assistance to over 100 countries in preparing national climate change vulnerability assessments and in the National Com- munications (NATCOMs) to the UNFCCC. Based on the National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs), UNDP expects to be in a position to help over 30 LDCs in accessing resources from the 5 Project details located at: http:// regionalcentrebangkok.undp.or.th/practices/ energy_env/rep-por/documents/Compendium_ Booklet.pdf UNFCCC Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF), managed by GEF, to implement priority adaptation initiatives. UNDP has also gained experience in working with poor communities to increase their resilience to weather-related shocks, particularly through work on drought risk reduction, led jointly by the Drylands Development Centre (DDC) and the Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery (BCPR). There are new initiatives on gender and climate change at various levels such as the Global Gender and Climate Alliance (GGCA) that was formed in partnership by UNDP, UNEP, IUCN and WEDO with the aim of ensuring inclusion of women\u2019s voices in decision-making, policy development and building capacity at global, regional and local levels. It focuses on ensuring that UN \ufb01nancing mechanisms on mitigation and adaptation address the needs of poor women and men equitably. The GGCA partners worked with the UNFCCC Secretariat to develop gender road maps, and develop and utilize gender guidelines for climate change \ufb01nancing mechanisms. It also developed a Resource Guide on Gender and Climate Change.6 The ongoing UNDP climate change portfolio supports both mitigation and adaptation policy responses. For example, greater energy access through improved energy ef\ufb01ciency and decentralized renewable energy technologies enables communities to diversify sources of livelihood and income, and better adapt to adverse impacts of climate change. Reduced emissions through sustainable land management practices help increase the resilience of ecosystems to climate change, in turn improving the resilience and adaptive capacities of vulnerable communities. In many cases, women\u2019s knowledge and participation has been 6 Guide available at: http://www.gender-climate.org 12 critical to the survival of entire communities in disaster situations. UNDP will therefore support governments to take advantage of women\u2019s specialized skills in various aspects of their livelihood and natural resource management strategies that lend themselves to mitigation and adaptation. UNDP will support the development of national capacity to consult with women, draw on their expertise in this area and ensure that national and local mitigation and adaptation policies and actions re\ufb02ect their concerns and experiences. UNDP Asia-Pacifc Gender Community of Practice (CoP) In May 2007, UNDP launched a Regional CoP that allows members to share and communicate through email, and functions as a repository of information. It has 200 members presently and has carried out two e-clinics on strengthening gender mainstreaming efforts. The platform helps in sharing information and materials for gender equality interventions within all areas of UNDP work, including for climate change advocacy strategies among the gender advocates and other development practitioners. It bene\ufb01ts members and stakeholders through facilitating access to relevant information and knowledge, improving effectiveness by connecting peers, transferring lessons, and increasing the potential for innovation. It also contributes to development effectiveness by connecting sectors, professions, countries, regions and cultures; paving the way for more coordination, coherence and innovation. This leads towards more balanced policy decisions and increased attention on gender equality issues in the policy agenda. 13 II) Where we stand: UNDP country office experiences iii.

Achieving representation 5) Country of\ufb01ce presentations on critical climate change- related gender issues In preparation for the CoP workshop, participants produced multimedia presen- tations on recent and ongoing initiatives on gender and climate change in their respective country of\ufb01ces. The discussions after each country presentation reinforced the need to address gender dimensions of climate change, leading to qualitative improvements in policy and measures. This also prompted a discussion of what steps are to be taken in order to integrate gender into all climate change mechanisms, measures and policies at the country level. The country of\ufb01ce presentations highlighted various entry points to integrate a gender perspective. The presentations are organized the matically as follows: i. Climate change adaptation \u2013 Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Afghanistan, Fiji; ii. Gender mainstreaming of climate change initiatives \u2013 Philippines, Thailand, Mongolia, Bhutan, Papua New Guinea; 14 for women is a challenge, as lesser value is attached to women\u2019s contributions in community development work. More women should be involved in development initiatives so that gender issues are integrated in the future planning process, and to determine development directions. Indonesia Key issues of climate change impact in Indonesia are highlighted through the UNDP Climate Change Programme Framework. UNDP Indonesia was in the process of preparing a draft on a human-development approach to climate change with the aim of ensuring that climate change adaptation and mitigation directly contribute to the national and local development process, strengthening efforts towards achieving the MDGs. It was emphasized that due to more frequent and more severe climate impacts, human development is being blocked or slowed down. The effects of climate change on women were highlighted in a project proposal \u2018Reverse Negative Development Trends on East Nusa Tenggara (NTT) Caused by Climate Change Impacts\u2019. This is one opportunity for gender mainstreaming where interventions speci\ufb01cally bene\ufb01ting women could be expected. Afghanistan Climate change-related work is yet to start in Afghanistan, even though the region is particularly prone to climate hazards such as droughts and \ufb02oods. As the country is recovering from con\ufb02ict, most investments are in security. Con\ufb02ict-related displacement and malnutrition are more pronounced in the face of climate changes and it has become clear that heavy rainfall in winter, water scarcity in summer, and lack of fuel wood disproportionately affect women and children. Studies of such events will identify where actions are required and the government can be informed accordingly. There is an urgent need to identify climate change-related impacts and address these in the overall development of the region. However, in all these processes gender concerns should be addressed as Afghan society is traditionally male dominated and men do the decision-making. Although Afghanistan is experiencing many climate change-related impacts, these are rarely included in post-con\ufb02ict interventions. Climate change issues are even absent from the UN National Human Development Report (2007\u20132008) that focuses on security issues. Fiji The Fiji Multi-Country Of\ufb01ce, which covers 10 small island developing states, has completed the formulation of the NAPAs of the four LDCs in its region. Gender mainstreaming has been used in the design of these programmes and gender experts are a part of the core team of the Gender Country Programme (2008\u2013 2012). Climate change-related activities, particularly adaptation measures, are included in the community development projects and programmes. Adaptation measures are integrated in projects supported by the Global Environment Facility-Small Grants Programme such as coconut-based biofuels, a biogas digester for community development, and sustainable environment for community development. Such measures include increasing resilience of coastal settlements, promoting salt tolerant species for agriculture, initiating water storage and conservation strategies, 15 controlling vector-borne diseases, providing access to potable water, protecting \ufb01shing communities in coastal ecosystems, protecting coral reef ecosystems, facilitating disaster risk reduction (DRR) through strengthening of community preparedness and response. Though the community development initiatives contribute to adaptation measures, they lack baseline data on gender. NAPA follow-up projects provide an opportunity for integrating gender components and there are indications of some steps forward, such as development of adaptation training kits for women, scoping exercises with gender dimensions, and gender mainstreaming checklists, etc.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "863560dc-2917-4472-b85d-8195dbe3c52b": {"__data__": {"id_": "863560dc-2917-4472-b85d-8195dbe3c52b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-climate-change-impact-and-adaptation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender and Climate Change: Impact and Adaptation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-climate-change-impact-and-adaptation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "990d0ec5b56cc7c39d4b29b68a8092974fc80d68124521c9187c5f5f524cc18b"}, "2": {"node_id": "d333f191-f4be-42c1-b7a5-27c4dc9613b9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-climate-change-impact-and-adaptation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "04ccdc813de20aa72ccdb295671105cabf1be7d56ed9e3a26971ea69a63134ea"}}, "hash": "6eb3ba477914ea1a96be4870ee70076f49b8d25c6307ee20ff8bc657ccb9bf51", "text": "It was highlighted that gender dimensions should be included from the project formulation stage and gender- differentiated impacts should be identi\ufb01ed in the local appraisal committees, as the government is more likely to take notice if data are made available on the effects of climate change on gender. 5.2 Gender mainstreaming in climate change initiatives Philippines Two ongoing climate change projects were being conducted, one on strengthening institutional capacity to adapt to climate change and another on equitable integrated ecosystem/climate change adaptation, both of which", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1dcce22a-c8d6-4b1e-9a83-75484d4f9089": {"__data__": {"id_": "1dcce22a-c8d6-4b1e-9a83-75484d4f9089", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-climate-change-impact-and-adaptation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender and Climate Change: Impact and Adaptation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-climate-change-impact-and-adaptation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f596cbb6639d88195bfe2158770ba4b376c4adc7bc91d87cf6a669acc38d4069"}, "3": {"node_id": "86a377ef-eb08-46a1-9178-e8cd677db2a5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-climate-change-impact-and-adaptation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "19937504ffe82230b62498148f9daaf315c692515db3e5d61144123adfaaa1cc"}}, "hash": "0b6708db4efcb0bd219f76b9c276de09514e7f0b21d4e1ea3d2d43a40e6e264d", "text": "focus on barrier removal. It was stressed that although GEF projects aim to reduce carbon emissions, they do not look at the role of the women in the decision- making process. Moreover, women in these projects are at a disadvantage due to cultural restrictions. The presentation highlighted the need for log-frame analysis in the design of projects; that stakeholders were often not systematically analyzed; and that the inclusion of gender issues in the project is often dependent on the consultants involved. The most effective way to convey the message to the government is to do a cost bene\ufb01t analysis on integrating gender, i.e. to talk in monetary terms, as the government has often failed to take notice of social issues like gender. Thailand UNDP Thailand is working to enhance the empowerment of women in the disaster management planning process, particularly at the community level. In traditional Thai society, women play a very important role in the household as well as in commercial areas, but when it comes to planning, it is the men who make decisions. In UNDP community-level projects, particularly those on DRR, work has been targeting women and has involved women in self-help groups and micro\ufb01nance. There should be room for change in discussing gender equality or empowerment, as gender roles have shifted in many cases, particularly in relation to disasters. What is important is how to address this transformation of gender roles. It can be addressed through regional examples of good practice. There is much emphasis placed on development at the grass roots level to indentify who participates and who bene\ufb01ts. It was stressed that different cultural and political contexts in each country require different approaches, as is recognized in the work of UNDP. 16 Mongolia In Mongolia, 86.7 percent of rural income is derived from livestock. This is problematic as intensive livestock grazing can be detrimental to the environment on which it is so dependent. The Mongolia Country Of\ufb01ce presentation discussed the project \u2018Strengthening the Disaster Mitigation and Management System in Mongolia \u2013 Phase III\u2019, which has resulted in the strengthening of the national capacity for climate resilience and adaptation to climate change to reduce disaster risks. It identi\ufb01ed gender mainstreaming components of DRR and climate risk projects, such as assessment of vulnerability to disaster in terms of sex, age, location, disability; development of a gender mainstreaming strategy for DRR and climate-related hazards; and creation of a training package and public awareness materials on concepts of gender and gender equality. Bhutan The Bhutan Country Of\ufb01ce presentation focused on three projects, namely: (i) Gender Mainstreaming in Reducing Climate Change Induced Risks and Vulnerabilities from Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) in two valleys in Bhutan; (ii) Enhancing Global Environmental Management in Bhutan Local Governance System; and (iii) Enabling Activities for the Preparation of Bhutan\u2019s Second NATCOM to UNFCCC. It was explained that gender mainstreaming is being carried out in the three projects through advocacy and awareness- building exercises, training and capacity building on \ufb01rst aid, drill, early warning systems for women and children, and identi\ufb01cation of evacuation sites. Also, sex-disaggregated data are part of the project\u2019s reports, and the terms of reference of consultants integrate gender concerns. The representation of women at the local level is very good but more effort is required to achieve this at the national level. Papua New Guinea (PNG) In PNG, entry points for mainstreaming gender into climate change mitigation and adaptation initiatives at the country level have been identi\ufb01ed in the United Nations Country Programme (UNCP) for 2008\u20132012, particularly in the areas of gender and sustainable livelihoods. Possible areas for action include increasing and enhancing women\u2019s leadership skills in government work on climate change and in formulating climate change policy. PNG was in the process of preparing its Second NATCOM report where it was felt that there was an opportunity for gender assessment in mitigation and adaptation strategies. Gender components can be integrated in to the United Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (UN-REDD). Challenges such as the lack of institutional coordination, lack of data and capacity to follow-up remain. However, the Gender Strategic Plan 2008\u20132012, the Annual Work Plan 2009 shows that there is a way forward for gender inclusion in awareness and advocacy activities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "86a377ef-eb08-46a1-9178-e8cd677db2a5": {"__data__": {"id_": "86a377ef-eb08-46a1-9178-e8cd677db2a5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-climate-change-impact-and-adaptation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender and Climate Change: Impact and Adaptation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-climate-change-impact-and-adaptation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f596cbb6639d88195bfe2158770ba4b376c4adc7bc91d87cf6a669acc38d4069"}, "2": {"node_id": "1dcce22a-c8d6-4b1e-9a83-75484d4f9089", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-climate-change-impact-and-adaptation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b6708db4efcb0bd219f76b9c276de09514e7f0b21d4e1ea3d2d43a40e6e264d"}}, "hash": "19937504ffe82230b62498148f9daaf315c692515db3e5d61144123adfaaa1cc", "text": "17 5.3 Preparation of NATCOM to UNFCCC and NAPAs Timor Leste Timor Leste was in the process of preparing the Initial NATCOM on Climate Change after its rati\ufb01cation of the Kyoto Protocol in March 2008.

Two ongoing projects related to climate change include \u2018Rural Electri\ufb01cation\u2019 and \u2018Sustainable Land Management\u2019. However, in all the above interventions gender considerations were not identi\ufb01ed and integrated. NAPA is a good entry point for integrating gender considerations. A stakeholder consultation helps in putting the right information together and prioritizing action plans. Cambodia It was reported that the Second NATCOM to UNFCCC was in the process of being approved without gender components. In contrast, there was a proposal in the National Strategic Development Plan to mainstream gender in the various line ministries. The Ministry of Environment had requested the Women\u2019s Affairs Ministry to develop an Action Plan for Gender. To facilitate gender sensitization, it was felt that the Gender Focal Points should be more proactive in identifying policy gaps and opportunities for capacity building on gender and more importantly should identify whom gender training should be provided to. Malaysia Malaysia was preparing its Second NATCOM to the UNFCCC and there were some ongoing projects on energy ef\ufb01ciency. There was also a new initiative on \u2018Building Sector Energy Ef\ufb01ciency to Improve Energy Ef\ufb01ciency in Commercial and Government Sector Buildings\u2019. This was to be achieved by promoting energy conserving design and by improving energy ef\ufb01ciency in the operation of existing buildings. 5.4 Energy ef\ufb01ciency and renewable energy India Addressing climate change from the perspective of energy ef\ufb01ciency was the focus of the India Country Of\ufb01ce presentation. India is addressing energy ef\ufb01ciency through various policies including: the Integrated Energy Policy 2006, the National Environment Policy 2006, and the National Action Plan for Climate Change 2008. Gender components are an integral part of implementation strategies in projects such as \u2018Renewable Energy for Rural Livelihoods\u2019, where local women are trained as solar engineers, in provision of small hydro-power for rural enterprises and in using biomass gasi\ufb01ers for grain milling, etc. Another project was \u2018Access to Clean Energy\u2019, which aims to provide clean energy for domestic cooking, energy for rural enterprise and improved electricity distribution management. Identifying government guidelines on gender and climate change, and making videos showing gender concerns in their energy projects are other forward-looking initiatives. All logical framework analysis of 18 future projects will include explicit gender components and options will be explored to invite other energy experts and gender specialists to partner meetings. Pakistan Pakistan is a signatory to all conventions on environment and gender and all joint programmes have gender and environment as a cross cutting theme. The Ministry of Environment undertakes gender analysis of all environment projects. However, gender and climate change is a new strategy for the country and projects on energy ef\ufb01ciency or renewable energy have yet to identify gender components, though there are many entry points. 19 Climate change issues have traditionally been thought as being scienti\ufb01c in nature with technical solutions. However, as social considerations (and the realization that social issues are intricately linked with climate change) in\ufb01ltrate this narrow conception, such beliefs are slowly being altered to re\ufb02ect a more complete and realistic re\ufb02ection of the climate change paradigm. Economically depressed women living in rural areas in LDC\u2019s are disproportionately affected by climate change, as they are highly dependent on natural resources for their livelihoods. But women are not given adequate roles, and their contribution to climate change policies remain unrecognized. Carbon \ufb01nance generated from reductions in greenhouse gas emissions through the CDM represents a total of about $5.3 billion to date, of which only 2 percent goes towards the UNFCCC administered Adaptation Fund. Since the money that goes to adaptation is clearly insuf\ufb01cient, there should be more leverage and lobbying undertaken along with the promotion of women\u2019s participation in climate change decisions-making at all levels. There are opportunities to ensure women\u2019s participation in climate negotiations through partnerships, such as GGCA, or GEF and COP. UNDP should ensure that women participate in all dialogues on the generation of solutions for disaster risk management and con\ufb02ict prevention.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "426a9f66-a27c-45ed-b6bb-d7e67674de8f": {"__data__": {"id_": "426a9f66-a27c-45ed-b6bb-d7e67674de8f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-climate-change-impact-and-adaptation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender and Climate Change: Impact and Adaptation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-climate-change-impact-and-adaptation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2ccfc6bd36041773a6a3b3de05400760c22125887091f71b73e5fb9d0a81d84b"}, "2": {"node_id": "263b1398-f877-439e-a723-ff0550d15451", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-climate-change-impact-and-adaptation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "755bf89064fcd3c4031ca74040a75ed12b89952d71183ae75494c51c09ed6aca"}}, "hash": "2fd8eebbb75072347e777b4a4fca83971acc553300e5909281d68f77f4b31572", "text": "UNDP should strengthen national capacities in crisis-related gender analysis, including the incorporation of gender statistics into assessments of disaster risks, impacts and needs.

The paper had its origins in a bus conversation in Dhaka with a woman whose organization was working with rural women on a pilot project to cultivate an indigenous medicinal plant for local and, potentially, regional markets. She was un- familiar with intellectual property rights issues and concerned that her association, which had a mandate to advise the government on trade policy, was also unfamiliar with trade regimes. It was not apparent that the funder was aware of national, regional or international IP regimes which might have a bearing on the long-term viability of their project. No one seemed to be connecting the dots between a pilot project targeting women micro-entrepreneurs, Traditional Knowledge and intellectual property regimes on the one hand, and trade-related capacity building initiatives available for government officials and larger producers on the other. I am very grateful for the support, encouragement and patience of Yumiko Yamamoto and Bryn Gay at the UNDP Asia- Pacific Regional Centre in Colombo, and for helpful conversations with Russell Barsh, Philip Bird, Chantal Blouin, Tasmin Rajotte, and Ann Weston.

By 2003 WTO members had reached an agreement to allow countries that produce generic drugs to export them to poor countries that have no capacity to manufacture generics. The move responded to evidence (and strong civil society campaign- ing) that patent protection under TRIPS for essential pharmaceutical drugs was having the effect of increasing prices and reducing access to essential medicines, in particular, to drugs that treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired ImmunoDeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), tuberculosis and malaria (Blouin 2006). There has been less progress in inter- national discussions on a TRIPS issue affecting another public health question of particular concern to developing countries: intellectual property (IP) on traditional medicinal knowl- edge2 (TMK) or \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d.3 Traditional medicine, which relies heavily on natural remedies based on natural products, provides an important kind of primary health- care system in poor countries, particularly in rural areas, where access to Western biomedi- cine4 is limited or prohibitively expensive. Medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) are an essential part of traditional healthcare systems, constituting an accessible, affordable INTRODUCTION and culturally appropriate source of primary healthcare for more than 80 percent of Asia\u2019s population (WHO 2003). In China, traditional herbal preparations account for 30-50 percent of the total medicinal consumption (ibid.). Traditional medicine is widely used in India, particularly in rural areas; Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha, naturopathy, homeopathy and yoga are recognized by the Government of India under the Central Council of Indian Medicine Act (1970) (WHO 2001, p. 132). Seventy percent of Indonesia\u2019s rural population relies on tradi- tional medicine; more births are attended by traditional birth attendants than by allopathic practitioners. Indonesia also has an important traditional medicine industry: At the end of 1999, there were 723 manufacturers of tradi- tional medicine, 92 of which were large-scale industries (ibid., p. 134). In Bangladesh, almost 80 percent of the rural population is dependent on medicinal plants for their primary health- care.5 Traditional medicine dates as far back as 500 AD in Nepal, and Ayurvedic medicine is widely practiced: More than 75 percent of the population uses traditional medicine (WHO 2001, p. 137). Seventy percent of Sri Lanka\u2019s rural population relies on traditional and natu- ral medicine for their primary healthcare (ibid., 139). The Republic of Korea and Viet Nam have integrated traditional medicine into all areas of healthcare provision; India, Indonesia and Sri Lanka have national policies on traditional medicine (WHO 2002, pp. 8-10). Medicinal plants are also important sources of livelihoods for millions of rural people in South and Southeast Asia, particu- larly women, indigenous peoples and people living in poverty. Traditional knowledge (TK) associated with medicinal herbs and cultiva- tion, innovation and preservation of medicinal herbs is a highly gendered activity in most 6 countries. In many cultures, women and men take on complementary roles and responsibili- ties in TMK, roles that are not presently well reflected in mainstream policy discussions. While there is considerable debate on the merit of including intellectual property rights (IPRs) at all in the WTO6, at present, members are ob- ligated under their commitments to TRIPS to provide minimum standards of protection for intellectual property rights either by enacting new legislation or amending existing national laws.

While demand has risen, inequitable trade practices have meant that only a small portion of the profits trickle down to collectors and harvesters. Concerns include recognition of the intellectual property rights of traditional users and biopiracy7 (il- legal or unethical \u201cbioprospecting\u201d8). Thus, unresolved intellectual property issues may present an access problem for the historical holders of traditional medicinal knowledge: \u201cincreasingly, it appears that knowledge of traditional medicine (TM) is being appropri- ated, adapted and patented by scientists and industry, with little or no compensation to its original custodians, and without their informed consent\u201d (UNCTAD 2000). There are two key, related concerns: (1) people who depend on traditional medicine may lose access to medicinal plants and the as- sociated knowledge if the plants are patented by pharmaceutical companies; (2) over-har- vesting of commercially valuable medicinal plants in their natural environment could result in their extinction9, with both healthcare and livelihoods impacts for indigenous and rural peoples. Loss of plant biodiversity also jeopardizes traditional knowledge: If there is no habitat to support plants and indigenous or rural populations, the cultural and traditional medicinal knowledge will disappear. There is a fairly extensive and diverse literature on IPRs and traditional knowledge, reflecting the many debates about the role IPRs might play in the preservation or commercial exploitation of TK, conservation of biodiversity, protection of indigenous peoples\u2019 rights, and public health systems. IP issues are discussed in many international forums with overlap- ping interests (see Box 3). This paper examines the discussion on intellectual property rights for traditional knowledge in medicine from a gender perspective. The growing literature on gender and trade has identified how trade policies can have different implications for men and women that are linked to gender-based differences in social and economic activities, access to productive resources and decision- making. Worldwide, women and men tend to be employed in different sectors (e.g., women are more likely than men to be employed in producing handicrafts and garments) or in dif- ferent activities in similar sectors (e.g., women in some developing countries are more likely to grow staple foods for local markets than crops for export)10. A gender analysis adds 7 to our understanding of how trade decisions can have important and unintended impacts on the lives of disempowered peoples. Trade institutions and trade policy-making processes are rarely inclusive of the interests of small economic players, including rural, indigenous or ethnic groups, and gender concerns are even less well understood and addressed. Govern- ments have international obligations to protect and advance women\u2019s economic activities un- der CEDAW11, the International Covenant on Economic, Social, Cultural and Political Rights, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Millennium Development Goals and other human rights conventions as well as trade commitments; however, these obligations rarely factor in na- tional trade policy discussions. The paper draws on the limited litera- ture on gender dimensions of IP and TK, which highlights the roles played by women, particu- larly indigenous women, as custodians of TK and as consumers and producers of traditional medicines. The second section addresses the question: What is being protected by IPRs? The following section summarizes current discus- sions on intellectual property and traditional medicinal knowledge (TMK) in TRIPS and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Many countries are taking steps to develop na- tional legislation to protect and promote their TK; however, there are growing concerns about the constraints that may be placed on govern- ments as a result of \u201cTRIPS-plus\u201d conditions within regional and bilateral trade agreements. IPRs in the area of TK are discussed in many international forums, and \u201cforum shopping\u201d appears to be a strategy adopted by some countries to obviate the push for accepting a stringent IP regime. The paper concludes with some suggestions for developed and develop- ing countries to orient the focus of discussions on IP and TK more closely to health concerns. Policy measures should be more consistent with the Doha directive, by adopting a rights-based approach in order to better address gender concerns than do current trade models. This strategy would imply a more bottom-up ap- proach to international rule-making, in which traditional and community governance mecha- nisms would be better reflected in national and international IP regimes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8463ee8c-0d87-4983-95b5-6bd94252232f": {"__data__": {"id_": "8463ee8c-0d87-4983-95b5-6bd94252232f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-dimensions-intellectual-property-and-traditional-medicinal-knowledge", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender Dimensions of Intellectual Property and Traditional Medicinal Knowledge", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-dimensions-intellectual-property-and-traditional-medicinal-knowledge", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1897b4b3e29cb448a04155f68771de899aba1ad02938e36d1ce6b8e23f3ff1f6"}, "2": {"node_id": "23d1de46-7e7c-4899-8567-1c238c24fc5b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-dimensions-intellectual-property-and-traditional-medicinal-knowledge", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9f14650faa518965717509f98e6b30ecbc5f55f25d3b6655f4eac8ddb4163de2"}}, "hash": "0e9d43eef2db530230c946edf08eae9ab760c453f973d244fd7d131cfe346e9a", "text": "8 Women\u2019s traditional roles as keepers of biodi- versity are widely recognized and reflected in several international plans of action and orga- nizations concerned with biodiversity, health and food security, including: \u2022 The Convention on Biological Diversity Preamble affirms the central role of women drawing specific attention to \u201cthe need for the full participation", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "575619a6-6a33-4c6b-940d-dc1f333f1e1a": {"__data__": {"id_": "575619a6-6a33-4c6b-940d-dc1f333f1e1a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-dimensions-intellectual-property-and-traditional-medicinal-knowledge", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender Dimensions of Intellectual Property and Traditional Medicinal Knowledge", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-dimensions-intellectual-property-and-traditional-medicinal-knowledge", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "241a766cf8e4b8e2857b75204467d7a65bfc75538315d54a4aa0aebe4b1f314e"}, "3": {"node_id": "b64840da-c294-4928-a777-8de6ecf463c7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-dimensions-intellectual-property-and-traditional-medicinal-knowledge", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a765b76d1ebb829e8dfc68562d314d336a80a8c9e3e2ff67478c3876f9f84268"}}, "hash": "9adf9af5f607a85f58a686cd4888d974e92c3f6dd55a423e259f8fb17e7b77ef", "text": "of women at all levels of policy-making and implementation for biologi- cal diversity conservation\u201d.12 \u2022 Agenda 21, adopted at the Earth Sum- mit, Rio de Janeiro, 1992, stresses the need to strengthen women\u2019s involvement in national ecosystem management and control of envi- ronmental degradation. \u2022 The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has drawn attention to the different roles that men and women maintain within livelihoods systems that comprise farms and home gardens, common property resources, such as pastures and forested lands, as well as protected areas. In addition to pro- viding vegetables, these home gardens are also experimental plots where women try out and adapt diverse wild plant and indigenous spe- cies.13 There are gender dimensions to the impacts of processes of globalization on tra- ditional medicine, to the knowledge itself, and to strategies governments adopt to take advantage of booming markets for traditional medicine. Some of the adverse effects of pro- cesses of globalization and trade liberalization on traditional knowledge in medicine include the introduction of imported foods as a result of tariff reductions that impact on and may diminish the use of local varieties of plants; WOMEN AND TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE IN MEDICINE the introduction of alien species for commer- cial farming that out-compete or contaminate indigenous herbs and medicinal plants; and, shifts to market-oriented agriculture that erode the roles and knowledge systems of indigenous women in agricultural production. Unsustain- able levels of harvesting have raised concerns about the long-term viability of natural ecosys- tems which support medicinal plants and the livelihoods of traditional knowledge-holders. These medicinal herbs are an important source of both income and medicine for poor people, especially women.14 In most countries, proportionately more women are engaged in agricultural activities than men (ILO [n.d.]; FAO [n.d.]). In many regions, women and men perform different, complementary roles in cultivating, harvesting and using medicinal plants, however, quanti- tative and qualitative data describing women\u2019s specific roles in collecting, growing or market- ing medicinal herbs are difficult to obtain. This level of detail is not included in labour force data, which in any event tend to under-report the significance of women\u2019s economic activities in labour markets and agriculture, since much of this activity takes place outside the realm of the market. Studies15 suggest that in most countries, there are well-defined gender roles in agricul- ture and biodiversity management, although these vary across regions and cultures. In many cultures, women and men have different knowledge of medicinal plants which is linked to the division of labour. In many rural-based and indigenous communities, women play key roles in delivery of informal healthcare alternatives based on medicinal plants.16 Poli- cies and initiatives that ignore gender dimen- sions of traditional knowledge in medicine can 9 have serious implications, as one World Bank report concludes: \u201cAs a result of this gender differentiation and specialization, the [tradi- tional medicinal] knowledge and skills held by women often differ from those held by men, affecting patterns of access, use and control, while resulting in different perceptions and priorities for the innovation and use of Indig- enous Knowledge (IK). It also impacts the way in which IK is disseminated, documented and passed on to future generations\u201d (Pidatala and Rahman Khan 2003). Some studies17 document women\u2019s roles in local knowledge systems, however, despite the recognition of gender in the CBD and other agreements, the literature review conducted for this paper found that case studies setting out women\u2019s roles in TMK and gender analyses of TK in the English lan- guage were limited, and virtually non-existent in the IP literature. This \u201cinvisibility\u201d persists in technical and scientific research, where women\u2019s knowledge and roles, responsibilities and management practices for the conservation and improvement of animal and plant genetic resources tend not to be recognized.18 Many governments in South Asia have targeted non-timber forest products (NTFP) and medicinal herbs for development, as sources of livelihoods for rural people and as export commodities. In Bangladesh, for example, the government has encouraged production of medicinal plants.

A South African study found that the ethnobotanical knowledge of Zulu women enabled them to substitute the bark of plentiful trees which had similar scents and medicinal properties for the bark of a scarce tree (Siles [n.d]). The International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), which houses the Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Pro- gram in Asia (MAPPA), is engaged in research and pilot projects to promote community- based sustainable development of MAPS and non-timber forest products.21 Box 1: Women and Medicinal Plants in Asia These examples are a non-exhaustive list of the roles that women carry in the cultivation of medicinal plants in Asia, and they are rep- resentative of the multitude of women\u2019s and community initiatives throughout the Asia- Pacific region: \u2022 Bangladesh: Women account for about 45 percent of total employment in agriculture. The NGO Development of Biotechnology and Environmental Conservation Center (DEBTEC) has encouraged women to cul- tivate backyard home gardens of medicinal plant, both as a strategy to protect endan- gered species and to empower women through plant cultivation that will provide a source of earnings.22 The Government of Bangladesh has advocated farmers to grow 10 more medicinal plants to meet both local de- mand and enter export markets: At present, most medicinal plants are gathered from the wild. According to one report (Hossain 2005), the government plans to provide farmers with plants from its nurseries at low cost and give farmers soft loans to cover the cost of cultivating them (Hossain 2005; SciDev.net [n.d.]).23 \u2022 Bhutan: Gender roles are not rigidly as- signed, and women and men can take over each other\u2019s tasks. According to an FAO Sustainable Development Dimensions re- port [n.d. (c)]24 about 45 percent of medicinal plant collectors are women. The government is systematically developing the traditional medicines sector. The South Asia Develop- ment Facility (SEDF) also is collaborating with the National Women\u2019s Association of Bhutan in a pilot project training women in rural communities to cultivate medicinal herbs to create employment and build SME capacity (IFC SEDF 2005). \u2022 India has a rich tradition of indigenous med- icine (i.e., Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, Amchi) and many traditions of \u201cethno-medicine\u201d (Pidatala and Rahman Khan 2003). Because women are more likely to have family care responsibilities, they tend to be primary practitioners of this indigenous knowledge. A World Bank (2006) study found that a vast majority of community folk healers (\u201cNaitivaidyas\u201d) are women. As well, with large numbers of young men migrating from rural to urban areas, women are becoming responsible for main- taining indigenous knowledge of traditional medicine in rural areas. A number of case studies have illus- trated the different roles of women and men in collecting NTFP, including medicinal plants. The different roles and responsibili- ties of men and women vis-\u00e0-vis forests and the concomitant social and economic conse- quences for tribal households at large, and women in particular, are considerable (FAO [n.d.]).25 According to studies in Uttar Pradesh, women derive a greater proportion of their income from forests and common lands; poor women derive 45 percent of their in- come from forests and common lands as op- posed to 13 percent for men (FAO & SIDA 1991; Yadama, Pragada, and Pragada 1997). \u2022 Nepal: It is mostly women who collect herbs and wild vegetables in Nepal. While sex-disaggregated data is limited, a 2002 Gender Budget Audit in Nepal reported that when unwaged labour is included in the labour force statistics, 56 percent of cur- rently employed women (aged 15 years and older) are engaged in agriculture.

One survey in the Utror-Gabral Valley in the northwestern part of the District of Swat found that the \u201cwomen folk of the area provide the most valuable source of indigenous knowledge of medicinal plants (Hamayun, Khan & Be- gum [n.d.]). Another study found that tribal women and children collect 90 percent of the medicinal herbs and all drying is done by women. About 71 percent of medicinal herbs are sold by women and children, and 29 percent by men.29 \u2022 Sri Lanka: Over 600 species have been used as medicinal plants, since Ayurveda is widely practiced in Sri Lanka. The demand for medicinal plants for Ayurvedic pre- scriptions and pharmaceutical companies is largely met from natural plant resources. There are concerns about the impacts of over-harvesting on rural women, who are collectors and vendors, as well as about the availability of local medicinal plants to sup- ply domestic health needs. \u201cHome gardens\u201d play an important conservation role, with women playing a key role by first identify- ing the economic value of these plants for food, medicine, and other uses, and later domesticating them. Some studies suggest that new farming practices and the emer- gence of the market economy have played an important role in altering gender roles and reducing the position of women to that of farm labour, away from their historical roles as planners and managers (FAO [n.d. (b)]). \u2022 Viet Nam: Agriculture employs 57 percent of the labour force, but one-half of men and two-thirds of women in rural areas primar- ily earn their living in agriculture; almost all new employees to the sector are women. In particular, ethnic minorities are engaged in agricultural biodiversity and traditional knowledge (Twarog & Kapoor (eds.) 2004; Jha (ed.) [n.d.]).30 Viet Nam has integrated traditional medicine into its national health- care system, and TMK is viewed as a signifi- cant national resource. Despite their heavy participation in agriculture, ethnic women are less likely to have tenure security over the land. For many ethnic groups, inheri- tance customs that pass down land patri- lineally, and women\u2019s lack of awareness of their legal rights, exacerbate the situation (World Bank 2006, pp. 4-6). 12 Discussion of the role that intellectual prop- erty regimes play in protecting traditional knowledge raises the question of what is being \u201cprotected\u201d and for what purpose. In trade regimes, IPRs mean that the owner of a pat- ent, copyright, trademark or some other type of intellectual property has the legal right to exclude others from using or reproducing it. A different view is \u201cprotection\u201d in the sense of safeguarding the continued existence and de- velopment of TK. The Philippines\u2019 Traditional and Alternative Medicines Act defines IPRs as \u201cthe legal basis by which the indigenous com- munities exercise their rights to have access to, protect, control over their cultural knowledge and products, including but not limited to, traditional medicines, and includes the right to receive compensation for it.\u201d31 Some North American indigenous peoples\u2019 organizations have emphasized that ownership of all traditional knowledge col- lected from Elders and healers belongs to the communities, and have expressed apprehen- sion about non-indigenous governments regu- lating traditional medicine (Martin Hill 2003). Some analysts have drawn attention to how colonial influences have marginalized indig- enous women\u2019s roles in traditional medicine and ceremonies, a marginalization that may be further perpetuated in appeals to \u201ctradition\u201d. M\u00e9tis women in Canada testifying to the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples noted that: \u201c\u2026tradition is invoked by most politi- cians in defence of certain choices. Women must always ask \u2013 Whose tradition? Is \u2018tradi- tion\u2019 beyond critique? How often is tradition cited to advance or deny our women\u2019s posi- tions?\u201d32 Most national governments have rati- fied CEDAW and other human rights conven- tions that set out and protect women\u2019s rights, but these guarantees are not yet mainstreamed in trade forums.

It is difficult for herbal medicines to meet all the requirements for patentability for the following reasons: \u2022 Herbal medicines are crude plant materials, thus, not eligible for patent law protection as products that involve the discovery of new chemical entities must be novel, in- volve an inventive step, and be industrially applicable; \u2022 Production processes for herbal products are created using simple methods and do not involve any invention that requires a novel or complicated enough step to justify protection under existing patent laws; WHAT DO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REGIMES \u201cPROTECT\u201d? 13 \u2022 Holders of TK such as research institutes and practitioners usually do not have the financial and human resources necessary to obtain protection through intellectual prop- erty rights; \u2022 It is difficult to keep traditional knowledge a secret because disclosure of the composi- tion of the product is a prerequisite for the registration of herbal medicines before the product can be sold; \u2022 It is prohibitively expensive for traditional practitioners as well as research institutions in developing countries to acquire, exercise and enforce patent rights in most countries, particularly if international coverage is re- quired.36 While discussion on the international legal frameworks has intensified, not all ob- servers agree that formal intellectual property rights regimes are the most appropriate way to \u201cprotect\u201d this knowledge, particularly me- dicinal knowledge which is critical for impov- erished communities. Some analysts suggest that extension of ownership rights through intellectual products could expedite the very processes that contribute to the appropriation and erosion of indigenous knowledge resourc- es. IPRs may, under certain circumstances, assist traditional medicine holders to obtain monetary compensation for their knowledge. However, by their very monopolistic nature IPRs may restrict the diffusion of sacred, pro- tected knowledge, thereby potentially reduc- ing access and imposing costs on communities, as follows37: \u2022 Formal IPR systems extend to indigenous knowledge mechanisms, which generally are collective in orientation, but IPR systems predominantly reward individual effort. Thus, as TK resources become commercially valuable, individual incentives to cheat could increase, undermining any newly devised collective institutions; \u2022 The incorporation of TK under a system of patents and copyrights strengthens material forces that potentially deplete the resources and strengths of indigenous peoples; \u2022 Commodification of TK situates TK within a world system of mass-production and resource management, rather than valuing indigenous knowledge as important to cul- tural heritages; \u2022 If herbal medicines are patented, the medicines that are used as the predominant resources for healthcare by people living in poverty may become unaffordable. 14 Trade in Medicinal and Aromatic Plants is Big Business Adaptations of traditional medicine, known as complementary and alternative medicine,38 are big businesses. According to the WHO (2003), 70 percent of Canadians have used comple- mentary medicine at least once; the figure for Germany is 90 percent. Medicinal and aromatic plants and traditional medicine are big busi- nesses: Globally, sales of herbal medicines are estimated to have exceeded US$12.5 billion in 1994 to US$30 billion in 2000. Annual growth rates of this sector average between 5 percent and 15 percent, depending on the region. In 2000, the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity reported that the world market for herbal medicines, including herbal products and raw materials, was US$60 billion (Zhang 2000). World trade in medicinal plants and related products is forecast to reach US$5 trillion by the year 2050 (Gupta 2005, p. 45). It is difficult to assess global trade in all medicinal plants, as a substantial part of this trade is not recorded. In addition, official trade statistics either do not identify the plants indi- vidually, or they do not separate their medici- nal use from other usage. The value imports by the world\u2019s top importer of medicinal plants39, the United States, from all countries rose from US$136.9 billion in 2001 to US$174.7 billion in 2005, with China and India supplying the largest percentage (i.e., China in 2001 supplied 26 percent; in 2005 it supplied 28 percent; in 2001, India supplied 27.5 percent and in 2005, 17 percent).

The turnover of export and import com- modities, including NTFPs, has increased by 15 to 30 percent each year.44 Intellectual Property and Traditional Medi- cine The international legal framework to protect TK includes the TRIPS Agreement, which allows patents to be granted on biological materials and indigenous knowledge, and the Convention on Biological Diversity, which acknowledges the rights of states over their bio-resources and indigenous knowledge. Most biodiversity-rich countries are located in the global South, while technology-rich coun- tries with resources to develop biodiversity are based primarily in the North. Before the CBD codified the sovereignty of nations over their biodiversity, it was considered \u201cthe common heritage of men\u201d; that is, in the public domain (Moran 1999). TRIPS and CBD address the overlapping and possibly conflicting interests 15 of different domains: TRIPS addresses private rights, according monopoly rights and benefits to private interests, while the CBD provides for sharing benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources. At the WTO Ministerial in Doha, the TRIPS Council was instructed to examine the relationship between IPR provisions within the TRIPS Agreement and the CBD, taking full account of the developmental perspective. At the same time, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), through its Intergov- ernmental Committee on Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore (referred to as the \u201cIGC\u201d) began work on both policy issues at the international level as well as work on some practical link- ages between the IP system and concerns of practitioners and custodians of TK.42 In 2006 the WIPO Provisional Committee for Propos- als Related to a Development Agenda (PCDA) recommended that WIPO take on a key role in technical cooperation, given WIPO\u2019s orienta- tion on the implementation and enforcement of IP obligations. Other international instruments involved in the IP treatment of traditional knowledge in medicinal plants include the In- ternational Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, the International Union for the Protection of new Varieties of Plants (UPOV), established by the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants,46 the World Health Organization (WHO), and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).47 Box 2: Intellectual Property Rights and Tradi- tional Medicinal Knowledge A number of unresolved intellectual property issues remain: \u2022 Limited recognition of the importance of TK as a source of food and healthcare for a large proportion of people in developing countries. \u2022 Inadequate acknowledgement of the rapid pace at which TK is being lost due to envi- ronmental degradation and loss of habitats, which are sometimes linked to the expan- sion of market-oriented agriculture and over-harvesting of wild plants. \u2022 Asymmetry between the benefits obtained by companies, usually from developed countries that commercially exploit prod- ucts derived from TK, and lack of benefits for the TK holders. \u2022 Misappropriation (\u201cbio-piracy\u201d of TK, then using patents and other intellectual prop- erty rights without prior, informed consent from originators and traditional knowledge holders). 16 Box 3: International Forums Intellectual property rights involve many inter- national forums which can help to resolve the outstanding issues for equitably and sustain- ably protecting traditional knowledge: \u2022 Convention on Biological Diversity and the International Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agricul- ture (IPGRA) (FAO International Treaty) relates to issues on conservation and the sustainable use of biodiversity.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5db40f5c-bc04-41b5-a349-1d3370dbdb51": {"__data__": {"id_": "5db40f5c-bc04-41b5-a349-1d3370dbdb51", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-dimensions-intellectual-property-and-traditional-medicinal-knowledge", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender Dimensions of Intellectual Property and Traditional Medicinal Knowledge", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-dimensions-intellectual-property-and-traditional-medicinal-knowledge", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a1680ead626128a6092bc3cb7ea8aef01d1edf9f3d2505aaeca3950d8e55ad9f"}, "2": {"node_id": "f6065de8-73aa-4b48-a2f7-350be439a54b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-dimensions-intellectual-property-and-traditional-medicinal-knowledge", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "778963e353af13ea0429f7483c1b3940433fec12246240dc171526b898801e93"}}, "hash": "1bd213f3fb89a597445f9f4e8880065b317ac8d4fcdb9d1c72b06a32fe8afd23", "text": "\u2022 International Covenant on Economic, So- cial and Cultural Rights of the United Na- tions: The General Comment No.14 (GC 14) of the Covenant defines the right to health as the \u201cright to the enjoyment of a variety of facilities, goods, services and conditions necessary for the realization of the highest attainable standard of health.\u201d48 \u2022 The International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants49 (UPOV Convention) is silent on the subject of TK, but its provisions are relevant to protection of the interests of small farmers and local communities.

By making this connection, the WHO has examined the relationships between intellectual property rights, innovation and public health (WHO 2006). \u2022 World Intellectual Property Organiza- tion (WIPO)51: Prior to TRIPS, WIPO had exclusive oversight and competence in IP matters. Its mandate is to harmonize the international patent system. WIPO engages in IP discussions with several organizations, including UNEP (which houses the CBD Secretariat) particularly on the role of IPRs in benefit-sharing (Gupta 2005). \u2022 WTO TRIPS outlines the global rules on intellectual property rights. 17 The TRIPS Agreement covers seven types of intellectual property rights: patents, Geo- graphical Indications, copyright, trademarks, trade secrets (undisclosed information), indus- trial designs, and layout-designs of integrated circuits. TRIPS does not acknowledge or distin- guish between indigenous, community-based knowledge and that of industry; according to Kibet A. Ng\u2019etich (2005) it does not make refer- ence to the protection of traditional knowledge. One contentious issue is Article 27.3(b) on pat- ent protection on \u201clife forms\u201d, which requires WTO members to provide patent protection on micro-organisms as well as non-biological and micro-biological processes. Members are required to provide for protection on plant varieties either by granting patents or by using \u201can effective sui generis system\u201d. The TRIPS Article calls for a review of Article 27.3(b), by the TRIPS Council, a review broadened by the Doha Declaration to include strengthening the relationship between TRIPS and CBD on the protection of traditional knowledge and folklore. The debate has cen- tred on the extent to which TRIPS is supportive of or runs counter to the principles in the CBD. According to some analysts, TRIPS \u201cpaves the way for the privatization of biological resources\u201d by allowing patents to be granted on biological materials and associated indig- enous knowledge, and it pressures developing countries to increase levels of protection based on standards developed by and for developed countries.52 There also are ethical, social and environmental concerns about patenting life forms. In the lead-up to the Doha Ministerial, developing countries had lobbied for incorpo- rating CBD principles within TRIPS that rec- ognize the authority of governments to grant access to genetic resources, subject to prior informed consent (PIC), on mutually agreed terms, with fair and equitable benefit-sharing, including with respect to TK. Most developed countries opposed this proposal. Since Doha there has been considerable discussion within the TRIPS Council; however, the North-South divide between the technology-rich developed countries, and bio-diversity rich developing countries persists.53 Some areas of flexibility within TRIPS have been identified that could afford protec- tion for traditional medicine, including: \u2022 Special and Differential Treatment (SDT) TRIPS contains almost no significant differences in rules for developing countries, LDCs and developed countries, maintaining a \u201cone size fits all\u201d with respect to minimum rules for IPR protection in patents, trademarks and copyright, except that the timing of imple- mentation of the rules differs. One measure that has been advocated is that WTO members should have the right to adopt any effective sui generis system which is compatible with their TRIPS obligations (Michalopoulos 2003).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f72354f3-2ce4-411c-946d-5a3af100a498": {"__data__": {"id_": "f72354f3-2ce4-411c-946d-5a3af100a498", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-dimensions-intellectual-property-and-traditional-medicinal-knowledge", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender Dimensions of Intellectual Property and Traditional Medicinal Knowledge", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-dimensions-intellectual-property-and-traditional-medicinal-knowledge", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e91845c39c408835e6720ed13efa465988e504be533c55ff58c0993dfc741a2c"}, "2": {"node_id": "9002bbe3-9763-461e-9802-3daf1841c002", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-dimensions-intellectual-property-and-traditional-medicinal-knowledge", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f3e4e7f86dd3baea0a3457550652afa4c7665752627e118b33453e5627c588d4"}}, "hash": "3567fb94c56a1a6fb84735245e8bc82a4641388af4cce50f0ebf7d747883cc68", "text": "There are also two non-legally binding provisions in- volving commitments by developed countries to promote technology transfers and technical and financial assistance to developing coun- tries. \u2022 Sui Generis Systems Article 27.3(b) requires the protection of plant varieties through patent laws or through effective sui generis systems.

UPOV represents one standard of protection that is mainly used by developed countries and some developing countries. Yet as the UPOV system has evolved, it has resulted in more and more restrictive interpretations of farmers\u2019 rights which many critics say are more appropriate to corporate farms in developed countries than to the traditional knowledge and practices prevalent in most developing countries. In addition, some preferential, free trade arrangements between developed and de- veloping countries have reduced the flexibility in Article 27.3(b) by requiring participating de- veloping countries to adopt a particular system of plant protection, typically UPOV 1991. This later version of UPOV sets higher standards for patent protection than TRIPS (i.e., includes TRIPS-plus measures). Cambodia, China, and Viet Nam are several countries that have been required to adopt UPOV 1991 standards as part of the terms of their WTO accession. \u2022 Disclosure of Source of Origin IP protection in the international trad- ing system could require mandatory disclo- sure of the source of genetic resources and associated TK in applications for patents and plant variety rights, through an amendment to TRIPS Article 29. This Article could incorpo- rate mandatory disclosure, assess whether the collection of information used prior informed consent, and ensure equitable benefit-sharing (Connolly-Stone & Correa 2003). This approach has been proposed by Brazil, China, Cuba, In- dia, Pakistan, Peru, Tanzania, and Thailand at the WTO TRIPS Council. \u2022 TK and Geographical Indications Some IP analysts advocate expanding the scope of Article 23 of TRIPS to strengthen the protection of Geographical Indications. The TRIPS Council has been considering whether protection afforded under TRIPS to Geographi- cal Indications54 should be increased through either the establishment of an international register of protected indications or through the extension of additional protection currently available for wines and spirits to other prod- ucts. Movement forward in the Doha Devel- opment Round, however, has been limited to discussion on wines and spirits. \u2022 Exclusions to Patentability This discussion aims to incorporate into domestic patent laws all the exclusions to patentability that are allowed under TRIPS Article 27. This move could involve excluding plants and animals from patentability (but not micro-organisms). It also encourages countries to adopt an expansive interpretation of the ex- clusions in Article 27.2, which allow Members to exclude patentability of inventions when it is necessary to protect public order and moral- ity, including the protection of human, animal or plant life, and to avoid serious damages to the environment (Connolly-Stone 2004). Currently, WTO members are divided on whether to include a mandatory require- ment to disclose the source of origin of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge while applying for a patent. If such a require- ment is included, the TRIPS Council would continue discussions on the modalities for prior informed consent and benefit-sharing. 19 BILATERAL TRADE AND INVESTMENT AGREEMENTS Although one of the main reasons developing countries accepted the TRIPS Agreement dur- ing the Uruguay Round was the expectation that they would not be subject to bilateral pres- sures on IPRs by developed countries, bilateral and regional trade and investment agreements between developed and developing countries often include mutual commitments to imple- ment intellectual property regimes that go beyond TRIPS\u2019 minimum standards (Vivas- Eugui 2003).

Considerable work has been conducted in the CBD Working Group on Article 8(j) to support sui generis systems that recognize cus- tomary law. Many countries have introduced such legislation to protect traditional knowl- edge and promote traditional medicine.58 Examples include the Philippines\u2019 Traditional and Alternative Medicine Act, passed in 1997, which established the Philippine Institute of Traditional and Alternative Health Care and a Traditional and Alternative Health Care De- velopment Fund.59 India recognizes customary law as well. The Government of India has de- cided to protect its TK and folklore by creating a public database that catalogues traditional herbal medicines, plants and yoga practices. The database constitutes a state of prior art and is intended to be a deterrent to potential bio- pirates. It is a legally valid form of sui generis protection for TK. Information is available in English, French, German, Japanese, and Span- ish. However, there are limits to the database approach: In addition to the cost and acces- sibility factors for marginalized groups, some communities refuse to provide their TK, or they provide incomplete information because they believe that storing TK in a database sepa- rates their TK from traditional systems, which govern access to that knowledge.60 In addition, there are concerns about how inclusive such databases can be for women\u2019s TK, where their knowledge is not well documented or may not well represent women\u2019s voices. 20 In Thailand, traditional knowledge is protected in two laws: The Plant Variety Pro- tection Act (1999) and the Act on the Protection and Promotion of Thai Traditional Medicinal Intelligence.61 The Acts include access and benefit-sharing arrangements and measures for prior informed consent, and they are being implemented in stages. The Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand provides for the rights of communities to continue their traditional practices, inclusive of resource management. Extensive negotiations involving communities, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other stakeholders have been underway on a Community Forests Act which attempts to bal- ance traditional utilization and custodianship of local environment with broader conservation objectives. This process is seen as an important step towards securing broader community rights. Thailand may be the first country to have conducted a human rights impact assess- ment of a proposed bilateral trade agreement (the Thai-United States Free Trade Agreement [FTA]). A study by the Thai Human Rights Commission found that demands made by the United States in bilateral negotiations on IP protection exceed those required by the TRIPS Agreement. The study found that US pressure on Thailand to remove patent exemptions on life forms under the FTA would be viewed by many Thais as an action that could accelerate biopiracy and further make existing Thai legis- lation partially or completely redundant.62 Under their bilateral trade agreements with the United States Jordan, Singapore and Viet Nam have been required to become UPOV signatories. One analysis of bilateral free trade agreements identifies a persisting North-South pattern in agreements: When negotiating with the United States, trade negotiators concerned about biopiracy try to put limits on when and how researchers and corporations can get patents on biodiversity or TK in the US. When the US is not involved, they carve out spaces to define their own legal systems of rights to traditional knowledge. The Bay of Bengal grouping of countries (BIMSTEC) adopted an FTA in 2004 and mem- bers are working together to develop systems of legal rights over biodiversity and traditional knowledge. Governments are looking into expanding their IP regimes to cover traditional knowledge. The draft ASEAN Framework Agreement on Access to Biological and Genetic Resources and Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits addresses potential problems that may emerge when biological resources are shared across borders (as many countries in Southeast Asia share ecosystems). One of its objectives is \u201cto accord recognition and protection to traditional knowledge of indigenous peoples and local communities, and to facilitate fair and equitable sharing of benefits with the said communities where traditional knowledge is utilized.\u201d63 The members of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAA- RC) also are working to develop systems of documenting local and indigenous knowledge in order to safeguard intellectual property.64 21 The CBD and TRIPS have overlapping views on private rights versus public rights, on the rights of indigenous communities versus the rights of pharmaceutical corporations, and on the rights of commercial breeders versus the rights of pri- vate or small-scale farmers.

The US patent on the use of turmeric was revoked in a high profile chal- lenge led by India\u2019s Centre for Scientific and Industrial Research.65 Signed at the 1992 Earth Summit, the CBD has three main goals: \u2022 The conservation of biological diversity, \u2022 The sustainable use of all components of biodiversity, and \u2022 The fair and equitable sharing of the benefits from the use of genetic resources. The CBD affirms that the state has sover- eign rights over its biological resources (Article 15), and explicitly calls for equitable sharing of any benefits arising from the use of these re- sources (Article 8(j)). The Convention does not address ownership of resources, which is to be determined at the national level in accordance with national legislation or practice. This area of potential conflict arises between indigenous peoples and some non-indigenous govern- ments that have declared that all resources, including TK, belong to the state. The three key elements of the CBD framework are:66 \u2022 The need to obtain the prior informed con- sent of the country of origin before obtaining access to resources; \u2022 The need for mutually agreed terms of access with the country of origin (and po- tentially with the direct providers of genetic resources such as individual holders or local communities); and \u2022 The importance of benefit-sharing; the obligation to share, in a fair and equitable way, benefits arising from the use of genetic resources with the party that provides those resources.67 The 2002 Bonn Guidelines on Access and Benefit-Sharing set out voluntary guidelines on how this framework is to be implemented. They include specific supports for indigenous and local interests, including calling on govern- ments to provide support measures to enhance indigenous and local communities\u2019 capacity to represent their interests at negotiations on access to genetic resources.68 Implementation of CBD commitments occurs through decisions from the Conference of the Parties (COP), the Convention\u2019s govern- ing body. The COP has set up ad hoc work- ing groups to carry out work and advise the COP on biosafety, on Article 8(j) and Related Provisions of the CBD, and on Access and Ben- efit-Sharing. While the CBD is an international treaty, national governments are responsible for its implementation, and COP decisions only constitute guidance to governments on how to implement their CBD commitments. In contrast, WTO commitments are legally bind- ing and disputes may be taken before a WTO dispute settlement mechanism. THE CONVENTION ON BIODIVERSITY 22 The CBD was the first international legal instrument to recognize the importance of traditional knowledge, recognize the useful- ness of TK, innovations and practices to their conservation (in contrast, an underlying notion in TRIPS is that TK involves a private right in areas such as micro-organisms and microbio- logical processes). CBD Article 16.5 states that contracting parties shall cooperate to ensure that IPRs are \u201csupportive of and do not run counter to\u201d the CBD\u2019s provisions. Article 22, however, states that the CBD\u2019s provisions do not affect the rights and obligations of countries to other \u201cexisting international agreements, except where the exercise of those rights and obligations would cause a serious damage or threat to biological diversity\u201d (Adhikari 2005, pp. 261-264). Unlike the WTO process, the CBD process provides space for indigenous peoples and other traditional knowledge holders to participate in and influence the CBD process. The 2005 Asian Regional Meeting on the Composite Report on Traditional Knowledge, for example, involved both governments and indigenous organizations. The report noted the erosion of complementary gender roles and loss of important roles and knowledge systems of indigenous women in agricultural produc- tion, labour and seed diversity that participants linked to globalization processes.69 23 The study of the TRIPS and CBD approaches to intellectual property and traditional knowledge highlights very different visions of \u201cprotecting\u201d TK: a \u201cbusiness\u201d vision and a \u201csustainability\u201d vision. The \u201cbusiness case\u201d is concerned with promoting innovation and commercialization of TK and emphasizes the need to protect tra- ditional knowledge and secure fair and equi- table sharing of benefits to be derived from the use of biodiversity and associated traditional medicine.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "22198b0c-1a25-4ef4-858e-62211ea79a57": {"__data__": {"id_": "22198b0c-1a25-4ef4-858e-62211ea79a57", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-dimensions-intellectual-property-and-traditional-medicinal-knowledge", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender Dimensions of Intellectual Property and Traditional Medicinal Knowledge", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-dimensions-intellectual-property-and-traditional-medicinal-knowledge", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eb6bcd79334c577324641acbd6f0d524bcd09746f502f76f65b3314aa9353f87"}, "2": {"node_id": "ca58f8fd-89ba-4bef-9b2b-49c528d37ef0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-dimensions-intellectual-property-and-traditional-medicinal-knowledge", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "188f2d757a3be8cd77031fd063b3a5eeae9c62c00170924511ed33288a15b3c3"}}, "hash": "7b395e2164a96801f9125537cb9d9580c66432e0101f6355b88fabe981dac125", "text": "Many governments interested in helping small-scale producers participate in potentially lucrative regional and international markets for traditional medicines and MAPs recognize the IPR issues for TK.

As women play key roles in TMK, trade development and promotion poli- cies and strategies need to address persisting gender-based barriers that constrain women from gaining income from their TK (for ex- ample, barriers to inheritance and ownership of property), and recognize as legitimate stakeholders in policy dialogues. Where deci- sion-making is based on institutional patterns on property rights that discriminate against women, women may not be defined as actors (Padmanabhan 2005). Inequalities between women and men and their different gender roles with respect to TK have generated different levels of access to medical plants and their genetic resources in many countries. These differences in turn af- fect legal and financial possibilities for women to negotiate benefit-sharing agreements. \u201cRecognition of gender roles and responsi- bilities contributes to a better understanding of women\u2019s roles in knowledge generation, care, harvesting, production and marketing of medicinal plants. This will promote a more equitable distribution of benefits derived from biodiversity and its genetic resources\u201d (Siles op cit.). The ILO/Commonwealth Secretariat\u2019s \u201cGender and TRIPS\u201d checklist offers some questions for policymakers (and donors) to consider that help ensure that gender dimen- sions are addressed in policy processes: \u2022 What are the mechanisms for recognizing, protecting and rewarding men\u2019s and wom- en\u2019s knowledge, innovation and practices? Are systematic processes established that identify women\u2019s contribution to this body of knowledge? \u2022 Are there accessible mechanisms in place for capacity-building and training for women to understand the IPR system?70 Most developing countries have not fully utilized flexibilities available under TRIPS. As the UK Commission noted, underutilization may be because of an informed decision not to do so, or because countries may be constrained by other commitments, such as within bilateral agreements, \u201c\u2026 or those in charge may not have been aware of other options available.\u201d The Commission recommended that devel- oped countries could take a positive step by \u201creview[ing] their policies in regional/bilateral commercial diplomacy with developing coun- tries so as to ensure that they do not impose on developing countries standards or timetables beyond TRIPS\u201d.71 The \u201csustainability case\u201d is concerned more with ensuring traditional users\u2019 con- tinued access to traditional medicines. This view is concerned with over-harvesting due CONCLUSIONS 24 to intensified local use or exploitation to meet export demand. A gender perspective high- lights women\u2019s and men\u2019s different and often complementary roles and responsibilities in TMK, different access to resources and the knowledge associated with those resources. Some governments recognize customary or tribal laws and systems of governance. A con- cern here is ensuring that equality obligations are respected in situations where customary law is gender-blind. ILO Convention 169, that clarifies that indigenous rights are superceded by fundamental human rights, provides guid- ance.72 While many governments have begun addressing IP protection for TK in national legislation, international protection is im- portant since national policies have limited effect beyond national borders. With so many international and national agencies involved in IP and TK, there is growing consensus that the most appropriate protection for traditional knowledge will have to be based on a com- bination of approaches. The analysis of ways forward at WTO and WIPO deliberations on IP and TK suggests that governments are engaging in \u201cforum shopping\u201d to get the best deal: Many developing countries consider the CBD most sympathetic to their perspective, but the WTO, with its broad membership and dispute settlement mechanism that has \u201cteeth\u201d is recommended in a recent UNCTAD study.73 Developed countries including the EU and US have argued that WIPO, which has technical expertise on IPRs, should be the main forum for establishing a consensus on a new global IP protection framework for TK. Some observers have questioned WIPO\u2019s ability to reflect the development concerns of developing countries given its tendency to emphasize the benefits of IP protection.74 One way forward might be to put a much higher priority on the public health dimensions of TK. The Doha Declaration on WTO members\u2019 rights to promote \u201cpublic health and \u2026 access to medicines for all\u201d ar- gues for a rights-based approach to IP and TK.

This approach would include space for women, in particular, indigenous women, to participate in and shape decisions at interna- tional forums. The CBD process, for example, is noticeably more inclusive of indigenous and tribal peoples than the WTO; however, in most countries, indigenous peoples\u2019 and women\u2019s organizations need resources, training and capacity-building to participate effectively in international policy forums. Groups participat- ing in international meetings also need the ca- pacity and resources to consult with their own communities.

In addition, the draft ASEAN Framework Agreement on Access to Biological and Genetic Resources and Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits defines traditional knowledge more simply as: \u201cknowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities relating to the use, properties, values and processes of any biological and genetic resource or any part thereof,\u201d (ASEAN Framework Agreement on Access to Biological and Genetic Resources and Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits, GRAIN 2000). 3According to the WHO (2001), \u201ctraditional medicine is the sum total of the knowledge, skills, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physi- cal and mental illness.\u201d The term \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d includes several components: a system of treatment that normally take a holistic approach; a source of knowledge about natural remedies that are effective and based on natural products; natural products that are an important source for discovering and isolating new modern medicines, and traditional medical practitioners who are an important part of the healthcare system in many developing countries. 4\u201cWestern medicine\u201d refers to what is also called \u201cconventional medicine\u201d, \u201cclinical medicine\u201d, or allo- pathic systems of medicine, as distinguished from other medicinal paradigms.

Moreover, it provides examples of good practices across the Asia-Pacific region where gender statistics are assisting in the creation of effective and long-term development solutions. In encouraging awareness about gender statistics and their usefulness in gender mainstreaming,1 the Guidance Note aims to increase understanding and encourage advocating for systemic production of official gender statistics and indicators. As defined by the Office of the Special Advisor on Gender Issues (OSAGI), \u2018gender\u2019 refers to \u201cthe social attributes and opportunities associated with being male and female\u201d as well as the relationships between these socially constructed identities.2 Because these categories are context-specific, time-specific and changeable, gender is an important criterion for socio-cultural analysis. The lack of sex-disaggregated data3 and statistics that make gender inequalities visible, especially around issues pertinent to inclusive and sustainable development, has resulted in an incomplete picture of women\u2019s economic, political and social situations in the Asia-Pacific region. At a time when many countries are making extra efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015, the importance Gender Statistics August 2014 What are Gender Statistics? Gender statistics are statistics that incorporate a combination of the following: \u2022Sex-disaggregated data; \u2022Data that reflect gender issues and inequalities; \u2022Data that highlight the realities and diversity of the lives of women and men; \u2022Data collected using methods and concepts that account for the gender biases present in traditional classification and collection methods. Source: http://unstats.un.org/unsd/genderstatmanual/What- are-gender-stats.ashx 2 GENDER STATISTICS of gender statistics needs to be re-emphasized as a tool by which MDG acceleration can be achieved. In regional and global discussions around the Post-2015 development framework, gender statistics and sex-disaggregated data have also been emphasized. Certainly, disadvantages that women and girls may face in various social, political and economic contexts are a major source of inequality, which is correlated with unequal human development.4 Sex-disaggregation of data is thus required for accurate reporting on MDG progress and is central to achieving all MDGs as well as addressing persisting and new gender inequalities.5 As a result, statistics have been crucial to the work of the United Nations on gender equality since the organization\u2019s inception. Specifically, in development programming, gender statistics are more important than ever, as they document the situation of women and men around the world, making it easier to raise awareness about inequalities between them and promote actionable change.6 The production of gender statistics is complex and entails disaggregating individual data by sex and other characteristics as well as collecting data on specific issues that affect one sex more than the other or that shed light on gender relations.7 Once produced, however, gender statistics are a necessary prerequisite for the systematic analysis of gender issues and the subsequent promotion of gender-equitable development processes.8 The successful production of sex-disaggregated data is a first step in creating more efficient, effective and sustainable development programs on a global scale. In 2005 the Commission on the Status of Women\u2019s (CSW) Report on the Forty-ninth Session noted that insufficient sex-disaggregated data was a barrier to measuring progress in achieving gender equality and promoting the empowerment of women as well as in \u2018effective policy formulation and programme design\u2019.9 While collection of sex- disaggregated data is a necessary, and often first, step toward providing gender-responsive statistics and data, on its own it is not enough to create gender-responsive statistics \u2013 further actions and changes are required. Gender sensitive content, definitions, data collection, compilation and analysis are also required in the planning and production of gender statistics. Women\u2019s contributions to the economy are often overlooked and not counted due to definitions of what counts as \u2018productive\u2019 labour, with women\u2019s unpaid care and reproductive work and over- representation in the informal sector leading to a statistical bias against women.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e212f5ea-a35c-4409-99b5-35ac7dfdff78": {"__data__": {"id_": "e212f5ea-a35c-4409-99b5-35ac7dfdff78", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidance-note-gender-statistics", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidance Note: Gender Statistics", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidance-note-gender-statistics", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "976fe442d04ff93cf0896dbbf41980464c9573dd42c1f5b04195fa8b0f12ab62"}, "2": {"node_id": "13dcc38b-e219-4de9-a378-7082e8962e5c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidance-note-gender-statistics", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7ed57dd39c79ac08a663216ffae4bba30b8acc518812c697c421f910520261bb"}}, "hash": "4b19a69d4840e2a13d8b6f1abb8250e0ce5006f2cb0da40f2ff225a9461d9d43", "text": "Moreover, in 2008, the CSW recognized the importance of developing gender-sensitive tools10 in building the capacity of various stakeholders for gender mainstreaming.11 In assessing the progress of gender mainstreaming efforts since the adoption of the Beijing Platform for Action in 1995,12 the lack of political will and commitment among governments and the scarce collection and usage of sex-disaggregated data, are seen as two of the main, persistent impediments to achieving gender equality.13 Gender inequalities often remain unaddressed because they are poorly defined and as a result are ignored by many policy makers and development planners.

As such, it recommended an expansion of the work of \u2018Indicators and information must be disaggregated; averages hide disparities and the recognition of disparities is essential for human rights-based programming\u2019 Recommendation 7, Asia-Pacific Human Development Report: Power, Voice and Rights, UNDP (2010). 3 GENDER STATISTICS the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on Gender Statistics to include: (a) reviewing gender statistics with the aim of establishing a minimum set of gender indicators; (b) guiding the development of manuals and methodological guidelines for the production and use of gender statistics; and (c) serving as the coordination mechanism for the global programme on gender statistics.14 In February and March 2013, following the recommendations of the Commission, an international minimum set of gender indicators was identified and started to be developed by experts from national statistical systems and international agencies, who intended it to be a common basic set of indicators across countries and regions, for the national production and international compilation of gender statistics. The international minimum set of 52 developed by the Inter-Agency and Expert Group is included here in the boxed text: Minimum Set of Gender Indicators, By Domain. 15 The minimum set of gender indicators covers all of the areas highlighted in the 1995 Beijing Platform for Action, including economic structures, participation in productive activities and access to resources, education, health and related services, public life and decision-making, and human rights of women and girls. The establishment of an international minimum set of gender indicators is a positive development. It is a testament to the increased recognition of gender statistics in evidence-based policy making. However, more can be done. For instance, in the minimum set of 52 indicators, there is no measure for women\u2019s participation in local government or in the public sector, nor is there a measure for the kinds of positions held by women and men in the private sector. Moreover, measurement of violence other than physical or sexual violence is not included in the set, although this will be addressed with nine additional (forthcoming) indicators specifically designed to measure violence against women. The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) Statistics Division has a plan to develop a regional framework and core set of gender indicators in consultation with Asia- Pacific countries in 2014 so as to specifically address regional issues and needs. The Beijing Platform for Action commits governments to mainstreaming a gender perspective into the work of national statistical systems and to producing gender statistics. Ensuring the development of an adequate database forms part of this commitment and is reinforced by the responsibility that states have for the systematic collection and publication of data under the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics, adopted in 1992 in effort to promote appropriate and reliable baseline data. These include, among others, the commitment to support NGOs, academics and others engaged in such work.16 Integrating a gender perspective through this process will enable governments to formulate better and more gender-responsive policies. Countries in the Asia-Pacific region are at different stages in fulfilling these commitments. Clearly, a range of different actions and stakeholders as well as investments in capacity development of statistics producers and consumers are necessary to achieve them. 4 GENDER STATISTICS Minimum Set of Gender Indicators, by Domain I.

An example of a major measurement index in this area is the Gender Inequality Index (GII). The GII was launched by UNDP in 2010 to strengthen gender analysis and policy advocacy on issues of health, empowerment and employment. As an index it succeeds the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM), which was developed by UNDP in 1995. The GEM focused primarily on evaluating political participation, decision-making power, and power over economic resources. As a tool for measuring empowerment it has been criticized for not including vital components such as participation in local governance, civil society, and broader government administration. The GII is considered stronger in that it examines the consequences of gender inequality for human development and measures reproductive health, empowerment, and labour market participation. While income is left out of the GII, it focuses on evaluating and measuring the consequences of horizontal inequalities in three key areas: a. Reproductive health (measured by maternal mortality ratio and adolescent fertility rate); b. Empowerment (measured by women and men\u2019s percentage shares of parliamentary seats and levels of secondary and higher education attainment); and c. The labour market (measured by women\u2019s participation in the workforce). The GII provides a strong empirical foundation for policy advocacy efforts aimed at addressing gender inequality; though, it faces major data limitations by missing some key indicators of empowerment (including gender-based violence, participation in local governance, and time-use). In all major gender-related indices, education, employment and health statistics are essential in assessing the presence or absence of gender equality.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6e45b7f9-9b58-4d24-b5ba-94bbbaaf3380": {"__data__": {"id_": "6e45b7f9-9b58-4d24-b5ba-94bbbaaf3380", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidance-note-gender-statistics", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidance Note: Gender Statistics", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidance-note-gender-statistics", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "06ff6123a9bdd9111c487a062ca1a317010c85d16255c4563fe64d0ca1b0c62d"}, "2": {"node_id": "faa6da8a-d89f-4a70-9aac-8548244e4fe4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidance-note-gender-statistics", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "128744db5e11eb399df42f07c20860ac6d4eb854728d0f1d3e7ce40ebfc8bc61"}}, "hash": "e80d6f2f5ab7040fc5510ffe43df1be7c971afba63e4092e1246f867f2d96e26", "text": "Yet, there are many other areas (such as sexual and gender-based violence, asset ownership, participation in natural resource management, unpaid work, trade, entrepreneurship, taxation, and capital flows) that are not covered explicitly by the MDGs and are not measured by these indices but are essential for achieving gender equality.

Such a process identifies to what extent a programme\u2019s outputs benefit women and men at the same time that it evaluates their respective roles in addressing programme outcomes. Gender-responsive M&E also facilitates the formulation of corrective paths to address gender inequalities that stem from specific programmes as well as from broader social and institutional dynamics in countries. Gender-responsive planning in the design, situational analysis and initial stages of any programme/project is also essential, as this is when men and women are identified as actors, beneficiaries, victims and so on. These early characterisations are often maintained throughout the life of a project, especially if not analaysed and challenged with 6 GENDER STATISTICS good gender-responsive M&E practices. Additionally, gender-responsive M&E drives greater sustainability of gender mainstreaming initiatives across diverse programme areas. By providing recommendations for follow-up initiatives and pointing to a programme\u2019s substantial implications for other stakeholders, gender-responsive M&E is important for assessing how addressing gender issues are pivotal to a larger policy agenda. As part of this process, sex-disaggregated indicators should be defined in a concrete manner, so that they measure the impacts of the programme on both men and women in addition to equitable resource distribution and transformation of power relations.19 Gender-responsive indicators surpass just sex-disaggregated indicators but they also include indicators that probe gender-equality-related aspects of specific development interventions. Indicators should also look at not just benefits to women and men but also whether development interventions have negative impacts on women (or men). For example, in the case of some micro-finance projects, there\u2019s an increase in domestic gender-based violence (GBV) cases when women start earning more money.20 In addition to paying substantial attention to women\u2019s empowerment and participation levels throughout the M&E process,21 defining important indicators can help with removing gender bias from data gathering systems and provide policy makers with the necessary tools to make evidence-based policy decisions. By systematically engaging in gender-responsive M&E, gender mainstreaming initiatives can be effectively promoted as beneficial for the success and sustainability of programme outcomes.22 Gender-responsive monitoring has three aspects: 1. Levels of monitoring: This encompasses monitoring of progress towards fulfilling substantive goals and objectives in addition to monitoring of the implementation process. Monitoring requires both developing SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-based) indicators and setting targets to measure progress.23 Output indicators indicate or monitor immediate changes (intended or unintended, positive or negative) as the result of the project activities. Outcome indicators look at changes at a higher level as contributed by a collective set of outputs. \uf0b7 When monitoring progress towards substantive goals and objectives, example indicators might include: How many HIV tests were conducted in area X of country Y? How many men versus women appeared for these tests? \uf0b7 When monitoring the implementation process, questions to ask might include: Are men and women equally participating in decision-making? Are men and women treated with equal respect as decision makers, implementers, and participants?24 2. Gender-responsive monitoring plans: These should be developed and included in the official document outlining the programme strategy, and they should include who takes responsibility for monitoring tasks to ensure gender-sensitive data collection has occurred, how other stakeholders will participate, when monitoring visits will take place (for example, the different schedules of male and female respondents/participants need to be taken into account to ensure comprehensive and gender-responsive monitoring), which tools will be used and what mechanisms there are to review progress. \uf0b7 An effective monitoring plan can generally use a matrix to assist with gender-sensitive programme/project planning, monitoring and evaluation.

Have the differing schedules of women, men, girls and boys been taken into account? It is important to note that in evaluating \u2013 and ensuring \u2013 the sustainability of gender mainstreaming efforts, UNDP initiatives should be aligned with and support broader country development goals so that follow-up activities can systematically take place. As long as gender considerations remain outside mainstream policy-agenda setting, progress towards greater gender equality outcomes will be static. Good examples of gender-responsive M&E in the Asia-Pacific region can be found in a number of countries. In 2009, to understand the impact of Cyclone Nargis on women in the Ayeyarwady Delta and Yangon regions of Myanmar, the Women\u2019s Protection Technical Working Group and the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement actively promoted the use of gender-sensitive M&E in its assessment of women\u2019s needs and challenges as a result of the Cyclone.28 A year earlier, in 2008, the Government of Myanmar, ASEAN and the United Nations conducted a joint assessment during which sex-disaggregated data were collected which identified a disproportionate share of women victims as a result of the disaster.29 In Bangladesh, where the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC) and Grameen Bank have used eight comprehensive sex-disaggregated indicators to measure women\u2019s empowerment (these included economic security, ability to make larger purchases, and involvement in political campaigning).30 UNDP\u2019s Rural Employment Opportunities for Public Assets (REOPA) Project in Bangladesh had, between 2005 and 2011, also made sure to develop gender-sensitive and sex- disaggregated variables and indicators that can mainstream women into development programs and ultimately contribute to Bangladesh\u2019s long-term sustainable development.31 Gaps and Challenges Frameworks and methods that are often used in development work do not reflect the actual variation in men and women\u2019s roles, opportunities, and preferences.

One often neglected step in efforts to improve gender statistics is to collate and compile existing data relating to gender issues in a systematic manner. Service-related data from health centers, police stations, banks, courts and public services such as housing, social welfare services and shelters can offer valuable contributions to understanding the sector response to issues and how far they meet the needs of women. The quality of such data may be flawed, inconsistent and not entirely representative of issues due to inadequate training of service providers, limited resources to compile data, as well as poor coordination between service providers and statistical agencies.34 However, despite such problems this information can highlight entry points for action or for further research. For example, a study by the Women and Development Unit of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) illustrated how basic data collected through routine household surveys on topics such as age, sex, economic status of household members could be combined with existing information on household size, composition and headship, to gauge gender differences and vulnerability in poverty.35 For example, the contraceptive prevalence rates from household surveys can be verified through materials dispensed by health clinics, doctors and NGOs as well as records on the number of births and fertility rates. Strengthening gender statistics, and in particular the collection and analysis of sex-disaggregated data at the national level poses an array of challenges in addition to the human and financial constraints faced by most national statistical offices. Critical obstacles include institutional barriers (for example, a \u2018gendered policy agenda\u201936), a lack of understanding of gender issues, the lack of user-producer interaction and lack of political will. This is particularly true in the Asia-Pacific region where many national systems require general strengthening to produce basic statistics in a timely manner. However investments in gender statistics, specifically sex-disaggregation and capacity for gender analysis, are more cost-effective and easier to accomplish at an early stage of institutional reform of statistics agencies rather than as an add-on at the end of a lengthy reform process.37 The main gaps and challenges that UNDP Country Offices in the region face when working on improving gender statistics include: the lack of a centralized database, removing gender bias from data gathering systems and increasing demand for sex-disaggregated data amongst others. The collection of sex-disaggregated data on all topics \u2013 both those that are especially relevant to women as well as those that appear at first glance to be unrelated to gender \u2013 is vital. A systemic review of official statistics and data collection systems is required. For example, business surveys for One of the strategic objectives of the Platform for Action of the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women is to \u2018generate and disseminate gender- disaggregated data and information for planning and evaluation\u2019. The associated set of actions include an agenda for the development of statistics so that each country can \u2018ensure that statistics related to individuals are collected, compiled, analyzed and presented by sex and age and reflect problems, issues and questions related to women and men in society.\u2019 Source: United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (2010), Developing Gender Statistics, p.8 10 GENDER STATISTICS economic statistics can incorporate the sex of employees which can then be used in sector productivity and other analysis. Often policies and programmes that appear gender neutral actually affect the relative position, the status and the rights of men, women and children. Investigation into a particular gender aspect not initially articulated is often required. This has been seen in relation to violent crime policies. A hidden aspect of violent crime is violence in the home. Excluding such considerations from conceptual and/or measurement processes means that a significant proportion of violent crime is not acknowledged or measured, and therefore not considered in programming or policy development. While the collection of data about both women and men can provide important insights into their status in society, sex-disaggregated data does not completely reflect the state of gender relations in any given society because they do not consider the different socio-economic realities women and men face. This means that the concepts and methods used data collection need to be adequately formulated to ensure that they reflect existing gender concerns and differentials. Additionally, social and cultural factors must be considered, as they can result in gender-based biases in data collection, analysis and presentation. If this is done, gender can be mainstreamed into data collection and analysis, producing gender statistics.

UNDP has been assisting national institutions to generate gender statistics that can inform policy and programme development through capacity building, institutional strengthening and support for innovative action. The following are examples of emerging UNDP good practices from the region in particular thematic areas. a) Studies on Gender-based Violence (GBV) There is a continuing need to generate more statistics that shed light on the extent and causes of GBV.38 GBV data clearly requires disaggregation not only by sex but also by other factors in order to pinpoint heightened vulnerability to GBV. Partners for Prevention, a UNDP, UNFPA, UN Women and UNV regional joint programme for gender-based violence prevention in Asia and the Pacific, recently conducted a multi-country study on men and violence. The full report of this study, Why Do Some Men Use Violence Against Women and How Can We Prevent it?, was released in September 2013.39 The objectives of the study were to estimate the prevalence of men\u2019s use of violence against women and understand the factors associated with such violence in order to be able to develop more effective violence prevention programmes and policies. Data on GBV prevalence remains a consistent challenge due to a lack of standardization of GBV terminology and incident classifications, as well as the problem of under-reporting of GBV by victims and sometimes by police. Analysis of crime statistics in many countries simply does not allow for a comprehensive picture of GBV to be drawn. The cutting-edge methodologies used in the Partners for Prevention study included both quantitative In 1993, A World Bank study estimated that domestic violence and rape account for five per cent of the total disease burden for women aged 15 to 44 in developing countries; more recently, in 2013, WHO revealed that 35% of women worldwide have experienced intimate partner or sexual violence. Sources: World Bank (1993), Global Burden of Disease Study; WHO (2013), Global and Regional Estimates of Violence Against Women. 11 GENDER STATISTICS and qualitative surveying and interviewing of participants, for example in utilizing audio-enhanced personal digital assistants (PDAs) respondents could easily input into the PDAs their answers to very sensitive questions, particularly around sexual crimes, rather than verbally answering an interviewer. Over 10,000 men and 3,000 women were surveyed across nine sites in six countries: Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Sri Lanka. Knowledge from the study is already informing national-level programmes to prevent violence through the promotion of non-violent and gender-equitable masculinities. A toolkit for replicating the study has also been produced and is available online.40 There have also been other studies in this area. In 2012, UN Women commissioned research in Viet Nam whose aim was to estimate the costs of domestic violence against women and provide targeted recommendations to address them.41 Data for the study was collected using household as well as service provider surveys, and qualitative interviews of women affected by GBV provided more in-depth information about the behaviour of women seeking assistance. To estimate costs of intimate partner violence to households and communities the Viet Nam study collected data on both out of pocket costs (health fees, providing shelter, and court costs for example) and indirect costs (days lost from paid and unpaid work, and school days lost for children).42 Earlier, in 2005, WHO also conducted a Multi-Country Study on Women\u2019s Health and Domestic Violence, where 24,000 women across 10 countries were carefully interviewed about their experiences of violence in effort to determine prevalence rates and thus strengthen national commitment and action on violence against women.43 New data collected included impacts of GBV on women\u2019s health supporting efforts for more comprehensive health care sector responses to GBV. That it is health care providers and not necessarily police that are often first contacts for victims of GBV is significant when considering data collection methodologies for GBV studies. Studies similar to these but focusing on under-researched topics would be valuable additions to a rapidly developing discourse on GBV in the Asia-Pacific Region. These may include an examination of different forms of GBV (other than intimate partner and sexual violence) as well as longitudinal studies which observe the same variables at regular intervals over a long period of time, useful for analyzing changes or consistencies over time, and studies that investigate the impact of social change, economic development and globalization on GBV. It would, moreover, be important to explore possible correlations between GBV and time-use or between increased levels of GBV and women\u2019s increasing status as a substantial (sometimes primary) income earner in a household. b)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "063bfbcd-b792-40ab-8b9f-23354d384e50": {"__data__": {"id_": "063bfbcd-b792-40ab-8b9f-23354d384e50", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidance-note-gender-statistics", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidance Note: Gender Statistics", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidance-note-gender-statistics", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f498ba563f441f04bd2a88944982dcdf9eb12f3bc441734100c1d198a0828840"}, "3": {"node_id": "c5ccb7e1-6ea1-45a4-8b28-ad2c79d65b2b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidance-note-gender-statistics", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a12d2dbfeb811df79bd1ff84f246c0032688e627a5ced7f91cb0be747e160542"}}, "hash": "bd6f2ebfd04931c33990938d7385b2c6cf3d97286a6464f19f65ae007928d73a", "text": "Studies and Reports on Women\u2019s Political Participation and Involvement in Decision-making As the issue of women\u2019s political participation in the Asia-Pacific region has increased in visibility, it has become apparent that most public and private institutions with decision-making roles are not formally required to gather data on women\u2019s participation. Beyond parliaments, state, and local governments, this situation applies to political parties, the private sector and NGOs. As a result, data on women at the lower levels of decision-making and on women candidates in politics (as opposed to elected officials) are largely lacking or are collected on an ad hoc basis, often in response to specific demands such as reporting for CEDAW or the Secretary General\u2019s questionnaire on the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action. Improved data collection could help to clarify trends and to compare the impact of strategies to increase women\u2019s political participation.

Improved statistics are also needed to improve our understanding of women\u2019s participation in political parties and in elections, both as organizers and as voters. For example, the report by the UNDP Electoral Support Project on Gender Mapping in the Field of Elections in Nepal presents statistics outlining the gender gaps that exist in the different stages of the electoral process (pre-voting, voting and post-voting), allowing for analysis on women in d
