According to the IPCC, deltas, particularly so- called \u201cmegadeltas\u201d are vulnerable to climate change due to increased susceptibility to sea- level rise, storm surges, saltwater intrusion and floods. The Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta and the Mekong Delta are the largest in South and Southeast Asia, respectively, incorporating large amounts of people across international borders. Bangladesh and Cambodia, both delta countries, are among the most vulnerable countries in Asia. Both depend on rice-based cropping systems to provide the mainstay of food security and both are exposed to a number of water-related hazards. With an anticipated increase in rainfall variability, rain-fed farming households are confronted with the challenge of not just maintaining productivity in an environment of global change, but of increasing rice production to match growing food and cash demands. The question, thus, is whether the most disadvantaged households being impacted by climate change will be able to sufficiently adapt to these pressures while being able to improve livelihoods. Within vulnerable areas, however, livelihoods are by no means homogenously difficult. Depending on livelihood strategies, resources and differential opportunities households have varying levels of adaptive capacity to cope with changes. Thus, rather than taking a purely geographic approach we need to take a closer look at delta areas and identify differential types of households, their respective resource availability and consequent adaptive capacity. This case study attempts to use local data to look into types of livelihoods, which provide us with a richer picture on what households do \u2013 and what they could do \u2013 to adapt to climate change in the region. Given the points above, the case of Khulna, Bangladesh, and Svay Rieng, Cambodia, is not only meant to provide an example for specific adaptation. In fact, the case tries to open up the black box of \u201cvulnerability\u201d and map out differential adaptation strategies according to varying levels of resource access, livelihood strategies, and perception of risk. The aim is to incorporate self-assessments of farmers with scientific descriptions of exposure to hazards and available resources to cope. The idea behind these new approaches is to match experts\u2019 assessments of adaptive capacity with a self-evaluation of the target populations on what can actually be done to adapt to ongoing processes (in addition to the continuing effort to improve livelihoods). For determining the household typology a number of indicators were selected namely: ownership of assets, access to public goods or resources, household ability to transform assets, individual status and capacity for following alternative livelihoods options.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c274508-cc22-46fa-9377-e94eeb517f94": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c274508-cc22-46fa-9377-e94eeb517f94", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/09", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/09", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/09", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "076c3666b27063cc79b4e8bb116f810acd32dc2ae9fd86a6af988838e3f34599"}, "2": {"node_id": "018fbee3-cd9a-4716-93e4-e191341a08d6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/09", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7ff5128ba5ad1a047dba12d63cd6e5dadb545325ec30c5765526e13134030b4d"}}, "hash": "22392a507e3ed6723c30c949f25df5a617e3a5314963ac8dda7230383ecdb4ce", "text": "The study revealed how household typologies can be used in assessing adaptive capacity and climatic vulnerability.

As a result, practicing of such strategies eventually increases household and community level adaptive capacity that in turn reduces vi climatic vulnerabilities. Successful adaptation practices depend on specific formal or informal institutional arrangements, i.e., adaptation never occurs in an institutional vacuum but is guided and managed by existing structure. Institutions are the channels through which external interventions reinforce or undermine existing adaptation practices such as agricultural techniques, water management techniques, diversification, common property resource management, etc. The analysis shows that not only do the varying characteristics of what \u201cclimate change\u201d means to different communities determine the ability and capacity to adapt. It is also the specific set of resources available to and their respective access by the communities that differentiate potentials for adaptation. In addition to geomorphological factors, the institutional setting plays a rather important role as to which resources are available in a particular community and how they can be accessed. In fact, institutions govern the availability of resources, which, in turn, determine the level of adaptive capacity of a community or household. Additional factors affecting adaptive capacity include: (a) remoteness; (b) economic structure; (c) community action; and (d) social structure Any future strengthening of adaptive capacity needs to take current adaptation into account for three reasons: (a) adaptation strategies, especially technical adaptation strategies, are inefficient if they are imposed upon farming households already struggling to make ends meet. Transaction costs are high and ownership is low. Only the most desperate will engage with the level of risk involved; (b) current adaptation strategies are, by definition, adaptations to an ongoing process of change. By having adapted, it shows that farming households have capacity to do so, even if adaptations have not proven successful; and (c) screening the suitability of current adaptation strategies seems more cost-efficient than introducing new practices. In addition, even when introducing new technologies, it seems reasonable to look for locally acceptable entry points rather than forcing resource-disadvantaged populations into high-risk transitions. For effective interventions, understanding of existing livelihoods is necessary. The data presented in this paper suggests that adaptive capacity is highly volatile and depends on a vast number of factors and influences even in a general area considered \u2018vulnerable\u2019. Megadeltas are in itself vulnerable areas, but adaptive capacity, in the cases presented above, depends on geography, economic dependency, community action, and social structure. It follows that large-scale programs devised into vulnerable areas are unlikely to increase adaptive capacity as they cannot take local specifics into account. Rather, policy should be able to allow for local variation within vulnerable areas and thereby create the space needed by communities to become active in their adaptation processes. Thus policy recommendations targeted at improving adaptive capacity towards climate change can be divided into four fields covering the social reality of resource use by smallholding and landless households: (a) The households themselves - The household level is the locus of specific measures of adaptation. As added benefits, households are less dependent on monopolistic traders for their product but can make use of trader competition or even choose to sell locally; (b) Government - Government must assume the responsibility to maintain protective infrastructure, such as Polders, irrigation canals and stormwater drainage. No single community can afford to maintain infrastructure on this scale and it is crucial for adaptive capacity to be able to adequately access the critical resources land and water; (c) The community - This study shows that community action and community structure can make the difference between high and low potential adaptive capacities. Hence, there needs to be a focus on functioning and integrated communities to provide opportunities for adaptation strategies; and (d) Markets - Markets play a crucial role in providing opportunities to farming vii households. Provided markets allow fair pricing and equitable access to rural households they can act as a major catalyst to improving adaptive capacity. This study covers communities situated at the top (Mekong) and the very bottom (Sundarban) of a delta. While all are highly vulnerable, the analysis of adaptive capacity has shown that communities with higher adaptive capacity show a higher diversity of resource use portfolios, horizontally integrated social structure, mature economic structure and the vicinity to market hubs. Therefore, this community is more likely to withstand shocks as well as adapt to slow- onset effects of climate change.

Introduction While climate change may seem as lying in a remote future, it is already a reality in many parts of Asia, with evidence of increasing temperatures (Lal 2003; Cruz et al. 2007); projections of an increase in monsoonal rainfall in some countries (Kumar et al. 2006); a higher frequency of extreme weather events; and accelerating rates of glacier and snow melt (Cruz et al. 2007). As most Asian economies largely depend on agriculture, in terms of share of GDP as well as absorbing the labour force, they are likely to be more heavily affected by climatic perturbations than industrialised countries. The most disadvantaged1 farm households in delta areas bear the brunt of climate change because they typically live in areas more exposed to extreme climate effects or otherwise marginal locations2. According to the IPCC (2007) deltas, particularly so-called \u201cmegadeltas\u201d are vulnerable to climate change in due to susceptibility to sea-level rise, storm surges, saltwater intrusion and floods. In Asia, deltas tend to attract high population densities, many of which base their livelihoods on the deltas\u2019 natural capital3. There is broad consent over the fact that policies and programs need to provide for integrated and co-ordinated development of deltas, balancing the needs of the populations living in them with the ecosystem services provided by deltas as well as mitigating further erosion of natural capital in these highly fertile areas (ibid.). The Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta and the Mekong Delta are the largest in South- and Southeast Asia, respectively, incorporating large amounts of people across international borders. Bangladesh and Cambodia, both delta countries, are among the most vulnerable countries in Asia (Yusuf and Francisco 2009; Cruz et al. 2007). Their vulnerability to climate change arises out of a combination of socio-economic factors, i.e. low institutional and community capacity to adapt, and a high exposure to climate risks, (i.e. flooding in delta areas as well as increased drought and extreme weather events). While other Asian countries are also vulnerable, these two countries, with their high percentage of agricultural population and dominating waterways, warrant particular focus. Both Bangladesh and Cambodia depend on rice-based cropping systems to provide the mainstay of food security and both are exposed to water-related hazards from the sea as well as freshwater arteries. Situated in deltas, both countries attempt to harvest the immense freshwater discharge for irrigation. Most farming systems apply at least basic forms of 1 \u201cDisadvantaged\u201d, in this paper, is used to designate households with poor or lacking access to resources compared to fellow co-residents in the community. The authors are reluctant to use the term \u201cpoor\u201d as, by all international definitions, all households covered in this report would be classified poor in terms of their absolute resource base, income levels and social stratification. However, among those households there are those that are able to access the scare resources and use them for their own benefit and there are those that cannot. 2 In fact, the IPCC (2007) identifies two particularly vulnerable populations, those residing in Megadeltas and those in Megacities. Levels of exposures specific to these areas apply in addition to the fact that both areas are attractors to large numbers of people. 3 Ganges-Brahmaputra: 1300cap/km2; Mekong: 250cap/km2 (calculated from data in IPCC 2007). 2 irrigation while large investments into irrigation technology (e.g. water pipelines) are not needed due to the abundant availability of water. Rice is the main staple crop, with annual rice production in Bangladesh of 47 Million tons (285t/cap) and Cambodia of 7.2 Million tons 478t/cap in 2008 (FAOSTAT 2010). With an anticipated increase in rainfall variability, rain-fed farming households are confronted with the challenge of not just maintaining productivity in an environment of global change, but of increasing rice production to match growing food and cash demands.

Bangladesh, in itself a Delta country, is a case in point. Large numbers of people live very close to coastal and delta areas, which are characterised by tidal surges, seasonal fluctuations, the balance of fresh and saltwater and the increase of extreme weather phenomena. Hence, it becomes progressively difficult for populations in those areas to maintain livelihoods, let alone improve them. Extreme events, especially, seem to destroy any progress that is made over years in the blink of an eye. Within one and a half decades six devastating cyclones and tidal surges hit the coastal areas of Bangladesh (in 1994, 1997, 1999, 2007 and 2009). In the context of the climate change debate and the emergence of an adaptation research agenda, the inclusion of social and institutional research in technology driven adaptation options has regained new prominence (Howden et al., 2007; Resurreccion et al. 2008; Meinke et al. 2009). This has also revived interest in vulnerability and livelihoods analysis, as it is increasingly being recognised that effective adaptation is as much a socially driven process as it is one reliant on technological solutions. Furthermore, it is important to understand how and why people adapt to climate change and which adaptation options are most feasible to them. As such, social capital remains one of the key elements in assessing the capacity of people to adapt, particularly to climate change (Prasad et al. 2009). Within vulnerable areas, however, livelihoods are by no means homogenously difficult. Depending on livelihood strategies, resources and differential opportunities households have varying levels of adaptive capacity to cope with changes. Thus, rather than taking a purely geographic approach we need to have a closer look at delta areas and identify differential types of households, their respective resource availability and consequent adaptive capacity. This case study attempts to use local data to look into types of livelihoods, which provide us with a richer picture on what households do \u2013 and what they could do \u2013 to adapt to climate change in the region. Selecting a case-based approach highlights several issues inherent to much climate change related research today: \uf0b7 Many donor-funded Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) programs are underway in Asia. Several of these do not regard the particular context within which adaptation occurs. \uf0b7 Many Government and Non-Government programs are \u2018top down\u2019, technology or sector- driven and lack household and village level assessments of adaptive capacity. 3 \uf0b7 In some instances, uncertainty about appropriate adaptation strategies and lack of proven design principles is constraining donor and government funding. \uf0b7 CCA research has been primarily focussed on impact and vulnerability assessments to underpin policy and investment prioritisation, as well as on breeding new climate resilient varieties. There are very few cases where research has been undertaken to optimise practical approaches to farm level adaptation. Adaptation to climate change is as much a research domain as it is also increasingly becoming an advocacy domain, where the distinction between both domains becomes blurry. While there is a predominance of portraying the potential risk and negative impacts of climate change on development, less emphasis has been given to exploring the opportunities those changes to climate might entail (e.g., carbon fertilisation effects in some parts of South and Southeast Asia, which could give rise to opportunities, such increased productivity (Rosegrant 2008)4. There is a need to assess not just the risk, but also demonstrate how to capitalise on opportunities arising out of climate change (Howden et al. 2009). As Bangladesh and Cambodia continue to ramp up their policy response to implement climate change adaptation programmes, there is recognition that this process will take several years to consolidate and become evidence-based. However, there is broad consensus within leading agricultural research institutions and the non-governmental organization (NGO) sector of these countries, that enhancing adaptive capacity in rural communities is predicated on broadening livelihood opportunities of smallholder households through a range of technical and socio-economic and institutional approaches. Some of the key elements comprise: \uf0b7 Developing adaptation options at various scales, i.e. policy development, capacity building, as well as local technical interventions into farming systems. \uf0b7 Extensive consultations with relevant government stakeholders which confirmed the proposed approach and focus on demonstrating how adaptive capacity can be fostered at the community level. \uf0b7 Adapted interventions, i.e., interventions developed in a participatory way that ensure ownership by the community and fit into the local institutional arrangements to be easily absorbed into existing structure rather than building parallel structures. \uf0b7 Capitalize on ongoing adaptation.

Given the points above, the case of Khulna district, Bangladesh, and Svay Rieng province, Cambodia, is not only meant to provide an example for specific adaptation. Instead the case tries to open up the black box of \u201cvulnerability\u201d and map out differential adaptation strategies according to varying levels of resource access, livelihood strategies, and perception of risk. Vulnerability assessments are undoubtedly useful in identifying hotspots where climate change impacts can be expected to be more adverse than elsewhere, particularly if they are spatially explicit, and in consequence allow a more targeted approach to allocating limited resources towards climate adaptation (see Yusuf and Francisco 2009). Vulnerability assessments often focus on potential threats (exposures, hazards, stresses etc.) that affect livelihoods and well-being (reviewed in Kofinas and Chapin 2009) rather than in 4 It must be stated, however that carbon fertilization effects are still being debated (cf. Rosegrant et al. 2008). 4 considering what people can do to improve their livelihoods. Much of the work on vulnerability assessment has focussed on the potential negative impacts of exposure and sensitivity to specific drivers of change such as declining terms of trade, land degradation and rising temperatures. This tends to be disempowering for individuals, households and communities unable to directly influence these change drivers because they can overlook intrinsic adaptive capacity and the ability of land managers to adjust to change. It is important to specifically link climate change adaptation and mitigation to sustainable development of communities to enhance adaptive capacity (Laukkonen et al. 2009). Kofinas and Chapin (2009) argue that participatory location specific approaches are required to improve well- being and to enable for planning for change. There are few published examples where climate change, adaptive capacity and participatory approaches have been successfully conducted. Furthermore, there is a recognised need to develop adaptation assessment frameworks that are relevant, robust, and easily operated (Howden et al. 2007). Although there are several adaptation assessment frameworks, methodology and tools available for assessing community vulnerability and assessing adaptation options including technologies for adaptation at local level, their relevance and robustness is often questionable owing to their contradictory nature of being either too context-specific or being too generic. This has also led to a reassessment of vulnerability and impact assessments in their own right as falling short of informing effective adaptation strategies, as either they are too location and context specific and do not lend themselves to up-scaling to other areas, or they are conducted at a too generic level and therefore fall short of providing meaningful options applicable and acceptable at a farming household level (cf. Klein 2009). This is compounded by the difficulty in comparing the different approaches used as well as integrating them into biophysical research required to identify and test viable adaptation measures. The focus on potential negative impacts of exposure and sensitivity to rising temperatures and other extreme events (cyclones, floods) tends to be disempowering for individuals, households and communities who are unable to directly influence these events. A focus on impacts is also disempowering because it overlooks the intrinsic adaptive capacity and historically demonstrated ability of affected populations to adjust positively to significant change under conditions of limited options and limited access to livelihood resources. Assessments of adaptive capacity are better positioned to consider the constraining and enabling factors for individuals, households or communities to cope with various types of change because they typically link possible responses back to actions and behavioural change that households or communities are able to initiate using the resources at their disposal and taking environmental constraints into account (Gallop\u00edn 2006). Moreover, such assessments more readily lend themselves to uncovering actions that farming households are already undertaking to adapt, as managing climatic risk is nothing intrinsically new to people who are constantly adapting to drivers of change, be they climatic, socio-economic, political or market in nature (Crehan 1992). As the applicability of the vulnerability concept, especially in the context of climate change adaptation, is being debated, current research is developing frameworks that integrate investigations into the adaptive capacity of populations exposed to climate risks with more biophysical and quantitative research (cf. Roth et al. 2010). The aim is to incorporate self- assessments of farmers with scientific descriptions of exposure to hazards and available resources to cope. The idea behind these new approaches is to match experts\u2019 assessments of adaptive capacity with a self-evaluation of the target populations on what can actually be 5 done to adapt to ongoing processes (in addition to the continuing effort to improve livelihoods). 2.

The purposively selected communities give us an overall understanding of the situation in south-west coastal region of Bangladesh, and an indication of different levels of vulnerability. The community of Kapalfuli5 is a subsistence-oriented agricultural community, which focuses on growing rice as the staple. Rice is grown for consumption while any surplus is sold off to earn additional cash income. Moreover, other agricultural activities are followed during the dry season, e.g. livestock holding, fish breeding, or dry season cropping (e.g., mungbean, okra). However, the availability of fresh water constrains agricultural production and precludes developing an entire second crop in the dry season. Hence, the focus is on subsistence while farmers constantly search for opportunities to make additional cash income to pay for agricultural inputs, maintenance of tools and machinery, commodities, and any repayments of debts from investments made. Rice is farmed intensively, i.e. at a high labour cost, and many farmers hire labour from local landless people to keep up with production.

On the other hand, Labonkhola has until recently been dominated by the shrimp industry. As Khulna lies in the main shrimp-producing area in Bangladesh, the country itself being one of the major shrimp producers globally, this community has experienced a surge in conversion of formerly fertile rice fields into shrimp ponds over the last two decades (cf. Islam 2007; Ahmed et al. 2010). In recent years, however, it became obvious that shrimp cultivation exacerbates already existing issues of salinity in the area. Shrimp production, which uses saline or brackish water in ponds, has increased soil salinity in agricultural fields to a point where it becomes unfeasible to grow rice any longer, thus creating major problems of food security (Haque 2006). Shrimp cultivation has been branded as having major positive livelihood and income benefits (Ahmed et al. 2010). It seems, however, that farmers are now turning their back on this particular option as it endangers their livelihood portfolios and, most importantly, their subsistence base (Azad et al. 2009; Muralidhar et al. 2010). Issues of disease in shrimp farms \u2013 as in most monocultures \u2013 are virulent (Tuong and Hoanh 2009). Rather than being an adaptation to the limited availability of freshwater resources due to sea level rise, storm surges, saltwater intrusion, and changing water regimes in deltas, shrimp farming actually worsened the already dire situation of farming on Bangladesh\u2019s South West coast (Azad et al. 2009) (Box 1). Not only were households losing their staple, rice, which was the foundation of every other livelihood activity, but the shrimp production system, being 5 All Bangladeshi names of communities and individuals have been altered to provide anonymity and protection of privacy. 6 built on a foundation of credit and debt hinged on every other aspect of farmer households\u2019 lives (Islam 2007).6 Box 1: The social and ecological implications of shrimp/prawn cultivation The social and ecological impacts of both, marine shrimp and freshwater prawn cultivation first became known in the late 1980s and early 1990s with the \u201cblue revolution\u201d gradually taking over vast stretches of coastal areas in South and Southeast Asia. Previously, the demand for these products had been met by wild catch providing local fishermen and \u2013 women with an additional source of income. However, there were ecological issues around the rapid depletion of wild stock as well as large quantities of by-catch, which was dumped back into the sea. The plight of the sea turtle, which was often ensnared in shrimp trawler nets, caught the attention of the environmental movement in the West and international pressure to end wild shrimp harvesting and shrimp cultivation was widely seen as the solution to the problem (Martinez-Alier 2001). It became apparent shortly after, however, that shrimp and prawn cultivation comes with its own ecological issues and, on top of that, threatens local farming households whose traditional livelihood sources are depleted.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0a24ea80-7805-4060-b3fa-e2c3c9aa4ebf": {"__data__": {"id_": "0a24ea80-7805-4060-b3fa-e2c3c9aa4ebf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/09", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/09", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/09", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b6c1fb8df532c0b487aea9794a80898a238e13e34523ad47f2eb32c1f82e8182"}, "2": {"node_id": "17ed9de7-ffcb-425a-8964-5971fe2ac1a6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/09", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e1dba8f9f281ddbe18642a77384485907aa8989f007836f42c743e343d14abe1"}}, "hash": "da177cdeab465024f5bd814ee76ea997441149b0d6c2d274d66f00b067296a47", "text": "Globally, the bulk of shrimp ponds are usually converted from coastal mangrove areas, which leads to ecological decline, such as deforestation, coastal erosion and loss of biodiversity.

The case of converting agricultural land to shrimp ponds, especially, has implied drastic changes to local livelihoods. Whereas the depletion of wild catch and mangrove stocks have largely been identified as an ecological issues by comparatively more powerful environmental NGOs in the West, the deterioration of local livelihoods has gone virtually unnoticed in the public eye of industrialised countries. Thus, as global demand for crustaceans is rising the high likelihood of more paddies being converted to shrimp production due to pressure exerted by the powerful shrimp industry in the country (Martinez-Alier 2001; Azad et al. 2009; Ahmed et al. 2010). In order to mitigate increasing salinity levels, the Government of Bangladesh has devised policies to promote prawn cultivation instead of shrimp and is developing the formation of hatcheries to alleviate the pressure on wild stocks (Ahmed et al. 2008). 3. Two communities in Southeast Cambodia In order to compare to a wholly different situation, albeit equally in a delta area, two communities in Cambodia are also considered. The aim of the comparison is to use the different observations as a correcting lens when listing policy principles towards the end of this paper. Policies on supporting the adaptive capacity of delta populations must be developed for large numbers of people and, hence, a large diversity of livelihoods. The bias of inferring recommendations from a non-representative sample of case studies seems 6 The top 10% of farmers benefitted from this process, however only in the short term. Interviews in the field suggested that once a disease that caused widespread damage to shrimp larvae came through the area more advantaged farmers were basically left with worthless land and virtually no production. It may be suggested that those farmers were hit even harder because of their absolute dependency on marketed product while more disadvantaged farmers were able to resort to traditional methods of mitigating food security (fishing, backyard gardens, etc.). 7 inevitable. The two cases from Cambodia shall provide a glimpse into the range of livelihood types in delta areas. Svay Rieng Province is located on the south-eastern tip of Cambodia with Viet Nam bordering the province on three sides. The province is part of the greater Mekong Delta, which includes most of eastern and South-Eastern Cambodia and well as the Southern tip of Viet Nam. The Mekong delta system includes the hydrological anomaly of the Tonle Sap Lake and river, which acts as a giant reservoir for the Mekong river\u2019s immense discharge during the wet season. As the lake\u2019s water table waxes and wanes the river changes the direction of its flow twice per year. Virtually all tributaries in Cambodia (with the exception of the far West) are connected to this system and are thus subject to flooding, depending on the amount of water in the main artery. Such is the case in the community of Chey Ressey, whose agricultural land is flooded during large parts of the wet season and therefore unusable. Even though the community focuses on rice production, wet season rice cannot be planted. Instead, most households plant \u201crecession rice\u201d twice every year, before the rains come into full force as well as towards the end of the wet seasons, when floodwaters recede. Large parts of Cambodia follow this system of rice cultivation. Along virtually every major waterway recession rice is the standard production method, i.e., around the Tonle Sap Lake and river, the Mekong River, as well as its tributaries. In comparison, the community of Koul, which lies further inland, practices rain-fed wet season rice. In fact this is virtually the only major agricultural activity conducted in the community. In addition, a few households grow vegetables for home consumption and a few keep cattle or pigs for emergency savings. Although there is a canal built through the community area of Koul, it appears that a secondary crop is not feasible to its residents in spite of water availability in the canal throughout most of the year.

The relatively larger number of female-headed households in Koul contributes to the relative majority of females.

With a number of off-farm income opportunities within reach of the community (Phnom Phenh is approximately 200km away), especially for females, many previously agricultural communities in Svay Rieng are losing their rural labour. 4. Living with and around water 4.1 Bangladesh Both communities are based on mainly rain-fed agriculture. The first community, Kapalfuli on Polder 308, mostly cultivates rice during monsoon and several rabi \u2013 dry season - crops in winter using fresh water collecting from a canal under the polder. The second community, Labonkhola, on Polder 31 mostly depends on shrimp cultivation along with rain-fed rice. General Features While Labonkhola produces a single harvest in the agricultural season Kapalfuli is able to supplement the main rice harvest with secondary crops, such as mungbean, or ancillary production, such as cattle. In a general sense, variation of cropping patterns between villages may be understood as an outcome of geography. The single crop community is situated close to sea and dominated by characteristics of remote villages, such as disadvantaged access to markets or services. This paper shows how climatic change may create different opportunities and/or constraints depending on different social conditions. In this section we provide a brief overview of the study communities so the reader can build an understanding of the communities whose stories are told in this paper. Labonkhola is characterized by poor road and communication networks, an absence of Polder maintenance activities, disadvantaged market facilities and, above all, a negligible presence of service providing agencies. Though government institutions have offices in Labonkhola, officials often remain absent. On the other hand, Kapalfuli is more accessible to the outsider and well connected to Khulna district town. As shown in Table 1 the demographic features of both communities are not significantly different. The average household size of Labonkhola (5) is slightly larger than Kapalfuli (4.5). It has been observed that the population growth rate in hazard prone areas is comparatively higher since family planning service providers are reluctant to stay in those areas (Khan et al. 2010). This absence of service provision affects the supply of family planning facilities. 8 Polders are areas surrounded by dykes or levees to protect that area against seawater intrusion. Often areas of reclaimed land, the embankments are man-made and allow regulating water within the area. They are a common in deltas around the world and the alluvial soil they are built around, together with the control over water usually making them exceptionally fertile. 9 Household types To understand the farmer communities, within the given population composition and socio- economic conditions, focus group discussions were held in both villages to explore what different types of farming households are present, with the aim of understanding how different households perceive or apply different adaptation strategies. Facilitators explained the aims of the discussion and a participatory wealth ranking was used to explore and select indicators and characteristics of the different groups. Farmers considered: \uf0b7 Ownership of assets; \uf0b7 Access to public goods or resources; \uf0b7 Household ability to transform assets; \uf0b7 Individual status; \uf0b7 Capacity for following alternative livelihoods options. No single indicator is able to determine the typology of households. Thus, a combination of indicators is considered. For example a household with a small farm could be considered advantaged if they have access to reliable alternative income source(s). In contrast, a large landholding household, which has poor soil that does not have appropriate education and training to farm efficiently or is unable to join the non-agricultural labour market could be considered as a medium or disadvantaged household.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "55d5ee52-15c4-469e-aecf-09021a770011": {"__data__": {"id_": "55d5ee52-15c4-469e-aecf-09021a770011", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/09", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/09", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/09", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7a1a75acb655a4cdd8ff9e0511b7767587fa99b9424ac11d2d8ce78f940ae88f"}, "2": {"node_id": "ff59c1c9-4755-4976-9718-f18bc344d2ac", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/09", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "db379e5e6fc5779bde29dc634e93dfa6f2a22098f89be3f5e5b8a6308b9d0d4e"}}, "hash": "1a4684fbe35b8da4e231a60e15b6b0dca99b58346c989370764147f69a2abe97", "text": "Both communities defined four different types of farming households present in their community (Table 3).

Arnes and Beurden 1977; Jansen 1987). In contrast, there are no landless households in Labonkhola, but it shows a higher percentage of disadvantaged households (60%) which provides a sense of less polarized community. 9 During the self-assessment workshops the categories used across the two communities were advantaged, medium, disadvantaged and landless. Being a self-assessment, the categorization depended on the perception of the workshop participants. Our assumption is, however, that the categorization comes close to the results of a hypothetical wealth ranking (if one had been carried out) with land ownership being the main determining criterion. 10 This classification refers to the farmers\u2019 self assessment. According to international definitions a much larger percentage, if not the entire community, would be classified as poor. Because this classification does not refer to absolute poverty the groups cannot be compared across communities. For example, a \u201cmedium farmer\u201d in Labonkhola might be a \u201cpoor\u201d farmer in Kapalfuli. 10 Table 3: Household types and land holding in two Khulna communities Percentages of types identified in the two communities (%) Average land holding for household types (bigha) Kapalfuli Labonkhola Kapalfuli Labonkhola HH type 1. \u201cadvantaged\u201d 10 10 5-10 >10 HH type 2. \u201cmedium\u201d 40 30 1-4 5-10 HH type 3. \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d 20 60 <1 <5 HH type 4. \u201clandless\u201d 30 - - - Note: 1 bigha = 0.1338 hectare Source: Data collected in 2011 by SERDI staff on location. Does land size matter? In both the communities, the top 10% of households were considered more advantaged farmers by the focus groups. They consistently have larger land holdings than the other types. Farmers in Labonkhola on average had bigger parcels of land than Kapalfuli farmers (Table 3). However, we must also acknowledge community differences in land productivity and land use. For the time being, however, it is noteworthy that Labonkhola tends towards larger land parcels. Land productivity is determined by the quality of soil and water and the level of salinity. Labonkhola households achieve poor yields regardless of capital-intensive equipment and inputs compared to Kapalfuli. The reason behind such lower productivity is the location of croplands and level of salinity protection. Labonkhola, situated in Polder 31, is poorly protected from saltwater intrusion, while Kapalfuli, situated in Polder 30, is better protected. Weak protection from saltwater forces the Labonkhola farmer community into producing a single monsoonal crop (Kharif). The low productivity due to saline soil and water results in huge economic losses for the farmers regardless of land size or social differentiation. In this sense, land size is less relevant than the quality of the land and subsequent crop production. In Kapalfuli the community is able to produce a monsoonal crop with higher yields per acreage as well as engaging into secondary agricultural activities in the dry (Rabi) season without an irrigation system in place. Advantaged farmers are able to invest in technology such as tractors to increase yields and diversify as well as intensify their cropping patterns. The medium farmers who are mostly owner-tenants cultivate their own and rented land to maximize production. In this case the size of land determines the wealth ranking. However, the level of yield per land unit depends on the farmer\u2019s economic position and their ability to invest in higher agricultural inputs. Yield differences are most visible in the case of the top 10% advantaged households. 11 Box 2: The impact of shrimp cultivation on Labonkhola Labonkhola had different circumstances prior to the introduction of shrimp cultivation around 10 years ago. In the past, farmers were able to double crop in a diversified way. The introduction of shrimp forced the community into single cropping and resulted in lower rice yields. This forced a shift away from farming crops in favour of shrimp - from food to cash crops. Although there is less social differentiation in this community, the intensification of cash-oriented farming demands larger land size in order to maximize profit.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9044c2b5-1303-46b3-bc82-4c924f490ea5": {"__data__": {"id_": "9044c2b5-1303-46b3-bc82-4c924f490ea5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/09", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/09", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/09", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6daa13e2ea90827bbcd8bc1bf439c0167181f2c023d9300914a57a9f8e67ea8e"}, "2": {"node_id": "67ffd8d2-1e54-45d1-9a81-303570746064", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/09", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "23549f429c4f094ffb039bdd2ca250d37c40db21d58a7fe6242ef87fd2d406d8"}}, "hash": "503fda26331571d2b4702b33c44c15ade6ba96c6eb5f660007915b3f7eeb6543", "text": "Regardless of their economic status, farmers are drawn into competition to increase their farm size.

In some instances, advantaged households store their rice and purchase food for consumption from the market, only to sell the stored products at peak market times at higher prices. They have the savings and facilities to be involved in this business where other household types cannot. Medium farmer households are involved in petty businesses (e.g., tea stalls), poultry farming, and small formal and informal wage jobs such as teaching. As farmers with a higher degree of mechanization, many of them lease out agricultural equipment on a regular basis. In Labonkhola all households involved in shrimp farming (see Box 2), regardless the status, are ridden with debt. With limited or no cropping option, farmers seek alternative earnings. Advantaged households are in a better position as they have access to local credit markets and products and links with local political institutions and service provider agencies. They get involved with small scale poultry farming, shop keeping and regular paid jobs. However, in both communities, farmers of all household types develop additional sources of earning such as fresh water fishing, fruit tree plantation and small and medium poultry farming. These serve two purposes depending on the type - cost savings or income. For instance, for advantaged households, the productivity of pond fishing or small scale poultry is used for household consumption; while the medium household type use the product as a source additional income. Landless households living in Kapalfuli are migrants from neighbouring areas. Due to its well-maintained Polder and income opportunities, the community attracts people to take up residence. These people often arrive from areas where livelihoods have become untenable due to, e.g., cyclone damage. They come to Kapalfuli to work for the more advantaged households and the few small businesses in the area. However, in the dry season, almost 100% of male members of the disadvantaged and landless type, and around 50% of the male members of the medium type migrate seasonally after harvesting the rice. 12 To bolster food supply most households use the area around their homesteads to cultivate food plants. Women of advantaged and medium household types of both villages grow seasonal vegetables and fruits such as brijals, potato, tomato, and banana around the house. In comparison, women of land disadvantaged households are involved in handicraft production such as making mats and sewing Nakhshikathas which is common in Kapalfuli. 4.2 Cambodia General Features Almost all residents of both, Chey Ressey and Koul, are landholders with a focus on rice production, however, with marked differences. As evident in Error! Reference source not found., average landholding in Chey Ressey is larger than in Koul11. The larger emphasis on rice production becomes more pronounced considering the fact that the former community harvests twice per year, while Koul only invests in one crop per season. Consequently, Chey Ressey manages to produce an average of 2.8 tons per hectare while Koul yields 1.7t/ha.

Source: NCDD 2009. Chey Ressey, on the other hand due to its higher yields and advantaged water availability is able to draw income from farming. In addition to satisfying local demand, farmers can produce an additional harvest with the recession rice system, which they market for export through traders. The rice planted for home consumption is a local variety, which is preferred by the villagers for its qualities in taste and appearance to modern improved varieties. To add to the local staple, vegetables and forages are grown along the banks of the canals and floodplains. Hence, there is less need to seasonally migrate in order to maintain a livelihood (Table 6). Household dependency In an analogy to the Bangladesh case of Labonkhola, however, Chey Ressey had put itself in the dependency of Vietnamese rice traders. All rice planted for export is of the Vietnamese VN504 variety14. This variety is somewhat controversial as it is not listed as one of the 10 official varieties eligible for export under Cambodia\u2019s new foreign trade laws of late 2010. Nonetheless, 100% of the cash crop rice harvested in the community is sent to Viet Nam through a network of Vietnamese traders. Cambodia has disregarded VN504 for various reasons: the state has no control over the quality of seeds and crop; the variety is susceptible to the Brown Plant Hopper (Nilaparvata lugens), one of the most widespread pests in the country; the variety is prone to seed rot and blight; planting VN504 requires a higher amount of chemical inputs as the official varieties. Instead, Cambodia aspires to replace VN504 with the local Chulasa variety, which has similar qualities but avoids some of the negative characteristics. 13 Seasonal migration has been identified as a growing trend albeit numbers are difficult to produce as seasonal and temporary migrants are not reflected in national statistics. Seasonal and temporary migration can be seen as a precursor to permanent urban migration but may actually remain a distinct livelihood strategy for some time in the future (Deshingkar 2006). The explicit link between seasonal migration and climate change has yet to be investigated. 14 The information regarding the production and marketing system of VN504 originates from an interview with Mr Ngin Chhay, Department of Rice Crops, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Cambodia (Ngin Chhay, pers comm.). 14 The farming households of Chey Ressey, however, continue farming VN504. Similar to the dependency created in the case of shrimp farming, VN504 creates a dependency on a specific supply chain, out of which farmers have difficulties liberating themselves. The seeds for VN504 are sold with a package of inputs (fertiliser, pesticides), whereby the buyer must purchase the entire package. In return, the crop is bought back at a guaranteed price after the harvest. The farmer does not have to worry about storage, seed loss, seed quality, chemical inputs or marketing of produce as everything is taken care of when entering into the agreement with the Vietnamese trader. Even loans or early payments for anticipated yield can be accessed (at a lower price) through the trader. The well-established system creates a dependency on a crop that leaves little flexibility to respond to changing requirements. 5. Current Adaptation Strategies There are a series of adaptation techniques used in the villages to cope with hazards and minimize economic and social loss. Though households and communities have historically adapted to climate variability through many different strategies, their capacity to adapt is significantly affected by the ways local institutions regulate and structure their interactions: both amongst themselves and with external actors. Survival strategies drawn onto in times of crisis could be defined as adaptations to climate variability (see, e.g., Crehan 1992). As a result, practicing of such strategies eventually increases household and community level adaptive capacity that in turn reduces climatic vulnerabilities. In general, successful adaptation practices depend on specific formal or informal institutional arrangements, i.e., adaptation never occurs in an institutional vacuum but is guided and managed by existing structure. Institutions are the channels through which external interventions reinforce or undermine existing adaptation practices such as agricultural techniques, water management techniques, diversification, common property resource management, etc. Agricultural technology In Bangladesh, in order to cope with dwindling yields and demands for increasing production, both villages have adopted saline tolerant crop varieties in addition to rice production. This diversified cropping pattern is prescribed by official agriculture extension departments as well as local NGOs due to the farmers\u2019 lack of adequate knowledge about innovative technological adaptation strategies. For instance, from 1972 farmers of Kapalfuli have harvested sesame at a small scale during the dry season.

In some instances infrastructure investments by government or non-government programmes support diversification of cropping patterns. For example, the construction of Polders with sluice gates by the government has enabled the cultivation of sesame, pulses, jute and other seasonal fruit and vegetables. Ten years ago farmers kept agricultural land fallow during the dry season; today, crop diversification in this region is maintaining food security as well as economic gain for those with sufficient resources of land and labour. Medium farmers are most often able to take advantage of this option, but disadvantaged farmers are unable to do so due to lack of capital, inadequate access to local institutions and disadvantaged networking within the community. 15 In Labonkhola, farmers are dependent on local rice varieties of wet season rice, such as Borhan, Patnai, Rajasail, suggested by government and non-government institutions. To adapt to the changed situation of increased soil and water salinity they are now trying to cultivate high-yielding varieties such as BR-47 or BR-23, which have been tested for their suitability to withstand salinity by agriculture departments. BRAC 15 is supporting this type of adaptation by providing seeds, training, and other technical support. In terms of advantaged household types in both villages, crop diversification is relatively feasible due to better access to local government and non-government institutions. Such networking with relevant institutions enables them to adopt practices of reducing salinity in the soil. In addition, better access to other formal or informal private institutions, such as local banks or NGOs, also helps them to access loans for adopting such capital-intensive practices. Their communication with formal cooperatives, informal community-based organizations or even neighbour and kin networks also result in receiving more information and resources such as agricultural loans, training, and agricultural inputs. In Kapalfuli, the slow and irregular onset of the monsoon season has destroyed huge amounts of seed in the past. In order to cope with loss of seeds and minimize the cost of purchasing seeds after initial planting has failed, the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation has suggested developing emergency seed stores, which mitigate risk, should the first seeding suffer from rains are slow to arrive in the season (ODI, 1996). Emergency seed stores allow farmers, who typically store sufficient seed for a single seeding, to re-seed if first sowing is unsuccessful. This option is usually only feasible for advantaged households but medium and disadvantaged households can actually benefit from these as it becomes possible to borrow emergency seed from their advantaged co-residents In Cambodia, agricultural adaptations can be made in three areas: (a) rice crops; (b) secondary crops; and (c) cropping patterns. In terms of rice, adaptations can be made by switching to other varieties, such as drought/flood tolerant varieties and/or improved (high- yielding) varieties. Also the production and storage of seed can be improved to prevent loss and increase germination efficiency. In terms of secondary crops, the emphasis for adaptation is on plant legumes that regenerate soils after the rice harvest and provide for an additional income source. Currently, CARDI (Cambodia Agricultural Research and Development Institute) as well as some NGOs are experimenting with mungbean and maize as well as forage legumes. The objective is to rely on supplementary irrigation systems, such as ground water wells, or to make use of residual moisture in the soil following the wet season. The third area of adaptation is essentially a combination of the former two. If, for example, households switched to short maturation rice varieties and started earlier in the season (using supplementary irrigation) they could easily plant a second crop and then even let their livestock graze on the stubble in the dry season when water becomes too scarce to plant. This is the type of integrated farming system the Provincial Department of Agriculture in Svay Rieng is promoting for poor and marginal households (Thach Rattana, pers comm.). 15 BRAC = Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee, one of the largest NGOs in Bangladesh and an important influencing factor in national rural development policy. 16 Water management techniques In Bangladesh, before the arrival of commercial shrimp cultivation in Labonkhola during the early 1990s, the gher system \u2013 traditional fish farming \u2013 kept most canals fully functioning. Today, the villagers see better water management as the foremost requirement to return to their previous status of crop production.

This task cannot be carried out by community labour without the support of public works. Political support for these infrastructure investments, however, seems lacking. In the coastal region it is crucial to maintain an adequate supply of fresh water and prevent incursion of saline water through the management of sluice gates. In order to prevent water salinity, control of sluice gates is critical. Sluice gates are managed by relevant local extension departments to allow fresh water into the crop area during the wet season and prevent saline water to incur during the dry season. A committee of elected members, informal community-based organizations and cooperatives monitor water levels. All villagers have the same level of access to the provision of fresh water from rivers and canals; however, participants claim that the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA16) prioritize the concerns and needs of large landholders in considering control of the sluice gates. The two communities in Cambodia face different issues. While the \u201crecession rice\u201d community is well adapted to the rise and ebb of the natural water cycle, managing two crops before and after the floods, they remain at risk should the water cycle change as in, e.g., an extreme weather event. Extreme flooding puts their livelihoods at risk as they could potentially lose an entire crop. On the other hand, in Koul the issue is rather one of access to water. Even though there is a canal running through community territory this canal does not hold water year-round. It is only sufficient for supplementary irrigation during the wet season. Similarly, those households not adjacent to the canal do not benefit from stored water, since there is no system of distributary canals in place. Some get by with supplementary ground water wells if they are able to afford them (advantaged and medium households only). During the dry season agricultural water remains a highly sought commodity, to the extent that it may become unfeasible. Currently, all villagers have given up on dry season agriculture as the last two seasons have proven to provide insufficient water for a full dry season crop. Historically, that has not been the case and dry season crops (various kinds) were grown in the village. Today, residents prefer to find work in or around the growing urban centre of Phnom Penh. 16 This authority has since split into two separate units: the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) and the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB). 17 Market interventions In Kapalfuli, due to better infrastructure and road communication farmers have better access to local markets and are able to exchange goods at the district town. Such access has enabled them to develop a more diversified economy. In Labonkhola, due to its inaccessibility and poor access to agricultural inputs the shrimp industry is monopolizing land use, and most farmers have little control or information on pricing and often incur losses as a result. Involvement in small business or paid labour ultimately diversifies the livelihood portfolio of rural agricultural societies. Due to extreme salinity levels and other hazards, households in these villages are no longer fully dependent on agriculture. The need for cash forces households to apply a diversified income strategy. However, while off-farm income is mostly brought to Labonkhola through seasonal migration to construction sites, Kapalfuli is able to diversify both in-village production, such as cash crops and small businesses as well as external income through a larger range of opportunities in urban centres. In Labonkhola NGOs such as Prodipon provide loans to farmers to start non-farm income activities. Advantaged and the medium households mostly run grocery shops, while the disadvantaged are mostly involved in petty business. As natural hazards increase (increasing frequency of cyclones, increasing levels of salinity) along with the decline in agricultural productivity, villagers stated they are trying to adopt other means of securing livelihoods (Box 3). Through the creation of markets farmers are now reverting to poultry, fisheries, homestead gardening, tree plantation, petty business, rickshaw-van pulling, etc., to gain extra income. In Labonkhola, more than 80% of the villagers engage in rickshaw pulling as an alternative income source.

Source: Household interviews conducted by SERDI staff in 2011. 18 In both communities, local informal institutions inspired the emergence of poultry farming among all types of households. This has increased their ability to cope with adverse situations. Local markets provide access to inputs for poultry as well as an avenue for sale of animals. In Kapalfuli, some households are entering in joint, profit-sharing poultry ventures with other households. In Labonkhola, poultry is carried out by the advantaged and medium farmers. In addition, by taking experiences from them, medium and disadvantaged are inspired to venture into poultry farming as well. In the two Cambodian communities the international NGO International Development Enterprises (IDE) is working through \u201cFarmer Business Advisors\u201d \u2013 essentially, model farmers \u2013 to promote agricultural production for sale at local markets. Rather than seeking income outside of the community, the program is designed to create business opportunities in the village by, e.g., promoting a secondary crop that can be marketed (maize, mungbean) or planting vegetables during the dry season using small-scale irrigation facilities (groundwater wells, small reservoirs). Household capabilities Farmers in the Bangladesh study areas seasonally migrate to neighbouring, more advantaged areas. This usually occurs, when the croplands remain fallow or crops do not reach maturity to harvest. Advantaged households do not need to migrate; on the contrary, they are usually recipients of seasonal migrants for farm labour. In Kapalfuli, around 25% of the population (medium and disadvantaged) migrate from the village to spread risks should crops fail or yields falter. In Labonkhola, before the introduction of shrimp farming in the 1990s, seasonal or temporary migration was rare as labour was needed year-round (rice cultivation during wet season and secondary crops during the dry season). Under conditions of shrimp cultivation, almost 100% of the disadvantaged and 50% of the medium farmers migrate after harvesting rice as shrimp cultivation does not require the amount of labour available in the village. Local NGOs have supported rural women to get involved in homestead gardening and grow cabbage, cauliflower, brinjals, pumpkins, ladies finger, gourd, kidney beans and other vegetables. Over the last 5 years, farmers are more inclined to cultivate homestead trees in their courtyard. Trees that bear fruit and those that can be sold for wood production are favoured to meet subsistence needs and provide income to the household. In rural parts of Bangladesh, women of medium and disadvantaged classes are mostly supported in handicrafts by local institutions and the influence of kin and neighbour networks. As a result, rural women are able to contribute in household income. In Labonkhola, through a joint venture of Heed Bangladesh and Father Rudi women are sewing Nakshikatha. Gradually a cottage industry is developing within the village, helping the women to become self-sufficient. Women sew the kathas in their leisure time, receiving 500tk (approx. USD 7.00) for one item.

This saves them from spending on food items and keeps those individuals busy who opt to stay behind during the dry season. In 2010, forty hectares of vegetables have been planted throughout the village of Koul, which has been made possible since the installation of the canal that retains rainwater during much of the dry season. In addition, they use techniques adopted by IDE, such as composting, and apply them to their homestead vegetable plots.17 The main adaptive strategy for Koul, however, seems to be migration. According to residents, an increasing number of seasonal migrants choose not to return during the wet season to plant rice. Rather, they find it more lucrative to work in the garment factories and constructions sites. Residents claim that most migrants eventually return to establish a household and revert to farming rice. The fact is, however, that the Koul community is losing inhabitants and, thus, farm labour. As early as 2008 close to a third of rural households in Svay Rieng District has at least one member working in the private sector (NCDD 2009). In Koul, over 30% of the population have found work in factories, which represents a strong pull factor should these jobs become permanent (Table 6). Already, 15% of the population commute beyond the district borders (most likely with the destination Phnom Phenh) to find work. 6. Adaptive capacity in Khulna District, Bangladesh At a broad level Khulna District could be classified as vulnerable to the effects of climate change. However, looking at our two case communities, the picture becomes somewhat differentiated. Geomorphological, geographic, infrastructural, social and institutional factors determine the adaptive capacity of communities and households to deal with the primary effects of climate change in South West Bangladesh. Thus, different communities in Khulna district deal with very different types of climate change effects due to varying levels of adaptive capacity. Thus, interventions and practices introduced affect each community differently. For example while structural interventions like improved polders may be suitable for communities experiencing intermittent salinity intrusion from storm surges, they often exacerbate the problem in communities already suffering from intense salinity intrusion. The most prominent climatic hazards in Khulna are (a) salinity; (b) increased frequency of cyclones; and (c) changing monsoonal patterns. Each of these phenomena can be further disaggregated: \uf0b7 Water salinity; soil salinity \uf0b7 Wind, storm surge, and flood hazards associated with cyclones \uf0b7 Quantity and seasonality/temporality of precipitation. Each of these phenomena requires different types of adaptation. Hence, adaptation is not a matter of changing a few activities, e.g. applying more fertilizer to maintain production, but 17 These activities were part of the implementation of the project Developing multi-scale climate change adaptation strategies for farming communities in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Bangladesh and India. IDE is a partner in this project and much of the Cambodian data in this report stems from observations made from either CSIRO or IDE staff. 20 requires a process of transformation of approach(es) that takes into account ramifications of adaptation for the entire production-consumption system of the community. Equally, it is difficult to speak of adaptation as such, as each of these phenomena is characteristically different. For example, salinity is an ongoing, slow-onset threat to livelihoods but does not necessarily endanger lives directly. On the other hand, cyclones are (increasingly frequent) events that often lead to major loss of life but sometimes livelihoods can be rebuilt in a relatively short time span following their occurrence. Not only do the varying characteristics of what \u201cclimate change\u201d means to different communities determine the ability and capacity to adapt. It is also the specific set of resources available to and their respective access by the communities that differentiate potentials for adaptation. Three aspects can be identified here: a Kind/type of resources available b Amount/quantity of resources c Range/distribution of varying resources In addition to geomorphological factors, the institutional setting plays a rather important role as to which resources are available in a particular community and how they can be accessed. In fact, institutions govern the availability of resources, which, in turn, determine the level of adaptive capacity of a community or household.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dd8033d2-5e36-44c7-b2cc-ca5825f69495": {"__data__": {"id_": "dd8033d2-5e36-44c7-b2cc-ca5825f69495", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/09", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/09", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/09", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "94937a62f8562ee6308d29ac93bbfaf4932cd784db5f5575d140541aa0617112"}, "2": {"node_id": "72d8c355-15dd-4c33-9e11-bebb457f1c7f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/09", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "749cecad5c6b891302871738ababb416d8ac41d570fcb13e99e8805ccdbdc31c"}}, "hash": "cc6b1b1611531c85c416ebc9e92442b76a5a91a51433718f94ed65f7a70af00e", "text": "Even though the two case communities, Kapalfuli and Labonkhola, are located in the same general area (same political district, same geographic area along the Sundarban Delta) they are characteristically quite different in terms of resource use and institutional governance.

Before going into this analysis, however, the key physical difference needs to be pointed out, which strongly affect the differences in the scale of exposure to climate change effects. Both areas are bounded by coastal embankment; equally, both communities are in close proximity to the sea and are situated in the same risk zone. However, the exposure to storm surges, flooding, and salinity is higher the further downstream a community is located. Storm surges affect those communities within closer reach to the open sea. Due to the frequency of these events, Polders tend to become dysfunctional earlier, i.e. more and more frequent maintenance work is required. This issue is evidenced by the devastation of Polder 32 following cyclone Aila in September 2009. The Polder wall was destroyed intruding water destroyed houses and agricultural fields. The population now still lives in temporary shelters on the Polder wall. There is no agricultural activity. Men are off working as labourers in other areas and the women and children remain at home without occupation. They are supplied with small amounts of rice from the government, but nowhere near enough to satisfy daily needs. Thus, regardless of resource management and institutional arrangements, Labonkhola will always be struggling with greater external pressures and constraints than Kapalfuli due to its physical location. Remoteness In part due to the location further downstream or closer to the sea, as well as the nature of the landscape, which is ridden by rivers, canals, streams, and other waterways, Labonkhola is far 21 more difficult to reach by vehicle than Kapalfuli, which is more easily accessible via main roads and geographically closer to the district centre. Most major road arteries in Bangladesh are built along an East-West axis, i.e. perpendicular to the major water arteries. Communities lying in the extreme South of the country often are not well connected to the road network, which gives them a disadvantage in terms of transport connectivity. Such is the case of Dacope sub-district, where Labonkhola is located. Closely linked with the lack of road connectivity is another type of remoteness \u2013 lack of full institutional integration into the Government\u2019s administrative system. When accessibility is limited, local power structures tend to become more important than those imposed by the Government. The emergence of local big men, i.e. local leaders with power or wealth, becomes more evident and parallel structure of leadership replace the Government\u2019s bureaucratic arrangements (Devine 2000; Sarker 2006). In Labonkhola two types of informal power figures are discernible: (a) traditional (Hindu) leaders with a community-sanctioned power base; and (b) modern (Muslim) middlemen connected to the shrimp industry who act as link between shrimp producers and the shrimp value chain (Islam 2007). While the latter have risen in influence in this previously Hindu- dominated community, the former remain important because government institutions have been slow in establishing their authority over community matters. Kapalfuli, on the other hand is more \u201cmainstreamed\u201d as the formal institutions (local authorities, formal political parties) have gained a foothold and there is no single institution dominating the community. Economic structure Due to the over-reliance on shrimp cultivation - a \u201ccash crop\u201d - in Labonkhola, the shrimp industry has been dominating the community\u2019s economic structure. Islam (2007) describes how this fertile region has come under the control of the industry, with local middlemen controlling all economic activities, including access to loans and provision of agricultural inputs. The farmers are disadvantaged in this process. The quasi-monopolised structure is supported by the central government policy on promoting the shrimp industry in Bangladesh, which is the second-most valuable industry in the country18. Thus, even if farmers intend to move away from shrimp farming they cannot easily do so as other options are not easily accessible (for alternatives, see Box 6). In addition, shrimp farming exacerbates salinity levels and, to a certain degree, encourages the intrusion of salt water on agricultural land. Consequently, other agricultural options are minimised, even if they are actively sought. On the other hand, Kapalfuli displays a more diversified economic structure. While prawn cultivation is practiced by some farmers it has not taken dominance over other activities.

Whereas in 18 Relevant Government policies are the \u201cShrimp Mohal Management Policy (1992)\u201d which identified and declared shrimp areas; the \u201cNational Land Use Policy (2001)\u201d, which allocated land for shrimp culture through zoning; and the \u201cExport policy (1997-2002)\u201d which promoted export and consequently shrimp cultivation. 22 Labonkhola, farmers are in the hands of industry middlemen, Kapalfuli farmers are \u201cself- employed\u201d and may chose to sell their produce at their own quantity and timing. Community action The history of land claiming in Bangladesh involves large-scale public works and major government investments into infrastructure, drainage, water management and, most importantly the construction of massive Polders. These dykes protect the land from the incursion of brackish water from the delta. A system of sluice gates allows regulating water levels. Initially, the Government took on managing the sluice gates (opening/shutting, maintenance, cleaning) itself. Community members were trained and given a salary and a permanent house to perform duties as sluice gate masters. Due to budget cuts, these positions eventually got slashed and communities were left to manage the sluice gates by themselves. This has turned out to work better in some communities than in others. Comparing the two case communities, sluice gate management seems to work better in Kapalfuli whereas in Labonkhola sluice gates are clogged with debris and apparently dysfunctional, exacerbating the intrusion of saline river water during the dry season. Kapalfuli, due to its higher levels of social integration as well as the lack of internal conflict over resources, has managed to establish a functioning management committee to regulate and maintain sluice gates. Smallholders in Kapalfuli follow a common objective, i.e. preserving available fresh water for irrigation while preventing incursion of saline water. They have the capacity to self-organise and assign responsibility to individuals to assure proper management of the sluice gates. While this still entails issues, such as whether the farmers of Kapalfuli have adequate information regarding seasonal water availability and how the decision is made to open or shut the gates, the system, based on community action, works well for the inhabitants. While the previous government-paid position of sluice gate master endowed an individual with an advantage and control over the village\u2019s water management the current system allows for greater ownership by the community and independent control over its assets19. On the other hand, in Labonkhola two issues prevent the proper management of sluice gates. Firstly, the lack of horizontal social networks (see section below) largely decreases the community\u2019s ability to install mechanisms of community action to address the management of its assets. Traditional institutions of arbitration and administration have virtually dissolved and have not been replaced by modern institutions of the state. Secondly, there is actually no agreement over the objectives of sluice gate management. While shrimp cultivators encourage the incursion of saline water onto their land, rice farmers seek to prevent this. The result is that gates are opened and shut arbitrarily and, due to poor maintenance, tend to clog up and become unusable. 19 This phenomenon is comparable to the debate in economics around common-pool resource management, which allows for the community taking responsibility in managing its resources without the need of government intervention. In this case, however, the resource is not a natural resource but infrastructure. We believe, however, the concept could be extended to common infrastructure as well (cf. Wade 1987; Bromley and Cernea 1989; Ostrom et al. 1999). 23 In Labonkhola, community based organizations, cooperatives and neighbour and kin networks are coming to terms with the long-term environmental and economic loss associated with shrimp farming. They are taking initiatives to phase out this activity against the vested interest of the shrimp industry. This insight was further enhanced by spells of disease in shrimp ponds that led to widespread loss and exposed the risks of their venture. While prawn farming is touted as a sustainable alternative to shrimp, its market value is lower and it also comes with environmental baggage (see Box 1, above). In the view of many villagers, reverting back to wet-season rice complemented by saline-tolerant cash crops and seasonal labour migration would better ensure long-term livelihoods (Rashid Bhuyan 2010).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c75a0a12-2692-4f61-946d-54e51460885f": {"__data__": {"id_": "c75a0a12-2692-4f61-946d-54e51460885f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/09", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/09", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/09", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "afd2907f651ab01f1c0e1822950d5bf1db4c494f6010648338df6de62d9c6fce"}, "2": {"node_id": "13d288cb-9608-4ca4-8b3f-c9de4abbd963", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/09", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aa5ff7c14c21f68c19c1ec5d609db20640bc5362e99836c3da8f95cd0cbad2b1"}}, "hash": "92f0da4d41016ff265bba0e9f387def655d61aa91032759a7041e1123c3ea6f3", "text": "Social structure Kapalfuli could be characterised as a \u201ctraditional\u201d village, based on subsistence agriculture with an objective of food security and additional surplus production being marketed for necessary cash income.

The relatively high number of large landholdings demands agricultural labour. Workers enter in a traditional patron-client relationship with landowners and receive, in addition to financial reimbursement, food and the landowners\u2019 responsibility to look after their labourers in times of need (cf. Scott 1976 1985)20. This moral responsibility of those better-off towards people employed by them is embedded in the concept of community solidarity in Bangladeshi culture and transcends religious and ethnic boundaries. In times of strife this sort of relationship \u2013 albeit exploitative in nature \u2013 mitigates impacts through provision of basic needs. Similarly, there are neighbourly responsibilities as well as those within the family, which, together with established work relations make up a \u201chorizontal\u201d social network (Datta 1991; Van Schendel 1986; Chen 1986) that boosts adaptive capacity of community members in villages like Kapalfuli. In contrast, Labonkhola is not characterised by such intense lateral networks within the community. Due to the hierarchical nature of the economic relations that come with shrimp farming, as well as the fact that the relations between individuals are purely transactional without traditional obligations involved, networks are \u201cvertical\u201d, i.e. they follow the supply chain. This implies that the moral obligation for reciprocity in times of crisis is weaker. If a farmer cannot deliver produce the buyers may just turn to the next producer. As a consequence, community solidarity is weakened as traditional social relations become irrelevant and inter-community competition increases (Hartmann and James 1983). The farmer becomes dependent on the shrimp industry and options to draw resources from elsewhere become drastically limited. The consequence of the contrasting social relationships in the two communities is that households in Kapalfuli, even if they may show indications of low adaptive capacity (low 20 More recently, however, changes can be observed in traditional patron-client systems in rural Bangladesh. Landowners have been moving out of the rural areas into urban centres. As absentee landlords, they lease out land or employ a managers and labourers. In this case, landlords are usually concerned with the financial gain from the farm and, in case of a disaster, tend to omit support for their staff on-farm (cf. Scott 1972). 24 income levels, little or no landholdings, lack of economic assets) can cope with unforseen events due to stable and traditionally regulated social relationships. On the other hand, while Labonkhola farmers may earn income and economic assets are available, their brittle social networks tend to falter in times of crisis. The adaptive capacity of disadvantaged households in Kapalfuli depends on the moral responsibility of those with sufficient assets. In Labonkhola the adaptive capacity of all households is mediated by the shrimp industry, which does not need to abide to moral obligations. 7. Adaptive capacity in Svay Rieng Province, Cambodia Whereas in the Bangladesh cases we have found one community likely to have a higher potential for adaptive capacity, the two cases in Cambodia, while economically and structurally different, seem to each have their own set of issues that tend to keep adaptive capacity low in both cases. On one hand one could argue that Chey Ressey has successfully adapted to current economic demands and ecological limitations. Households have adapted their pattern of agricultural production to the hydrological cycle of the delta. They successfully do so by achieving two harvests of rice and have the potential to improve by adding secondary crops in the interim seasons. The cropping pattern keeps the labour in the community and there is little need to enter potentially exploitative labour relations with the industrial sector. Economic structure In terms of economic relations, however, the households of Chey Ressey have entered into agreements with Vietnamese traders that keep them dependent with little hope of exiting this relation quickly. They rely on the Vietnamese for seeds, agricultural inputs and loans, which is exactly the sort of vertical integration into the supply chain that Labonkhola has adopted in the case of shrimp farming. The traders naturally have more leverage in this quasi- monopolistic structure and, analogous to the shrimp case, it keeps the households of Chey Ressey poor. Poverty, in turn, keeps the potential for adaptation low. Infrastructure The other case of Koul suffers largely from the ecological limitations it is presented with. Even though it is situated in a delta, Koul is suffering from the lack of access to agricultural water during the dry season. With not much to do, other options, such as working in the garment factories on the fringes of Phnom Penh, become attractive and the recipe for rural", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "85eba972-0a2a-4f46-a5ba-34a1744bea64": {"__data__": {"id_": "85eba972-0a2a-4f46-a5ba-34a1744bea64", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/09", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/09", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/09", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d59eb0c10655fefb5117d1631783bf224347089ba3cd2259411abb226c8106af"}}, "hash": "d59eb0c10655fefb5117d1631783bf224347089ba3cd2259411abb226c8106af", "text": "flight is laid. With little choice left than to turn to where the income opportunities are, households in Koul cannot be said to have high adaptive capacity either. Even if progress is made in terms of providing agricultural options for secondary crops the doubt remains whether these would be able to outweigh the lure of fast cash earned in the factories. The story would be a different one if Koul were given access to a perennial supply of irrigation water. In this case livelihoods could be re-built around agricultural production in the community. These resources, however, would require major investments by the government as the situation is not one that the community itself can resolve on its own. In sum, both communities suffer from the lack of opportunities to adapt. While Chey Ressey is locked into a cycle of borrowing, provision of inputs and guaranteed buy-back, which it 25 finds hard to break, the situation in Koul responds to the lack of adequate local resources. While they have both adapted to their current situation, adaptive capacity in both cases remains low due to their inflexibility to respond to new situations arising due to climate change. For example, Chey Ressey will find it difficult to respond to increased flooding by introducing new, flood-tolerant varieties due to its fixation on VN504. Similarly, Koul will only be able to respond to increasing climate variability by sending off more seasonal migrants who will eventually turn into temporary or permanent migrants, thus adding to decreased adaptive capacity in the urban hubs21. 8. Differential Adaptation Even when dealing with slow-onset impacts of climate change, such as the dominating issue of salinity, the adaptive capacity in Kapalfuli can be assessed as higher due to the higher levels of economic diversification in the community. Risk is mitigated through a focus on subsistence and surplus marketing. In addition, the diversity of agricultural products leads to lower dependency on a particular supply chain as is the case in Labonkhola. Cattle, dry season crops, fish, prawn and even shrimp are sold off to markets without needing to buy inputs, get credit, or sell to a certain trader. Farmers in Kapalfuli will sell when they need to and may \u2018shop around\u2019 for the best available price. Due to their better connectedness to the district market they have access to a range of buyers and use competition among traders to their advantage. The focus on food security even allows them not to sell should they not produce sufficient amounts or decide to use them for self-consumption. Social relations in Kapalfuli further increases adaptive capacity as traditional local dependencies create a culture of looking after fellow villagers, even if the relationships are inherently exploitative. The fact that people are known personally, and villagers share their private as well as public lives in the well-integrated village leads to households supporting each other in order to maintain the relationship after the crisis, which is often of mutual benefit. On the other hand, shrimp farming in Labonkhola is unsustainable and is crowding out other forms of land use and therefore decreasing diversity of resource use in the community. This, combined with the monopolistic economic structure of the shrimp production system decreases their adaptive capacity to a degree that alternative resource use becomes impossible. In a situation lacking other options, if resources required in shrimp production deteriorate, e.g., due to heat stress or disease, households are left with little else to make a living. Any adaptation strategy in the study area needs to target the entire livelihood portfolio of the communities\u2019 households. Rather than searching for \u201csilver bullet\u201d solutions adaptation must cross-cut the various activities households engage in. This promotes mitigation of risk and increases the probability of adaptation success. Contrary to \u201crevolutions\u201d (green, blue) experienced in past decades it seems indicated that remaining true to the term \u201cadaptation\u201d is more likely to be successful, i.e. gradual, incremental change according to what the current situation and the foreseeable future demands. The following section looks into the areas of potential adaptation developments. 21 For the increasing vulnerability of urban populations to climate change see IPCC (2007); for initial research on the relation between climate change and urbanisation see Kolmannskog (2009). 26 Extreme climatic variability is dwindling agricultural production and leads to long-term degradation. The Third IPCC report identifies crop production in low-lying developing countries to suffer most from adverse agro-climatic conditions (IPCC 2007). In order to mitigate such enormous financial and environmental loss farmers of different household types in the studied villages have diversified their livelihood options along with cropping.

Transaction costs are high and ownership is low. Only the most desperate will engage with the level of risk involved; (b) current adaptation strategies are, by definition, adaptations to an ongoing process of change. By having adapted, it shows that farming households have capacity to do so, even if adaptations have not proven successful; and (c) screening current adaptations regarding their suitability seems more cost-efficient than introducing new practices. In addition, even when introducing new technologies it seems reasonable to look for locally acceptable entry points rather than forcing resource-disadvantaged populations into high-risk transitions. Cropping Agriculture plays a crucial role in the rural livelihoods context of Bangladesh. Different types of farm households diversify their livelihood options based on agriculture as these options are more available to them as they have good knowledge and experience of activities like livestock rearing, poultry, renting of agricultural equipments and so on. The on-farm livelihood options for different types of households are described below. Cropping or growing of seasonal crops is still the most prominent option of livelihoods in the salinity-prone coastal belt. In both communities, cropping is the main livelihood option for advantaged, medium and disadvantaged households types as farming has been handed down from generation to generation. The advantaged farmers of both villages earn sufficient income from cultivating their 6-10 bighas (0.8-1.3ha) of arable land. The medium and disadvantaged household types achieve lower yields than advantaged farmers due to poor capability to adopt better equipment and practices. However, the location of land is also important with some advantaged farmers producing less due to the close proximity of their croplands to the Polder and/or salinity-prone zones. Cropping is currently not an option for the marginal farmers and landless as they have so far been unable to purchase land due to disadvantaged financial capital and the distrust of other villagers. Rent out farm machineries Renting out agricultural equipment such as tractors, shallow tube wells, pumps and power tillers have become crucial secondary income source during crisis periods. This is predominantly an option for the advantaged farmer type as the initial investment makes it less viable for disadvantaged and medium household types. In both villages, machines are rented 27 on an hourly basis. For instance, shallow machines cost around 60-70 tk (approx. USD 0.8- 0.9) per hour, whereas a tractor costs around 700 tk (approx. USD 9.5) per hour. Homestead gardening Growing vegetables is also profitable, with the price of vegetables increasing due to low yields from other agricultural crops. Women have started with homestead gardening around ponds or other available space. Common products grown include gourd, beans, brinjal, peas and spinach. Growing vegetables has the dual purpose of meeting subsistence needs, with the option to sell excess on the market. The larger land area available to advantaged and medium class household types mean this is a viable option for them. In contrast, the extent of home gardens in disadvantaged and marginal types is much smaller due to land and time constraints. Aquaculture/fishing Fish culture and fishing in water bodies is an alternative livelihood option for households in the coastal belts. Fishing and shrimp cultivation has been a prominent livelihood option in Labonkhola village (see Box 4 for an example of fishing as a main livelihood activity). Advantaged household types used to cultivate prawn on their own gher in order to guard against theft and increase profits. Medium and disadvantaged types pooled resources to cultivate on gonogher \u2013 community-based ponds - and shared profits.

Though the yield of agricultural crops is low due to salinity levels, they engage in rice cultivation in addition to growing saline-tolerant marketable crops, such as cowpea, sesame and watermelon (Rashid Bhuyan2010). More recently, the Department of Fisheries is promoting the \u201crice-fish\u201d system to diversify income sources (see Box 5). 28 Box 5: The Rice-Fish system: a viable adaptation option? The Department of Fisheries in Bangladesh are heavily promoting a system of integrated rice-fish production in Khulna District as a way to wean farmers off shrimp cultivation and provide an alternative income source. In fact, legislation nominally discourages shrimp (not prawn) cultivation because of its relation to problems with salinity. However, ex-shrimp farmers struggle to find alternative income sources. For rice-fish to be feasible canals must be dug between the rice field and bunds (see Fig.1.). The surrounding canals breed fish, such as bethi, monosex tilapia, mirror carp or nilotina. Fertilisers used in rice cultivation also serve as feed for fish. In turn, fish faeces have fertilisation effects on rice production. Figure 1: Bird\u2019s-eye and transect sketch of the rice-fish system as promoted by the Fisheries Department of Khulna District. According to the district fisheries official interviewed, the system requires an initial investment in landscaping for the farmer and only works in moderately saline fields. Fish fingerlings are available from commercial hatcheries. The Fisheries Department regards the fish-rice system as a viable alternative to shrimp and it is catching on slowly among ex-shrimp cultivators. The system reduces rice production area by 20-25%, which is offset by expected benefits from fish sales. The initial costs are high (excavation, purchase of fingerlings) and farmers need training and cash for start-up. There are various options for single species or multiple species management including three species of fish or carp plus prawns. One limiting factor, however, is that fresh water needs to be available for 8-10 months per year. Fingerlings also need to be available at the right time from the hatchery. According to Tuong and Hoanh (2009) rice cultivation is a low-risk enterprise but limits opportunities for income generation. Shrimp cultivation, on the other hand, can be profitable but depends on the supply chain and risks involved are higher (prices, disease). Rice-fish may be a combination, which ensures food security for farmers but allows for profits from fish without too many environmental trade-offs and risks involved. Polyculture, if managed sustainably, can increase overall food production and contribute to the development of coastal areas (Ahmed and Garnett 2011; Tuong and Hoanh 2009). Nevertheless, there are some factors that inhibit scaling-out of rice-fish: (a) the above-mentioned initial investment costs; (b) higher production costs (input costs) than monoculture rice; (c) lack of farmers\u2019 technical knowledge concerning the management of fisheries; (d) risks associated with flood and drought in the deltas; (e) poor water quality; (f) fish mortality due to heavy use of pesticides or rising temperatures. It seems, however, that rice-fish is a viable option to deal with the issues associated with shrimp as well as providing benefits to smallholders in terms of alternative income generation (cf. Ahmed et al. 2011; Ahmed and Garnett 2011). B un d Ca na l Rice field 29 In Kapalfuli all types of farmers have ponds near their homestead.

USD 1,243) on local chicken each year. Source: Household interviews conducted by SERDI staff in 2011. Livestock rearing Livestock rearing plays an important role to cope with any disasters or times of crises. However over the last ten years, livestock rearing has been in decline. According to the villagers of Kapalfuli, the decline is due to extreme heat, which has reduced fodder available for cattle. Previously, 1 bundle of straw cost 20tk (approx. USD 0.3), now it can cost up to 200tk (approx. USD 3.00). Land use change and conversion of grazing areas to shrimp ponds may be another factor. In addition, power tillers have replaced cattle to plough land and cattle are thereby losing their previous multi-functionality. In Labonkhola the situation is more extreme since the disadvantaged and marginal household types lack enough financial capital to invest in cattle, while the extreme salinity of the soil restricts the cultivation of forages. Some households in the advantaged household type have entered into shared cattle arrangements with medium and disadvantaged households, sharing equal profits when cattle are sold. 30 Business Due to increasing climatic hazard, villagers of both areas do not get optimal levels of return from on-farm activities22. As a result they secure cash income with on-farm activities. The following off-farm activities are preferable additional livelihood options regardless of agriculture activities. Business is the fastest-evolving livelihood option in both communities. Advantaged households are involved in stock businesses, grocery and also renting out agricultural equipment. In some instances, these households are able to store excess paddy and sell it in the local market during the peak demand at a higher price. The other types do not have the resources to undertake this type of activity, however, as with share-poultry and livestock, the opportunities of the advantaged household type often filter down to others. Some medium households act as brokers and sell paddy that has been stored by advantaged farmers at the local market and receive a small portion of the profit. Disadvantaged households may have petty/small scale businesses, however, this is rare as they lack financial capital to start up a business of their own. Rather, they most often rely on employment by others. Small official jobs Involvement in small official jobs in the rural areas of Bangladesh ensures better livelihood security. In both villages many of the advantaged and medium farmers are involved in small official jobs, such as teaching, working in banks, NGOs etc. This is an option for a minority of disadvantaged households, whereby low literacy rates of marginal household types rule them out of contention for these jobs. Handicraft Making and selling homemade products to local agents enhances empowerment and mobilization of rural women and contributes to household income. Unlike the advantaged farmer households women of medium and disadvantaged class in Labonkhola village sew Nakshikathas and mats after receiving training from local NGOs. However, women of landless classes are not involved in such handicrafts due to shortage of time since they usually work in wage labour. Through involvement of local NGOs such handicrafts are also emerging in the Kapalfuli village. Wage labour/Rickshaw or van pulling Working as labourers on other people\u2019s land, rickshaw-van pulling or migrant labour enhances the secondary income options and also mitigates the damage from agriculture sources due to increased salinity level in the rural areas (see Box 7 for an example). In both villages, farmers of medium, disadvantaged, and marginal classes earn better livelihoods during the off seasons. They usually migrate to neighbouring districts to work as day labour. Due to social and cultural barriers migration is not an option for the advantaged household types. 22 Or, as it increasingly happens, no return due to cyclone destruction (see \u201cIntroduction\u201d, above). 31 Box 7: Labour migration Devtul Morol (50), small farmer, migrates to neighbouring villages due to decreasing crop production.

Figure 2: Areas of social reality affected by policy to increase adaptive capacity Source: Authors. When interviewing villagers and local officials, demands towards the Central Government are often voiced. The impression is that, if only the Government would allocate resources to certain problematic areas they would automatically be fixed. While the Government (or the \u201cState\u201d) has an important role in setting a regulatory environment that allows adaptation options to develop as well as investing into public infrastructure it cannot enforce adaptive capacity. The community, on the other hand, constantly needs to react to and has the ability to develop adaptations to certain environmental (and others, including State-induced) stresses, as does the household. Lastly, markets, in their role mediating global demands on local products as well as creating supply chains that offer economic options to rural farmers can assume roles of either promoting or inhibiting local adaptive capacity (Lea and Chaudhri 1983; Bebbington et al. 2006; Smit and Wandel 2006). 32 Policy cannot refer to national policy alone. Otherwise, the sort of hand-out mentality alluded to above prevails. Instead, policy needs to focus on creating an environment that promotes and supports active adaptation by the community. Regulations and incentives devised by policy must be able to encompass visions, targets, and strategies set by the communities as policy is not able to reflect local specific requirements and development aims. Focusing on national policy development alone may create a type of dependency, which potentially reduces adaptive capacity and inhibits self-determined adaptation. The four areas reflected in Figure 2 therefore represent areas of policy development along different hierarchies (household \u2013 community \u2013 state) as well as markets, which are, in itself, multi-level and strongly affect local economic practices. While levels and dimensions can be added, e.g., levels of governance or dimensions of culture, the four identified have the most direct effect on building local adaptive capacity. The issues in decreased adaptive capacity have been identified in the above case studies: single-dimensional social integration along industrial supply chains; monopolistic land use and monoculture that precludes alternative land uses due to environmental degradation (salinisation) and supply chain dependency; as well as lack of community action and community solidarity and remoteness. From these issues, follow a set of policy principles and a number of possible strategies for policy development. According to each strategy, examples are given as to how the actual policies may be realised. It must be stated, however, that this is a research paper and that concrete policies can only be developed with the inclusion of stakeholders and policy-development institutions and follow the respective process in policy development, depending on the country. Policy principles The data presented in this paper suggests that adaptive capacity is highly volatile and depends on a vast number of factors and influences even in a general area considered \u2018vulnerable\u2019. Megadeltas are in itself vulnerable areas, but adaptive capacity, in the cases presented above, depends on geography, economic dependency, community action, and social structure. It follows that large-scale programs devised onto vulnerable areas are unlikely to increase adaptive capacity as they cannot take local specifics into account. Rather, policy should be able to allow for local variation within vulnerable areas and thereby create the space needed by communities to become active in their adaptation processes. From the community cases described above, it becomes evident that the observation and analysis of adaptive capacity cannot be separated from processes of global change. As we look at adaptive capacity in any particular community of a developing country, rapid development occurs simultaneously, as do environmental change, industrialisation, rural- urban migration, etc. For these reasons, assessments of adaptive capacity become historic as soon as they are completed due to the social dynamics occurring at a more rapid pace. Two lessons must be derived here: (a) assessments of adaptive capacity (and vulnerability) are mere snapshots of development and must be treated as such by policy; and (b) adaptation occurs as part of global change and therefore needs to be mainstreamed by policy into other policy development rather than treating it as a separate matter. Hence, adaptive capacity needs to be weaved into rural development policy, economic policy, environmental policy, etc. 33 Policy strategies Having stated that adaptive capacity is highly diverse some overarching strategies, however, emerge by comparison among the four very different communities in Bangladesh and Cambodia.

In order to prevent dependencies arising such as those to the supply chains of shrimp and rice, economic diversification seems to generally strengthen adaptive capacity, at least at the low capitalisation level of communities investigated in this study. We are dealing with communities at the threshold between subsistence and market agriculture. Investing people\u2019s efforts into a single income source to escape poverty seems attractive to them but entails a number of emerging properties that lead to detrimental effects for both standard of living as well as adaptive capacity. Monocropping, especially, can lead into lock-in situations that initially require heavy investments, which may not pay off if the effects of climate change or other external shocks preclude harvesting the returns. Communities that remain risk-averse, keeping one foot firmly in subsistence agriculture to ensure local food security have the ability fall back on it in times of need. Similarly, if investment capital is spread across different business ventures, such as cash crops, rickshaw driving, handicrafts, etc., then dependencies are prevented should the supply chain ever fail. Local adaptive capacity can only be supported through strengthening local institutions. National level policies are too broadly conceived to respond to local requirements or specific needs. National policies can, however, strengthen national institutions to support local institutions for informed decision making. Local institutions, on the other hand, are able to identify needs, report them, set targets, and build strategies around them. Local institutions could be Government institutions (e.g., local offices of line ministries, such as agricultural extension) but could also be community institutions, such as farmer groups, water management committees, community advisory boards, etc. Furnished with clear objectives, mandates and resources, such institutions could act as the \u2018eyes and ears\u2019 on the ground and detect deficiencies as well as recommend solutions. Creating equitable and representative local institutions can support community solidarity and working towards common goals. They could also act as monitors to assess the efficiency of national policy when implemented locally. National policies on adaptive capacity need to shy away from patronising communities. Rather they should work towards creating an enabling environment for adaptive capacity to develop. Just as the community is dependent on policy directions by the state, the national Government is dependent on local communities to adapt to current and future climatic change. Any policy on adaptive capacity, therefore, must take into account the mutual dependencies between various levels of governance rather than using communities merely as playing fields for policies to pan out. The following sections provide a few examples for possible policies along each of the four dimensions, namely (a) household; (b) community; (c) Government; and (d) markets (Figure 2). 34 Household The household level is the locus of specific measures of adaptation. One of the more successful ones has been mentioned in the report, above. The adoption of rice-fish systems as an alternative to detrimental shrimp cultivation has proven viable to farming households while still following the principles introduced through shrimp. Fish production provides real income to households (albeit initially at lower levels than shrimp) while rice ensures food security. As added benefits, households are less dependent on monopolistic traders for their product but can make use of trader competition or even choose to sell locally. Rice-fish has far less negative effects on soils and water than shrimp and households do not depend heavily on the industry to provide inputs. These insights are slowly catching traction in Bangladesh, both, among the shrimp-producing households as well as government offices, such as the Department of Fisheries, which promotes rice-fish and offers training to convert rice paddies. Community This study shows that community action and community structure can make the difference between high and low potential adaptive capacities. Hence, there needs to be a focus on functioning and integrated communities to provide opportunities for adaptation strategies. As in the case of sluice gate management, the community is able to manage such resources at the local level. A high degree of community solidarity and well-integrated horizontal networks support common-property resource management and thereby improve adaptive capacity. Farmer groups or water management committees could enable autonomous management of water run-off and storage when needed and provide water to those who need it. Such clearly identifiable institutions have the additional benefit of being able to be targeted by NGOs or national government for support in order to further strengthen adaptive capacity. Government Government must assume the responsibility to maintain protective infrastructure, such as Polders, irrigation canals and stormwater drainage. No single community can afford to maintain infrastructure", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4b7bce66-6d90-45a3-b805-5783a6fc9a7b": {"__data__": {"id_": "4b7bce66-6d90-45a3-b805-5783a6fc9a7b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/09", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/09", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/09", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "49fa90f148c0ea4d632065f832620a7330ad9d878ed0c42dd3a9df46bf73096d"}}, "hash": "49fa90f148c0ea4d632065f832620a7330ad9d878ed0c42dd3a9df46bf73096d", "text": "on this scale and it is crucial for adaptive capacity to be able to adequately access the critical resources land and water. Large infrastructure performs that task, however, only if it is adequately maintained and protected. Under this prerequisite there are various ways of enacting infrastructure maintenance, such as co-investing into infrastructure maintenance costs (state, community, and industry), establishing repair funds, direct intervention, etc. In remote areas connectedness makes a huge difference in the potential for adaptive capacity. If we accept the assumption that adaptive capacity is essentially a function of livelihood diversity and opportunities, interconnectivity with markets and service provision is key. It usually falls into the responsibility of government at various levels to allocate budgets to road construction and diligent planning in this area is crucial. To assist farmers in adapting agricultural activities to changing weather patterns it appears crucial to make efforts in providing them with up-to-date information on forecasts for as long a period as possible. While research is improving the capacity for seasonal forecasting of weather patterns this information must be provided to farming households timely and easily understandable. 35 Most governments entertain agricultural research organisations to improve production of this sector. It seems mandated, today, that increasing production cannot be the only objective of these organisations. Rather, they need to include climate projections and their on-ground symptoms into their analyses and solutions development. For example, CARDI in Cambodia is putting stronger emphasis on developing flood and drought tolerant varieties and disseminating them to farmers. Similarly, BRRI and BARI in Bangladesh are experimenting with salinity tolerance of existing market crops, such as cowpea, mungbean, watermelon, and sesame. The challenge lies in integrating the latest in climate science with agricultural development and extension to assist farming households with knowledge and skills to bolster adaptive capacity. Communities experiencing dependency on single supply chains, as in the examples of shrimp farming or the Vietnamese rice varieties often face the issue of unstable land tenancy as they are battling debt and fending off land grabbing. For example, the expansion of shrimp farming in Bangladesh promotes more advantaged farmers to expand their landholdings as more disadvantaged households must retract because they cannot afford the required inputs. While some revert to labouring in the fields of larger farmers others choose to migrate to urban centres, which puts their land under risk of being usurped by farmers striving to extend their land resources. Government needs to intervene in such cases and establish land security for farming households to appropriately manage their resources. Markets Markets play a crucial role in providing opportunities to farming households. Provided markets allow fair pricing and equitable access to rural households they can act as a major catalyst to improving adaptive capacity. This study contains two cases of quasi-monopolistic structures (Labonkhola and Chey Ressey), which has led to a decrease in adaptive capacity among the affected communities. If markets remain open and households are given opportunities to choose between varying sets of livelihoods the critical parameters of diversity and options can be maintained. Government regulation can support this process. In the case of Chey Ressey, Government has banned export of the variety produced by the community. Instead, it has enabled 10 local varieties to be exported, which ensures quality control, pest management, and responding to international markets. In the case of Chey Ressey, however, the lack of enforcement leads to market failure and, thus, the unfavourable situation the community finds itself. Another possible measure, trialled elsewhere under the UNDPs \u201cAccess to Information Programme (A2I), is active promotion of price transparency to prevent quasi-monopolistic structure to emerge. Programs that deliver daily price updates to cotton farmers in West Bangladesh through text messaging services (SMS) have proven successful as farming households are able to decide when and to whom to conduct their sales to achieve the best price. In this way, market imbalances and intransparency of information are mitigated and farmers can achieve a fairer share of their product. 36 10. Conclusions The comparison of case communities in this study covers communities situated at the top (Mekong) and the very bottom (Sundarban) of a delta. While all are vulnerable, the analysis of adaptive capacity has shown that communities with higher adaptive capacity show a higher diversity of resource use portfolios, horizontally integrated social structure, mature economic structure and the vicinity to market hubs. These communities are more likely to withstand shocks as well as adapt to slow-onset effects of climate change. The recommendations presented here, however, do not imply that communities with lower adaptive capacity should strive to become like the ones identified to have higher adaptive capacity.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "37d1ebd0-a1cb-4f96-a048-99b5b49c1e4d": {"__data__": {"id_": "37d1ebd0-a1cb-4f96-a048-99b5b49c1e4d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/09", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/09", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/09", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7411c1311785c5bfe3c67136c39d36e743903081c039e776562d931856cd02f3"}, "3": {"node_id": "b5cf3d9e-6b0a-4e7e-a666-cad384d35670", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/09", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7477f0368bb06d0fd87684d762725c740da2cdf01ea7c1207a78da9196499721"}}, "hash": "359e5f0187022253ccc87d135aaee29e2b0b9b822b98dce7563f269f0fcbf3db", "text": "Such a goal would be highly unrealistic because of different levels of exposure as well as particular characteristic specific to each community. We can, however draw some lessons through the comparison and extract policy goals that could be achieved and improved in both communities. The communities analysed and compared in this report lie within 'vulnerable' megadeltas (IPCC 2007) and, thus, it could be assumed that similar sets of policy may apply homogenously to develop and support their adaptive capacity to deal with current and prospective climate change symptoms. The study has shown that, while all communities need to deal with the new sets of drivers originating from the changes in global climate, the magnitude of exposure as well as the ability to react to it is significantly different according to local geography, infrastructure, social structure, and economy. Vulnerable areas therefore need to be re-assessed according to differential potentials of adaptive capacity as well as risks involved in inducing social change through policy. Several dimensions of community reality can be observed to generate a richer picture of adaptability, such as agricultural technology, water management, market interventions and household capabilities. This means that it might become necessary to focus future research on internal capabilities, skills, coping mechanisms, and institutions in addition to already well- researched exposure and vulnerability data, such as changes in natural phenomena, frequency of occurrences, and number of (poor) people living in vulnerable areas (cf, e.g., UNDP 2010). Finally, the issue that becomes most apparent when looking at communities affected by climate change, such as those in SW Bangladesh or SE Cambodia, is that it can become virtually impossible to differentiate between processes due to climate change and other external drivers. This is a messy reality that scientists and planners do not appreciate sufficiently as they pose complex problems to analysis and intervention development. Salinity, for example, can be attributed to rising seawater levels. However, there is also a causal link to decreasing run-off due to upstream infrastructure development (Mirza and Sarker 2004). The problem is exacerbated by poor water management and conflicting interests in water usage. The salinity issues, thus becomes one not directly attributable to one cause but also one of climate, environmental, developmental, and social processes as well as power relations. The emergence of such wicked problems (cf. Rittel and Webber 1973) requires clumsy solutions (cf. Verweij et al. 2006), which are complex, require inter- and transdisciplinary approaches and constant reformulation of the problem narrative. An approach to deal with such problems has been put forward by the postnormal science movement (cf., e.g., Funtowicz and Ravetz 1993; Giampietro 2004). 37 References Ahmed, N., E.H. Allison, and J.F.

Since 2000, she had lead extensive sensitive investigations on activities underpinning conflict and structural violence such as corruption, arms trafficking and related resource-trade issues throughout Africa, Asia- Pacific and Europe. She has worked closely with UN Security Council, member-states and other key stakeholders including IFIs, law enforcement agencies, NGOs, and others in order to identify, and drive forward, measures for positive change. Email: ABlondel@NexaWorld.org 2 Abstract Combined with poor governance, climate change represents the largest and most global environmental variable to peace and security and its impacts are set to fall disproportionately on the world\u2019s most vulnerable populations with the Asia Pacific region facing some of the most widespread challenges. However, while the links between climate change and security have been recognised by both the UN General Assembly (UNGA) and the UN Secretary General, the issue remains dangerously peripheral to national, regional and international peace and security strategies. Home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor, half the world\u2019s intra-state conflicts and with its populations more likely to experience natural disasters than any other region in the world, the Asia Pacific region is already facing dire supply and demand challenges. Many states are also already experiencing the adverse effects associated with of climate change, namely: increased extreme weather events, rising sea levels and increased resource scarcity. These are likely to act as \u2018threat-multipliers\u2019 to conflict in areas already facing development and security challenges and where the direct physical effects of climate change will be greatest. Due to inequalities and inadequate social protection programmes, the regions\u2019 most vulnerable are also set to be the most exposed; a dynamic that could have dire humanitarian and security ramifications. However, expected negative effects can be curbed through sound governance at international, regional and national levels. Progress made at the UNGA and discussions held at UNSC levels should be continued. Also, regional resource management can be a basis for peace and stability within and between states and sound national good governance practices must be prioritised. The development of climate-friendly policies not only represent long-term peace and sustainable growth, they also present opportunities for building bridges across communities and countries through comprehensive representation and cooperation.

The knock-on effects of climate change could compound existing low-intensity conflicts, spill insecurities into neighbouring countries and create new bases for insecurity. However, while the links between climate change and security have been recognised by both the UN General Assembly and the UN Secretary General, the issue remains dangerously peripheral to national, regional and international peace and security strategies. \uf0b7 Many Asia Pacific countries are already experiencing the adverse effects of climate change, namely: increased extreme weather events, rising sea levels and increased resource scarcity. These are likely to act as \u2018threat-multipliers\u2019 to conflict in areas already facing development and security challenges and where the direct physical effects of climate change will be greatest, leaving many Asia Pacific countries particularly exposed. The region is home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor and almost half its intra-state conflicts. It is already facing dire supply and demand challenges, and its populations are more likely to experience natural disasters than any other region in the world. \uf0b7 Low-and high-intensity resource-based conflicts in the region have thus far been primarily intra-state and this trend is likely to continue with climate change. Resource-based conflicts are likely to be both within and between sectors and user- groups with causes and effects also crossing state boundaries. Resource-based conflicts in the region already also stretch across borders and this has affected sub- regional stability. \uf0b7 Several overarching conflict risk factors are present and relate primarily to supply and demand dynamics. This is true particularly in regards to water. For example, seven of the world\u2019s greatest rivers, fed by glaciers in the Himalayas and the Tibetan plateau, supply water to roughly 40 per cent of the world\u2019s populations. Yet as these glaciers decline several countries, primarily China where many of Asia\u2019s key rivers originate, may divert waters as their own needs increase. This could adversely impact on other countries, however, and low-intensity conflicts already exist over several proposed dam projects. \uf0b7 Due to inequalities and inadequate social protection programmes, the most vulnerable sectors of society are likely to be the most exposed to the adverse effects of climate change. These are primarily the poor, indigenous peoples, the displaced, women, children and the elderly. If improperly addressed, climate change effects threaten to further impact on these vulnerable social groups; a dynamic that is likely to have humanitarian and security ramifications which may undermine progress toward the UN Millennium Goals (MDGs). 9 \uf0b7 Information with which to form comprehensive and targeted peace and security-based approaches on existing and possible resource conflict faultlines is insufficient and at times contradictory. This is particularly true of smaller-scale tensions and conflicts that easily go unnoticed but could increase with environmental stress. Increasing information on resource-based conflicts is central to developing sound mitigation and adaptation policies. \uf0b7 Regional resource management can be a basis for peace and stability within and between states and this has been true particularly in regards to shared water management.

Recommendations overview The decisions that states and the international community take today directly impact on the vulnerability of populations, sectors, peace and security. However, climate change has been framed primarily within scientific and environmental discourse and less so within contexts of development and security. At national levels, several National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPA) address key issues yet, while there is no one- size-fits-all solution to conflict mitigation and climate change adaptation, these are mostly ad hoc and unlikely to prevent conflict (see 3.1 Existing Mechanisms: Strengths and Weaknesses, page 48). This is also reflected in regional and international approaches. Recommendations are contained in full in section 3.2 Looking Ahead: Risks and Opportunities, page 57. \uf0b7 At the national level, curbing the effects of climate change that could undermine security means increasing information of conflict and natural resource fault-lines, prioritising good governance, and advancing the involvement of local communities and vulnerable groups in the identification of problems and solutions. This could also mean prioritising natural resource management; adjusting domestic demand and trade to alleviate vulnerability in regards to international market fluctuations and local availability. NAPAs and Disaster Risk Reduction (DRRs) strategies should also incorporate conflict prevention and resolution strategies and ensure comprehensive participatory processes; \uf0b7 At the regional level, countries must advance coordination and cooperation based on information sharing and through the development of a regional perspective to countering the effects of climate change with sustainable human development. Regional agreements and mechanisms should also been seen as a coordination of common regional needs and as an opportunity to increase the voice of regional bodies within the international fora. Its growing political and economic strength, particularly through China and India, should be mirrored in their influence in other areas that promote active peace; 10 \uf0b7 At the international level, the international community must advance the issue of climate change and security. Address should span across its multilateral bodies \u2013 with a focus on resource-conflict prevention and should include for example, the UN Security Council and other UN agencies such as the UNEP, UNDP and UNDPA. Support should be garnered for Asia Pacific countries to incorporate resource-conflict mitigation and resolution strategies into national and regional policy and legislation. 1. INTRODUCTION Home to half the world\u2019s poor, the Asia Pacific region is especially vulnerable to resource-based conflicts and the adverse effects of climate change. It is host to a large proportion of the world\u2019s conflicts and its population is especially exposed to humanitarian catastrophes associated with natural disasters. These are predicted to increase as a consequence of climate change and, coupled with societal, economic and political vulnerabilities, leaves some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable states exposed to heightened risk of conflict. On 3 June 2009, the UN General Assembly unanimously adopted Resolution 63/281 titled \u201cClimate change and its possible security implications,\u201d where it invited major UN organs to \u201cintensify efforts in addressing security implications of climate change.\u201d This represented the first formal recognition by the international community of the potential security implications of climate change and recognized the \u201crespective responsibilities of the principal organs of the United Nations, including the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security conferred upon the Security Council\u201d and invited \u201cthe relevant organs of the United Nations, as appropriate and within their respective mandates, to intensify their efforts in considering and addressing climate change, including its possible security implications.\u201d2 This underlined the urgency and need for international, as well as national, attention. However, as highlighted in the 2004 report by the UN High Level Panel,\u201c[r]arely are environmental concerns factored into security, development or humanitarian strategies.

The most crucial variable, however, in the climate change and security dynamic is the timely commitment, 12 or lack thereof, of individual states and the international community. Unaddressed, the effects of climate change threatens to embed destructive dynamics between poor resource management and insecurity, while enhanced local and international governance and resource management would provide a platform for active peace and sustainable development. Climate change represents the most global environmental variable in international peace and security and today\u2019s climate change mitigation and adaptation choices will be central in determining prospects for future peace and sustainable human development.5 Addressing the issue thus necessitates a marriage of strong international coordination and state-based actions with security, governance and sustainable human development at its core. 1.1 Scope of Study The aim of this paper is to present a background to resource-based conflicts and how they may be influenced by climate change in the Asia Pacific region. In so doing, this paper first examines the relationship between security, natural resources, and climate change. Second, this paper looks specifically at this issue in the Asia Pacific region, presenting case studies from South and West Asia, East Asia, and the Pacific. Case studies have been chosen on a basis that they illustrate varying, but not all, areas of concern from across the region. These are glimpses into the problem and do not represent the full scope of issues generally neither in the region nor within countries presented, this paper presents an appraisal of existing address of this issue and explores options for future action that may underpin peace and security in a climate change context at local and international levels. The issues of resource-based conflicts fuelled by climate change and security are both extremely broad and, in the case of the latter, relatively complex and evolving. Both have been subject of debate with varying levels of agreement and disagreement. As this paper is the result of desk-based research conducted over a period between November 2010 and January 2011, it does not purport to represent all dimensions of the issue of resource- based conflicts nor of climate change in the Asia Pacific region, nor does is assume to present all existing mechanisms and possible solutions. It should be noted that no mechanisms exist which specifically address resource-based conflicts fuelled by climate change. Conflict and resource management varies from country to country and is largely dealt with as problems arise. As such, focus has been placed on existing climate change mechanisms in order to chart where gaps exist and where priorities should be focused. Reflecting this gap, one of the principal conclusions is that there is an urgent need for further exploration and understanding of this issue both within communities, the region and globally in order to determine best ways forward. Throughout this paper, there are several important baseline approaches: 1. In line with IPCC findings, this paper is developed on the basis that a) climate change is actual, and b) human activity is the main cause. There is overarching consensus that climate change is caused by human activity and that climate change is increasing the earth's surface temperature at previously unseen rates.6 13 2. References to conflict in this paper will refer to disputes over perceived or actual incompatibility of interests, and further be categorized as either non-violent - low intensity conflict-, or violent -medium and high intensity conflict (see Figure 1: Conflict Intensities). 3. Neither natural resource scarcity nor climate change lead directly to violent conflict. Instead, they can act in concert with a multitude of factors that can impact negatively on peace and human security. 4. This paper is concerned primarily with conflicts connected to resources necessary for human development and survival. This is in contrast to resources that are non- essential for survival and include, for example, high-value gems and metals. 5. In reference to vulnerability, this paper addresses primarily the causes of, and effects on, human systems that may undermine peace in a climate change context. This is in contrast to an examination of the vulnerability and resilience of crucial ecosystems to climate change. 7 Figure 1: Conflict Intensities (From: Heidelberg Institute for International Conflict Research, Conflict Barometer 2010, p. 88) 1.1 Background The nature of global security has changed over the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "002cdd7c-7c0f-4df0-b2b1-9d35bc12d932": {"__data__": {"id_": "002cdd7c-7c0f-4df0-b2b1-9d35bc12d932", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e7e2b8f868658e496279e243dbe16fe8bb1a8683e027f96638538f29eec5af2d"}}, "hash": "e7e2b8f868658e496279e243dbe16fe8bb1a8683e027f96638538f29eec5af2d", "text": "past 50 years; no longer do traditional military conflicts between states dominate security discourse. Since the end of the Second World War, conflicts have become increasingly intrastate. The end of the Cold War, which saw the support and funding for proxy wars between states recede, has in part influenced this trend.8 Conflicts today are principally internal and self-financed, though many with international dimensions and natural resources have played a central role in this dynamic. Illustratively, in a report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) it was highlighted that in the past 60 years 40% of conflicts have been tied to natural resources and that since the end of the Cold War eighteen conflicts have been driven by natural resources. The report also summarised that \u201cintrastate conflicts over the past 60 years indicate that conflicts associated with natural resources are twice as likely to relapse into conflict within the first 5 years.\u201d9 In recognition of the possible destructive ties between natural resources and security, the UN General Assembly World Charter for Nature asserted in 1982 that \u201c[c]ompetition for scarce resources creates conflict.\u201d10 More than 20 years later, the former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan established the High Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, mandated to examine modern threats to peace and security. The Panel produced a report of their findings in a 2004 titled A More Secure World: Our Shared Responsibility where it was found that \u201c[e]nvironmental stress, caused by large populations and shortages of land and other natural resources, can contribute to civil violence.\u201d 11 Still, despite widespread recognition, existing address is largely unrepresentative of the ties between environment and security \u2013 a dynamic which exposes the world\u2019s most vulnerable populations and which, in the face of climate change, is likely to be compounded by the absence of sound development and implementation of urgently needed policies and legislation. 1.1.1 Natural resource-based conflicts Because climate change effects the environment and, by extension, natural resources, the dynamics that connect natural resources and insecurity are also those which may intensify with the effects of climate change. Thus, it is important to examine the relationship between natural resources and conflict in order to grasp how climate change may affect resource-based conflicts. Since the early 1990s there has been an increase in the availability of publications within the international community, academia, media and NGO sphere which have discussed the issue of natural resources and conflict among,. A debate now exists also on exactly how these ties connect and just how relevant they are. However, that they are bound to each other, even if not directly, is extensively evidenced in many scenarios from across the world and throughout history (see for example Box 1: Natural Resources and the UN Security Council). 15 Any conflict emerges as a result of several factors and rarely from one alone; the processes that lead to conflict are multi-dimensional and complex. The same is true of the link between natural resources and conflict and, more specifically, between climate change and conflict. They are linked by a variety of elements that heighten the risk of insecurity and expose, on a macro level, primarily fragile, crisis and failed states,12 and on a micro level, the world's most vulnerable groups and individuals. Furthermore, the link between resources and conflict is often a reflection of underlying resource management and governance issues. It has been found that, the absence of greater focus on the environment and natural resources in the peace-building process, 13 intrastate conflicts are more likely to be prolonged and also to escalate. Similarly, cross-border conflicts tied to natural resources are found to be more likely when a state with poor governance mechanisms experiences resource depletion and where a key resource is shared between two states.14 The opposite can also be true: a shared resource can also serve as a backdrop for cooperation; this has historically been the case in regards to, for example, water (see 2.1 Risks and Vulnerabilities). Three ties between natural resources and conflict are defined in one study as the resource curse, resource conflicts and conflict resources. 15 The resource curse is characterised by a combination of natural resource wealth with other elements including poverty, corruption, poor economic growth and civil war. Resource conflicts concerns competing Box 1: Natural Resources and the UN Security Council The Security Council has adopted several resolutions that recognise the ties between resources and conflict.

Conflict resources exist in a situation where the financial rewards of resources drive and sustain armed conflicts (see Figure 2: Analytical Framework of Resource Wars). When coupled with the failure, by either will and/or inability, of states to address tensions around natural resources fairly and peacefully, natural resources can become a source of tension or of inducing and/or prolonging conflict and/or undermining peace. Good governance and sustainable human development are determinant factors in the level of vulnerability to insecurity and conflict. While unsustainable and poor management of natural resources can increase a country's likelihood for conflict, it is also important to note that conflict itself can negatively impact on the environment which can in turn effect resource availability and compound cycles of insecurity. The same is also true of poor mitigation efforts: inadequately planned and implemented, these can have adverse effects on the environment and security (see 2.1 Risks and Vulnerabilities). Figure 2: Analytical Framework of Resource Wars (From: Le Billon, Philippe. \"Diamond Wars? Conflict Diamonds and Geographies of Resource Wars.\" Annals of the Association of American Geographers 98:2, 2008. p. 349). 17 1.1.2 Mapping Conflicts in a Changing World Violent armed conflicts, whether intra-national or international, generally receive more focus than low intensity conflicts. This is mirrored in policy focus and implementation, which prioritises involvement in high-intensity conflicts. However, low intensity conflicts indicate underlying problems that could escalate in the face of increased resource scarcity associated with climate change. Low intensity conflicts are also more likely to go unnoticed and/or may only provoke attention when tensions have escalated, for example, to the point of conflict outbreak, or when implications have spread through, for example, migration.16 The dynamics of resource management and security have also steadily changed due in part to changing supply and demand dynamics in regards to resource availability but also reflecting the changing reach of resource trade. While the majority of tensions and conflicts are confined within state borders and between communities, they often exist within broader cross-border dynamics. As reported in a 2008 study by the Centre for Security Studies (CSS) and SwissPeace, titled Linking the Environment and Conflict Prevention, there is \u201can increase in the frequency and intensity of conflicts between different groups of users regarding lands and other resources\u2026also caused by international, multi-dimensional forces which the populations don\u2019t understand or over which they have little control.\u201d17 Box 2: Resources and Security on the Afghanistan/Pakistan border Type: Violent direct-use resource conflict within the forests sector The Pakistan/Afghanistan border is one of the most dangerous regions in the world. Both countries have recently experienced devastating floods, caused in part by severe deforestation, which are projected to increase with climate change. Government oversight and sound resource governance in the area has been lacking and the timber sector has gone largely unregulated. This has allowed criminal networks to operate unhindered, victimising both local communities and helping undermine security in the area. 18 For example, in 2006, a logging ban was introduced in Afghanistan in recognition of the country\u2019s deforestation problems. However, the ban could not be enforced and logging continued unabated under the Taliban who oversaw the transfer of logs from Kunar province in Afghanistan across the border to Pakistan a dynamic that has now become \u201cpart and parcel of the insurgency.\u201d19 This", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c89bff1-90b8-4705-aeef-095d98893428": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c89bff1-90b8-4705-aeef-095d98893428", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e93263c5501619f602ef053a41ae4074a9f11a595727c61179991de5924b533f"}, "3": {"node_id": "2c7a2745-0472-4941-8860-ef2cb33ee8e7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cb8ccf0f8effc9ab97264b30511a93e8d459761eab68c6339bc5fce46ae009d7"}}, "hash": "80e3a2278286ad343a00c1c9a167e28a6c2c681b61caf3ae65e0f305c3f48b1c", "text": "is not new. A similar ban was introduced in Pakistan in 1992 after devastating floods were found to be partly the result of deforestation. Logging companies instead harvested timber illegally in Afghanistan.20 As is common in areas where insecurity and poor forest governance exist together, forest communities in the Pakistan/Afghanistan border region lack protection, and reportedly fall victim to the criminal logging industry activities.21 While a study on conflict timber concluded that the impact of the timber trade in the area appeared to be limited, it concluded that [c]ontinued deforestation could, however, give rise to grievances and thus fuel conflicts at the local level.\u201d22 This signals an urgent need for drastically improved governance and resource management in the region in the face of increased extreme weather events and resource scarcity associated with climate change. 18 The CSS and SwissPeace study classifies resource-based conflicts as either \u2018indirect use\u2019 conflicts, \u2018direct use\u2019 conflicts, or \u2018complex conflict hotspots\u2019 that may combine direct and indirect use conflicts.23 This differs from Lebillon\u2019s Analytical Framework (above), which illustrates the causes and motivations for conflict. The CSS and SwissPeace study maps the makeup of resource-based conflicts. \u2018Indirect use\u2019 conflicts are often marked by heightened violence and characterised in part by the extraction and trade of resources that are internationally scarce and locally abundant. Conflicts are usually intra-national, though international conflicts have also been noted to occur, for example, within the fisheries sector over Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) rights.24 In the context of climate change and the threat posed by rising sea levels in the Pacific, addressing issues over EEZs and fishing rights will be particularly important (see for example section 2.2.3 Pacific). This is also true in the case of the South China Seas, where fishing rights are already a source of tension between states (see for example Case Study: China). Internal \u2018direct-use\u2019 resource conflicts can be split into three categories, all of which reflect dynamics within a given state and which marginalize the poor: 1) conflicts within an economic sector, 2) conflicts between economic sectors, and 3) conflicts relating to large development projects.25 Conflicts in this category are often slow to escalate and are often addressed once they have increased in intensity. With increased resource scarcity projected with climate change, the early identification and address of these conflicts is essential. Conflicts within an economic sector may include, for example, clashes between large and small resource-related projects and operators. For example, in the case of forests, communities who derive their livelihoods, food and medicines from forests are often side-lined in favour of large logging operators (see Case Study: Indonesia). Conflicts between economic sectors occur when competing interests exist over a given resource. This could include, for example, conflicting claims and needs over water sources. Conflicts relating to large development projects occur when competing interests between local communities and large-scale projects develop \u2013 these are often in areas otherwise occupied by local communities. International \u2018direct use\u2019 conflicts are categorized as either 1) international fresh-water conflicts, 2) international territorial conflicts, and 3) conflicts relating to ecosystem services.26 International fresh water conflicts occur where there is water scarcity and shared water sources, it may not be a conflict necessarily, but it can serve as a destabilising factor (see for example Case Study: China and Box 5: Water in the Asia Pacific: A Source of Peace or Conflict?). International territorial conflicts are often related to natural resources in a given area under dispute. Conflicts related to ecosystem services regards primarily climate change. Notably, the CSS and SwissPeace report found that there exists a latent 19 conflict between developed countries, primarily responsible for climate change, and developing countries most vulnerable to its adverse effects.27 Harnessing information of resource-based conflicts is essential in building peace in a climate change context. It is a key component in preventing resource-based conflicts fuelled by climate change and provides a platform from which to base sound development and implementation of prevention and peace-building strategies. And, while it is significantly less costly to prevent the development of violent conflicts than to address their outbreak, and while low-intensity conflicts are a key entry point for conflict prevention, mechanisms at national, regional and international levels to prevent such conflict are sorely lacking. 28 Comprehensive and integrated action at local and international levels are necessary; anything less would be unrepresentative both of the global nature of resource trade and climate change (see 3.

This can in turn lead to the revaluation of important resources: where non-renewable resources have traditionally been more associated with conflict than renewable resources, this could change as 'survival resources' become more scarce and therefore of higher value.29 Without proper mitigation and adaptation, tremendous strain will be placed on already exposed national, regional and global infrastructures. Yet despite recognition of this by the international community (See section 3.1 Existing Mechanisms: Strengths and Weaknesses), agreement on how to address the security implications of climate change remains unrepresentative of the magnitude of the problem, equated by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon to \u201cthe danger posed by war to all of humanity - and to our planet...\u201d30 The impacts of climate change will vary across the world and the knock-on effects of these impacts will also be diverse. Some countries may gain short-term economic benefit 31 while most, particularly poor and developing countries, will experience exacerbated adverse consequences that will likely affect security. Depending on the region, three principal direct physical effects of climate change that could have implications on security have been identified as 1) an increase in natural disasters, 2) rising sea levels, and 3) increased resource scarcity. Tellingly, all have been projected for the Asia Pacific region (see Figure 3: Possible Pathways from Climate Change to Conflict). An increase in natural disasters can affect security by decreasing resource availability and can lead to humanitarian catastrophes and mass sudden migration. Migration can increase the vulnerability of populations and increase the likelihood of conflict by taxing already fragile dynamics. Rising sea levels are expected to adversely impact primarily on river deltas and small island states. Communities in low-lying coastal areas face widespread 20 flooding and entire states have been told to prepare for submergence, including the Maldives and several Pacific island states (see 2.2.3 Pacific). Resource scarcity associated with climate change can also present new challenges as countries move to secure resources necessary for their own populations while potentially adversely affecting neighbouring countries (see Case Study: China). It is important to note that the first two effects, an increase in natural disasters and rising sea levels, can also lead to and/or exacerbate the third, increased resource scarcity which can also, as highlighted above, be a contributing precursor for conflict. This means that, while the natural resources and conflict dynamic already exists, it also does so within a climate change context both as a direct physical result of climate change and also as a knock-on effect of other climate change impacts, placing resource scarcity as a central issue that should be addressed in both security and climate change discourse. This is illustrated in Figure 3: Possible Pathways from Climate Change to Conflict, below, which shows how climate change can adversely affect economic activity, livelihoods and food security which, coupled with factors such as bad governance, regional insecurity, social inequalities and inappropriate response and mitigation, can increase insecurity and opportunities and motivations for violence and conflict. In a study by the German Advisory Council on Global Change, Climate Change as a Security Risk, it was found that climate change could affect security generally by 1) exacerbating existing environmental accelerators of conflict, 2) by creating new pathways to conflict that can emerge as a result of the effects of climate change, and 3) through the effects of climate change increasing due to inadequate mitigation efforts.32 The study also highlighted 6 principals ways in which climate change could present a threat to international peace and security: 1) through the possible increase in the number of weak and fragile states as a result of climate change, which could develop into failed/weak sub- regions and stretch the capacity of international coping mechanisms, 2) through risks presented for global economic development, which could change regional supply and demand dynamics and lead to cross-border tensions, 3) through risks of growing conflicts between the main drivers of climate change and those most exposed to its affects, 4) through the risk to human rights and the industrialized countries\u2019 legitimacy as global governance actors, curbing their action and influence possibilities, 5) by triggering the intensification of migration, and 6) by overstretching classic security policy due to increased insecurity and climate change impacts.33 21 Figure 3: Possible Pathways from Climate Change to Conflict (From: Buhaug, Gleiditcsh and Theiesen, Implications of Climate Change for Armed Conflict 2006, p. 21).

These may negatively impact on existing developmental and security issues if unaddressed. Peace, Conflict and Resource Management Good governance and sound equitable resource management is central to safeguarding peace, development and environmental security. Where good governance is present, corruption and insecurity is usually minimal and resource management is likely to be fair and coupled with sound social protection programmes that reduce vulnerability to climate change.34 On the other hand, poor governance, corruption and the mismanagement of resources undermines sustainable human development and increases the vulnerability of the most exposed groups, sectors, countries and regions to the threat-multiplying effects of climate change. The development and implementation of policy and legislation plays a determining role in peace and security outcomes. For example, poor resource management can force individuals and communities to migrate in search economic stability, water and food and can undermine security (see section 2.1 Risks and Vulnerabilities, page 27). The fact that some states are in a position to avert adverse effects of climate change should be seen as an opportunity, especially when compared to small island states that have limited options in addressing issues associated with rising sea levels. 22 The Maldives, for instance, are threatened with the possibility of complete submersion by 2100 and have declared intentions to become completely carbon neutral by 2020.35 Still, the future inhabitability of the Maldives lies primarily in mitigation choices of the world\u2019s largest GHG emitters. On the other hand, many countries have a host of options available to them that would decrease the vulnerability of its people and resources to climate change effects by improving governance and resource mechanisms. For instance, Myanmar, rich in natural resources could manage its resources to address dire poverty issues, while benefitting sub-regional stability and energy security (see Box 3: Myanmar and Nepal: 2 Examples of Resource Management Impacts on Security). Several factors in national resource governance have been found tied to the stability and security of country. In a study by Stephen R. Tyler, Policy Implications of Natural Resource Conflict Management, it was found that public policies on natural resources that have been shown to undermine security have included: 1) uncoordinated planning and investment, which can intentionally or unintentionally be coupled with the marginalization of local communities, 2) inadequate information and consultation, which can intentionally or unintentionally be coupled with minimal consultation with local communities, 3) discriminatory or unclear tenure policies, which marginalize local communities, often in favor of industrial ventures regardless of traditional use and which further ostracize local communities, 4) population displacement and marginalization, both voluntary and forced often through public policy on large-scale resource projects can lead to marginalization and conflict, 5) piecemeal approach to reform, indicates lack of comprehensive address of reform, where one area is addressed without considering another can create tensions between, for example, sectors or government agencies, 6) vague policy direction, indicates a gap between policy and implementation due to poor planning and communication which can leave policy open to interpretation and misunderstanding and can present contradictions between implementation depending on priorities and interpretation, and 7) inadequate support for reforms, undermining the sound implementation of policies.36 The effects of resource management choices on security often also stretch beyond national borders and reflect the reality of climate change in regards to, for example, water, forests and energy (see 2.1 Risks and Vulnerabilities). Governance also stretches beyond the government bodies to the private sector, where global business interests can, when combined with weak national governance, underpin the inequitable allocation of resources thereby contributing to factors that increase vulnerability and insecurity mentioned (see for example Box 3: Myanmar and Nepal: 2 Examples of Resource Management Impacts on Security). Yet, although the dynamic between natural resources and conflict have been widely recognized (see section 1.1.1 Natural resource-based conflicts, page 14) the central role that resource governance could and should play in peace-building, conflict prevention and resolution has been neglected and this has, in part, resulted in sometimes inadequate and non-integrative approaches (see section 3.1 Existing Mechanisms: Strengths and Weaknesses). As one report charting resource and conflict management summarized, \u201cno specific school of thought can be 23 identified.\u201d37 Addressing resource management and security in a climate change context necessitates a holistic approach that reflects local realities, the global trade in natural resources, and the trans-boundary nature of the causes and effects of climate change (see section 3.2 Looking Ahead: Risks and Opportunities).

Corruption and mismanagement of Myanmar\u2019s natural resources have caused serious environmental degradation and left a large majority of Myanmar\u2019s population poor.38 Community participation in development and implementation of projects has been negligible and associated with broad- spectrum human rights abuses. In a recent publication by the Pa-Oh Youth Organization it was found that the Tigyit coalmine was integrally bound to severe water pollution, the displacement of entire villages and the seizing of farmlands. The majority of energy produced powered an iron mine factory, failing to meet the dire energy needs of local communities.39 The Shwe gas and oil transport pipelines have also been a source of controversy - tied to corruption, grave human rights abuses and identified as fueling tensions between local communities. The internationalization of this dynamic is reflected in criticism of international investment firms in Europe and the fact that the principal users of Myanmar\u2019s energy are not its poor, but neighboring China and Thailand.40 Nepal: Source for Peace Type: Non-violent direct-use resource conflict. Sector: Forests. Nepal is in the process of developing a new constitution against a backdrop of significant political, socio-economic, environment and security challenges. Critical to its success will be its ability to address of key development and security issues. With pressing water supply strains and a forestry sector historically tied to high-intensity conflict, good resource governance will be critical. Notably, however, Nepal has strong foundations to build on. During the Nepal\u2019s 10-year civil war, forests were a cause of conflict, funding source and place of refuge for armed groups. More recently, however, Nepal\u2019s forest management has been found by ECOSOC to be a \u201cleading example of the achievement and continuing challenges of community based forest management.\u201d 41 Its management system has been credited with notable environmental improvement, and has reduced the countries vulnerability to climate change. Still, non-violent conflict exists between Nepal\u2019s Community Forest User Groups (CFUGs); with smaller CFUGs often sidelined, and large powerful groups reaping majority of benefits. The address of pressing land tenure and property rights will be central to preventing the transformation of what is currently referred to as one Nepal\u2019s successes into a situation of violence. Existing forest management practices must build on its strengths while also remaining recognizant of 24 If the Myanmar government fails to change policy on resource management the vulnerability of its population will increase with the impacts of climate change. Ensuring equitable and participatory management and access to resources, particularly in regards to water, food and energy, will be central in climate change adaptation. the role of forests have played in both high and low-intensity conflict and also in decreasing vulnerability to climate change effects. 2. CLIMATE CHANGE, RESOURCES AND CONFLICT IN THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION The Asia Pacific region is vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change through its existing issues of poverty, governance, insecurity and exposure to natural disasters. These exacerbate both security and environmental issues that in turn compound the effects of natural disasters and conflict, leaving the region vulnerable despite its considerable economic growth and progress toward the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) aimed at eradicating poverty. 42 The Asia Pacific is home to half of the world\u2019s total population and two thirds of the world's poor with 1.8 billion living on less than 2 USD per day, of which close to one billion live on less than 1.25 USD per day.43 Those living in the region are also four times more likely to be affected by natural disasters than people living in Africa and 25 times more likely than those living in Europe or North America.44 The Asia Pacific is also particularly vulnerable to conflict (see Figure 4: Hazard map of armed intrastate conflict in the Asia region, 2008). In 2008, nearly half of the world\u2019s intrastate conflicts were in Asia, where also one third of all battle-related casualties during the past 25 years have been. 45 As summarized in UCDP and PRIO\u2019s 2009 Patterns of Peace and Conflict, \u201cMost of the recent wars have taken place in Asia; a pattern visible throughout most of the period following the Second World War. Another disturbing trend is that Asian conflicts tend to last longer than conflicts in other regions.\u201d46 25 Figure 4: Hazard map of armed intrastate conflict in the Asia region, 2008 (From: PRIO in UN-OCHA report: NGI (2009): Risk assessment and mitigation measures for natural and conflict related hazards in Asia Pacific.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "af6806f9-0cd0-4d9d-bbc9-81d466921107": {"__data__": {"id_": "af6806f9-0cd0-4d9d-bbc9-81d466921107", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d3591c4e61ec477bb061821f5a480a51f2409efc6f58651a1718637968af7fed"}, "2": {"node_id": "510205b1-6870-44e0-8346-585473345f67", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ea7e647dfd97def519fe45f2a0761f863c733cd063e773d052759c9b7c1b7f5c"}}, "hash": "14097d865cd7d853e897541df41a6974b16cc3582fc2e9d2ab4e009244acac26", "text": "NGI report no. 20071600-1.

Socio-economic status This index varies between 1 (relatively wealthy) and 5 (relatively poor) and is generated from 4\u20135 country-specific indicators of socio-economic status. Because the data sources differ between countries, the values on the index are expressed in relative terms (i.e. relative to the most well-off district) and are thus not immediately comparable between cases. However, most of the country indices contain local estimates of GDP per capita, infant mortality, and HDI scores from national Human Development Index reports. The sources and characteristics of the specific socio-economic indicators can be found in the appendix. 26 The Influence of Climate Change Projected consequences by the IPCC for the Asia Pacific region are largely negative. The 2007 IPCC report found that \u201c[c]limate change is projected to impinge on sustainable development of most developing countries of Asia as it compounds the pressures on natural resources and the environment associated with urbanisation, industrialisation, and economic development,\u201d47 and that, in regards to Pacific islands, \u201caccelerated coastal erosion, saline intrusion into freshwater lenses and increased flooding from the sea cause large effects on human settlements.\u201d48 The 2007 International Alert report, A Climate of Conflict: the Links between Climate Change, Peace and War, found that \u201c[f]ailure to help already stressed communities cope with the additional pressure to their livelihoods caused by climate change means that existing grievances will intensify and the risk of violent conflict will increase.\u201d49 The report assessed the degree to which countries could be exposed to greater risk of conflict Figure 5: IPCC projected impacts of Climate Change on the Asia-Pacific Climate change impacts on Asia* * By the 2050s, freshwater availability in Central, South, East and South-East Asia, particularly in large river basins, is projected to decrease. * Coastal areas, especially heavily populated mega-delta regions in South, East, and South-East Asia, will be at great risk due to increased flooding from the sea and, in some mega-deltas, flooding from rivers. * Climate change is projected to compound the pressures on natural resources and the environment associated with rapid urbanisation, industrialisation and economic development. * Endemic morbidity and mortality due to diarrhoeal disease primarily associated with floods and droughts are expected to rise in East, South and South-East Asia due to projected changes in the hydrological cycle. Climate change impacts on Small Islands * Sea level rise is expected to exacerbate inundation, storm surge, erosion and other coastal hazards, thus threatening vital infrastructure, settlements and facilities that support the livelihood of island communities. * Deterioration in coastal conditions, for example through erosion of beaches and coral bleaching, is expected to affect local resources. * By mid-century, climate change is expected to reduce water resources in many small islands, e.g. in the Caribbean and Pacific, to the point where they become insufficient to meet demand during low-rainfall periods. * With higher temperatures, increased invasion by non-native species is expected to occur, particularly on mid- and high-latitude islands. * Taken from IPCC synopsis report, 3.2.2 impacts on regions 27 in a climate change context and identified 46 states with high risk of conflict.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7364ca6a-c843-43c6-9b80-570ab78cae83": {"__data__": {"id_": "7364ca6a-c843-43c6-9b80-570ab78cae83", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f354e79e95703e38501e9d5bd35b0f4a85a6003513d19818a2135d1c861dc7e8"}, "2": {"node_id": "f06e1a8e-ca2a-4940-99e4-a344e622a976", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b89aa5d6d98a5d623f8b5c1a96f47fe03d44227c065c00f0628782c7297061ab"}}, "hash": "07cf544a8f738476f622347071904efc65273fa54eb80a7bdb4476b033d23192", "text": "In the Asia Pacific these included Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, India, Indonesia, Iran, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka.

The 10 countries with the highest number of people exposed to flooding are all in Asia, whilst the region has the highest absolute exposure to severe tropical storms. With rising sea levels, these populations face the acute threat of permanently losing the coastal land on which they reside and derive their livelihood. And in South Asia, it is thought that crop yields could decrease by 30%, creating food insecurity in predominantly agricultural economies.52 Myanmar and Vietnam have been identified by one study as potentially the most fragile states, in which natural resource and climate change may fuel conflict, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal and Thailand less so.53 But significantly, the high exposure of some countries and regions of Asia is likely to be as much the result of their vulnerability \u2013 the high population densities in the case of the Asian mega-deltas, for example - as climate change impacts.54 Ensuring a future of security and growth necessitates inclusive and equitable sustainable development. Economic growth in the region has not been inclusive and, together with the projected effects of climate change, this threatens the realisation of MDG goals. The level of growth experienced in the region is expected to continue and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has estimated that Asia's economy will be 50% larger than it is today and will account for one third of global output in just 5 years.55 This necessitates present-day efforts to prioritize the MDGs in order to place sustainable human development and good governance at the core of growth and planning. 2.1 Risks and Vulnerabilities Studies show that the majority of world\u2019s armed conflicts since the end of the Cold War have been in regions heavily reliant on agriculture56 - a sector integrally tied to food security, and the 2010 Maplecroft Food Security Index has already found that \u201cclimate change is having a profound effect on global food security.\u201d57 Notably, in 2009 the Asian Development Bank (ADB) also highlighted that \u201c[m]ore than 60% of the economically active population is dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods in Asia and the Pacific.\u201d58 Climate change effects are heightened by land degradation, both by increasing the socio- economic vulnerability of populations, and also by decreasing the capacity of the land to withstand pressures associated with population growth and climate change. 59 For 28 instance, between 1990 and 2005, in many Asian and Pacific countries forest areas declined by roughly 1 per cent every year and have thereby added to overall carbon emissions, damaged natural ecosystems that provide natural life supporting systems such as water purification and water composition, and, through increasing desertification and soil mineral depletion, have crucially hampered the agricultural sectors on which the poor mainly depend for their living.60 Food and water security are also integrally bound to the human security and projected scarcity is likely to increase the vulnerability of populations. At the centre of this correlation lies chronic inequality manifested in poverty and gender-based marginalisation that, when coupled with a decrease in natural resources essential for survival, threaten overall development and security in the region. Large portions of Asia Pacific\u2019s population are being left exposed to various threats including those posed by climate change. They are exposed through issues of poverty, with the poor being substantially more exposed than middle and upper classes; gender inequalities, with women substantially more vulnerable than men; age inequalities, with the elderly and children more vulnerable; the ability to protect, with the disabled more vulnerable than the able; and also through the marginalization of indigenous and traditional peoples.61 Demographers estimate that over the next 40 years Asia, with nearly 5.5 billion, will host approximately 60 per cent of the world\u2019s population. With the vast proportion of this population growth projected to occur in the poorest countries of the region and within the poorest segments of Asian national populations,62 soundly addressing the development needs of the region is a critical part of climate change adaptation and mitigation. Poverty, Food Security and Livelihoods One study has found that poverty, often intertwined with a heavy reliance on natural resources for income, together with poor health and nutrition, was tied to the outbreak of conflict 63 \u2013 an essential factor to consider in the face of decreasing fresh water availability, and is illustrative of the fact that many vulnerable sectors and groups are inextricably linked (see also Annex II: Food Scarcity and Conflict).

For example, global food price hikes in 2008 led to violent riots in several countries. In Bangladesh demonstrations over price hikes led to clashes between protesters and police that ultimately led to 24 people being injured.66 Also, as summarised by the USAID report, Livelihoods and Conflict, \u201c[l]ivelihood failure can contribute to the emergence of conflict by weakening the social fabric of a society, making people resort to violence to 29 obtain necessary resources, and increasing individuals\u2019 vulnerability to those with an interest in promoting conflict for political or economic gain.\u201d67 Underpinning this dynamic is local and global natural resource governance which has increasingly placed resources in the Asia Pacific under strain and has contributed to curbing development, has threatened livelihoods, food and water insecurity, affected health and also increased the risk posed by natural disasters \u2013 themselves accelerators of insecurity. But vulnerabilities are not solely due to local governance factors alone and this is reflected in the effects of, for example, the global financial and economic crisis. In the Asia Pacific region, countries with high domestic demand were least affected by the crisis, while nations with high focus on exports were hardest hit.71 By the end of 2009, however, Asia's outputs and exports had returned to pre-crisis levels and the region has been cited as leading crisis recovery and pulling the world out of recession72 largely due to India and China,73 who experienced rapid growth even during the crisis.74 As highlighted in 2010 by ESCAP, \u201cexcluding these fast-growing sub-continental economies, the Asia Pacific developing economies contracted in 2009 by 0.6%.\u201d75 Box 4: Extreme weather events: Flooding and Conflict Flooding, which is expected to increase with climate change, has historically been associated with periods of insecurity and conflict. For example, the 1970 Bay of Bengal typhoon, which claimed between 300,000 and 500,000 lives has been credited with contributing to the outbreak of civil war in eastern Pakistan which itself claimed an estimated 3 million lives and led to the creation of Bangladesh. Tensions following the typhoon escalated to conflict when those most affected found that the response by the then Pakistan central government was lacking. A separatist movement, the Awami League, was formed and clashes between it and the central Pakistan government escalated. Post independence in 1971, there was further heightened insecurity following floods in 1974 and 1988.68 Other ties between flooding and insecurity have included: flooding in Orissa in 1980, after which clashes between students and businesses occurred; flooding in Bihar, India in 1987, after which there were clashes between looters and the police; flooding of Yangtze in 1997, after which there were concerns that the security situation would deteriorate and where the Chinese government ordered strong response by Chinese Security forces; and flooding in west Bengal in 2000, after which clashes between looters and aid workers developed.69 More recently, floods in Sri Lanka in January 2011 have been credited with contributing to the outbreak of violence in the town of Kattankudy. 11 of Sri Lanka\u2019s 25 districts were affected, destroying crops and killing livestock. Anger over the relief effort led to demonstrations and several civil servants required medical attention.70While flooding experienced was not necessarily directly tied to resource-based conflicts, extreme weather events did add pressure to issues of scarcity as vulnerable populations struggled to obtain resources necessary for survival. This dynamic can also lead to migration and other security issues (see for example, see Case Study: Bangladesh and Case Study: Pakistan). 30 While findings reflected in Achieving the Millennium Development Goals in and Era of Global Uncertainty: Asia Pacific Regional Report 2009/10 revealed that considerable progress towards the MDGs had been made in the region, with the greatest advances made in South East Asia and the least in the Pacific,76 accurate data after 2008 on the impacts of the global financial crisis hit was unavailable at the time of reporting.

These were projected to be principally women, children and the elderly.78 Gender Inequalities Women make up 70% of the world\u2019s poor, are responsible for 65% per cent of food production in Asia79 and have, as summarized by a report by ActionAid and IDS, \u201cless access to financial resources, land, education, health, and other basic rights than men and are seldom involved in decision making processes.\u201d 80 Women are also particularly vulnerable to both the immediate and long-term effects of climate change and conflict \u2013 a dynamic of gender inequality that is common in the Asia Pacific region where inequality often stretches from the private confines of home to government institutions and legislation. The UNDP 2010 Asia-Pacific Human Development Report found that \u201c[d]iscrimination and neglect are threatening women\u2019s very survival in the Asia-Pacific region, where women suffer from some of the world\u2019s lowest rates of political representation, employment and property ownership. Their lack of participation is also depressing economic growth\u201d81 and climate change is expected to worsen current gender inequalities and further increase the vulnerability of women.82 Women are particularly exposed to extreme weather events. In Bangladesh, for example, a staggering 90% of victims from the 1991 cyclone were women and children.83 Women are also particularly vulnerable at times of insecurity and conflict as sexual assault and abuse can sometimes used a conflict tactic.84 Exploitation of young women and children also often accompanies periods of environmental difficulty85 and it has also been found that during and after extreme weather events women and children are also subjected to increased violence.86 Also, if resource-based conflicts increase, so too will the likelihood that women will become more exposed. However, as highlighted by a USAID report, Women and Conflict, \u201cwomen are rarely mere passive victims of conflict and should not be treated as such\u2026[they can]\u2026play active roles in the events that lead to fighting and instability\u2026yet they have also served as the forerunners of peace movements.\u201d87 Similarly, the same is true in a climate change context. As ActionAid and IDS reported in We Know What We Need, women have an integral role to play in resource management, conflict prevention and resolution, and climate change adaptation:88 this must be reflected in national and international strategies (see 31 3.1 Existing Mechanisms: Strengths and Weaknesses). Migration The first IPCC report in 1990 found that the greatest impact of climate change could be the displacement of millions caused by shoreline or coastal erosion and agricultural disruption.89 It has been estimated that anywhere between 25 million to 1 billion may be forced to migrate due to climate change.90 Other studies have challenged the notion of 'climate refugees', or their future numbers. Either way, it has been found that poor states are the most likely to bear the burden of climate migrants.91 A report from 2008 by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) titled Migration and Climate Change highlights that \u201c[f]orced migration hinders development in at least four ways; by increasing pressure on urban infrastructure and services, by undermining economic growth, by increasing the risk of conflict and by leading to worse health, educational and social indicators among migrants themselves.\"92 Populations of the region\u2019s island states are potentially the most likely to become international migrants. This could occur gradually, as a reflection of the gradual erosion of work opportunities and as response to decreased food and water security, or suddenly, in response to extreme weather events. This may also be determined by coping capacities and governance issues (see Annex III: Environmentally Induced Migration and Conflict). Migration in a climate change context is likely to be primarily gradual and opposed to sudden93 and can undermine security. This is reflected in 1998 UN Security Council Resolution 1199, wherein the UN Security Council recognised massive migration flows to be a risk factor to peace and security.94 Worryingly, existing mechanisms do not currently encompass or address the rights of those displaced due to climate change or other environmental strains. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) recognises a refugee as someone who \"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country\u2026\"95 Unaddressed, citizens who are forced", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f255579b-5d61-4819-87c3-cac79d3600a4": {"__data__": {"id_": "f255579b-5d61-4819-87c3-cac79d3600a4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "073976edf2d6292dbe7ccb215414384b591793b11a9da760dfff1bc7e13dc426"}}, "hash": "073976edf2d6292dbe7ccb215414384b591793b11a9da760dfff1bc7e13dc426", "text": "to leave their homes could, on top of already belonging to one of the world's most vulnerable groups, face the additional burden of statelessness. Resource Sectors Climate change is set to impact on water, food and energy availability in the Asia Pacific region and, as these are essential for survival, their dwindling supply will also be cause for greater competition and an increased likelihood of conflict. Climate change effects can also have adverse impacts on forests, which are essential for the mitigation of climate change. The management and use of these sectors also impact upon each other. Also, as populations continue to grow, particularly in China and India, energy demands will increase. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) found that \u201c[e]missions from energy use are projected to increase by 100% between 2007 and 2030, at which point the region 32 will be responsible for 45% of all global energy\u2013related emissions (compared with 31% in 2007).\u201d96 As developing countries in the region continue to see a rise in demand for energy, so too will emissions grow without comprehensive mitigation measures; this necessitates a transfer to cleaner and more sustainable energy sources. Nuclear energy, increasingly used by China, India, Japan, and South Korea to produce electricity, may present new access and proliferation challenges in volatile areas that include Iran and North Korea. However, the severe damage caused to Japanese nuclear power plants by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, may cause countries in the region to review their nuclear strategies.97 Energy and GHG emissions are also intrinsically tied to forests and are central to both climate change mitigation and adaptation through their capacity to contain carbon dioxide emissions and to curb the physical effects of, for example, sea-level rise and flooding. Bangladesh has, for example, adopted policies to protect and extend its mangrove forests. This has helped lessen its vulnerability to the effects of climate change by countering erosion associated with extreme weather events and of rising sea levels.98 South and Southeast Asia contain many of the world\u2019s remaining rain forests and these are threatened by commercial logging and land clearance operations. In the 2006 Stern Review, The Economics of Climate Change, commissioned by the UK government, it was found that climate change \u201cis the greatest and widest-ranging market failure ever seen\u201d and, with deforestation accounting for more that 18% of global emissions, asserted that \u201c[a]ction to preserve the remaining areas of natural forest is needed urgently.\u201d99 Deforestation, the result of both legal and illegal logging, has also been associated with conflict, so-called \u2018conflict timber\u2019. 100 A report by the ARD charting conflict timber identifies two types: type 1 is \u201cconflict financed by trees\u201d, and type 2 is \u201cconflicts among competing stakeholders for control of trees\u201d and finds that conflict timber in Asia is primarily type 2. This has included, for example, Indonesia (see Case Study: Indonesia, page 38) and Cambodia where, in the 1990s, the Khmer Rouge derived about 10-20 million USD per month during the dry season from cross-border timber sales with Thailand.101 As the international community develops strategies to curb GHG emissions, it is thus essential that these are soundly developed and matched with mechanisms that will ensure that trade does not contribute to low- and high-intensity conflicts. Indeed, as concluded in a 2009 report by Human Rights Watch, Wild Money: The Human Rights Consequences of Illegal Logging and Corruption in Indonesia\u2019s Forestry Sector, \u201cthere are many worrisome aspects to the way carbon trading may be implemented that, if not addressed properly, could have a significant impact on forest governance, corruption, and human rights. In particular, there is a critical need for adequate safeguards to be in place to accurately monitor the actual logging rates and their legal compliance, and stop the flow of cash if forests are not protected.\u201d102 33 Box 5: Water in the Asia Pacific: A Source of Peace or Conflict? Global water use is increasing at a rate twice as fast as population growth.103 With water being a central component in, among other sectors, health, agriculture, industry, private use and electricity generation, its distribution will play a central role in determining how this changing supply and demand dynamic may impact on security and wellbeing.

However, the nature of water in many Asian states surpasses state boundaries and many countries are vulnerable to the decisions of other states. When water crosses state boundaries it often becomes highly politicised and a growing apprehension of the potential implications of dwindling water supplies has sparked debates over so-called \u201cwater wars.\u201d However, water-sharing agreements between states have historically been the source of cooperation rather than conflict.105 On the other hand, studies have also shown that countries that share rivers are more likely to engage in violent conflict,106 and that when there is a significant change in rainfall patterns in one year, the likelihood of violent internal conflict in the following year increases substantially.107 In a report by International Alert from 2007, it was found that China and India are among those countries that could face violent conflicts over water rights.108 Also, in a study on environmental conflict it was found that in 15 of 75 case studies, dams were a contributing factor to violence and tension between states.109 It was also found that when local participation is low, there is a marked increase for intrastate conflict.110 In geo-engineering terms, China has huge ambitions for hydropower from the three great rivers - the Salween, the Mekong and the Yangzi \u2013 which it hopes will help to maintain its growth. On the Mekong alone China has planned or built eight dams. The Xiaowan dam is due to be finished within two years and will be China\u2019s biggest hydropower project after the Three Gorges on the middle Yangzi. Proposals for 13 dams on the Salween, delayed by unusually vociferous protests about their social and environmental costs, will probably be re-started; many locals have already been resettled.111 The risk of conflict between states over potential dwindling water supplies caused by climate change, specifically the potential risk of capture of water resources by particular countries, could be especially important. Several rivers in the Asia Pacific region stretch across states and as the water from melting glaciers decline, so may China's diversion of those waters increase to feed its own population as needs increase. This will inevitably adversely affect those who depend on these headwaters for fresh water and agriculture production. Chinese infrastructure projects in Tibet, China where many Asian rivers originate, affect communities in neighbouring countries 34 2.2 Resource-based Conflicts and the Effects of Climate Change Data on resource-based conflicts in the Asia Pacific region is lacking and/or contradictory. For example, one study from 2000 noted that tensions involving natural resources in the Asia Pacific region included: Afghanistan (opium/heroin, emeralds, natural gas and oil routes); Myanmar (timber, rubies, heroin, oil); Cambodia (timber, rubies, oil); Timor-Leste (oil); Indonesia-Aceh (oil); Indonesia-West Papua (timber, copper, oil, hydropower); Papua New Guinea-Bougainville (copper); Philippines (timber, marijuana).115 that depend on these rivers (see Case Study: China). Water systems are also a significant source of energy through, for example, the provision of hydroelectricity and affected river systems could, therefore, also affect energy. Inadequate water supply also affects several other areas of security and developmental importance such as agricultural production, public health, and livelihoods. (See also Annex I: Water Scarcity and Conflict). The glaciers of the Himalayas, Hindu Kush and Tibetan Plateau currently supply water to 1.3 billion living in key Asian river basins including the Mekong, Irrawaddy, Indus, Ganges, Brahmaputra, Yangtze and Yellow River, especially during the dry season. And yet dry season flows appear to be gradually falling \u2013 some predict steeply - as the glaciers recede due to rising temperatures, and water supplies are increasingly erratic \u2013 droughts now appear to follow flooding.112 Water sharing agreements, undermined by changing water flows and levels, may also become sources of dispute, if not conflict. For example, fishery access agreements could cease to be relevant as fish move to other areas due to climate change. And rising sea levels and changing coastlines due to climate change may exacerbate, or shift the focus of existing border disputes over the South China Sea and Exclusive Economic Zones that extend 200 nautical miles out to sea from the coastline.113 Sub-regional trade dynamics have also received attention in reference to a 2010 agreement reached between Myanmar, Thailand and China concerning the possible development of a hydropower plant in the Salween River in Myanmar.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "db181b45-7cc7-4f68-b6eb-18618b29e453": {"__data__": {"id_": "db181b45-7cc7-4f68-b6eb-18618b29e453", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "637991dbced6cf2c3aebb2eb89d850df9ce1478529506c4f9651108fb249355d"}, "2": {"node_id": "8b4a327a-7771-41b3-826d-992661d9f16d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c87f862c6065545ac332195211c3c1b095bdb6c67671e0b2471750b4cb048cb3"}}, "hash": "def03e524ae8f5254d32d66c24cb8691d338473635ee39fc638e19f5512c6ffa", "text": "India has expressed concerns over how the project could impact on its downstream-use, while China has asserted that impacts would be minimal.114 Without comprehensive review of national water management systems, and in the absence of comprehensive water agreements", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f01525bf-45fa-4650-8260-64f4cb8ae27a": {"__data__": {"id_": "f01525bf-45fa-4650-8260-64f4cb8ae27a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dc0365e79620e4726a45525eb168a5816593567c9d70f2c25acc0625eec8b44d"}}, "hash": "dc0365e79620e4726a45525eb168a5816593567c9d70f2c25acc0625eec8b44d", "text": "between states, the chances that water scarcity will undermine security is high. Several countries in the Asia Pacific region have sought to address this issue. At national level, this is true for Bangladesh, and at international level, this is true for ASEAN ( 3.1 Existing Mechanisms: Strengths and Weaknesses). However, existing tensions over water supply indicate that existing mechanisms are not enough: it will ultimately be up to states to decide whether or not national and regional water management will be a catalyst for peace or for conflict. 35 While more recently, the 2010 Institute for International Conflict Research (HIIK) noted that 12 Asia Pacific conflicts within the 114 Asia Oceania classification conflicts were in part resource-related. These involved Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, China, Vietnam, Taiwan (Province of China), Brunei, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Solomon Islands, and Timor-Leste. Of these 12 conflicts, 6 are of crisis intensity, 2 are manifest conflicts, and 4 are latent conflicts (see Annex VI: Asia Pacific Conflicts with Resource-Issue Dimensions). However, the findings do not appear to reflect several resource-based conflicts including, for example resource-based conflicts in Myanmar and Nepal (Box 3: Myanmar and Nepal: 2 Examples of Resource Management Impacts on Security) nor in Fiji, for example, which stated in September 2010 that resource based conflicts was one of its top priorities.116 In another study on environmental conflicts from 1980 to 2005, and based on 4 environmental contributors to conflict: water, land/soil, fish and biodiversity, showed that in the Asia Pacific Region most environment-related conflicts were to do with water and/or soil. It is important to note, however, that the findings did not purport to represent all resource-based conflicts in the region. While information exists on resource-conflicts in the Asia Pacific and reveal several common denominators, there are also several significant differences in conflict identification. As a result, data on which to form comprehensive and targeted peace and security-based approaches on existing and possible resource conflict faultlines are therefore not comprehensive. This is further complicated by poor reporting due to corruption, fear and lack of access that inhibits the availability of comprehensive information that would show where resource conflict faultlines exist. This is particularly true of smaller-scale tensions and conflicts that easily go unnoticed but that could increase with environmental stress. Increasing information on resource-based conflicts is central to developing sound mitigation and adaptation policies (see Box 6: Mind the Gap: Identifying Sources of Conflict). 2.2.1 East Asia East Asia is likely to experience increased precipitation and temperatures associated with climate change. It\u2019s also particularly exposed to natural disasters both in terms of its geographic makeup and also number of people affected. This stands to be further affected by land-use change and deforestation. Most countries in East Asia, however, are only minimally responsible for climate change. China, on the other hand, is a key player in this regard: it emits more GHGs than any other country in the world and its mitigation efforts will play a determining role in long-term climate change. Its adaptation mechanisms will also have direct impacts in many countries across Asia (see section 2.2.2 South and West Asia). In East Asia, the reliance of countries on the Mekong River for water can become a source of tension as China feeds is own population. The Mekong River flows out of China and feeds Laos, Myanmar, Cambodia, and Vietnam; decreased flow to end-users and increased use by countries nearer the source threaten to have adverse effects on agriculture, water access, and health. For these reasons, China\u2019s importance in combating the effect of climate change is and will be profound. 36 Case Study: China China is now the world\u2019s largest greenhouse gas emitter and has invested in the development of clean energy. Its efforts to feed its growth and the needs of its booming population and economy effects it neighbours and will continue to do so. As a principal player in the global economy, China is also in a key position to play a positive and central role on climate change mitigation and adaptation regionally and internationally. As China has grown stronger it has also cultivated new needs to secure resources in order to support the rising living standards of its population, which amounts to one-fifth of the world's total. Industrialisation and urbanisation has jumped China\u2019s share of the world's metal consumption from 10% to 25% since the late 1990s.117 China is also now Saudi Arabia\u2019s biggest customer, importing roughly half of its oil, a share that will increase to two-thirds by 2015 and four-fifths by 2030.

In development terms, Beijing views the South China Sea as a major source of nutrition for its people. And yet it consumes only a third of the world's average consumption of fish.119 China's demand for water over the coming years is only likely to increase. And yet there is increasing evidence that climate change may affect its critical water sources in the Himalayas and along the Mekong River Basin.120 The first Chinese government national assessment on climate change in 2006, predicted that whilst precipitation levels were likely to increase drastically over coming decades, severe water shortages would too. Indeed, drought, heat waves and extreme weather events were expected to become more commonplace, and most likely to hit hard the agricultural sector.121 Over recent years this sector of China's economy, if not the country as a whole, has been hard hit by a series of large droughts, relieved only by devastating flooding last summer.122 Significantly, China's water problems have far reaching effects regionally. Seven of the world\u2019s greatest rivers, including the Ganges and the Yangzi, are fed by the glaciers in the Himalayas and the Tibetan plateau, the so-called 'Water Towers of Asia,' which supply water to roughly 40 per cent of the world\u2019s population.123 For India and China water supplies from this strategically sensitive region is set to exacerbate tension in their already troubled relations. Several of the big rivers of north India, including the Brahmaputra, which feeds millions, rise in Tibet, China. As a taster of what may come, last summer China undertook to build a dam on the Brahmaputra, which it calls the Yarlung Tsangpo, exacerbating long-held Indian fears that Beijing would divert the river\u2019s waters to Chinese farmers.124 Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam have long complained that China operates on the Mekong without prior consultation. A Bangkok Post editorial accused China of \u201cKilling the Mekong\u201d; distraught Thai, Laotian and Cambodian fishermen and farmers have blamed the Chinese dams of reducing fish stocks, cutting irrigation and disrupting livelihoods. In reality, whilst less than one-sixth of the total Mekong catchment is in China, it has held some of the dry-season flow back, 37 which is crucial to neighbouring countries during the dry season. Over recent years and until the 2010 floods, water levels on the Mekong, the river basin of which is the greatest inland fishing region in the world, were desperately low, following a long, brutal drought in Yunnan. China has undertaken to more than double its reliance on renewable energy by 2020, and is positioned to become a leading player in wind, solar and hydropower industries.125 It is the leading producer of wind turbines and it is making massive investments in its electricity grid \u2013 on hydropower in particular. By comparison to its leading competitor, the US, China has stricter fuel-emission standards and a more favourable and predictable market for private investments in clean energy technology. It has been argued that China long-term objective is to secure a leading position so that it can be secure during the transition to the new era of clean energy. At the same time it is now the leading manufacturer of components for renewable energy technologies. Above all, China is investing massively to achieve its goals \u2013 roughly $1,000bn over the next 10 years.126 China has traditionally been unwilling to co-operate on environmental matters with its Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) partners on matters affecting the South China Sea.127 Ethnic, cultural and political differences have not been easily overcome, and overlapping claims to central parts of the sea have caused repeated political skirmishes between China and various ASEAN members, and still do. That said, as regular high politics interaction has become more frequent fora have emerged which have slowly enhanced co-operation, although China's active political engagement and participation is key. But economic and sovereignty issues for China remain a stumbling block and it remains extremely wary of multilateral fora.128 There may be signs that China is now willing to engage with concerned governments in the region, however. In April 2010, China explained at the Mekong River Commission, the inter-governmental body supposed to resolve disputes, blaming the low water levels on climate change, a claim supported by a number of international water and environmental experts.129 And later in July, China took officials from Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam to view both the Xiaowan and Jinghong dams.

China has experienced considerable economic growth that is likely to continue. However, growth has been tied intrinsically to resource management and choices made in China over recent decades has resulted in severe degradation which is undermining \u2013 though not halting \u2013its successes. As China seeks to adapt to climate change and simultaneously respond to growing resource-demands of its population, the choices it will make will directly impact on countries in the sub-region. Incorporating conflict prevention and resolution mechanisms into China\u2019s resource, environmental and climate change policies could dramatically increase the potential for sound national and regional peace. Such an approach is necessary not only for China, but for the region as a whole, 38 and should be matched also with sound trading practices at national, regional and international levels (see section 3.2 Looking Ahead: Risks and Opportunities). Case Study: Indonesia Indonesia\u2019s forests have become synonymous with conflict, corruption and deforestation, and are responsible for over three-quarters of Indonesia\u2019s GHG emissions.131 Two key relationships are central in this regard \u2013 on the one hand there is deforestation and climate change, and on the other is the forest sector and conflict. Linking both is illegal logging, which at one time reportedly cost Indonesia an estimate USD 2 billion per year.132 Under President Yudhoyono, however, considerable advancements have been made although illegal logging continues. Addressing the adverse characteristics of Indonesia\u2019s forests sector, in particular the corruption within this dynamic, would underpin peace and security by both mitigating climate change and cutting links between timber and insecurity. Indonesia\u2019s deforestation rate is fastest in the world. According to a 2007 report commissioned by the World Bank and the UK Department for International Development (DfID), it is now among the top 3 emitters in the world.133 Indonesia has also been host to one of prime examples of conflict timber, \u2013 a dynamic that has permeated Indonesia\u2019s forestry sector to a backdrop of violence and corruption. In recognition of this link, the partnership between Indonesia and EU\u2019s Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT), included the establishment of several Conflict Resolution Forums, with full mandates to \u201camicably resolve forestry related conflicts.\u201d134 The dilemma facing Indonesia\u2019s forests can, in part, be dated back to policies developed before its current administration. An Associates in Rural Development (ARD) report from 2003 examined conflict timber in Indonesia in 6 of its provinces and found that, although there were variations on the characteristics of conflict timber between provinces, there was one over-riding theme in all cases and that was the influence of previous governments from the colonial period and/or from Suharto\u2019s authoritarian rule over Indonesia\u2019s resources and forests in particular.135 Suharto\u2019s regime tightly controlled resources for its own profit with minimal benefit for the Indonesian population. Conflict was suppressed through intimidation. Post Suharto, and with decentralisation, conflicts linked to the timber trade occurred between and within businesses, communities, foreign interests and varying levels of government and security forces. 136 This has been compounded by subsequent influences including bureaucratic, political and military weakness, corruption and the decentralisation process.137 With illegal logging reportedly costing Indonesia an estimated USD 2 billion per year,138 President Yudhoyono introduced a crackdown in Indonesia\u2019s forestry sector in 2005. Since then illegal logging has dipped considerably but corruption and illegal logging still remain rife. This is reflected in other resource sectors as well and has adverse consequences for, in particular, forest communities but also Indonesia\u2019s overall population. For example, Human Rights Watch found that between 2003 and 2006, funds lost to illegal logging were equal to the total amount of Indonesia\u2019s entire health spending 39 for the same period.139 The realities and costs of Indonesia\u2019s illegal logging industry also stretch into other resource sectors. Notably, a government task force assigned to investigate illegal activities revealed that only 67 of 352 plantations were operating legally in Central Kalimantan, and that only 9 of 615 mine operators were operating legally.140 As reflected in this case study, an unregulated or corrupt forestry sector can present issues of deforestation, climate change vulnerability and conflict. While efforts to cut ties by Indonesia\u2019s current administration with Suharto\u2019s legacy and the problematic decentralization that followed has at times been difficult it has also seen considerable and noteworthy improvements. These have also reflected the regional and global reality of illegal", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dc5f0435-6b32-41d1-b34b-99e24f81a6e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "dc5f0435-6b32-41d1-b34b-99e24f81a6e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "599b7aa233cd9c5646739805d0343ec4b8378242e7d7c79cdbc91b9b22078348"}}, "hash": "599b7aa233cd9c5646739805d0343ec4b8378242e7d7c79cdbc91b9b22078348", "text": "logging that is reflected in, for example, the fact that when Europe banned imports of illegal timber, destruction of Indonesia\u2019s forests halved.141 Other notable steps have been taken in this direction. China and the United States, the world\u2019s largest importers of forest products, have entered into an agreement to ban the import of illegal and unsustainably harvested timber from countries including Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.142 Similar legislation should be introduced holistically within the Asia Pacific region and globally in order to ensure that illegal logging is halted and should be matched with international regulations that ensure transparency and accountability (see section 3.2 Looking Ahead: Risks and Opportunities). 2.2.2 South and West Asia South Asia, home of half the world's poor 143 and classified by the World Bank as particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change 144 has high and growing population levels, serious poverty issues and is exposed to conflict and environmental stress. For example, 50% of South Asia's population was affected by an extreme weather event between 1990 and 2008 leaving about 60,000 dead and 45 billion USD in damages.145 In a study by the German Advisory Council on Global Change, Climate Change as a Global Security Risk, it was found that the climate change effects in the India, Pakistan and Bangladesh sub region could \u201cincrease social crisis potential which is already characterized by cross-border conflicts (India/Pakistan), instable governments (Bangladesh/Pakistan) and Islamism\u201d (suggested change: religious fundamentalism Islamism.\u201d146 In 2008, in recognition of the regional dimensions of climate change, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) environment ministers adopted the Dhaka declaration on climate change and Action Plan on Climate Change stretching from 2009 to 2011 where it identifies key thematic areas of cooperation: adaption; mitigation; technology transfer; finance and investment; education and awareness; management of impacts and risks; and capacity building for international negotiations.147 National and regional security issues that could arise from climate change, however, are not mentioned. This mirrors a general truth: peace and security is largely sidelined from climate change discourse. River water in South Asia supplies both downstream and upstream countries and has increasingly become a political issue with increased tensions of water supplies. Due to 40 climate change, Himalayan glaciers, which supply water to several of South Asia's most crucial rivers, are retreating. Because of the dependency of the rivers which draw their water from the glaciers, disrupted water supplies to the rivers could have widespread consequences for the sub region and its populations (see 2.1 Risks and Vulnerabilities). This, coupled with the projections of increasing weather events, higher temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, growing populations and increasing needs and use of water could be extremely problematic. Distribution of fresh water is unequal and this is exacerbated by pollution and changes associated with climate change. This has been both a source of cooperation in the past and also of tension. For example, tensions between India and Pakistan have risen from over the Baglihar dam construction over River Chenab in Indian-administered Kashmir.148 People living along the coastlines of Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh also face repercussions of rising sea levels, which could cause mass migration. Central to this is the Indus River Basin, which is a primary water source for millions in both India and Pakistan. In order to create hydropower, dams and canals have been built which has also resulted in the drying of certain parts of the Indus River Basin and resulted in increased migration across national borders. The Ganges River Basin, which is of both economic and religious importance, is also a source of tension between India and Bangladesh. Case Study: Pakistan In 2007, the IPCC projected that changes associated with climate change could worsen existing environmental stressors in Pakistan and lead to affected land, agriculture, poverty and unrest.149 Pakistan is vulnerable to potential adverse effects of climate change due in part to pre-existing elements of insecurity, namely: environmental stressors such as earthquakes and floods, economic weakness and political divisions, poor government oversight and resource management and a growing strength of radical Islamist groups.150 These factors also exist in a cyclical relationship with Pakistan\u2019s development. In Pakistan\u2019s 2010 report on its progress toward the MDGs, it noted that several factors from the global economic crisis to domestic security issues to devastating 2010 floods, would negatively impact on Pakistan\u2019s economy and its realisation of MDG goals and targets.151 There is growing concern this dynamic could impact negatively on national and cross-border security with, in particular, Afghanistan and India. Pakistan's primary natural resources, water and arable land, at one time represented an area of security. Today, the opposite is true.

The sector employs approximately 54% of Pakistan's workforce. 153 Pakistan is also heavily deforested, a factor that has been cited as contributing to the 2010 floods, identified by the UN as the largest humanitarian crisis in recent history - an estimated 20 million people have been affected by the floods with 10 million homeless, 1,700 lives lost,154 2.7 million displaced,155 and 5.3 million jobs lost or affected.156 The floods have caused concern that Afghan and Pakistani militant groups could capitalise on weak government oversight to increase control and legitimacy, 41 thereby deepening insecurity. This has been true in the past. For example, following the 2005 earthquake in the Northwest Frontier Province (NFP) and Azad Kashmir, militants were quick and effective in the provision of assistance. This helped them garner support and legitimacy.157 At the centre of concerns over regional security dynamics are tensions over water. An article published in the Washington Post in January 2009, stated \u201c[t]he water crisis in Pakistan is directly linked to relations with India. Resolution could prevent an environmental catastrophe in South Asia, but failure to do so could fuel the fires of discontent that lead to extremism and terrorism.\u201d158 Tellingly, reports state that militant groups have seized upon increasing tensions between Pakistan and India over water. Jamaat-u-Dawa, the charity wing of the anti-Indian Lashkar-e-Taiba, which was responsible for the 2008 attack in Mumbai which claimed 163 lives, refer to water tensions in anti-Indian rhetoric.159 While the relationship between Pakistan and India is one of the most tense in the world, water agreements have historically been a source for cooperation through the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty that assigned water access between India and Pakistan. However, this could change. Recent tension concerning the Kishenganga power project in Kashmir and Jammu, which Pakistan fears will affect its water supply and its agricultural industry, led Pakistan to file a case in May 2010 with the International Court of Arbitration in it attempts to prevent the project from continuing. This marked the second time in only 3 years and since the signing of the Treaty in 1960, that Pakistan invoked arbitration under Article IX of the Indus Water Treaty.160 In January 2011, Pakistan was made to withdraw its petition.161 However, water tensions are not only cross-border. The Kalabagh Dam on the Indus River in the Punjab Province of Pakistan is stirring tensions with Sindh and Baluchistan Provinces and the Northwest Frontier Province (NFP).162 IPCC projections highlight that melting Himalayan glaciers can adversely affect the Indus River. Together with projected rise in monsoon variability, this is a worrying projection for Pakistan's water and agricultural sectors and regional security. The change in extreme weather patterns and their devastating effects on the most vulnerable and exposed sectors and populations in Pakistan is a worrying sign of the toll that environmental destruction and change can take on security. Essential to mitigating the threat-multiplying effects of climate change in Pakistan and the region is increased oversight, heightened regional cooperation and information sharing and, above all, equitable natural resource management and distribution that results in balanced supply and demand dynamics that consider the most vulnerable people and sectors. The region should also explore the possibilities of expanded livelihood choices for its vulnerable populations. This would decrease the likelihood of conflict in the face of, for example, extreme weather events. Establishing participatory resource- conflict prevention and resolution mechanisms within, for example, climate change strategies would further decrease the likelihood of conflict in Pakistan and the sub-region. 42 Case Study: Bangladesh Bangladesh is classified as a country most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and is already experiencing its adverse effects.163 This is due in part to its high exposure to extreme weather events, particularly floods and cyclones, and sea level rise. When coupled with inadequate governance structures, high population density, widespread poverty, and reliance on natural resources and ecosystem services, climate change effects could undermine security through migration and increased resource scarcity. More than 5 million Bangladeshis live in areas that are very vulnerable to cyclones and storm surges and every year, between 30 and 70% of the country is flooded,164 placing pressure on land availability, agriculture, and water security and straining development.165 However, Bangladesh has seen improvement in its resilience to climate change through its efforts on adaptation. For example, when Cyclone Sidr struck in 2007,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e7ff979f-12f0-4903-9514-a83307f385c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "e7ff979f-12f0-4903-9514-a83307f385c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f3833bbf80523aed4067fa6f55ff92d429ee93c412bff167c35bfe05e218fd28"}}, "hash": "f3833bbf80523aed4067fa6f55ff92d429ee93c412bff167c35bfe05e218fd28", "text": "Bangladesh had taken efforts to increase its disaster preparation. While damage was nonetheless devastating, it has been estimated that if Bangladesh had not taken the measures that it did, the human and financial toll would have been far greater.166 Notably, the inclusion of women in decision-making on disaster preparedness has also lessened their vulnerability.167 Similarly, the same is true of the diversification of income amongst high-risk agriculture communities that also lessened potential adverse social impacts on livelihood.168 While measures taken have increased Bangladesh\u2019s resilience to climate change, the challenges confronting Bangladesh in the face of climate change are not negated as considerable challenges remain - not least of which is the nexus between natural disasters, migration, and security. In the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), disputes over land span as far back as the late 1970s. Between 1979 and 1985, the Bangladesh Government relocated hundreds of thousands of Bengalis to the CHTs promising access to land and food. Indigenous communities in the area have long opposed the settlement of Bengalis and have called for autonomy, are amongst the most marginalised in the country, and have faced human and civil rights abuse in the face of conflict between the Shanti Bahini, the military arm of the Parbatya Chattagran Jana Sanghati Samiti (PCJSS) and the Bangladesh Government, which ended with the Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord, signed in 1997. There have been accusations however, that the accord has not been honoured by the government and settlers and resentment is growing. For example, February 2010 saw several violent altercations in the CHT with homes burnt and lives lost. The Accord outlined that land owned by indigenous peoples be returned to them but as many do not have proof of ownership, resentment is growing. Meanwhile, Bengalis who were relocated to the CHT do not want to leave 169 and meanwhile, India has asserted that Bangladesh Army operations in the CHT region have caused mass migration into India.170 With an increase in extreme weather events comes also the risk of increased migration to both the CHT region and across the border to India. India has responded to migration issues with its neighbour by erecting a barbed wire fence along their shared border with the expressed goal of keeping out Islamic militants, illegal smuggling and trafficking. 43 The fence, however, has already become a source of tension with suspicions, fears, and accusation from both sides171 and reports of several hundreds killed by border security guards.172 With the increased environmental and human pressures that are projected with climate change, existing tensions between the two countries are unlikely to decrease and, as such, increased cooperation and planning is necessary and this must also mainstream the needs and involvement of the poorest, which include indigenous groups, into building national, and regional resilience climate change and conflict. Through its adaptation mechanisms, Bangladesh has considerable strengths to build upon in regards to its National Adaptation Programmes of action (see section 3.1 Existing Mechanisms: Strengths and Weaknesses) that could, in several cases, be looked to as an example of sound adaptation policy that could be considered for inclusion in other adaptation policies. However, Bangladesh and the sub region could further build upon these strengths by expressly incorporating resource-based conflict mitigation and resolution in its NAPA and other policies and ensuring representation of vulnerable groups including, in particular its indigenous peoples \u2013 a necessity that is true also for the region as a whole (see section 3.2 Looking Ahead: Risks and Opportunities). 2.2.3 Pacific Scientific research now advises many small island states to prepare for humanitarian catastrophes borne by increased extreme weather events and rising sea levels (see Figure 5: IPCC projected impacts of Climate Change on the Asia-Pacific). While the majority of migration is internal, long-term uncertainties coupled with increased GHGs could internationalize much of the migration associated with disappearing states. In their submission to the UN Secretary General's report Climate Change and its possible security implications, the PSIDS highlighted that they were facing \u201crising sea levels, changing weather patterns and natural disasters, soil erosion, loss of coral reefs\u201d173 and that this had adverse effects on food security, water security, public health, physical and social infrastructure, the loss of lives and livelihoods, migration, loss of islands, territorial integrity, sovereignty, legal rights, conflict and unrest, and sociocultural impacts.174 Several Pacific island states have experienced \u201cheavy inundation of heavily populated coastal areas, loss of freshwater, failure of agriculture and other results of saltwater intrusion\u201d175 and resettlement and migration.176 Extreme food and water shortages that have been aggravated by the effects of climate change have displaced of individuals and communities in Vanuatu, Micronesia, Papua", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "40768169-6104-4978-a0ca-23104f117dc1": {"__data__": {"id_": "40768169-6104-4978-a0ca-23104f117dc1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c2cafdb43dcb9c0c2cf9d764df44c0d5a41184c6abc2529269bc2a02f548bb54"}}, "hash": "c2cafdb43dcb9c0c2cf9d764df44c0d5a41184c6abc2529269bc2a02f548bb54", "text": "New Guinea, Tuvalu and the Solomon Islands.177 Food and water supplies were also recently negatively affected due to salt deposits and contaminants caused by rising sea levels. In Kiribati, water shortages reached critical levels and threatened to plunge Kiribati into a state of emergency.178 44 Case Study: Solomon Islands The Solomon Islands, a Pacific island nation with a population just over half a million comprises of nearly one thousand islands and has an economy which is heavily dependent on its agricultural, forestry, and fishing industries. Logging exports accounts for a significant proportion of the Solomon Islands\u2019 GDP. The islands were deeply affected by civil conflict between the late 1990s and 2003. In late 1998, Guadalcanal militants, the Isatabu Freedom Movement (IFM), mounted a violent campaign of harassment against migrants, mostly from a densely populated island, Malaita. In response, a rival militant group, the Malaita Eagle Force (MEF), comprising ex-policemen and youths, together with a paramilitary group named the Police Field Force, mounted a military coup in June 2000. Serious violence continued until the Townsville Peace Agreement (TPA) later that October (the ceasefire still holds), although there was a pattern of low-level violence, widespread looting and lawlessness throughout the islands until the deployment of the Australia-led Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) in July 2003.179 Such conflict, it has been argued, illustrates that even in a small island state such as this the unequal distribution of resources can cause violent conflict and tension.180 The socio- economic setting in the Solomon Islands sees a dependence on primary commodity exports (logging and fishing account for roughly 30 to 40 per cent of its GDP for the past two decades181). This, together with its youth-heavy population, can provide appropriate conditions for a \u2018resource war\u2019. Notably, a range of actors, including ex-militants, politicians and businessmen, benefited financially from the violence and disorder, particularly during the post-coup phase of the conflict. Important to the coup were middle class businessmen and politicians \u201cwhose personal wealth and status (were) tied up with who control(led) the state... (and the coup was in reaction to the introduction of) \u2026anti-corruption regulations which ... upset established business connections.\u201d182 Such anti-corruption reforms had become necessary. In essence, political morality had fallen to such a low level that national politicians were noticeably in the pocket of various Asian logging companies seeking and gaining ready access to the Solomon Islands' forests for logging rights in return for bribes and sweeteners, some of which was used to fund elections campaigns. 183 Even so, following the coup and ceasefire, pervasive corruption continued to affect the post-conflict demobilization process. The state, rather than lootable primary resources, had become the subject of predation.184 Set against this history of conflict and poor development, the Solomon Islands face the prospect of changes in their environment caused by climate change, which, it is argued, will exacerbate underlying tensions and undermine security. The Solomon Islands have seen a gradual long-term change in its climate over the past 30-100 years. Temperatures in the Solomon Islands have increased, but more rapidly in the past decade. Rainfall levels have decreased between 20-40 per cent in the last century and sea levels are estimated to have increased 15-25 mm between 1993-2001. 185 More widely, it is predicted that temperatures may increase by between 1-3 degrees Celsius before the end 45 of the century, and within the same timeframe, in a country already prone to flood and drought, it is estimated that rainfall levels could fall or rise by roughly 15 per cent, undermining food security. Sea levels may rise by 20-60 centimeters.186 In general terms, it has been argued that climate change may fundamentally undermine food security of southern Pacific nations, including the Solomon Islands, as they are heavily dependent on food imports but their ability to pay for them may become hampered because of adverse strains \u2013 falling soil fertility and fish abundance - placed on their agricultural and fishing sectors. 187 The Pacific Adaptation to Climate Change (PACC), a Global Environment Facility-funded project, has been working to address main medium-term effect of climate change in the local area \u2013 the threat to food security. With the effects of rising sea levels, supplies of taro, the staple root crop in Ontong Java atoll, and local ferns are dying due to rising salinity levels in the swamp. Food security for atoll islanders and coastal villagers in Solomon Islands is already in decline, which is affecting their health as well as their education - some children do not attend school because they lack sufficient food. And the islanders are unable to profit for surplus sales,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "05abc07e-8363-4b5a-ad7a-a0d54e96bda7": {"__data__": {"id_": "05abc07e-8363-4b5a-ad7a-a0d54e96bda7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6c81a023dbe9ed2e0e6575607cf14dbb358ef4e69394514dfd6c48706384b610"}}, "hash": "6c81a023dbe9ed2e0e6575607cf14dbb358ef4e69394514dfd6c48706384b610", "text": "stagnating local economies.188 Some local communities in the Solomon Islands traditionally have been well versed in adapting to climate change and/or extreme weather events (coastal protection, food sources, housing, etc.). A notable characteristic of these societies has been its mobility (migration) in the face of internal or external stresses, although these adaptive strategies cannot necessarily be attributed to climate change alone.189 And recently there have been signs of local success in combating possible sources of resource conflict. In 2009, local communities and tribal leaders in the Choiseul (or Lauru) region of the Solomon Islands, with outside assistance, agreed to create an ambitious network of marine and terrestrial protected areas using a holistic perspective that accounts for both current and anticipated consequences of climate change. The aim has been to identify and target for ecosystem- based adaptation, communities, natural defenses, food and water resources most threatened by climate change, and to implement new practices that limit the degradation and exploitation of important resources. The early signs are encouraging. The Parama reef at the northwestern tip of Choiseul, set aside as a marine protected area in 2006, had by early 2010 already seen a remarkable increase in the density of fish and other sea- life.190 Despite these signs of promise, the Solomon Islands has yet to implement measures necessary to efficiently manage its forests, a key source of its recent conflict and vulnerability to climate change and potential insecurity. But in 2008 its government did take the important step of acknowledging that the state of government coordination and legislation over this sector had played a crucial role in long lasting conflict over customary land ownership and resources and undertook to work to try to address this problem. This would represent a small but significant step in generating political will designed to tackle a significant local resource-based conflict on an area which is also crucial within climate change discourse. Such a policy needs to be developed by other governments across the Pacific region with the prioritization of participatory processes (see section 3.1.1.1, Existing Mechanisms: Strengths and Weaknesses: National). 46 3. ADDRESSING RESOURCE-BASED CONFLICTS FUELLED BY CLIMATE CHANGE Placing climate change squarely within peace and security discourse in 2007, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 191and former US Vice President Al Gore \"for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change.\" 192 In his acceptance speech, IPCC Chairman R K Pachauri said \u201c[h]ow climate change will affect peace is for others to determine, but we have provided scientific assessment of what could become a basis for conflict.\u201d193 Since then, there has been an increase in research on how the links between climate change and conflict, but there still exists no body holistically coordinating information and response to the issue. Charting existing mechanisms that address resource-based conflicts fuelled by climate change, and indeed climate change and security generally, reveals a largely porous area of policy and legislation. Much of the debate and hesitation that surrounds the climate change and security dynamic is centered on causality and sovereignty. Mechanisms that do exist do not address the issue in a peace and security context. For example, as the possibility of uninhabitable states becomes increasingly likely, questions of territorial and sovereign rights will also come to the fore. It is therefore important to address legal issues on the sovereign rights of governments whose states become submerged including, for example, the right to exploit Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), and whether or not states who lose their land due to the effects of climate change brought on primarily by other nations, can claim compensation. Adapting to climate change also means recognizing the interrelationships between the environmental and security and taking measures to sever ties that may increase the risk of conflict. Globally, the capacity of governments to deal with the more dire consequences of climate change will depend on institutional strength and capacity and political will. This will also help determine the humanitarian consequences and degree of assistance necessary from the international community through, for example, UN organs such as the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the UNHCR. As there are no existing mechanisms that address the issues of resource-based conflicts fueled by climate change, focus in this section has thus been on the few instances where climate change and security have been addressed together by the international community. This is followed by an inventory of action on climate change relevant to the region.

These stark divisions and concerns expressed in the debate have prevented further Security Council attention on this issue. This may change, however. Germany, which joined the Security Council for a period of two years in January 2011, has stated that it considers climate change to be a security issue that warrants urgent attention. Its Ambassador to the UN stated \u201c[i]n New York this is a current, and for some countries, existential problem and we would like to take up these issues and bring them before the Security Council.\" He noted, however, that several members of the Security Council could resist debate on this issue citing concern over relevance to its mandate. However, as reflected above, the nature of contemporary threats to security vary significantly from the traditional inter-state military threats common during the Cold War and recognition of this has been reflected in Security Council recent responses to, and debates on, thematic threats to peace and security.195 Prior to the 2007 Security Council climate change debate, the UK distributed a concept paper titled \u201cEnergy, Climate, and Security.\u201d In it the UK stated that the focus of the debate would be \u201cthe security implications of a changing climate, including through its impact on potential drivers of conflict.\u201d196 It went on to outline six principal climate change consequences that may threaten international peace and security: border disputes; migration; energy supplies; other resources shortages; societal stress; and humanitarian crisis.197 The concept note did not state that climate change effects would directly lead to conflict, rather the \u201ccumulative impacts of climate change could exacerbate these drivers of conflict, and particularly increase the risk to those states already susceptible to conflict.\u201d198 Opponents of the debate included Brazil, China, India, South Africa, and Russia. They claimed, for example, that climate change was an issue of sustainable development and not of security - that the debate interfered with the responsibilities of other UN bodies. Concern was also expressed over whether Security Council action on climate change would assign sweeping and uniform responsibility by all states, omitting the reality of causes of, and responsibility for, climate change, and that this would infringe on state sovereignty. Furthermore, concerns were expressed that the costs of mandatory climate change mitigation could cause negative socio-economic knock-on effects and reverse development. As one study of the legal dynamics of climate change and the Security Council found, \u201c[P]olitical will of individual Security Council members will be determinative of the ability of this organ to meet effectively the challenges posed by climate change\u2026the Security Council possesses sufficient legal authority to address both the causes and consequences of this threat. Whether its individual members chose to exercise this authority in practice remains the crucial ingredient.\u201d199 48 3.1 Existing Mechanisms: Strengths and Weaknesses In 2009, in addressing the question of the international community\u2019s effort on conflict prevention and the environment, the Swiss Ambassador to the UN stated, \u201c[c]urrent initiatives to develop new information technology schemes either focus on peace building or on environment, but seldom contain a authoritative overview of existing best practice or lessons learnt on environment related conflict prevention\u2026[w]hile existing lessons from the field clearly indicate that there are no quick fixes and no one-fits-all solutions at the operational level, there are still important gaps with regard to working instruments and tool-kits, such as mediation guidelines for resource sharing, training modules on environmental diplomacy, interactive information management tools; environmental indicators for peace-building strategies, specific sanctions regimes and guidelines to improve environmental sensitivity of peacekeeping missions, development and scaling up of positive experiences...\u201d200 Indeed, there has been a fundamental failure at national and regional policy level to address the question of security and climate change and, given the vulnerability of the Asia Pacific region to the effects of climate change, this is perhaps one its greatest policy weaknesses. Still, there have been several notable regional climate change adaptation developments which mirror an increasing awareness of the importance of participatory processes, which are essential to conflict prevention, and efforts to address resource- based conflicts. But these have been irregular and would benefit from a clear and cohesive strategy.

In light of an absence of mechanisms that address resource-based conflicts in a climate change context in the Asia Pacific region, this section charts some fora that address climate change, conflict prevention or resource management which might be well positioned to address resource-based conflicts in a climate change context. 3.1.1 National Asia Pacific country strategies on climate change vary greatly. Many have, or are expected to, develop National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPA), a platform for Least Developed Countries (LDCs) to prioritize activities that address immediate adaptation needs as they regard climate change, and many also are party to regional forums that address various climate change issues or resource-sharing agreements (see section 3.1.2 Regional). The question of resource-based conflicts in the region has however only been addressed as needs arise and mostly on an ad hoc basis. This is largely due to a lack of recognition of resource-dimensions in both low- and high-intensity conflicts (see Box 6: Mind the Gap: Identifying Sources of Conflict). Also, despite evidence that public policy on 49 resource-based conflict prevention mechanisms that prioritize participatory processes are most successful, these are far from being cohesively represented in the region and reflect a prevalence of top-down approaches in policy formation and implementation. Many states, however, have taken notable steps to address this. Also, as regional trade has moved beyond mainly localized extraction and use (see section 1.1.2 Mapping Conflicts in a Changing World) there has also been a gradual shift away from community-based resource management and conflict resolution; parties now involved in disputes over natural resources largely now refer resolution to government agencies.201 This is due in part to associated government authority, expediency and cost,202 but is also accompanied by varying issues \u2013 all of which highlight a need for more pro-poor and community-based resolutions. For example, when there is actual or perceived bias by government authorities and-or elites, this creates an imbalanced base from which one might develop and implement resource-based conflict prevention and resolution mechanisms. One-sided solutions, which often tend to favor powerful and influential parties, marginalize vulnerable groups and are seldom long lasting. 203 Hindered or unfavorable community access to resource-conflict dispute mechanisms can also be hampered by concurrent conflicts, in particular in cases where violent conflicts are present or where structural violence is such that communities become afraid of presenting grievances to government agencies. For example, during Nepal\u2019s civil war, communities were largely unable to avail themselves of government resolution mechanisms due to rampant insecurity.204 In Indonesia complaints by local communities on the activities of logging companies made during the Suharto regime were not only largely ignored, but countered with intimidation and further insecurity.205 Placed in a climate change context, vulnerable groups are likely to be exposed to increased stress and thus the necessity for comprehensive and sound resource-based conflict prevention and resolution mechanisms that address their needs are paramount. National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPA) priority areas are considered to be those that may increase costs and vulnerabilities for given states if unaddressed. NAPA priority projects by sector include: Cross-sector; Food security; Coastal Zones and Marine Ecosystems; Early Warning and Disaster Management; Education and Capacity Building; Energy; Health; Infrastructure; Insurance; Terrestrial Ecosystems; Tourism; and Water Resources.206 Yet despite widespread recognition of climate change-related resource scarcity, these do not include overarching resource-conflict prevention and resolution mechanisms. These are instead contained within diverse contexts that vary greatly from country to country. One example of resource-conflict recognition is contained in Bangladesh\u2019s 2005 NAPA, which explicitly recognized that diverse claims over water by different stakeholders often causes conflict and highlighted a need for sustainable conflict management of, in particular, the water sector with focus on capacity building.207 Also, the Solomon Islands 2008 NAPA recognized the role which pre-existing governance challenges and conflicts over resources and land play in inhibiting comprehensive adaptation, stating that \u201clack of coordination within sectors is a theme that is reflected in most sectors, in part due to weak government framework and capacity constraints.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3a900657-7472-4fef-aeb6-a9b65b3643e3": {"__data__": {"id_": "3a900657-7472-4fef-aeb6-a9b65b3643e3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c12b65235375593bd864d2e16e0ca4ff68404269c54fc42ba30915f86771534a"}, "2": {"node_id": "c8cf6bea-bfea-46ea-ae47-63fb888c3d00", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "41125ad67b6546a6a9bd6dbc2a24e4af4c235b99f2e073efc0d2389cfb453789"}}, "hash": "653b3d9279a968feb50360688e80d2605fc0ab5355774304a905c838503dc16e", "text": "In the case of the Forests Sector 50 lack of coordination is also due to conflict over land ownership and resources.\u201d208 The Solomon Island NAPA also highlighted also that it was taking steps \u201cto reduce conflict over customary land through their formal recording of ownership and mapping of their land boundaries.\u201d209 Cambodia listed land use conflicts as a potential risk and barrier in its implementation of its NAPA, but listed no conflict prevention mechanisms. 210 Similarly, the Kiribati NAPA highlighted that coastal erosion had led to the relocation of villagers resulting", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "99b36c0c-85bf-42bc-b50d-38ae41dc0c6c": {"__data__": {"id_": "99b36c0c-85bf-42bc-b50d-38ae41dc0c6c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6a58aed914ebda07749fc8431c51a1c00e3bec7e7c16dac1c3653a2e814006d7"}}, "hash": "6a58aed914ebda07749fc8431c51a1c00e3bec7e7c16dac1c3653a2e814006d7", "text": "in conflicting claims over land which made no mention of conflict prevention mechanisms either, 211 despite the fact that coastal erosion is expected to increase with climate change (see Figure 5: IPCC projected impacts of Climate Change on the Asia-Pacific). The fact that Bangladesh and the Solomon Islands recognized the role of resource-based conflicts within their national adaptation plans, is a significant development within climate change discourse, which needs to be developed further across the region. Also noteworthy is the fact that several, though not all, states have placed vulnerable groups and communities at the center of their planning. Bangladesh, for instance, stated in its 2005 NAPA that \u201cin all ecological regions the poor (including women, elderly and children) are the most vulnerable and likely also to be the most adversely impacted by climate change\u201d212 and expanded on this in its 2009 climate policy where it highlighted that \u201call programmes focus needs of this group for food security, safe housing, employment and access to basic services, including health.\u201d213 This approach is also reflected in several Pacific state NAPAs that also incorporate notable participatory processes. In the development its 2007 NAPA, Tuvalu conducted substantive community consultation with island communities and grassroots groups. The development of how best to address the issue of climate change was \u201cbased on stakeholders\u2019 observation and traditional expertise\u201d and included the consultation of church organizations, Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) and non-government organizations (NGOs).\u201d214 This approach, too, could also be built upon across the region. The representation of women in NAPAs also varies greatly. As women are the primary users of natural resources slated to be affected by climate change, are subject to rampant gender inequalities, are particularly vulnerable at times of extreme weather events, conflict and insecurity, their participation in the development of conflict prevention and climate change mitigation strategies is essential; not only because of their vulnerabilities, but also because of their strengths. Their representation, however, in adaptation strategies largely varies between countries. For example, women are featured at the center of planning and implementation in Bangladesh\u2019s NAPA215, while they are not mentioned at all in Laos\u2019 NAPA.216 Addressing this shortfall, and even harmonizing approaches as appropriate across borders, will be essential in the mitigation of resource- based conflicts in the face of climate change. 3.1.2 Regional The Asia-Pacific region hosts an array of regional institutions that are able to work effectively and informally to address problems in response to, for example, environmental hazards, natural disasters, as well as security threats, when there is consensus on common risks and when individual governments and institutions are willing 51 to assume responsibility for taking collective action. These regional institutions have been able to operate more flexibly in contrast to the constraints of regional political rivalries. However, several arrangements have duplicated effort and have not addressed broader and longer-term regional challenges, such as the security implications of climate change or existing regional resource management tensions. Several frameworks exist that could, with the necessary political will, promote peace building based on cross-border resource cooperation and coordination. Particularly relevant in mitigating resource-based conflicts fuelled by climate change are agreements and alliances that address the use of natural resources. Water agreements, for example, have been known to underpin cooperation between states. This includes, the Indus Waters Treaty (see section 2.2.2 South and West Asia) and also the Mekong River Commission (MRC), an agreement reached between Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam in 1995, and joined by China and Myanmar as dialogue partners a year later, works on managing jointly shared water resources and developing its economic potential. Although initially formed with no remit on climate change adaptation, much of the commission's work now focuses on sustainable development and environmental monitoring that assess the impact on the poorer population of the Mekong basin. This agreement may be seen as a prime example of how aspects of regional economic cooperation can be changed to collectively combat the impacts of climate change and could be used as a model for other agreements between regional countries with shared water resources.217 Reflecting increasing recognition of the realities of climate change is the recent development of \u2018Protecting the Himalayan Glaciers\u2019, an initiative created in April 2010 between China, India and Nepal for the conservation and sustainable development of the Mount Kailash Region of the Himalayas, which involves collaboration on ecological and climate change monitoring and data sharing. While it has no focus on conflict prevention in regards to resource-based disputes, it has brought together the region's two largest competitors and major GHG emitters, China and India, to work together towards preserving a common natural resource.

(and) ... could be an important stepping-stone for the management and conservation of a region that includes the sources of some of Asia's largest rivers.\u201d218 Attention within regional multi-lateral fora on sector security focus primarily on energy security, for example, through the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) \u2013 the only regional institution that draws members from Asia and the Americas, but does not consist of South Asian countries, such as India. As APEC works primarily by consensus on shared goals and has no binding provisions, its members are not compelled to meet commitments, other than by peer pressure and review. Only in its 2007 'Sydney Declaration' did it formally begin work on climate change centered on energy efficiency and security issues, although the fact that APEC leaders later withdrew specific emission reduction goals included in an earlier draft of the Copenhagen 2009 called into question 52 its commitment to its goals on climate change. Its inability to harmonize efforts among its members demonstrates, perhaps, the limitations of APEC and other Asian regional organizations.219 Although it does not represent the majority of Asia Pacific countries, the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate (APP) has arguably the most operational work plan of any of the regional institutions that deal with climate change. This is due in part to member countries including some of the largest economies that are collectively responsible for more than 50% of GHG emissions, including Australia, Canada, China, India, Japan, the ROK, and the United States. Member countries collaborate among themselves in independent task forces with the private sector to focus on cost effective public-private industry technological solutions to the climate change problems, with a broader goal of promoting investment and trade in environmentally friendly, energy- efficient technologies. The specific nature of its projects is arguably the APP's biggest advantage and principal limitation; on the one hand their goals may be practical and implementable; yet on the other it does not yet have the mechanism to translate technically feasible solutions into government policies, which ultimately it will need to achieve success.220 While the APP does not have a focus area on resource-based conflict prevention, it does specifically address areas that are essential to peace building. For example, it\u2019s Renewable Energy and Distributed Generation Task Force, in its prioritization of zero-emissions energy development, also recognizes the critical role that wide-scale renewable energy can play in \u201calleviating poverty by improving access to energy services, as well as increasing job opportunities and improving air quality and health.\u201d221 With China and India as members, the APP could represent a unique and authoritative forum within which to address Asia\u2019s cross-border tensions over, for instance energy and water sources. In order to ensure equability, however, this would need to ensure the integral involvement of countries which are impacted by, in particular, water use. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) works to build consensus discreetly and to avoid public action that could be perceived as challenging member state sovereignty. Its work on climate change emerged primarily from its efforts taken to address widespread haze pollution that affected the region, caused mainly by fires in Indonesia\u2019s tropical peat forests. The issue caused ASEAN members by and large to co- operate to a significant extent and is an important example of how regional cooperation can work to address mutual interests. Notably, in 2005, it developed the ASEAN Strategic Plan of Action on Water Resources Management. The plan specifically recognized the conflict and climate change dynamic stating that \u201cdemands may both cause greater economic competition for water resources and also potential conflicts at community, national and potentially international levels.\u201d It also highlighted that to \u201cmanage potential changing environmental and social demands effectively, comprehensive strategies and action plans are needed to develop sustainable water management systems.\u201d222 Other areas of co-operation \u2013 for example, infrastructure development aid, that can serve adaptation purposes; law enforcement and customs cooperation, needed to prevent illegal logging \u2013 may indirectly assist ASEAN efforts to 53 reduce GHG emissions. It has also entered into formal partnerships through ASEAN Plus Three (China, Japan, and the ROK), which focuses on climate change, as well as \u201cdialogue partnerships\u201d with a larger number of countries, including India and the US. Nonetheless, ASEAN Plus Three efforts on climate change thus far have been limited and have demonstrated that \u201csovereignty (has) exerted the stronger influence (than common action).\u201d223 Another primary Asian regional body is the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) made up of India, its six immediate neighbors", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7ac10624-c252-49e3-b636-088655f22b26": {"__data__": {"id_": "7ac10624-c252-49e3-b636-088655f22b26", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e96c9d7c2969af81a89b10957e49d3b3290cee057bebb162e53051bb95658d32"}}, "hash": "e96c9d7c2969af81a89b10957e49d3b3290cee057bebb162e53051bb95658d32", "text": "and Afghanistan. SAARC works around periodic heads of state and ministerial summits. SAARC's work on climate change, led by its Expert Group on Energy and the Environment, has been driven primarily by energy security concerns. An achievement of SAARC's 2007 Climate Change Declaration, an action plan designed to address adaptation, mitigation, technology transfer and capacity-building strategies, has been the establishment of five centers of excellence for climate change\u2013related research. Encouragingly, most recently in April 2010, an intergovernmental expert group on climate change was established to oversee timely implementation of the action plan. Previous SAARC environmental collaboration has centered on disaster management, for example in the wake of the 2004 tsunami, which may offer scope for its action plan to address other areas of common concern such as cross-border climate refugees. But despite the vulnerability of its members to sea level rises and flooding, in particular the Maldives, all members give priority to economic growth over concerns on climate change, reflecting possibly the most pressing concerns amongst developing states in the address of climate change. The Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (PIFS), created to implement the decisions of the Pacific Islands Forum, is an inter-governmental organization aimed at enhancing cooperation between Pacific states. As well as its role in harmonizing regional positions on various political and policy issues, the Forum Secretariat has technical programmes in economic development, transport and trade. Military and police personnel from PIFS nations formed part of the peacekeeping forces have been used in the region in the past decade, notably in the Solomon Islands in 2003 and in Tonga in 2006.224 PIFS has also provided advocacy for increased international support aimed at assisting small-island developing states\u2019 mitigation and adaptation efforts on climate change. It has actively engaged with the Development Partners Climate Change partnership and is an active member of the Pacific Climate Change Round Table.225 The Pacific Islands Framework for Action on Climate Change (PIFACC), a ten year action plan between 2006-2016 aims to ensure that Pacific Island residents build their capacity to respond to the risks and impacts of climate change.226 3.1.3 International Given the global nature of the threat posed by climate change to resource and security issues international mitigation efforts require international co-operation. And yet no international body is holistically addressing the issue of climate change and conflict, nor of resource-based conflicts. There exist, however, many platforms through which other 54 issues of climate change are addressed, particularly frameworks within the United Nations, where the prevention and resolution of resource-based conflicts could be addressed (see 3.2 Looking Ahead: Risks and Opportunities). The most widely adopted treaty on climate change to date is the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) with nearly global membership. Recommended actions on climate change under the UNFCCC have no binding nature and are entirely voluntary and recommendations have not been implemented by many states.227 The UNFCCC itself highlights that \u201c[t]he global nature of climate change calls for the widest possible cooperation by all countries and their participation in an effective and appropriate international response.\u201d228 Unfortunately, insufficient cooperation and international response is now dwarfed by the magnitude of the threats posed by climate change and the UNFCCC is not mandated to address the effects of climate change related to threats to international peace and security. The Kyoto Protocol, a protocol to the Framework Convention, first opened for signatures in 1998, came into effect in 2005 and expires in 2012. Although targets for GHGs are binding for its parties, there are no long-term restrictions, and it is not globally ratified. The 2009 Copenhagen climate talks illustrated clearly the persistent disagreement between developed and less developed countries on how best to proceed. The co- operation of BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) at the conference also illustrated that countries preferred to form alliances and negotiate on the basis of economic congruence as opposed to geographical proximity.229 That said, the climate talks a year later in Cancun, whilst not a breakthrough, \u201cbeat expectations by producing new, if modest, agreements,\u201d primarily an agreement aimed at reducing deforestation and forest degradation, also known as REDD+ (see below), as well as a new $100 billion dollar fund for \u201clong-term\u201d climate finance from the developed to the developing world. An independent board will run the fund with the World Bank acting as a trustee. Placed within these agreements were an encouraging number of achievements230 which may offer new mechanisms - a new board, programmes and institutions - and crucially funds, for achieving goals which could mean that the UN process can now move on from the \u201cflawed\u201d Kyoto protocol.231 Other international programs are", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0edbe614-6bde-4257-a9d0-5059907977ef": {"__data__": {"id_": "0edbe614-6bde-4257-a9d0-5059907977ef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "191793938bf514f2168c6d9b296f44d6e3cc793b38bf0a9472a2540145271c68"}}, "hash": "191793938bf514f2168c6d9b296f44d6e3cc793b38bf0a9472a2540145271c68", "text": "the G-20, which includes China, India, and Indonesia, and Japan and the ROK, Asia's three fastest growing and two most advanced economies, has begun to take on a global consensus-building role on climate change - \u201ctrying to move toward agreed goals and their implementation and seeking to establish broad aggregate measurements and equally broad commitments on both emissions and financing.\u201c232 Of paramount importance also to the ties between forests and climate change is Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) - an initiative designed to provide financial incentives - carbon \u201coffsets\u201d - to reduce GHG emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. Its focus in the Asia-Pacific region is on Vietnam, 55 Cambodia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Solomon Islands, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Critics of REDD scheme have accused these offsets of allowing the main polluters, governments and corporations, to buy their way out of the problems that exacerbate social and environmental conflict in those places which rely of the forest ecosystems for their livelihoods. Indeed, it has been argued that REDD and now REDD+ would provide governments and organizations with greater control over the forests than indigenous communities. The organization Global Witness argued in June 2010 REDD \"carries considerable risks for forests and local communities and will only succeed if civil society is engaged as an independent watchdog to ensure that the money is used in accordance with national laws and international guidelines.\u201d233 In regards to energy, the International Energy Agency (IEA), an offshoot of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), is an intergovernmental organization that conducts technical work and research into, and provides advice for, its members on current energy policy and best practices. Its mandate also covers aspects of economic development and environmental protection. Significantly, in recent years it has broadened its scope to conduct extensive data gathering and technical assistance missions in Asia. But its key limitation is its inability to perform as a mobilization and coordination mechanism beyond its membership, which importantly does not include the key energy markets of China and India. Smaller OECD members who are concerned that these larger countries will dilute their influence have resisted their proposed membership of the IEA.234 One paper has highlighted some possibly important bilateral efforts in Asia aimed at combating the adverse effects of climate change. The US Agency of International Development (USAID) has, for example, funded assistance programs with APEC and ASEAN. In Indonesia USAID has worked extensively in improving governance aimed at preventing illegal logging to reduce deforestation or forest degradation. The recently formed Joint U.S.-China Collaboration on Clean Energy, which draws on global expertise and collaborates with private companies to develop and facilitate clean and efficient energy use in China, \u201crepresents an important dialogue between two of the world\u2019s largest greenhouse gas emitters.\u201d235 Also, the World Bank funds its own as well as donor money to World Bank clean energy, energy efficiency and climate change\u2013related projects in Asia (about US$6 billion). In South Asia, it supports adaptation projects to help countries most affected by climate change deal with its impact. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) also funds efforts focused on Asian environmental sustainability underpinning regional economic development and poverty alleviation. The ADB's mitigation and adaptation work promotes energy efficiency and aims to increase access of the region\u2019s most vulnerable to climate change, the poor, to clean forms of energy.236 There have been several notable advancements in regards to addressing key vulnerabilities. For example, in 2008, in recognition of the particular vulnerability of 56 women to climate change, the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) declared gender perspectives in climate change one of its key focus areas, and following the 2010 COP 16 climate negotiations in Cancun, agreements recognized women and gender equality as central to effective climate change mitigation and adaptation. In Nepal, a UNEP and IUCN project has been developed which to aims to \u201cfacilitate mainstreaming environmental rights and the principle of sustainable development that represent the interests of all Nepali Citizens, with particular attention to those of women, poor and marginalized people.\u201d237 Supporting national strategies that address increasing extreme weather events is the focus of the UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction Asia & the Pacific. It operates within the Hyogo Framework for Action, a ten year UN action plan adopted in 2005 to protect lives and livelihoods against disasters and works specifically through a network of national and regional platforms to mobilize government action on disaster reduction and, at regional government level, to assist the formulation of national action plan on disaster risk reduction within national development plans.

Neither is there address of, at the broadest sense, climate change and security issues. However, several options exist to address this gap and these are presented below. 57 3.2 Looking Ahead: Risks and Opportunities Comprehensive climate change mitigation and adaptation is an essential component in peace building and conflict prevention; by prioritizing good governance through sustainable human development, sound resource management and pro-poor approaches, the needs and rights of the world\u2019s most vulnerable people and sectors are addressed while helping safe-guard a peaceful future. The development of climate-friendly policies not only represent long-term peace and sustainable growth, they also present opportunities for building bridges across communities and countries through comprehensive representation and cooperation. In a study charting options for resource management in a climate change context, it was found that the benefits of sound resource management and climate change action could include poverty alleviation, reduced demand for humanitarian assistance, enhanced sink capacity and biodiversity conservation.243 As summarized by former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan: \u201cEnvironmental degradation has the potential to destabilize already conflict-prone regions, especially when compounded by inequitable access or politicization of access to scarce Box 6: Mind the Gap: Identifying Sources of Conflict High-visibility conflict characteristics often become the focal point in conflicts, with environment-related issues pushed aside.239 As highlighted by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA), \u201c[t]he mechanisms through which natural resources induce conflicts are often deeply rooted in economic and social structures and call for integrated approaches in addressing peace and development.\u201d 240 The identification of resource-based instigators of conflict does not negate underlying issues of, for example, governance. However, recognition can serve as an invaluable tool for early warning and symptoms identification. This will be particularly vital in regards to low intensity direct-use resource conflicts in the context of climate change. However, harmonized and holistic information on resource-based conflicts is sorely lacking, revealing a gap in information that will need to be addressed in order to inform sound policy and approaches on conflict prevention and climate change adaptation. For example, although natural resources have been noted as playing a central role in Nepal\u2019s decade-long civil war and subsequent instability, this is not clearly represented in discourse. The Heidelberg Institute Conflict Barometers during the civil war period and beyond never listed resources as a conflict item, attributing conflicts solely to issues of \u201csystem/ideology, national power.\u201d241 On the other hand, detailed reports by the ARD exist on the role that the forest and water sectors play in insecurity, while a report by the UNEP lists yarsa gumba as fueling the civil war.242 The UNEP report does not, however, mention forests or water in the context of Nepal, neither does the ARD report refer to yarsa gumba. While this is not necessarily strange (agencies, of course, vary in focus and scope), it perhaps indicates an absence of comprehensive representative information from which to base proactive, integrated and long-term conflict prevention and climate change adaptation. 58 resources\u2026Programmes relating to the environment not only are a vital way of systemically reducing one of the worst sources of tension within or among societies, they can also have a positive impact locally by promoting dialogue around shared resources and enabling opposing groups to focus on common problems. This is particularly the case with respect to shared water resources.\u201d244 The following recommendations are geared toward national governments and regional bodies in the Asia Pacific, NGOs and CSOs, and the international community. Recommendations contained herein do not purport to represent all needed or available actions and opportunities and, in recognition of this, are therefore followed by suggested \u2018universal approaches\u2019 that reflect needed reforms across all stakeholders in the Asia Pacific region. 3.2.1 Asia Pacific Governments The direct effects of climate change, including increased weather events and rising sea- levels, will primarily be experienced first and foremost within local contexts, exposing primarily vulnerable populations that depend on the sectors that stand to be most effected by climate change (see section 2.1 Risks and Vulnerabilities).

As such focus by national governments should: 1. Incorporate environment and security factors into development, conflict prevention and climate change strategies, particularly in NAPAs, ensuring cross-sector approaches toward MDG goals with consideration for IPCC data and projections. This should include mainstreaming security issues into Disaster Risk Reduction strategies (DRRs) and into the address of various intra-state resource custody chains and cross-sector dependencies, ensuring the engagement of vulnerable groups. 2. Recognize and address current problem areas relating to low- and high- intensity resource conflict and anticipate new problem areas, recognizing also the need to develop cohesive conflict prevention strategies and addressing internal governance challenges, existing land tenure and property rights issues. Oversight issues and shortfalls in resource-based conflict prevention and resolution should also be addressed through, for example, the development of conflict prevention strategies in consultation with vulnerable groups, CSOs and NGOs. 3. Ensure that \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 approaches to resource conflict resolution and climate change adaptation are avoided, by ensuring climate change adaptation strategies are context-specific, participatory, and pro-poor, prioritizing strong vulnerable-groups representation and front-lining community empowerment and ownership. 4. Act now to decrease vulnerabilities and promote good governance and sustainable human development, in particular through resource management of energy, water, 59 land and forests and identify possible economic and peace building benefits, including increased employment, in climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. This should also include: i) Increased engagement across sectors and stakeholders, prioritizing engagement and close cooperation with national and international NGOs and CSOs in an effort to ensure equal representation \u2018trickle-up\u2019 approaches, and of the private sector; ii) Harnessing of traditional adaptation practices, with the active participation of vulnerable groups, in particular women and indigenous groups who have history of resource management and are primary users of natural resources. This should also involve the participations of religious groups and youth leaders; iii) Development of targeted conservation plans that mirror specific local needs and climate change vulnerabilities. This can help mitigate large-scale migration and the success of such strategies can be seen, for example, in Bangladesh; iv) Decouple economic growth from environmental pressures, developing sound green policies in order to underpin a gradual movement towards low-carbon, environmentally friendly, climate resilient economies. This should be coupled with economic diversification and increased livelihood choices. In Pacific Island states, this may mean addressing sustainable national consumption, whereas in South Asia, this may mean sustainable consumption coupled with increased national consumption. 5. Frontline awareness raising and training at all levels and across all sectors on natural resource-use, with focus on sustainable use while also harnessing best practices and lessons learnt from within and between communities. An example of such a system exists with India\u2019s Center for Environmental Education, which has developed broad spectrum strategies designed to mainstream environmental sustainability across several target areas including, for example, focuses on children, the media, industry and also climate change. Such programs can prove essential for capacity building on information gathering, analysis and solutions-identification on resource based-conflicts. 6. Review national policy and legislation and practice due diligence in the review or development of any old or new projects, ensuring fiscal transparency, environmentally sound practices and activities that do not undermine communities, resource availability, development and security. 60 3.2.2 Regional government bodies The effects of climate change will be felt across national boundaries and will reflect the realities of the environment and its resources, stretching through across borders through, for example, waterways, forests and the extreme weather events. As summarized by the Stern report, \u201c\u2026reducing the risks of climate change requires collective action. It requires co-operation between countries, through international frameworks that support the achievement of shared goals. It requires a partnership between the public and private sector, working with civil society and with individuals. It is still possible to avoid the worst impacts of climate change; but it requires strong and urgent collective action. Delay would be costly and dangerous.\u201d245 Regional coordination represents opportunities for regional, mutually beneficial cooperation and peace building. In order to maximize the opportunities presented, regional bodies should: 1. Prioritize regional cooperation, building on existing ASEAN, SAARC, and PIFS partnerships, with a focus on benefits and burden sharing in order to support sustainable human development that empowers local communities and considers effects across state boundaries. Coordinated actions could curb possible competition of increasingly scarce resources that could increase vulnerability to conflict and undermine development gains across borders. 2. Include natural resource based conflict prevention into overall climate change strategies, increasing information sharing between states on natural resources, and ensuring the active participation of vulnerable groups.

Prioritize resource management agreements between states and through regional bodies that underpin peace and cooperation with the active participation of, in particular China and India, using for example the Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) mechanism that takes a cross-sector approach to water management, going beyond strictly water management spheres and mirrors the realities of climate change. IPCC predictions and expected population growth should be factored into dialogue and agreements. 4. Strengthen coordination within and between SAARC, ASEAN, and PIFS, both as a platform for information gathering, sharing and awareness raising, and as a platform to bring synergized adaptation and mitigation policies to the fore within international community discourse on climate change and security. If the UN Security Council were to officially recognize climate change as a potential threat to peace and conflict, it would be essential that Asia Pacific countries be involved in such a development from the start, and that policies be channeled through regional coordination. 61 3.2.3 Non-Government Organizations (NGOs), Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) 1. Underpin bottom-up approaches, aiding the empowerment of communities and vulnerable groups, by lending voice internally and internationally to specific needs and threats in regards to resource-based conflicts and climate change. This should include aiding representation of vulnerable groups\u2019 interests in NAPA and DRR strategies. 2. Help ensure that policies and legislation are context-specific, including in the continuation and/or introduction of new projects on trade, technology, infrastructure, such as in the development of dams and industrial logging projects. 3. Aid in awareness-raising and capacity building at community-level, harnessing traditional adaptation strategies, resource management mechanisms, and conflict prevention practices. 4. Increase lobbying activities, ensuring heightened attention by news media, policy- makers, donors, the private sector and other stakeholders, and advocate for change where necessary. This should be underpinned by increased information gathering on resource-based conflicts in the region. 5. Provide assistance to governments and communities, where appropriate, in resource management, conflict prevention and mediation, through the provision of non-partisan and pro-people expertise on resource, conflict, and climate change dynamics. 3.2.4 The International Community 1. Consolidate and prioritize resource-conflict prevention mechanisms, ensuring financial and other support for resource-conflict mitigation strategies. This should build on UN General Assembly Resolution 63/280 whereby recognition of ties between climate change and security was accompanied by a call for UN agencies to increase attention to the issue. This should be addressed through: i) The UN Security Council, reviewing its mandate to include environmental security as a key issue of conflict prevention and recognize that climate change could pose a threat to peace and security. As such, the UN Security Council could also consider the establishment of a subsidiary body with a pivotal role in coordinating climate change-related security issues which could work closely with key stockholders, for example, ASEAN, SAARC and PIFS, the IPCC, ECOSOC, OCHA, ISDR, UNHCR, IOM, WTO and the World Bank. The UN Security Council could, while adhering to the principle of common but differentiated responsibility, address this issue by looking at overarching issues 62 concerning security and climate change, and also by addressing immediate and regional issues. ii) The UN Department of Political Affairs (UNDPA) and the UN Peace building Commission (UNPC), prioritizing and funding critical roles in conflict prevention and ensuring that resource-based conflicts and climate change are factored into peace building and conflict prevention strategies; iii) The UN Environment Programme (UNEP), ensuring its upgrade to a UN specialized agency following recognition by international environment ministers in February 2011 that increased attention was needed on environment issues, especially in light of climate change.

Provide international support for the inclusion of resource-based low- and high- intensity conflict prevention and resolution strategies in both national and regional arenas that recognize cross-sector realities, prioritizing the following areas: empowerment and training schemes for communities and vulnerable groups; the 63 development of cross-community and cross-border information sharing schemes on best practices and lessons learnt on climate change adaptation and resource-based conflict mitigation and resolution. These should ensure the active involvement of vulnerable groups with particular focus of women who stand to be the most effected by climate change, are primary natural resource users and managers, and are especially vulnerable during conflict. 3. Support the development of a low- and high-intensity resource-based conflict database. This could be a new database following structures of, for example, the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) and the Heidelberg Institute Conflict Barometer, and/or considered for incorporation into existing indexing mechanisms such as the UN Human Development Index (HDI). Information gathered should be used to identify fault-lines, match them with IPCC projections, and inform strategies for peace building, conflict prevention, and conflict resolution. 4. Ensure that world agriculture markets represent equal opportunities for developing countries and match trade with IPCC projections on climate change effects that could fuel resource-scarcities. This should involve close coordination and cooperation with, for example, the DPA, WTO, the UNDP, the UNEP and FAO. 5. Take concrete steps to ensure that resource trade does not underpin conflict. Due diligence in all countries and sectors along the commodity chain is essential. Trade should be made conflict-free, legal, and sustainably sourced and consider methods for the creation of public/private partnerships and development assistance through multilateral and bilateral means to strengthen financial incentives to trade sustainably and fairly. This needs to be further explored to find ways that financial incentives could be identified. 6. Global introduction of laws that prohibit trade of illegally traded goods such as illegally sourced and traded forests products, ensuring the introduction and/or full implementation of policy and legislation targeted and curbing financial transactions on resource trades. 7. Target development towards promoting active participation and representation of vulnerable groups and communities, the rule of law, transparency and, in particular, good governance. This could improve governance and mitigate security risks posed by climate change. Aid should also support holistic and consultative information gathering and capacity building on nation-specific resource conflict vulnerabilities and generally increase recognition and action on resource-based conflicts 8. Ensure transparency and efficacy of REDD+, appointing an independent monitor to ensure accountability of stakeholders and representation of vulnerable groups, particularly as relates to indigenous peoples and forest communities and prioritizing community-forestry. 64 9. Ensure the sound development and implementation of climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, ensuring comprehensive, sound and rigorous strategies are in place and avoiding rushing toward solutions that have not been fully developed thereby threatening to undermine efforts. 3.2.5 Universal approaches At all levels, one-size-fits-all approaches to climate change, environmental security and conflict prevention risk running counter to good intentions. For example, it is clear that priority action areas for island states in the Asia Pacific related to resource scarcity and migration issues will need to be addressed differently than scarcity and security concerns related to upstream and downstream water management in South Asia. Still, while the diverse ways that climate change will affect Asia Pacific states and sub-regions should be reflected in tailored approaches, the ties between climate change and security necessitate several over-arching changes regardless of geography, focus and responsibility. These are outlined below: 1. Improve overall coordination and cooperation between sectors, agencies, and countries, harmonizing micro and macro-level strategies with interdisciplinary approaches in preventing resource-based conflicts and mitigating the effects of climate change so that actions in one focus-area do not undermine actions in another. This can also provide invaluable insight from best practices and lesson-learnt studies. 2. Abandon short-term thinking in favor of long-term strategies, prioritizing planned adaptation development and peace building whilst also reflecting the realities of climate change and resource-use on long-term and active peace and security. Strategies should focus on conflict prevention and resource management within states, their neighbors, the sub-region and the international community.

At the national level this would involve reviewing existing resource management practices and considering the prioritization of community-led resource management. 3. Address wide-spread marginalization of vulnerable and unrepresented groups in the development and implementation of climate change mitigation, resource-use and conflict prevention strategies, moving away from \u2018top-down\u2019 and \u2018one-size-fits- all\u2019 approaches in favor of ensuring participatory processes at all levels of problem and solution identification, and policy and legislation implementation within national, regional and international fora. 4. Recognize good governance, climate change and resource management as a development and security issue that stretches beyond national boundaries, ensuring that state practices do not underpin the social and environmental vulnerability of other states. This should be true both for Asia Pacific countries but also for other regions, primarily Europe and North America. 65 5. Ensure private sector participation and compliance with good governance standards and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) guidelines, through the development of sound incentives programs in the development and use of safe and sustainable resource use and trade, particularly in regards to energy. This should be matched with general private sector regulation and accountability that should prioritize ending indirect resource-use conflicts. 6. Avoid presentation of climate change effects, including projected increase of natural disasters, as a direct cause of scarcity and insecurity, which could gradually increase feelings of mistrust, panic and disempowerment at individual and community-level, or be used as a \u2018scapegoat\u2019 in place of required governance reforms. 7. Explore options of information dissemination and awareness raising through, for example, local, regional and international media, as well as through education programs and initiatives. 66 Box 7: Research and Information Sharing As reflected in this paper, many studies and senior-level assertions on the ties between natural resources, the environment and conflict have found that comprehensive information and strategies are lacking. Together with an absence of comprehensive data on resource-conflict vulnerabilities in the Asia Pacific region and the lack of a precedent similar to that of current climate change projections, the region and international community is not currently equipped with sufficient accurate data on which to base sound policy. Research can provide an invaluable source of information for resource-conflict prevention and resolution. The timely and sound use of such information would make a marked difference in the knowledge base and adaptive capacity of communities, states and regions. Research at community, country and regional level should include: - The involvement of communities most vulnerable to climate change and resource- based conflicts - particularly where government oversight is lacking; - An appraisal of low and high-intensity resource-based conflicts in the Asia Pacific drawing on, for example, local media, and community-based research; - Development of a database collated from accurate, appropriate data on low and high-intensity conflicts pertaining to natural resources, alongside IPCC climate change projections, to map where threats and opportunities lie; - Multidisciplinary and multi-stakeholder address; - Share best practice and lessons learnt approaches and toolkits, including training for information gathering, analysis and use, conflict mediation approaches, and concrete action examples. Research should be harnessed at community level with a view to inform policy makers at national, regional and international levels. 67 4. CONCLUSIONS In the absence of comprehensive and sound governance as well as resource management mechanisms, environmental impacts such as those associated with climate change accelerate tensions. This trend is likely to continue with climate change and presents the possibility that low- and high-intensity conflicts in the Asia Pacific will increase. Insecurity is largely based on pre-existing governance issues, however. Methods of resource management within and across borders, and also through inequalities that serve to underpin insecurity will ultimately play a decisive role as to how climate change will impact on the region. With the Asia Pacific region hosting almost half the world\u2019s total conflicts and two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor, the risk that increasing destructive extreme weather events, dwindling resources and sea-levels rise poses on heightening existing instabilities is high. In a statement to the UN Security Council at the debate on energy, security and climate change, former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan stated, \u201cenvironmental degradation has the potential to destabilize already conflict-prone regions, especially when compounded by inequitable access or politicization of access to scarce resources.\u201d246 In recent years concern has increased over whether rising demand for natural resources such as food, water and land will hit supply limits thereby causing increased violent conflict over scarce resources \u2013 particularly, but not exclusively, because of the projected impacts", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "61645063-e143-4def-b5bb-1e520a0819b1": {"__data__": {"id_": "61645063-e143-4def-b5bb-1e520a0819b1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c37b0909ff632ecd850b7096f43aee36795c103bfe48d44c91db15855165248c"}, "3": {"node_id": "d0d749de-f601-45d2-b366-dc37e67df0dc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e0f7758580a63fce9508cc61a1a9839fa8ba3d560897997496ef9497bfe900ca"}}, "hash": "6c7375f7609f0b5f6cf8d81b948348dfa04999839aa1d6f612e9e0aef5bb335e", "text": "of climate change. And yet while climate change is generally acknowledged as a threat to the region, Asia Pacific as a whole has not yet responded collectively to it. Indeed, many governments, particularly those of populous developing countries, see this threat as secondary to the demands placed on them for sustaining livelihood and economic growth. There have been notable developments in national, regional and international address of climate change as regards resource-management and population vulnerabilities. However, these need to be made more robust, ensuring cross-sector and multi- stakeholder representation and must be matched by the inclusion of strategies to mitigate and resolve resource-based conflicts, including cutting ties that bind trade to insecurity and conflict. As reflected in the General Assembly resolution, climate change necessitates the consideration of action across stakeholders both within development structures but also, for example, security structures. The most crucial variable in how climate change and natural resources can or will influence security lies in the action, or inaction, of states and the international community. Much will depend on the political will of states locally and regionally to harness existing resources and opportunities and to decide between a climate change context that is backed by peace, equality and cooperation, or by insecurity, scarcity and mistrust. In sum it is political will, and not climate change in itself, that will determine whether or not climate change will fuel conflict or represent opportunities for peace. 68 ANNEXES Annex I: Water Scarcity and Conflict From: WBGU Conflict constellation: \u2018Climate-induced degradation of freshwater resources: Key factors and interactions\u2019.

United Kingdom (Host) While there was some doubt about whether the Council was the right forum, the Council\u2019s responsibility was the maintenance of international peace and security, and climate change exacerbated many threats, including conflict and access to energy and food. Charged with the maintenance of international peace and security, the Security Council could go a long way towards building a shared understanding of what the effects of climate change would mean to international peace and security, now and in the future.

She stressed that, for the United Kingdom, climate change was a security issue, but not of \u201cnarrow national security\u201d. It was about collective security in an increasingly fragile world for all. Bangladesh The representative from Bangladesh said that energy and environment issues were critically important to the debate on sustainable development, particularly for developing countries. But, even though the development aspects of the phenomenon had been extensively deliberated, the security implications of global warming had not merited consideration by intergovernmental bodies in the United Nations. China Developing countries believe that the Security Council has neither the professional competence in handling climate change \u2013 nor is it the right decision- making place for extensive participation leading up to widely acceptable proposals. India The representative for India said the appropriate forum for discussing issues relating to climate change was the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. In so far as international peace and security was concerned, if developed countries reduced their greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption, it would considerably reduce such threats through a reduction in the need for privileged access to energy markets. Nothing in the greenhouse gas profile of developing countries even remotely reflected a threat to international peace and security, yet their taking on greenhouse gas mitigation targets would adversely impact their development and increase their insecurity. 75 Indonesia Supported the position of the Non-Aligned Movement and said that, while his delegation could agree with the objectives of today\u2019s debate, it believed that the issue was being addressed effectively in other fora, including the Commission on Sustainable Development, which would deliberate on the issue of energy and climate change at its fifteenth session. Maldives The representative for the Maldives said that he was heartened by the increased attention to environmental degradation and climate change, he said. Today\u2019s debate should stress the fact that close cooperation and coordination among all principal organs was indispensable for the United Nations to remain relevant and capable of meeting the existing and emerging threats and challenges. Marshall Islands The representative for the Marshall Islands said that the fate of his country and many other small island developing States already experiencing the earliest ecological impacts of climate change, was not an isolated concern, but the first link in a chain of world events that would weaken the structure of global peace. Indeed, in addition to consideration by other United Nations and international bodies, the issue of climate change deserved the ongoing attention of the Security Council and needed to be an item on the 15-nation body\u2019s regular agenda. Micronesia, Federated States of The representative for the Federated States of Micronesia said that, for his country, like other small island developing States, climate change had been a serious security problem for quite some time. From the viewpoint of an islander, living on island atolls merely a few metres above sea level, global climate change was a security threat that must be confronted urgently by the Council. The circumstances of climate change that confronted the world today were unprecedented and threatened to render meaningless all apparent social and economic achievements and developments in all areas. Pakistan, speaking on behalf of the wider membership \u201cGroup of 77\u201d and China. The ever-increasing encroachment of the Security Council on the roles and responsibilities of the other main organs of the United Nations represented a \u201cdistortion\u201d of the principles and purposes of the Charter, infringed on the authority of the other bodies and compromised the rights of the Organization\u2019s membership. Palau The representative for Palau, aligning himself with the statement by Papua New Guinea, said that small islands like Palau were particularly challenged by rising sea levels, and he called the Council\u2019s attention to the risks posed by \u201cwarming\u201d, which was not specifically identified in the concept paper. Global warming threatened to destroy coral reefs. 76 Papua New Guinea Papua New Guinea spoke on behalf of the Pacific Islands Forum saying that the impact of climate change on small islands was no less threatening than the dangers guns and bombs posed to large nations. Philippines The representative for the Philippines broadly associating his delegation with the views of the Non- Aligned Movement and Group of 77 and China, said the Philippines was participating in today\u2019s debate because of the importance it placed on energy, security and climate change issues.

It gives priority to the poor, enlarging their choices and opportunities, and provides for their participation in decisions affecting them. It is development that is pro-poor, pro-nature, pro-jobs, pro-democracy, pro-women and pro- children.\u201d (UN Development Programme (UNDP) Report of the Administrator, 1994). 6 The IPCC highlighted in its 2007 Fourth Assessment Report that the increase in global average temperature was 90% likely due to human activity and concluded that \u201c[t]he observed widespread warming of the atmosphere and ocean, together with ice mass loss, support the conclusion that it is extremely unlikely that global climate change of the past 50 years can be explained without external forcing and very likely that it is not due to known natural causes alone,\u201d (IPCC, 2007b, p. 39). The IPCC also presented in the same report that carbon dioxide resulting from human activity had grown by 70% between 1970 and 2004, with eleven of 12 years between 1995 and 2006 representing the \u201cwarmest years in the instrumental record of global surface temperature (since 1850).\u201d (IPCC, 2007b, p. p. 36). 7 The IPCC outlines two ways in which the world is vulnerable to climate change \u2013 1) through the vulnerability of its natural systems, such as tropical forests, glaciers, and coral reefs and human systems, which include \u201cmainly water resources; agriculture (especially food security) and forestry; coastal zones and marine systems (fisheries); human settlements, energy, and industry; insurance and other financial services; and human health.\u201d In a climate change context, the IPCC defines vulnerability as \u201cthe degree to which a system is susceptible to, and unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes. Vulnerability is a function of the character, magnitude, and rate of climate change and variation to which a system is exposed, its sensitivity, and its adaptive capacity.\u201d (IPCC, 2007c, p. p. 21). 8 (Buhaug, Gates, Hegre, & Strand, 2007). 9 (Uppsala University and the International Peace Research Institute in Oslo as cited in: UN Environment Programme 2009, p.5). 10 (United Nations, 1982). 11 (UN High Level Panel on Threats, 2004, s. p. 15). 12 These terms are defined by the Crisis States Research Centre (CSRC) as the following: a fragile state is \u201ca state significantly susceptible to crisis in one or more of its sub-systems. (It is a state that is particularly vulnerable to internal and external shocks and domestic and international conflicts)\u201d; a crisis state is \u201ca state under acute stress, where reigning institutions face serious contestation and are potentially unable to manage conflict and shocks. (There is a danger of state collapse)\u201d; a failed state is \u201ca condition of \u201cstate collapse\u201d \u2013 e.g., a state that can no longer perform its basic security, and development functions and that has no effective control over its territory and borders.\u201d (Crisis States Research Centre (CSRC), 2006). 13 (UN Environment Programme (UNEP), 2009). 14 (Evans, Resource Scarcity, Climate Change and the Risk of Violent Conflict, 2010, s. p. 13). 15 (Le Billon, 2008). 16 See for example (Centre for Security Studies (CSS) and SwissPeace, 2008). 17 (Centre for Security Studies (CSS) and SwissPeace, 2008). 18 (Associates in Rural Development, 2003, pp. pp. 141 - 149). 19 (Tromfimov, 2010). 89 20 (Ahmed & Mahmood, 1998). 21 (Shamsie, 2010). 22 (Associates in Rural Development, 2003, p. p. 149) 23 (Centre for Security Studies (CSS) and SwissPeace, 2008, ss. pp. 21- 24). 24 (Centre for Security Studies (CSS) and SwissPeace, 2008, s. p. 21).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e2fc107-3464-44ab-aa51-03ac61f863ae": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e2fc107-3464-44ab-aa51-03ac61f863ae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0c9078b2abeb5689f04e3257643a5eaf9335591fb3eaff1b44b663dcb76e2b54"}, "2": {"node_id": "824a420e-000b-402c-9630-9fd209300bec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9cdc32c380eb10896aed011ef359010c63e7666c963e302086daff8a6abd0d76"}}, "hash": "5107e508e3f7a00ffe5946a8757f379ad89e11164597e34fbdb85fa36ae06358", "text": "21). 25 (Centre for Security Studies (CSS) and SwissPeace, 2008, ss. pp. 20-22). 26 (Centre for Security Studies (CSS) and SwissPeace, 2008, ss. pp. 22-24). 27 (Centre for Security Studies (CSS) and SwissPeace, 2008, s. p. 25). 28 (Centre for Security Studies (CSS) and SwissPeace, 2008). 29 (Lee, 2009, p. p. 2). 30 (Osborn, 2007). 31 Melting of the Arctic ice sheets due to climate change, for example, will allow commercial traffic in Arctic waters.

However, how such shocks translate into impacts on health and well-being is rather complex. One of the aims of this paper is to examine the current evidence on impact of climate change on water and how this might further translate into impact on access to water and sanitation and how this might affect health outcomes. Our analysis here suggests that institutional and policy failures rather than climate change may have much greater impact on health outcomes due to lack of access to water and sanitation. The second aim of this paper is to examine and develop the concept of water insecurity. The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that water insecurity is multi-dimensional and that there are different elements of water insecurity manifesting different aspects of inequalities in a given society. This is done principally using data available from the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) of WHO and UNICEF in innovative ways to provide a more detailed picture of water insecurity in different countries disaggregated further in terms of the urban and rural population. As far as we know, no one has previously used the JMP data in this way to develop the idea of water insecurity. In addition to cross-country analysis, case studies of countries such as Bhutan, Maldives, Papua New Guinea and Timor Leste highlight the complexity behind the figures of access to water and sanitation. The analysis in this paper emphasises the need for focusing on inequality and reducing water insecurity as a crucial step to promoting human development and reducing vulnerabilities to climate change in Asia and the Pacific.

Climate change projections suggest that in many regions in Asia and the Pacific, precipitation patterns will change significantly affecting the distribution of freshwater resources. This can exacerbate water insecurity and wipe out decades of progress that has been made in improving access to safe water and sanitation. The potential for increased frequency of climate change induced disasters also puts at risk health of population in post-disaster contexts to water-borne diseases. Climate change may indirectly contribute to flooding and increased vulnerability of population living in coastal regions especially of the Bay of Bengal. Climate change induced droughts and food insecurity can exacerbate malnutrition. Warming is also likely to contribute to the geographic spread of certain disease vectors and thus significantly increase potentially vulnerable population. Conceptually, these various routes of connecting climate change-water-health are shown in figure 1 below. Though conceptually it is easy to think of three routes, they are hardly independent or isolated. 2 Climate change Impact on fresh water resources (1) Impact on access to safe water and sanitation Health impacts Impact on disasters (2) Rapid onset disasters - damage to infrastructure Health impacts Slow onset disasters- drought Malnutrition and health impacts Impact on disease vectors (3) Public health - vulnerability of new areas previously immune Health impacts Figure 1: Alternative routes to link climate change, water and health The Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was set up jointly by UNEP and the World Meteorological Organisation in 1988 with a resolution of the General Assembly to provide scientific advice on climate change. IPCC summarises scientific evidence on climate change, impacts, adaptation, and mitigation issues in assessment reports issued periodically. So far four such reports have been published with the fourth assessment report or AR4 in 2007. The fifth report is due to be published in 2013. AR4 is organised in terms of reports of three working groups- WG1 focusing on physical science basis of climate change, WG2 on impacts and adaptation and WG3 on mitigation measures. WG2 report\u2019s chapter 3 included a significant discussion on the impact of climate change on fresh water resources (route 1 in figure 1). The main conclusions of that chapter include the following: \uf0b7 \u201csemi-arid and arid areas are particularly exposed to the impacts of climate change on freshwater (high confidence)\u201d; \uf0b7 \u201chigher water temperatures, increased precipitation intensity, and longer periods of flow exacerbate many forms of water pollution, with impacts on ecosystems, human health, water system reliability and operating costs (high confidence)\u201d; \uf0b7 \u201cclimate change affects the function and operation of existing water infrastructure as well as water management practices (very high confidence)\u201d (IPCC,2007a). Though the WG2 report did not include a separate chapter on disasters (route 2 in figure 1), these have been discussed within various sections in the report. Within chapter 3, section 3.4.3 focused on floods. Though the report noted that there is no evidence for climate-related trend with regard to floods, it also noted that \u201c\u2026a warmer climate with its increased climate variability will increase the risk of both floods and droughts\u201d (IPCC, 2007a). Chapter 8 of WG2 (IPCC, 2007a) report focused on health and covered all three routes suggested in figure 1. With regard to storms and floods, that chapter (in section 8.2.2) noted that \u201c\u2026populations with poor sanitation infrastructure and high burdens of infectious disease 3 often experience increased rates of diarrhoeal diseases after flood events\u201d; and also that \u201c\u2026flooding may lead to contamination of waters with dangerous chemicals, heavy metals or other hazardous substances\u201d. With regard to drought, it was noted that while establishing causal link between climate variability and human nutrition may be complex, \u201c\u2026both acute and chronic nutritional problems are associated with climate variability and change\u201d (in section 8.2.3). Other sections discussed water and disease and vector-borne diseases (such as due to rodents and ticks). Conclusions in this chapter suggest that projected health impacts of climate change will be predominantly negative with most severe impact in low income countries. An important evidence for route 3 in figure 1 above comes from studies by Colwell and colleagues on cholera (Colwell,1996; Pascual et al 2000; Belkin and Colwell,2005; Jutla et al, 2011; Reyburn et al, 2011; Vezzulli et al 2012).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "92e2df89-2227-42e6-888b-bdb076a2c1da": {"__data__": {"id_": "92e2df89-2227-42e6-888b-bdb076a2c1da", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f97f3721db9a1dd6bd4f0b76164676d852a7f5d3226939fc33cff1e1395b689e"}, "2": {"node_id": "789bba47-38c9-4be2-b70f-c99c09b34d17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "32037daab1c9c4c99dfe8ebc6c734f7026254575015564135372012883493ee9"}}, "hash": "5064a891a37334f005a4bcb8414c9168246524065ec5e18b8d8cb21e52059994", "text": "These studies suggest that the periodicity in the outbreaks of the epidemic is related to sea surface temperature (SST) and the boom in phytoplankton which then leads to an increase in zooplankton which acts as a host to vibrio cholerae.

The other two routes are analysed briefly. 2. Aims Against this background, this paper has the following aims: a. To provide a brief overview of conceptual issues in applying a human development approach to water and climate change interactions; b. To examine current evidence on health impacts of water and assess alternative scenarios of how climate change impacts on water in the region might translate into various forms of health impacts and disease burdens; c. To use the concept of water security to examine the potential for climate change induced water insecurity at alternative frames of analysis, namely, water security at the level nations, of water sharing or water transfers between intra-national units, at the level of decentred communities and at the level of individual households; d. To examine the main institutional barriers to improving water and sanitation services within the diversity of institutional settings that exists in the Asia-Pacific Region and identify good practices and lessons learned; e. To identify key policy recommendations. The outline of rest of this paper is as follows. Section 3 provides a brief summary of human development approach to climate change, water and health. Section 4 provides a brief review of the link between climate change and health. In section 5, a brief overview of climate change and water resources in Asia and the Pacific is provided. Section 6 summarises the health impact of water and sanitation in terms of deaths and disease burden. Sections 7 and 8 4 contain analysis of cross-section data. Section 7 focuses on water resources and access to improved sources of water and the role of economic and institutional factors. Section 8 develops a new indicator of water security from the WHO-UNICEF data and various conjectures are examined here. This section also includes brief discussions on various case studies of different types of vulnerable communities. Section 9 provides a brief discussion on disasters and health impacts; section 10 briefly considers the impact of climate change on vector borne diseases. Section 11 presents conclusions. 3. A human development perspective on climate change, water and health With regard to climate change and human development, the Global Human Development Report 2007 noted: \u201c\u2026What is certain is that dangerous climate change has the potential to deliver powerful systemic shocks to human development across a large group of countries\u201d (UNDP, 2007: 10). Reducing dangerous climate change will enhance the freedoms (and capabilities) of those in present as well as future generations. However, the main challenge concerns distribution of the burden or costs of mitigation and adaptation. While Stern (2006) review presents an economic argument for acting now, HDR 2007 aims to present an argument on equity. This is further developed in UNDP (2011). With regard to climate change-water-health as discussed in figure 1 earlier, each of the causal links between climate change and human health are subject to external and internal drivers. For example, external drivers such as population growth, economic growth and industrialisation and adaptation and mitigation measures may determine how climate change impacts on availability of freshwater resources. How fresh water availability impacts on access to safe water and sanitation depends on external factors such as availability and extent of infrastructure, the quality and nature of institutions governing water resources, effectiveness of policies and the entitlements they provide. Notwithstanding that people have access to safe water and sanitation, ultimate health impacts depend on external drivers including level of education and awareness, hygiene behaviour, cultural factors and the quality of health and public health institutions. 5 Climate change Impact on fresh water resources Impact on access to safe water and sanitation Health impacts Education, hygiene behaviour, vaccination, public health Long term trends, uncertainty Population growth, industrialisation, adaptation and mitigation measures Variability, quality New diseases, environment favourable to disease, resistance to vaccines Infrastructure, institutions, policies and entitlements Figure 2: Climate change-water-health (route 1 of figure 1 elaborated) Human development is \u201c\u2026the expansion of people\u2019s freedoms and capabilities to lead lives that they value and have reason to value\u201d (UNDP, 2011:1). A human development approach in the design of adaptation and mitigation strategies means focusing on sustainable human development i.e., enhancing the capabilities of present generation without compromising the capabilities of future generations (Anand and Sen,2000). A human development approach means understanding how to put people at the centre of development and how the enhancing of substantive freedoms affects the external factors that impinge on each of these links in the route. A human development approach also requires us to take both inter-generational and intra-generational equity seriously and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c943363-847b-480a-85f5-9790934044b8": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c943363-847b-480a-85f5-9790934044b8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "369e30b4767c13f4b9a4633c40a3488b1384c08a8427943c3639ea497e9d8bfa"}, "3": {"node_id": "591e6b0e-fcce-4eba-a304-e4536d790b5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7321f4b13be4f53ffcf20fd1993141aee5c07c580765fb37174730aaf89c94f6"}}, "hash": "9276c553201a4849b4aaac0585abc2df9ad1b4ec0487ce0425ea6eb544a9900a", "text": "understand how the external drivers affect or do not affect those households or individuals who are most vulnerable. An approach based on deliberative public scrutiny can help in empowering individual households to make reasoned decisions regarding their reproductive rights such that population growth is sustainable. At the next level, in translating existing fresh water resources into safe access to water and sanitation, a human development approach helps in shifting attention from treating water as a commodity to focusing on functionings - the beings and doings that people can achieve with water. Entitlements determine access to resources. Even if entitlements are uniformly (equally) distributed, the outcomes (having water to drink or cook food, having a bath or washing clothes) achieved may vary depending on individual circumstances (conversion factors). The outcomes may not automatically translate into substantive freedoms. Examples of freedoms related to access to water include: freedom to live a long and healthy life with dignity, freedom to be well-nourished, freedom to have access to resources to realise a decent standard of living, freedom to live in healthy and hygienic surroundings, freedom to learn (or acquire knowledge), and freedom to pursue cultural traditions (without impinging on freedom and dignity of others). Lack of access to improved water sources contributes to disease burden and erodes the freedom to live a long and healthy life. Diarrhoeal disease among 6 children impacts on their ability to attend school and thus erodes freedom to learn. Chronic episodes of water borne diseases impinge on freedom to be well-nourished. Clarifying and protecting the entitlements of individual citizens is an important step (Anand,2007a). A human right to water can be a useful component of a broader set of entitlements which may be required to enable an individual citizen to achieve substantive freedoms though a human right proclamation alone is seldom effective (UNDP,2006; Anand,2007b). The human development approach is also helpful in approaching health impacts changing focus from negative freedoms such as avoidance of disease to positive freedoms such as long and healthy life. 4. Climate change and health One of the earliest assessments of climate change impacts on human health was made by McMichael and colleagues (WHO,1996). Among other things, the report examined evidence on relationship between temperature and mortality with case studies including two from China and one from Egypt. Effect of climate change on biological disease vectors was also examined. For example, evidence seemed to suggest that impact in terms of new cases of malaria could be between 300 and 500 million and schistosomiasis could be over 200 million. Dengue fever cases could increase by over 50 million a year. The study also considered the health impacts of sea level rise and stratospheric ozone depletion. The report identified several recommendations for further research. These issues were re-visited in a subsequent assessment (WHO, 2003). With regard to climate change models and impacts on disease vectors, this study examined in detail the potential link between El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and spread of diseases such as Malaria and cholera. The study also estimated the overall likely impact of climate change on disease burden for the year 2000 (p. 152). These suggested that worldwide, climate change contributed to 5.5 million DALYs being lost due to climate change in year 2000; approximately 2.8 million of these were lost due to malnutrition; another 1.5 million due to diarrhoea. Malaria contributed to another 1 million DALYs lost; floods contributed to about 200 thousand DALYs lost. Regional distribution suggested that nearly half of all DALYs worldwide were lost in East and South Asia region. The 51st World Health Assembly in 1998 highlighted the links between climate change and health. A decade later, the 61st World Health Assembly issued resolution 61.19 on climate change and health and called upon all member states to \u201c\u2026develop health measures and integrate them into plans for adaptation to climate change as appropriate\u201d (WHO,2008). Climate change and health was also the focus of 2008 World Health Day (WHO,2008). WG2 of IPCC (2007a) noted (in chapter 8) that climate change affects the spatial and temporal distribution of diseases such as malaria, dengue, tick-borne diseases, cholera and other diarrhoeal diseases.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "591e6b0e-fcce-4eba-a304-e4536d790b5a": {"__data__": {"id_": "591e6b0e-fcce-4eba-a304-e4536d790b5a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "369e30b4767c13f4b9a4633c40a3488b1384c08a8427943c3639ea497e9d8bfa"}, "2": {"node_id": "7c943363-847b-480a-85f5-9790934044b8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9276c553201a4849b4aaac0585abc2df9ad1b4ec0487ce0425ea6eb544a9900a"}}, "hash": "7321f4b13be4f53ffcf20fd1993141aee5c07c580765fb37174730aaf89c94f6", "text": "The report noted that \u201c\u2026The projected health impacts of climate change are predominantly negative, with the most severe impacts being seen in low income 7 countries\u2026Projected increases in temperature and changes in rainfall patterns can increase malnutrition, disease and injury due to heatwaves, floods, storms, fires and droughts, diarrhoeal illness, and the frequency of cardio-respiratory diseases due to higher concentrations of ground-level ozone\u201d.

The report considered six areas that connect climate change to health outcomes: - Changes in patterns of disease transmission and mortality - Food - Water and sanitation - Housing and human settlements - Extreme events - Population and migration. The report calls for a public health movement to frame climate change as a health issue. Goklany (2009) challenges the conclusions reached by the UCL Lancet Commission and argued that the data on relative health risk does not suggest climate change to be the number one risk. Goklany used the data from year 2000 on disability adjusted life years (DALYs) for various health risks. In his analysis, in a list of 26 risks, climate change takes 22nd rank while \u2018underweight\u2019 (malnutrition) takes the 1st rank to be followed by unsafe sex as 2nd major risk. DALYs lost due to physical inactivity are twice the magnitude of DALYs lost due to climate change. The authors of UCL Lancet Commission replied to Goklany pointing out that 2000 WHO data may be out of date because of the nature of the knowledge then and information about climate change. They claimed that in the nine years since WHO original data, further studies have attempted to examine the extent of warming and its potential impact. Further, one can argue that even the risk of malnutrition is likely to be exacerbated by climate change. The Global Burden of Disease 2010 study was released in December 2012. These figures do not fundamentally alter the overall picture on burden of disease and the relative risk of climate change. . According to these estimates, worldwide, the number of deaths attributable to unimproved water and sanitation had fallen from over 715,000 in 1990 to 337,000 in 2010 (Lim et al, 2012). This fall is consistent with the progress that is being made with regard to MDGs though there is much progress to be made. This is highlighted from the fact that nearly two thirds of the deaths are attributable to lack of improved sanitation. 8 Direct and indirect impacts Direct impact of climate change on health is likely to include: additional heat related mortality in northern latitudes; mortality directly attributable to precipitation variability, coastal and inland flooding; and the spread of vector-borne diseases especially malaria. According to data from EM-DAT international disasters database, during 2000-2009, worldwide, extreme temperatures were responsible for some 91,061 deaths worldwide forming some 5.9 per cent of all disaster related deaths. Within the Asia-Pacific region, extreme temperatures resulted in 15,163 deaths during the same period. A set of papers published in Science highlight the potential increase in the area that may be affected by malaria due to climate change. Rogers and Randalph (2000) used multi-variate models and came up with estimates of the spread of malaria which are more cautious than previous estimates by others mainly based mainly on biological models. Harvell et al (2002) noted in their study of impact of climate change on disease risks: \u201c...The most detectable effects of directional climate warming on disease relate to geographic range expansion of pathogens such as Rift Valley fever, dengue, and Eastern oyster disease. Factors other than climate change\u2014such as changes in land use, vegetation, pollution, or increase in drug-resistant strains\u2014may underlie these range expansions. Nonetheless, the numerous mechanisms linking climate warming and disease spread support the hypothesis that climate warming is contributing to ongoing range expansions. We found no unequivocal examples of natural changes in severity or prevalence resulting from directional climate warming per se. However, current data on temperature-dependent pathogen development and replication rates, and on associations between disease occurrence and climate variation, suggest several ways in which climate warming has altered and will alter disease severity or prevalence.\u201d Studies on the outbreak of cholera also allude to climate change impact. Sharp (2002) points to Rodo et al (2002) study that suggested that up to 70 per cent of variation in cholera outbreaks during 1980-2001 can be accounted for the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). A subsequent note published by the authors in Nature (Koelle et al, 2005) concludes: \u201cWe have shown the existence of refractory periods during which climate- driven increases in transmission do not result in large outbreaks.

By 2080 about 6 billion people will be at risk from contracting dengue fever compared with some 3.5 billion people if there were to be no change in the climate. 9 While the direct impacts are significant, the indirect effects are likely to be several orders of magnitude larger. One of the indirect impacts is through increased variation in climate and the vulnerability of population to natural disasters. 5. Climate change and water resources in Asia and the Pacific Almost all of the significant impacts of climate change in the Asia and the Pacific impact on water resources. The key points to note from the report of the WG1 of IPCC (2007b) AR4 are the following: \uf0b7 \u201cAll of Asia is very likely to warm\u2026; \uf0b7 It is very likely that summer heat waves/hot spells in East Asia will be of longer duration, more intense, and more frequent\u2026 \uf0b7 Summer precipitation is likely to increase in northern Asia, East and South Asia and most of Southeast Asia, but it is likely to decrease in central Asia. \uf0b7 An increase in the frequency of intense precipitation events in parts of South Asia, and in East Asia is very likely. \uf0b7 Extreme rainfall and winds associated with tropical cyclones are likely to increase in East, Southeast and South Asia\u201d (section 11.4). Further to the discussion on water and climate change in the AR4, a technical report was issued by the IPCC on this subject (Bates et al, 2008). This report noted that while some regions may benefit from increased annual runoff, globally the negative effects of increased variability in rainfall and surface flows will outweigh the expected benefits. The report also noted that: changes in water availability and quality due to climate change will affect food availability; the changes affect functioning and operation of existing water infrastructure; that the current management practices may not be robust enough to withstand the impacts of climate change; that adaptation options designed to guarantee water supply during normal as well as drought conditions should include both demand side as well as supply side strategies. The report also noted that many gaps exist in current knowledge with regard to observations and research needs related to climate change and water. Data from the WHO-UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme indicates that out of 884 million people worldwide without access to improved sources of water, 484 million people live in the Asia-Pacific region. Similarly, 1,903 million people in the Asia-Pacific live without access to improved sanitation is 1,903 million as compared with 2.6 billion people without such access worldwide. The variation in distribution of water resources throughout the region and in the social and ecological pressures in managing the resources suggests that climate change induced variability can have significant impact on water security. This variability can also impact on making entire communities highly vulnerable. 10 6. Water supply, sanitation and health The link between access to water and sanitation and health conditions is well\u2013known. A study of WHO (2008) focused on estimating the burden of disease and mortality directly related to water, sanitation and hygiene. This report notes that water, sanitation and hygiene related factors contribute to 3.4 million deaths (or 5.4 per cent) out of some 59 million deaths from all causes and to a burden of disease of 128 million DALYs (8.4 per cent) out of 1.5 billion DALYs of globally from all causes. Worldwide, the principal contributors to the burden of disease due to water, sanitation and hygiene included: diarrhoeal disease (50 per cent of DALYs), malnutrition (6 per cent), consequences of malnutrition (13 per cent), malaria (11 per cent) and drowning (6 per cent). (See the bottom panel in figure 3.) In Asia region, three main contributors to burden of disease were: diarrhoeal disease (53 per cent), consequences of malnutrition (17 per cent) and lymphatic filariasis (8 per cent).

Based on that report\u2019s findings, the summary of DALYs and mortality for all the risk categories for Asia-Pacific and the world based on data for 2004 are presented in Appendix 1. Worldwide, unsafe water and lack of sanitation contributed to 64 million DALYs being lost and in that regard takes the fourth rank after childhood malnutrition, unsafe sex, and alcohol abuse. Within developing countries, unsafe water and lack of sanitation in fact takes the second rank after childhood malnutrition. Re-produced below are figures pertaining only to the environmental risks identified in the report. Worldwide, unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene account for 64 million DALYs or approximately 4.22 per cent of all DALYs lost due to various risks. Within the Asia-Pacific region, unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene account for nearly 25 million DALYs or 3.5 per cent of all DALYs.

The report noted: \u201c\u2026The largest overall difference between WHO regions was in infectious diseases. The total number of healthy life years lost per capita as a result of environmental burden per capita was 15-times higher in developing countries than in developed countries. The environmental burden per capita of diarrhoeal diseases and lower respiratory infections was 120- to 150- times greater in certain WHO developing country subregions as compared to developed country sub-regions. These differences arise from variations in exposure to environmental risks and in access to health care.\u201d (p. 11). The report noted that diarrhoea accounts of about 4 per cent of global burden of disease but nearly 94 per cent of diarrhoeal disease is attributed to environmental factors, in particular water and sanitation.

Climate change and access to water and sanitation: Economic and institutional factors An important argument linking climate change and health is in terms of potential impact on water resources distribution and how this may impact on access to water and sanitation (route 1 in figure 1). In this section an attempt will be made to examine the extent to which access to water and sanitation is determined by physical factors (freshwater resources) and institutional factors. Since nation states are important actors concerning climate change negotiations, it will be useful for policy to examine the links and relationships using national level aggregate data. Some data is available from UNDP Human Development Report and from Food and Agriculture Organisation\u2019s Aquastat database. The starting point is to consider natural resource constraint or carrying capacity argument. Thus access to water is determined by availability of fresh water resources. 14 Access to water = f (Water resources) (1) In this view, access to water is predominantly determined by natural factors such as precipitation or annual renewable freshwater resources. The same extent of precipitation results in different levels of the amount of annual renewable freshwater resources available in a country. Even when the same extent of freshwater is available, countries differ by how much of that water is used. Figure 5: Lack of relationship between water resources and access to water. Source: Author\u2019s calculations based on data from FAO Aquastat database and UNDP,2010. From the evidence presented in figure 5 above, it appears that access to water (% of population having access to safe water) is unrelated to the extent of (internal renewable) freshwater resources available or the extent of such resources actually withdrawn. Figure 6: Lack of relationship between water resources and access to water: Asia- Pacific region Source: Author\u2019s calculations based on data from FAO (2011) and UNDP,2010. The Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) view-point such as the results presented in Shafik and Bandyopadhyay (1992), Shafik (1994) and Grossman and Krueger (1994) suggested that 15 access to safe water is determined by income (GDP per capita)1. This can be summarised thus: Access to water = f (Income) (2) However, countries at the same level of income differ in the proportion of population having access to safe water. Figure 7: Same income- differences in population with access to safe water. Data for 160 countries worldwide Data for 35 countries in Asia-Pacific Source: Author\u2019s calculations based on data from UNDP,2010. Following the work of various researchers such as Wade (1987), Ostrom (1990 and 2005), Bardhan (1989, 1993, and 2000), Uphoff et al (1998), Chopra and Duraiappah (2002), the role of institutions \u2013formal as well as informal and collective- in determining access to water (though many of them in relation to irrigation) has been recognised. Institutions are humanly devised constraints that shape economic interactions (North,2003). While there is no single measure of institutions that can capture the rich tapestry of diversity of institutions that exists in any society, some indicators of agency and governance quality can be used as proxies or indirect indicators of dysfunctional institutions. 1 Various critics of EKC view (such as Arrow et al,1995; Dasgupta and Maler,1997; Panayotou,1997; Bhattarai and Hammig, 2001,Dasgupta et al,2002; Stern, 2004) question the assumption of lack of feedback effect and the importance of institutional evolution. 16 Figure 8: Fewer people have access to water in poorly governed societies Source: Author\u2019s calculations based on data from UNDP (2010) Simple, imperfect and limited as they are, the two relationships depicted in figure 8 above indicate that access to improved sources of water is associated with less corruption and more freedom of press (i.e., more accountability and voice). Therefore, access to water seems to be determined by income as well as institutional quality: Access to water = f (Freshwater Resources, Income, Institutions) (3) This is tested with data for some 111 countries. Gross national income per capita and corruption are the only significant variables. The extent of renewable freshwater resources per capita or the extent of water withdrawal per capita (in another regression not reported here) were not significant.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2d170560-e561-4359-a685-8dc956a5be61": {"__data__": {"id_": "2d170560-e561-4359-a685-8dc956a5be61", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8c61333cfaf2634fbea13fd08cf14e757e326ef0b8585b2270b94d7883c3d3ed"}, "2": {"node_id": "90e7883f-abbe-4deb-a2c6-3107b05cdb4d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b5be05a4390cb0acb971f622b37c87d37fe4423fb38b257e1fbbe2a10f34d63b"}}, "hash": "0c1b05333af4134fa5a4365bcd0cbd3f909fe4f67179b8a1c30c3c86f22a61bf", "text": "However, in the case of access to improved sanitation, apart from gross national income per capita, the extent of freshwater withdrawal per capita was also significant. 17 Table 3: Descriptive Statistics of variables included in regression analysis N Minimum Maximum Mean Std.

To check for assumption of homoscedasticity, residuals were saved and a regression equation was estimated using the dependent variable and residuals (White test). 19 Impact of climate change on access to water would in turn depend on the impact of climate change on freshwater resources and on economic activity (and hence the national income). Climate change may not have a direct impact on institutions but institutions can have a mediating role on how well a society manages to maintain water security for all households. The concept of resilient institutions can be considered here. While we do not have any variables in this analysis to capture climate change, we can draw some conjectures. The direct effect of climate change is likely to be on freshwater resources (total internal renewable water cubic metres per capita). However, the lack of significance of this variable raises doubts about the potential direct impact of climate change on water availability. The indirect impact of climate change is likely to be far greater in both intensity and magnitude. Several indirect impacts can be foreseen. For example, impact of climate change on water resources can affect not merely the quantity but quality of water. Data from Gallup World polls suggests that even at present, in many countries where a large proportion of people do have access to water, many people are not satisfied with water quality (figure 9). With climate change, this proportion is likely to increase.

Summary: The analysis presented in this section clearly highlights that how climate change translates into impact on access to water is not simple and straight forward. Whilst it is easier to predict how climate change impacts on physical quantities of water resources, what seems to matter more concerns economic conditions (namely, income per capita and income inequality) and quality of institutions (for example, proportion of people experiencing a bribe situation).

Thus, the total amount of freshwater resources available per capita in a country may appear sufficient even while within country distribution of such resources could be very skewed such that much water may be available in one region and little elsewhere. Box 1: Rural urban disparity in access to water in Papua New Guinea Papua New Guinea consists of the eastern half of New Guinea island and several islands including New Britain, New Ireland, North Solomons and Manus islands. Of PNG\u2019s 6.6 million population, nearly 87 per cent is rural. The climate of Papua New Guinea is described as humid with average precipitation of 3,142 mm per year. The overall internal renewable freshwater potential is estimated to be 801 cubic km per year. This makes PNG water-rich with fresh water availability of more than 121,000 cubic metres per capita. However, actual amount of water withdrawn is smaller at about 13 cubic metres per capita. Only 40 per cent of population has access to improved sources of water and 45 per cent has access to improved sanitation. However, the overall average figure does not fully reflect the rural urban disparity in access to water and sanitation. 87 per cent of urban population has access to water as compared with only 33 per cent of rural population. Likewise, 71 per cent of urban population and 41 per cent of rural population are served with improved sanitation facilities. In the capital city Port Moresby and a few other towns, sewerage systems are operational though population in slums do not have access. In a country where a significant majority of the population lives in the rural areas, increasing access to improved water supply is possible but requires concerted efforts (see Bhutan case study). Though PNG is very well-endowed with water, localised access to drinking water and pollution of water resources especially due to natural resource (mineral) activities are becoming matters of concern. Climate change is likely to exacerbate these stresses and exacerbate the vulnerability of rural population especially children. Already, water-borne diseases, especially typhoid and other diarrhoeal diseases account for about a third of all deaths among children (Kingston, 2004). Reducing rural-urban disparity and reducing vulnerability to health impacts appear to be policy priorities. Source: FAO 2010a. 21 Box 2: Variation in water resources and access to water in Timor Leste Of some 1.1 million inhabitants of Timor Leste, overall some 69 per cent of population was estimated to have access to improved water supply in 2008. Among urban residents, nearly 86 per cent have access; among rural residents this proportion is 63 per cent. Though overall precipitation is around 1,500 mm per annum, there is considerable variation from 565 mm along the north coast to over 2,800 mm in the central and western mountainous areas (FAO,2010). Though agriculture contributes to only a quarter of the GDP, nearly 80 per cent of economically active population depend on agriculture sector. Water supply and sanitation infrastructure also suffered damage during the violence after referendum for independence in 1999. According to the WHO (2009c), environmental burden of disease results in some 1,800 deaths per annum and loss of 64 DALYs per 1,000 inhabitants. Malaria and diarrhoea together account for 27 DALYs per 1,000 inhabitants. The main determinants of climate change vulnerability of Timor Leste are the geographic variation in rainfall and dependence on agriculture. An ADB (2004) review suggested that for urban areas the main constraints were inadequate water resources and lack of operation and maintenance expenditures while in rural areas the main constraint was the lack of appropriate institutional capacity. 8. Water security Water security can be applied at national, sub-national as well as personal levels. At national level, water insecurity means the aggregate quantity of water withdrawn is approaching or exceeding the limits imposed by historical, locational and technological factors. Countries in the Asia-Pacific vary in terms of the extent of internal renewable freshwater available from 5 m3 per capita in Bahrain to 121,000 m3 per capita in Papua New Guinea. In general, countries that have limited water resources tend to use a greater share of water that is available. If we look at the distribution of countries in relation to what proportion or internal renewable freshwater is actually withdrawn, we have a vast range whereby 4 countries in the Asia- Pacific and 26 countries in the world use less than 1 per cent of all freshwater available and 1 country in the Asia-Pacific and 18 worldwide using more water than is", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5183dd4d-45e2-430a-aba7-7f5e9e6ccffd": {"__data__": {"id_": "5183dd4d-45e2-430a-aba7-7f5e9e6ccffd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "12ca7c58afa97b2af6735a4c6cba9ba00042ba4737d0fb68f7e2890cb9beb62a"}, "3": {"node_id": "a2972ec3-351b-4332-894e-bfde6f9596ec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "147d02002f87d882c00ef28e4400a439d28751231899dd9dc4c6df22a49495d3"}}, "hash": "545d8b9d7bab18c2d7cb39b4e55ef4f394a5f2263cac8348d22fb884dcc01db6", "text": "internally available.

In the next category are countries where the amount of water withdrawn is between 10 and 20 per cent \u2013 where additional water withdrawal may be possible but is likely to be subject to location and technology. In the next set or category are countries whereby somewhere between 20 and 50 per cent of all internal renewable freshwater is already withdrawn. We can consider this as a situation \u2018approaching water insecurity\u2019. In the next category are countries using more than 50 per cent and in some cases more than 100 per cent of all internally available renewable freshwater resources. We can consider this as a situation of \u2018water insecurity\u2019. 22 Table 5: Conceptualising water security based on the share of available fresh water that is actually withdrawn Water security category Amount of water withdrawn as % of total internal renewable freshwater resources Countries Number of Countries in Asia- Pacific All Countries \u2018Abundance\u2019 in theory Less than 1% New Zealand, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Bhutan 4 26 1% to 2% Brunei Darussalam, Mongolia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Cambodia 4 20 Relative abundance \u2013 spatial constraints 2% to 3% Malaysia 1 9 3% to 5% Myanmar 1 5 5% to 10% Australia, Nepal, Indonesia 3 21 Spatial and technological constraints 10% to 15% DPR Korea, Timor-Leste 2 12 15% to 20% Philippines, Maldives, China 3 12 Approaching water insecurity 20% to 30% Japan, Viet Nam, Sri Lanka, Thailand 4 13 30% to 50% Bangladesh.

This approach has two shortcomings (i) that the lines or boundaries between categories are arbitrary and choice of technology of withdrawing water is considered to be a purely economic decision and (ii) that the focus here is on water availability rather than water access. An alternative approach is to define water insecurity in relation to the context of a given country. To do this, we can construct a statistical relationship between total internal renewable freshwater and amount of water withdrawn. Then for each country we can compare its existing position with the predicted position. It appears from figure 10 that there is a strong (negative) association between amount of internal renewable freshwater resources available and the proportion actually withdrawn. Given that the regression estimate is very high (R square 0.719), we can propose an alternative way to define water insecurity in relation to deviation above the line. 23 Figure 10: Water withdrawn depends on how much internal renewable freshwater is there. Source: Author\u2019s calculation based on Aquastat 2011 data from FAO. Thus, for example, Cambodia, Timor-Leste and Indonesia have approximately 8,000 to 9,000 cubic metres of internal renewable freshwater per capita. However, Cambodia and Indonesia use less than 10 per cent of available freshwater (and remain below the line). Water insecurity may also depend on economic conditions. It is clear from table 6 below that the share of water withdrawn decreases with freshwater available and increases with income per capita.

WS1 is directly relevant to target 10 of Millennium Development Goal 7. However, grouping countries into categories allows analysts to distinguish between different sets of policy priorities. Policy emphasis in high insecurity countries would be to increase access to water speedily and for those in low insecurity countries would be to maintain progress and improve on quality. Dimension 1 alone is adequate for emphasising the urgency for action in the case of \u2018high insecurity\u2019 countries. However, for all other countries (especially those in medium and low risk categories in the table above), this approach alone is not adequate in diagnosing policy challenges. The following discussion focuses on developing clarity on further dimensions of inequality which can be combined with WS1 indicator above to shine further light on specific aspects of insecurity. Dimension 2: Entitlement insecurity caused by some people having piped water and not others. This can be captured by: WS2 = f (Proportion with \u2018other improved\u2019 water/total population with improved water) This ratio is useful when read along with WS1 indicator. When this ratio is closer to zero, a majority of those having access to improved sources will have access to a tap. As this ratio gets closer to 1, almost everyone in the population is having access to \u2018other improved\u2019 sources. In the middle there is a range whereby a proportion of all those who have access to improved sources but not access to tap. In that sense, the ratio can be an indicator of systemic inequality and the lack of entitlements (if a significant proportion of people need to depend on \u2018other improved sources\u2019 while some people have access to a tap). Any lines or boundaries are arbitrary but we can illustrate a few examples (see figure 11). 26 Figure 11: Entitlement insecurity caused by lack of entitlements Source: Author\u2019s calculation based on JMP (WHO-UNICEF) 2011. In China and India, less than 15 per cent of population does not have access to water. However, of those who do have access to water, almost all households in China have access to tap whereas in India, nearly 75 per cent of them have access to \u2018other improved sources\u2019. In the event that climate change triggers changes in water availability, then this divergence is likely to create a \u2018water divide\u2019 in India between those who have secure access in the form of a yard tap and those with insecure access in terms of \u2018other improved sources\u2019. In Bangladesh and Nepal, more than 80 per cent of people have access to water (or 20 of households do not have access) but of those having access, most of them have \u2018other improved sources\u2019(hence WS2 indicator above 0.8). Dimension 3: Insecurity caused by urban bias: Those in the urban areas who have access v those in the rural areas who do not have access: WS3 = f (Proportion of rural population with improved water/ Proportion of urban population with improved water) In the absence of urban bias, this ratio will be close to 1. Where there is significant urban bias in the provision of water, this ratio will approach zero. 27 Figure 12: Insecurity caused by urban bias Source: Author\u2019s calculation based on JMP (WHO-UNICEF) 2011.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "85d11d76-acd5-446e-9a41-a3b44412f9d7": {"__data__": {"id_": "85d11d76-acd5-446e-9a41-a3b44412f9d7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4d41acc1433a0902647a101abdaf25584f7b67de00f1f69a540b1b9987c149ca"}, "2": {"node_id": "d8551646-4c49-4e07-870a-09564232344e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "910da6e00f1a95a47037a50d087fbde1eac4d4d985c9b91bad5bd38fbc9fd193"}}, "hash": "f57534f5f38f49c25999e840c4dd86357f63c65ec87a18a85f254304f06cbe9b", "text": "In figure 12, we can see that amongst countries which were earlier considered as \u2018low insecurity\u2019 countries based on WS1 alone (in table 7), in China and India, there is some evidence of urban bias.

Thus there is likely to be some degree of water insecurity due to rural-urban difference in those who have access to improved sources of water. Dimension 4: Intra-urban inequality: This is constructed as an indicator of those with piped water v those with improved but not piped water. This is captured by the ratio: WS4=f (Proportion of urban with improved water/ urban population with improved water). 28 Figure 13: Lack of entitlements within urban population with access to water Source: Author\u2019s calculation based on JMP (WHO-UNICEF) 2011. In appears from figure 13 that in Myanmar, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Mongolia [group 1 countries], most of the urban households have access to \u2018other improved sources\u2019. In Thailand, Bhutan, Vanautu, Maldives and China [i.e., group 2 countries], less than 20 per cent of urban households with access to water depend on \u2018other improved sources\u2019. However, in India, Viet Nam, Pakistan, Nepal, Philippines, Cambodia and Papua New Guinea [or group 3 countries], between 30 and 55 per cent of all urban households depend on \u2018other improved sources\u2019. In the event of climate induced water shortages, intra-urban conflicts are more likely in the third group of countries. Dimension 5: Health vulnerability: Those with improved water but without improved sanitation. WS5 = f (Proportion with improved sanitation /Proportion with improved water) This insecurity is broadly an indicator of health risks. Where this indicator approaches 1, it is likely that water and sanitation investments are based on an understanding of health risks (especially diarrhoeal disease risk). Where (after controlling for access to water) this indicator approaches zero, that means even though access to water may have been improved, diarrhoeal disease risk would remain significantly high. 29 Figure 14: Health vulnerability related water insecurity Source: Author\u2019s calculation based on JMP (WHO-UNICEF) 2011. From figure 14, it can be seen that though earlier, based on WS-1 (i.e., proportion of population not having access to improved sources of water), China, Sri Lanka, India and Nepal were all placed in the same category as \u2018low insecurity\u2019 countries, here we can see that only Sri Lanka appears to have made progress in both water and sanitation access whereas in India and Nepal this ratio is 0.3 (i.e., for every 100 people having access to improved sources of water, only 30 people have access to improved sanitation). Similarly, among the countries previously placed in the category of \u2018medium insecurity\u2019, in Bangladesh, Mongolia, and Indonesia, there is a need to improve both access to water and sanitation. Water security of vulnerable populations A further approach to examining water insecurity is to analyse the vulnerability of specific groups or populations. Some examples are discussed here. a. Megacities: Out of 21 megacities (population in excess of 10 million), 10 are in Asia- Pacific region. A few other cities in the region already have populations very close to this threshold and will join this group in the next few years. A number of these are also \u2018coastal\u2019 cities and population in these cities is already vulnerable to flooding due to variability in precipitation. Future climate change is likely to increase the risks of coastal flooding. Such flooding puts at risk water and sanitation infrastructure. Population density 30 of such cities makes them highly vulnerable to infectious disease outbreaks, especially, cholera, typhoid, and other diarrhoeal diseases. b. Slum population: Another indicator of water insecurity is the extent of population living in slums in urban areas. From table 8 below, it is apparent that as of 2005 when data was available for a number of countries, some 430 million people were living in slums. The definition of a slum household is a household living in a shelter lacking in any one of the following: improved water, improved sanitation, durable shelter, sufficient living area, and security of tenure. Inevitably, a significant proportion of such population remain without improved access to water and sanitation. Though there have been concerted efforts to improve access, constraints that block progress include poor choice of technology by utility providers, gaps in meeting initial capital costs, lack of legal titles to land and institutional problems (i.e., while negotiating participation of all stakeholders requires appropriate political institutions, water infrastructure is often the responsibility of predominantly technocratic institutions).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8ee3635a-3edd-4ba0-9a35-6d4b2547f071": {"__data__": {"id_": "8ee3635a-3edd-4ba0-9a35-6d4b2547f071", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "31b88eb1efbf984e3dc9c255061b0d6527ae540a104c1b748437087c28ec882c"}, "2": {"node_id": "bda2483c-e172-426e-a9c6-0aafa6c2ce0e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c5e902d7a1239395e6ecbadc505ff37836e742c512a90014d1fe14e5a8f26529"}}, "hash": "0fbd284e76621ee717bae4cb7c97caa2622630fc8f7fea2474700249cea72433", "text": "There is also a debate whether privatisation or private sector participation in urban water services results in disempowerment of slum population.

Mountain societies Though in principle many mountain regions have higher level of water resources per capita, such resources are not easy to access. As a result, population in mountainous areas often faces a \u2018double jeopardy\u2019 both from heavy rainfall and associated health burden during rainy season and lack of access to improved water within reasonable distance during the rest of the year. As seen from the case study of Papua New Guinea, a significant proportion of population in such societies face water insecurity throughout the year. Climate change is likely to increase such risks. However, as the case study of Bhutan indicates, with concerted and long term action, it is possible to significantly increase access to safe water and sanitation. Box 3: Bhutan\u2019s success in improving access to water and sanitation The Kingdom of Bhutan is a land-locked nation in the Eastern Himalayas. It has a population of approximately 690,000 persons. It has very diverse climates with sub-tropical systems in the plains and lower foothills to cold-temperate climate in the mountain areas. Annual average precipitation is 2,200 mm but there is significant variation from around 500 mm is Gidakhom near Thimpu to around 21,000 mm in Samdrup Jhongkar district. At the First Asia Pacific Water Forum in Japan in 2007, the Prime Minister of Bhutan highlighted the retreat of glaciers and the threat of floods caused by glacial lake bursts. With climate change, such events are likely to become more frequent and devastating. Since 1974, UNICEF has been involved in the development of rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) programme by way of developing small scale and appropriate technological models. By 1982 it was estimated that 10 per cent of Bhutan\u2019s population benefited. Steadily, rural population\u2019s access to water and sanitation has been gradually increased. As the WHO assessment noted, by 1990, 30 per cent of rural population and 60 per cent of urban population had access to water. According to the 2007 Bhutan Living Standards survey some 90.9 per cent of all households had access to improved sources of water. It is particularly noteworthy that over 88 per cent of rural households had access to improved sources of water. The 2008 MDG Report of Bhutan noted that with the exception of one district, namely, Gasa where 57 per cent of households had access to water, in all other districts, over 80 per cent of population had access to improved sources of water.

Source: Government of Bhutan and UNDP (2008). This case study suggests that developing appropriate technological solutions, piloting new approaches, training local people, up-scaling and maintaining steady progress, using incentives where necessary, combining legislation and moral persuasion are all important in improving access to improved sources of water and sanitation in all countries, but more so in mountainous regions. Box 4: Case study- Water supply and sanitation in Maldives The Republic of Maldives has a population of nearly 300,000 persons. 60 per cent of population lives in rural areas (Governmet of Maldives,2009a). Though the country consists of some 1,192 islands, fewer than 200 are inhabited. A third of the nation\u2019s population lives in Male the capital. Annual rainfall is approximately 2,000 mm. Much of the rainwater is harvested or collected from roof tops and stored in tanks for use. Maldives does not have any permanent rivers or streams; only freshwater is found in groundwater \u2018lenses\u2019 or small pockets. These are highly susceptible to saline water intrusion. All the groundwater sources near the capital have become brackish or saline. According to WHO-UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme, nearly 86 per cent of urban population and 2 per cent of rural population has access to improved sources of water. However, 86 per cent of all households depend on desalinated water supplied by pipe. The Male Water and Sewerage Company Private Limited (MWSC) supplies water and sanitation services in the capital and four other atolls. In January 2010, Hitachi Plant Technologies Limited took a 20 per cent stake in the MWSC. Hitachi\u2019s Singapore based subsidiary Aquatech is a major producer of reverse-osmosis technology. On average, households spend about 6 to 9 per cent of household income on water. This is significantly higher than the 5 per cent figure which is normally considered as the basis for defining water-poverty.As per the Census of 2006, out of 46,000 households, only about 5 per cent did not have access to toilet. However, of those who did have access, nearly 23,250 households connected to septic tank while some 17,000 households had toilet connected to sea (Government of Maldives, 2009b) Continues\u2026 33 a. Disability and access to water Though disability is not included discussion of vulnerable people in WG2 report of AR4 of the IPCC (2007a), there are two dimensions to consider disability with regard to access to water and one dimension with regard to climate change. With regard to access to water, the first dimension concerns a disabled person\u2019s access to safe water and the issue of fairness. As discussed in section 3 above, Amartya Sen\u2019s capability approach clearly highlights how the same quantity of resources may not translate to same well-being freedoms due to individual circumstances. The so called \u2018conversion factor\u2019 i.e., the mechanism that allows an individual to convert resources into outcomes can vary significantly from person to person. The amount of water required per day varies due to cultural values, temperature and other factors. However, since the definition of improved access to water includes in it a subjective judgement about such water being available within a \u2018reasonable\u2019 distance, there is a danger that such judgements completely ignore the issue of access to water by disabled persons (whose definition of reasonable distance may well depend on mobility, availability of a carer and so on). This does not mean that disabled persons do not have access to water. Though we took the example of a physically disabled person here, it needs to be noted that the fundamental issue is about the freedoms of persons with any form of disability including mental or psychological disability. However, definitions addressed to an average citizen may not reflect the fact that most citizens do not fit the profile of average citizen. In almost all Asia-Pacific countries, existing social norms encourage compassion and require able-bodied persons to assist disabled persons. However, such social norms are not adequate to guarantee access to water as a matter of right. \u2026.Continued In 2008, some 6,000 cases of diarrhoea were reported for children under the age of 5 years and another 12,000 cases were reported for those above 5 years of age (Government of Maldives, 2009c) .

Tourism is the mainstay of the economy; however, freshwater availability is crucial to tourism as well. Annually, some 500,000 tourists are estimated to visit Maldives. If we assume that average duration of stay is one week, this is equivalent to increasing the population of the islands by 10,000 persons. This case suggests that for small islands, access to freshwater can be an important dimension of vulnerability to climate change in addition to sea level rise. Source: Author\u2019s compilation 34 The second dimension concerns causality in that lack of access to improved water and sanitation may have been a primary or secondary cause of disability. Thus, the question is not about access to water by a disabled person but whether lack of access was responsible for causing disability in the first place. For example, contaminated water may result in diarrhoea or intestinal nematode infections which in turn cause malnutrition which may have caused contributed to disability. For example, poliomyelitis is caused by a virus that is transmitted by faecal-oral contamination. In the Asia-Pacific, polio is endemic in Afghanistan, India and Pakistan and it appears to have been reimported in China and Nepal. Globally, 642 cases of wild poliovirus (WPV) cases were reported in 2011 \u2013 of these nearly 300 were in Asia and the Pacific. Other water borne infectious diseases that can result in disability include onchocerciasis or fialriasis (globally 66% attributed to water and sanitation \u2013 WHO,2008). Data on disability is fairly limited. In high income countries such as Australia and New Zealand, close to 20 per cent of population is considered to have disabilities. However, in developing countries, there is considerable under-estimation and under-reporting of disability. Data from India and Indonesia for example put disabled persons to be about 1 to 3 per cent of population. Notwithstanding these data limitations, it can be hypothesised that (a) disabled persons already face difficulties with regard to access to water and sanitation in many of the developing countries in Asia and the Pacific (b) such individuals are likely to be more vulnerable in the case of disasters; (c) with climate change as the likelihood of disasters increases, vulnerability of the disabled people will also increase; (d) as climate change accentuates spatial and temporal distribution patterns, it is likely to exacerbate competition to control water resources which may worsen the outcomes for all vulnerable people including the disabled persons. Climate change and water insecurity Climate change in Asia-Pacific will have two kinds of impacts on water resources \u2013 in some regions such as Central Asia, the summer precipitation is likely to decrease while in many other parts including in Northern Asia, East and South Asia and most parts of South East Asia, summer precipitation is likely to increase. As such, increased flow in rivers poses greater flood risk and associated hazards. Though the foregoing analysis of water insecurity is a static analysis focusing on data from year 2008, it highlights vulnerabilities that already exist even in countries that have made significant progress in increasing the proportion of population with access to improved sources of water. Climate change is highly likely to accentuate and worsen some of these insecurities and diminish the impact of significant progress. The methodology suggested here needs to be replicated with details of sub-national level data to \u2018climate proof\u2019 water security. A human right to water as recommended at the UN General Assembly in July 2010 and supported by several nations including those in the Asia-Pacific can be useful in securing the rights of the vulnerable. It is particularly helpful in countries within the \u2018low insecurity\u2019 and \u2018medium insecurity\u2019 categories where even while one form of insecurity (namely, proportion 35 of population without access to \u2018improved sources\u2019) has been decreased, there remain significant challenges for progress due to continued and institutionalised forms of inequality in access to water. However, in my earlier analysis (Anand,2007b) I have argued that formalising a human right to water through legislation is perhaps merely a first step. Unless the full extent of institutions are developed to clearly assign the roles and responsibilities of duty-bearers and how they will be held to account, it appears that a formal human right to water may remain ineffective and limited in scope. 9.

This is likely to increase the frequency of events such as cyclones (especially in coastal regions in South East and South Asia), floods (in South Asia and parts of East Asia). The United Nations (2011) Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction notes that between 1970 and 2010, the total number of tropical cyclones has remained more or less the same at around 86 cyclones per decade; the total number of countries hit by tropical cyclones has also more or less remained at around 145. However, the number of disasters reported (and thus included in EM DAT) has increased from 21 in 1970s to 63 in 2000s. An evaluation of World Bank\u2019s portfolio of disaster projects by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG,2006:3) noted that the reported number of disasters had increased from less than 100 in 1975 to over 400 in 2005. The report also noted that the economic cost of disasters also increased by over 15 times during the same period. The report noted that disasters appear to strike with regular periodicity and a small number of countries appear to be far more vulnerable- for example just 10 countries accounted for 208 of 528 disaster projects of World Bank between 1984 and 2005. Four of these top ten countries are in the Asia-Pacific region \u2013 China, India, Bangladesh and Vietnam. Climate and weather patterns are involved in both rapid onset disasters such as floods and hurricanes and also in slow onset disasters such as drought. 36 Climate change Impact on disasters (2) Rapid onset disasters - damage to infrastructure Health impacts Slow onset disasters- drought Malnutrition and health impacts Preparedness, Risk management Institutions Extreme events Figure 15: Disaster occurrence in Asia-Pacific Source and copyright: EM-DAT (available from http://www.emdat.be/asia-geo-referrenced accessed on 29 April 2013). In this section, we focus on route 2 of figure 1 presented in the introduction to this paper to which we can add institutional dimensions. Figure 16: Climate change, disasters and health (route 2 of figure 1 elaborated) A natural hazard is a significant adverse event caused by natural factors such as volcanic activity, weather patterns, coastal or river based flooding, significant period of precipitation anomaly or aridness. Not all natural hazards turn into disasters. When a natural hazard affects 37 social and economic well-being of a community significantly, a disaster occurs. The same magnitude extreme event may produce different magnitudes of impact. For example, even though the earthquakes in Haiti in January 2010 and Tohoku in Japan in March 2011 were both of similar magnitudes, casualties in Haiti were over 200,000 as compared with 28,000 lives lost in Japan. This highlights the importance of vulnerability and also the role of institutions. In Japan, advance warning systems, awareness of citizens as to what to do in the event of a disaster, internalising disaster risk awareness in the design and construction of buildings may have contributed to reducing mortality from disasters considerably. As Scott (2009) notes: Disaster risk = Hazard X Exposure X Vulnerability Toya and Skidmore (2007) and Padli et al (2010) also reach a similar conclusion with regard to association between economic conditions (per capita GDP) and disaster related fatality and economic impacts. Recently, Ambraseys and Bilham (2011) argued that mortality due to earthquakes appears to be correlated with level of corruption. Disasters themselves need not result in health impacts and mortality. A WHO (2012) paper notes that out of 14 major floods that occurred between 1970 and 1994, only one led to a major diarrhoeal disease outbreak. The report notes that the major perceived risk of floods is contamination of water sources but notes that even when this happens as in the case of floods in Iowa in 1993 and Tajikistan in 1992, \u201c\u2026the risk of outbreaks can be minimised if the risk is well recognised and disaster-response addresses the provision of clean water as a priority\u201d. Our analysis of cross-country data (see figure 17) also suggests a weak association between population affected by natural disasters and both per capita income and freedom of choice (an indicator of freedoms and quality of institutions). Figure 17: Vulnerability to natural disasters \u2013 do income and institutions have a role? Source: Author\u2019s estimations based on data from UNDP (2010) This highlights the importance of disaster preparedness, planning and risk management strategies.

Climate change and vector borne diseases A brief mention has already been made in the introduction of this paper about the evidence that has been presented by Colwell and various authors on the connection between sea surface temperatures and cholera outbreak in the coastal regions of Bay of Bengal. Figure 18: Climate change-disease vectors and health (route 3 in figure 1 elaborated) An earlier analysis of climate change and vector borne diseases suggested that malaria and dengue fever were likely to be the most important vector borne diseases in the topics and sub- tropics while encephalitis was emerging to be a public health concern (Githeko et al, 2000). WG2 of AR4 of IPCC (2007a) stated that dengue is \u201c\u2026the world\u2019s most important vector- borne vial disease\u201d. The report noted that while several previous studies reported associations between spatial, temporal or spatio-temporal patterns of dengue outbreak and climate change, these results may not be entirely consistent. The report noted that \u201c\u2026approximately one-third of the world\u2019s population lives in regions where the climate is suitable for transmission\u201d. A more recent WHO (2009b) factsheet suggests that approximately two fifths of global population is at risk. Worldwide some 1.3 billion people are at risk of lymphatic filariasis and over 120 million people infected of which 40 million people have been incapacitated (WHO,2011). Mosquitoes act as the vector transmitting the disease \u2013 anopheles mosquitoes in rural areas 39 and culex in urban areas. Culex mosquitoes can breed in both freshwater and also in polluted waters in urban and semi-urban environments. WG2 report of AR4 of IPCC (2007a) notes that the \u201c\u2026spatial distribution, intensity of transmission and seasonality of malaria is influenced by climate in sub-Saharan Africa\u201d. Malaria accounts for 14 million DALYs (approximately 11 per cent) of global burden of disease. Approximately, 0.5 million DALYs are lost in the Asia region due to Malaria (WHO,2008). Though overall malaria risk may be lower in the Asia-Pacific region, certain groups including children may be more vulnerable. A recent study raises a concern that most of the pregnant women worldwide at risk of malaria infection live in the Asia-Pacific region (McGready et al, 2012).The IPPC (2007a) report notes that \u201c\u2026Despite the known causal links between climate and malaria transmission dynamics, there is still much uncertainty about the potential impact of climate change on malaria at local and global scales\u201d. A cause for concern with regard to malaria is that the parasite is becoming drug resistant. These brief discussions suggest that there is need for further examination of risk of spread of vector borne diseases due to climate change. 11. Conclusions Asia and the Pacific is very diverse in terms of the extent of population with access to improved sources of water and improved sanitation. These variations are reflected in the variations in environmental burden of disease and in indicators such as infant and child mortality rates. Even in countries where a significant proportion of population is considered to have access to improved sources it is possible that a considerable section of population remain water insecure due to the definition and subjectivity of what constitutes improved access. Water, sanitation and hygiene related factors contribute to 994 thousand deaths and a disease burden of 38 million DALYs in Asia region (WHO,2008). Main contributors to the disease burden include diarrhoeal disease (53 per cent of DALYs), consequences of malnutrition (17 per cent), lymphatic filariasis (8 per cent) and drownings (5 per cent). Both malaria and dengue contribute about 1 per cent each. We have seen in this paper that countries differ in the proportion of internal freshwater that is withdrawn. Availability of water is only one aspect. It is not easy nor straight forward to anticipate the links between climate change, availability of renewable fresh water, technology of withdrawal and translating all this into \u2018access to improved water\u2019 for the population.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5cf0cc10-a983-4fc5-9c77-64c1c6c75f0f": {"__data__": {"id_": "5cf0cc10-a983-4fc5-9c77-64c1c6c75f0f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "83672a23993e601cff8ffa5cd875d6916a9ea427e2ad33f4dfc37cc924cbfdb1"}, "2": {"node_id": "e2d929d4-472b-416f-9f37-cbb273815a3f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0c5684c3410bd8bf175b8d15909e3812243ddda652d95bdeb0b7bd97ee8881f0"}}, "hash": "1e656238a977a376ff9378689985b224aefa55fcdcbcd90b949f45bb4d95fab4", "text": "Analysis based on data for 162 countries including 49 countries in the Asia-Pacific region indicated that income per capita remains a significant variable in explaining variation in proportion of households with access to improved sources of water.

While the possible links between climate change and hydrological resources are discussed previously (in Bates,2008), the models discussed in the present paper indicate the 40 scope for further analysis of climate-economy interaction models and climate-institutions interactions. The Bhutan case study indicated that through sustained programme of intervention and a combination of various policies and technologies, it is possible to make substantial increase the proportion of population with access to water and sanitation. Such institutions are also needed to increase the resilience of existing water institutions in the face of climate change and to increase the adaptation capacity of societies. While in Bhutan, UNICEF and the Government of Bhutan played a central role, the case study of Maldives suggests that there is some scope to involve private sector and promote partnerships. However, in the case of Male, it appears that residents pay a significant share of monthly income for water. An attempt has been made here to develop a set of new indicators of water insecurity using country-level data on different aspects of access to improved sources of water and sanitation from WHO-UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP). These indicators suggest that even in countries that have made significant progress in providing access to \u2018improved sources of water\u2019, there remain crucial aspects of insecurity due to the nature of entitlements to water given to some sections of the society and not others or not making adequate progress in one dimension of access to water and not others. This analysis also indicates that while national level aggregate indicator of access to water is useful, it may not reveal institutionalised insecurity due to urban bias. Though this was a static analysis, this approach to water insecurity clearly highlights the potential vulnerabilities that exist even in countries that have made significant progress. From this analysis, it is clear that we need to continue to make progress in access to improved sources of water and sanitation in countries such as Papua New Guinea, Afghanistan, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, and Cambodia. It is also clear that even in other \u2018medium insecurity\u2019 or \u2018low insecurity\u2019 countries, there remain important dimensions of insecurity. Climate change is likely to make it harder to make significant changes in the extent of water that can be withdrawn. We can anticipate that even as more people gain access to improved sources of water, the proportion who report satisfaction with water quality could gradually decline if climate change induced pressures result in further exacerbating the existing patterns of water insecurity. 41 References Ambraseys and Bilham (2011) Corruption kills, Nature, 469,153-5.

Email: Kazuyuki.Uji@undp.org i Abstract Climate change threatens human health. A report from The Lancet, the world\u2019s leading general medical journal, declared climate change as \u201cthe biggest global health threat of the 21st century\u201d. While climate change affects the world over, the Asia-Pacific region stands particularly vulnerable to its adverse consequences where more than half (or 56%) of the world\u2019s estimated 7 billion population and nearly two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor live. In the 1990s, Asia-Pacific accounted for 32% of global extreme climatic events, 84% of deaths caused by such events and 88% of people affected worldwide. Women are \u201cthe most vulnerable to climate change\u201d and its negative health consequences in developing countries. It is estimated that the mortality risk of women during disasters is 14 times higher than that of men. Poor women, who constitute the majority of the poor in the Asia-Pacific region, are particularly vulnerable to climate- sensitive health risks. This paper explores available data on the observed and projected linkages between climate change and health in the Asia-Pacific region. It highlights key health risks and vulnerabilities due to climate change and extreme climatic events, including infectious diseases, injuries, and other morbidities. Particular health vulnerabilities of women and girls to climate change impacts, along with other vulnerable populations, are also examined.

Vulnerability of the Asia-Pacific region While climate change affects the world over, the Asia-Pacific region stands particularly vulnerable to its adverse consequences where more than half or 56% of the world\u2019s estimated 7 billion population 7 and nearly two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor live. 8 Empirical data demonstrate the scale and magnitude of such vulnerability.

During the same period, however, the number of deaths attributable to such events increased over 5-fold, from 90,000 to 500,000. The record implicates a growing intensity and expanding geographical coverage of extreme climatic events in the region. In the 1990s, the Asia-Pacific region accounted for 32% of global extreme climatic events, 84% of deaths caused by such events and 88% of people affected worldwide.13 Bangladesh experiences only 1% of all cyclones in the world. However, approximately 50% of global deaths due to cyclones are registered in Bangladesh,14 where over 70% of the country15 and 80 million people16 are flood-vulnerable. Given a large number of people living in areas prone to flooding and other extreme climatic events in many parts of Asia, it is estimated that a 40cm rise in sea level by 2080 would cause the displacement of about 76 million people in South and Southeast Asia,17 with significant adverse health implications. The low-lying nature of Pacific Island countries and territories are also highly vulnerable to climate change, particularly along coastal areas, due to rising sea levels, cyclones, and tidal surges. The highest points in Kiribati, Republic of the Marshall Islands, Tokelau and Tuvalu are just about 4 meters above sea level.18 Except for Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Fiji, coastal areas are where the majority of the Pacific\u2019s 9.5 million people live. The Secretariat of the Pacific Community declares that \u201c[C]limate change is among the most serious challenges facing Pacific Island countries and territories.\u201d19 In 2000, many LDCs and developing countries in Asia such as Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Myanmar and Nepal were already carrying the world\u2019s highest disease burden from diarrhoea and malnutrition, which are sensitive to climate change.20 It is estimated that mortality risk from vector-borne diseases is almost 300 times greater in developing countries as compared with developed countries.21 Increasing frequency, intensity, and geographical range of extreme climatic events could reinforce, perpetuate and exacerbate enormous pre-existing public health challenges and further strain already fragile and overstretched health systems22 in Asia and the Pacific. 12 WHO 2003. 13 Based on WHO 2003. 14 Amadore et al. 1996, as cited in Woodward et al. 1998. 15 Mizra 2003. 16 UNESCAP 1995. 17 IPCC 2001a. 18 Rodgers 2009. 19 Ibid. 20 UNFCCC 2007. 21 WHO 2009b. 22 WHO 2006a. 3 2.

Infectious diseases Climate change affects mortality and morbidity by creating favourable environments for, and altering the distribution of, climate-sensitive infectious diseases, particularly water-, food- and vector-borne diseases.34 For example, warmer climate often increases the risk of mosquito-transmitted diseases such as dengue fever and malaria.35 It does so by shortening disease incubation time and breeding cycle, and by increasing feeding frequency. In the case of dengue fever, disease transmission from mosquitoes to humans becomes more efficient in high temperature.36 23 IPCC 2001. 24 WHO 2008d. 25 Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters 2009. 26 Confalonieri et al. 2007. 27 Costello et al. 2009. 28 WHO 2008f. 29 UNFCCC 2007. 30 Ibid. 31 Staringa 2008 32 Ahern et al. 2005; WHO 2008e, cited in Chand and Murthy 2008. 33 Behere and Behere 2008, cited in WHO 2011a; Nagaraj 2008, cited in WHO 2011a. 34 WHO 2008a. 35 Ibid. 36 Ibid. 4 Reduced availability of safe drinking water caused by droughts, floods, or intrusion of warmed salt water into fresh water due to sea level rise increases the risk of diarrhoeal diseases.37 Lack of proper sanitation and hygiene systems and close gathering of people displaced by flooding38 or storms further elevate the risk. 2-1-1. Dengue fever An article from the journal of Lancet Infectious Diseases affirms that \u201c[d]engue is perhaps the most important of the emerging infections that are likely to be affected by climate change.\u201d39 According to WHO, 40 dengue threatens health of 2.5 billion people with a global estimate of 50-100 million infections every year. Epidemics of dengue haemorrhagic fever, which is a severe manifestation of dengue fever, were registered only in 9 countries prior to 1970, but then spread to more than 100 countries by 1995. The most affected regions in the world are Asia and the Pacific, where more than 1.8 billion people or over 70% of the global population at risk of dengue live.41 Dengue haemorrhagic fever accounts for the highest childhood mortality in some Asian countries.42 While no concrete evidence seems to exist yet on the association between climate change and dengue outbreaks in the region,43 existing data may indicate such possible connection. For example, Singapore observed an increase of 1.5 degree Celsius in the annual temperature between 1978 and 1999.

However, the number of dengue cases between 1999 and 2005 reached nearly 20,000, with an annual average of 3,305 cases.46 Bhutan, Timor-Leste, and Nepal reported dengue epidemics for the first time in 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively. 47 In South Pacific, dengue epidemics between 1970 and 1995 were found to be associated with La Ni\u00f1a conditions, which brought warmer and wetter weather patterns.48 Dengue outbreaks were observed in 14 Pacific Island Countries and territories in 2009.49 37 Ibid. 38 Haines et al. 2006. 39 Senior 2008. 40 WHO 2012. 41 WHO 2010b. 42 WHO 2006b. 43 WHO 2008b. 44 Ibid. 45 Benitez 2009. 46 Rahman 2008. 47 WHO 2006b. 48 Hales et al. 1996, cited in WHO 2003. 49 WHO n.d.-a. 5 2-1-2.

By 2030, climate change is projected to account for about 4.7 million cases of malnutrition, or about 10% of the global total.72 The IPCC-4 report73 predicts that climate change could reduce agricultural yields by up to 30% in Central and South Asia74, leading to \u201ca very high risk of hunger\u201d in some 62 WHO 2008c. 63 Cruz et al. 2007. 64 Rahman 2008. 65 Ahern et al. 2005; Haines et al. 2006. 66 UNICEF and WHO 2009. 67 WHO 2005. 68 UNICEF and WHO 2009. 69 Ibid. 70 In this report, the term \u2018malnutrition\u2019 denotes \u2018undernutrition\u2019 or poor nutritional status and not \u2018over-nutrition\u2019 such as obesity, which is also part of malnutrition. 71 WHO 2008a. 72 Ibid.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ab19582d-0d1e-4ec9-b9b9-d30eb8ca8921": {"__data__": {"id_": "ab19582d-0d1e-4ec9-b9b9-d30eb8ca8921", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/16", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/16", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/16", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "73e233a58f21ceaee62c40465ceae884b5e890636faa6080dc32528e90703184"}, "2": {"node_id": "6927a73c-2000-489e-9f1e-1d2ed15ed0f1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/16", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "33025381348e459a0f6de1404b88b88a80ac50e75c7979c9b79c52d438c2016e"}}, "hash": "82e0a0892b3784d9251d39dbc5a18185af3e1ae7db4dce561c6abbbb963844dd", "text": "71 WHO 2008a. 72 Ibid. 73 UNFCCC 2007. 74 Cruz et al. 2007. 7 countries of the regions.

Climate change is also likely to affect the amount of marine fishery catch, up to a 40% decrease in tropical countries. 77 This could threaten food security and livelihoods, thereby potentially causing health deterioration. UNEP estimates that climate change will affect 2.6 billion people worldwide who source their protein from seafood. 78 According to FAO,79 400 million people in the poorest countries derive at least 50% of animal protein and minerals from fish and fish products. Its health implications are profound for the Asia Pacific region with a very large number of people living in coastal areas who are likely to depend heavily on seafood. Fisheries and aquaculture also provide livelihood opportunities for more than 500 million people in developing countries. 80 In the Mekong delta region, more than 500,000 people, mostly women, depend on catfish aquaculture for their livelihoods.81 However, increasing salt water intrusion due to sea level rise and reduced river flow associated with climate change is threatening the future of the industry, livelihoods and human health. Regardless of the future impact of climate change on food availability, millions of children are already suffering from various forms of malnutrition in the world today: 171 million under-five children from stunting, 115 million children from wasting and 20 million children from life-threatening severe acute malnutrition. It costs 3.9 million children\u2019s lives every year.82 Malnutrition is believed to be responsible for about half of child mortality worldwide, and for 57%, 64% and 52% of child deaths from malaria, diarrhoea and pneumonia, respectively.83 Malnutrition is highly prevalent across Asia. Of the global malnourished children of 150 million, about 67% or 100 million are estimated to live in Asia and the Pacific, particularly South Asia.84 The World Bank reports that India accounts for one-third of 75 The Hindu 2008. 76 Science 2007. 77 Cheung et al. 2009, cited in FAO 2011. 78 UNEP 2008. 79 FAO 2009. 80 Ibid. 81 Ibid. 82 WHO 2011c. 83 Gragnolati et al. 2005. 84 UNICEF 2002. 8 malnourished children in the world and its prevalence is among the highest, which is twice as high for the corresponding figure from Sub-Saharan Africa.85 Furthermore, in South Asia and South-East Asia, the prevalence of underweight among women of reproductive age is 45-60%, while 80% of pregnant women are iron- deficient.86 Over 20% of maternal mortality in India is attributable to malnutrition.87 WHO estimates that 87% of women in India are anaemic.88 Anaemia, a manifestation of malnutrition, elevates the maternal mortality risk at childbirth by up to 20%.89 It causes annual deaths of 65,000 women in childbirth in Asia,90 where it is the second leading cause of maternal mortality.91 Countries with more than 40% of stunting among under-five children in Asia include Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Nepal and Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.92 In Nepal, 50% of under-five children were stunted in 2006, which is also an indicator of malnutrition.93 Extreme climatic events such as floods and droughts and subsequent crop failures, disruption of supply chains, loss of livelihoods, and food price increase could exacerbate the extent of the region\u2019s existing vulnerability to malnutrition-related morbidity and mortality. Empirical and projected figures shown above reveal the high susceptibility of Asia and the Pacific to climate-sensitive mortality and morbidity risks. They elucidate the extent of actual and potential public health effects of climate change in developing countries of the region, which are further multiplied by already existing health vulnerabilities, disease burden and widespread poverty. 3.

The risk of facing violence is likely to elevate after a natural disaster if women were already the victim of violence prior to the disaster.103 Women\u2019s vulnerability can be further exacerbated as support networks including family, friends and relevant government/non-government institutions to protect vulnerable women may not be accessible or functional in disaster situations.104 Fear of violence may also drive women away from using shelters or camps,105 which could exacerbate their vulnerability even further. Following the 2004 tsunami, for example, some young jobless women in Thailand were reported to have been subjected to the risk of forcible entry into sex work.106 The 2010 Asia Pacific Disaster Report107 elucidates the difference in the disaster-related mortality risk between men and women in Asia. For example, 61% of nearly 140,000 deaths caused by the 2008 cyclone in Myanmar were women. In the 1991 cyclone in Bangladesh that killed 140,000, women accounted for 90% of deaths108 and they were nearly 4 times more likely to be killed as compared with men. During the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, 70 to 80% of those killed were women. Although tsunami is not a climate-sensitive event, this figure, together with the other figures, strongly indicate the magnitude of greater mortality risk for women in natural disasters in Asia. In addition to women, girls at younger ages also appear to be particularly at a heightened risk of disaster-related mortality. In a 1993 flash flood that hit Nepal with a death toll of over 1,600, the flood-related fatality rate per 1,000 for girls and boys at the age of between 2 and 9 was 13.3 and 9.4, respectively.109 The corresponding figures for adult women and men were 6.1 and 4.1, respectively. A study that examined information from 147 countries demonstrated that gender differences in the disaster-related health risks are not likely attributable to physical differences between men and women.110 The 2009 UNFPA State of World Population concludes that the sex differences in disaster-related mortality are directly influenced by 98 Neumayer and Pl\u00fcmper 2007, cited in WHO 2011a. 99 Araujo and Quesada-Aguilar 2007. 100 ADB 1999. 101 Bartlett 2008, cited in WHO 2011a. 102 Brody et al. 2008. 103 All India Disaster Mitigation Institute 2005, cited in WHO 2011a; International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies 2007, cited in WHO 2011a. 104 Ibid. 105 Ibid. 106 UNESCAP and UN International Strategies for Disaster Reduction 2010. 107 Ibid. 108 Aguilar 2004, cited in WHO 2011a. 109 WHO 2010c. 110 Neumayer and Pl\u00fcmper 2007, cited in WHO 2011a. 10 gender inequalities in the socioeconomic status and \u201cthe degree to which women enjoy economic and social rights.\u201d111 The report also affirms that in countries where men and women enjoy comparable status, natural disasters affect them almost equally. Additionally, pregnant women are at an increased risk of malaria infection, which is climate-sensitive as described previously. In comparison to non-pregnant women, maternal women are at a 2-fold increased risk of malaria due to pregnancy-induced physiological changes.112 Maternal malaria infection is associated with a number of complications, such as \u201cspontaneous abortion, premature delivery, stillbirth and low birth weight.\u201d 113 4. Other population groups vulnerable to climate change impacts Apart from women, other population groups with high vulnerability to climate change in the region include people living in (1) mountain communities, (2) deltaic regions, (3) coastal areas, and (4) urban slums. Mountain communities are highly vulnerable to water scarcity, floods, landslides, rock avalanches, and infectious diseases triggered by climate change. 114 Warmer climate increases the risk of vector-borne diseases such as malaria among mountain populations who do not have immunity against these diseases. Data show that the pace of temperature increase is faster at high altitudes.115 Glacier melting associated with climate change threatens the supply of fresh water for personal and agricultural use in mountain areas, thereby jeopardising their livelihoods, food security and health.116 Food insecurity is already a continuous problem among people in mountain communities in Nepal, 117 and climate change could further aggravate the challenge. By creating lakes, glacier melting also increases the risk of glacier lake outburst floods (GLOF), which are extremely deadly and destructive to downstream mountain communities,118 their food security and health.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e37ffc73-4c1c-4f29-942b-ca6a48c87676": {"__data__": {"id_": "e37ffc73-4c1c-4f29-942b-ca6a48c87676", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/16", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/16", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/16", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5d2fef08f6b504522c03364009e060483118fc66a9f6ad834b37371ee7f9d78f"}, "2": {"node_id": "03ba6210-0d91-4a8b-8f78-b060069bd3cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/16", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "547e0eee84e739f41f373fef5df5357cd97b2c0c58a585de8732f139d170ecf5"}}, "hash": "9de8ba3200ad6d5ea4518fdbdf68ec39ac5d7f599eb50ade084e555a2bf6ccbf", "text": "This is particularly concerning for the countries in the Himalayan region, such as Bhutan, China, India, Nepal and Pakistan.119 The health vulnerability of people in mountain areas is amplified even further for their limited access to public health systems.120 Floods, sea level rise, and subsequent salinization of fresh water subject people in deltas, particularly in low-lying river deltas, as well as", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "83a1b7bf-dda5-4b85-ab93-e2a07185cfb0": {"__data__": {"id_": "83a1b7bf-dda5-4b85-ab93-e2a07185cfb0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/16", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/16", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/16", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fbb6c541e32b7d22256bc5fc44aa4339932cfbff50f00bf10edcd89c181f344f"}, "3": {"node_id": "08b82ad7-0dbd-4f42-8276-2db4c077d346", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/16", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3665a8e71c9ad8ae2b7b6bae8e57f33c91d6340265ac7861bb97eb7bae3d1663"}}, "hash": "a98cd88a17e2d4dfad713940e5f42e6cad48bce9041130aaabe3ae2f01d5f558", "text": "in coastal areas to health hazards such as disaster-related deaths, injuries, and food insecurity due to destruction of agricultural 111 UNFPA 2009. 112 WHO 2011a. 113 WHO 2011a. 114 WHO 2009b; WHO 2008a. 115 Liu and Chen 2000, cited in WHO 2008a. 116 WHO 2008a. 117 Eriksson et al. 2008. 118 Bajracharya et al. 2008; Ives et al. 2010. 119 Ives et al. 2010. 120 Eriksson et al. 2008. 11 bases. Climate change is also believed to increase the level of cholera bacteria in waters in the coastal areas.121 In Bangladesh where over 120 million people live in the deltaic areas, it is estimated that a 10% land loss and 6 million displaced people would result from a 0.5m sea level rise.122 A 1.0m rise would lead to a 20% land loss and 15 million displaced people. According to another estimate, Bangladesh is projected to see a rise of up to 1.8m in sea level by the end of the 21st century, under the worst case scenario, losing up to 16% of its land that is supporting 13% of the Bangladeshi population,123 or approximately 21 million. The magnitude of large populations living in coastal areas in the Asia Pacific region can magnify public health vulnerability, risks and impacts of climate change. They may include disaster-related deaths and injuries, infectious disease outbreaks, loss of livelihoods, distress migration and destruction of critical public health-related infrastructure such as hospitals, clean water supply, sanitation and disposable systems. In Indonesia, nearly 61% of its population, or 110 million, live in coastal areas.124 About 70% of Samoa\u2019s population and infrastructure are found in coastal areas.125 Poor sanitation and waste disposal systems and lack of access to improved water in urban slum areas create high health risks among urban slum dwellers. A study, for example, demonstrated that poor people residing in slums in Jakarta are highly susceptible to floods.126 In 2005, about 35% of the urban population in Asia and the Pacific were living in slums.127 In some countries such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Mongolia and Nepal, the figure was much higher, exceeding 50%.128 UNESCAP estimates that the number of urban slum dwellers in the Asia Pacific region is approximately 571 million.129 Together with a growing urban slum population and its densities, urban slum dwellers are at a greater risk of tuberculosis as well as water-borne diseases such as diarrhoea and cholera in extreme climatic events such as flooding and heavy precipitation.130 Additionally, heat island effect in urban areas can increase the risk of heat waves and heart strokes.131 121 UNFCCC 2007. 122 Houghton 2004, cited in Costello et al. 2009. 123 Maslin 2008, cited in Costello et al. 2009. 124 Staringa 2008. 125 WHO 2008a. 126 Firman et al. 2011. 127 UNESCAP 2010. 128 Ibid. 129 Ibid. 130 Tupasi et al. 2000; UHRC 2007; WHO 2008c; Staringa 2008; WHO 2009b; Costello et al. 2009. 131 Costello et al. 2009. 12 5. Responses in the Asia-Pacific region In response to real and potential health impacts of climate change, various recommendations have been made. They range from reduction of carbon emissions, more studies to strengthen evidence on health impacts of climate change, sensitisation of policy makers, establishment of effective disease surveillance and control to disaster preparedness, among others.132 The WHO Regional Framework for Action to Protect Human Health from the Effects of Climate Change in Asia and the Pacific133 highlights the following objectives and action points for governments: (1) Increase awareness of health consequences of climate change: \uf0b7 Undertake studies on the health implications of climate change and share information to understand how to promote changes in individual and corporate behaviours that mitigate climate-related health risks, while protecting and promoting health. \uf0b7 Enhance political commitment and strengthen institutional capacity and arrangements to achieve adaptation and mitigation goals. \uf0b7 Facilitate national working groups, nongovernmental organizations and civil society to develop coordinated mitigation and adaptation plans by including relevant sectors, regions and disciplines.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "08b82ad7-0dbd-4f42-8276-2db4c077d346": {"__data__": {"id_": "08b82ad7-0dbd-4f42-8276-2db4c077d346", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/16", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/16", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/16", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fbb6c541e32b7d22256bc5fc44aa4339932cfbff50f00bf10edcd89c181f344f"}, "2": {"node_id": "83a1b7bf-dda5-4b85-ab93-e2a07185cfb0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/16", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a98cd88a17e2d4dfad713940e5f42e6cad48bce9041130aaabe3ae2f01d5f558"}}, "hash": "3665a8e71c9ad8ae2b7b6bae8e57f33c91d6340265ac7861bb97eb7bae3d1663", "text": "\uf0b7 Develop awareness-raising programmes and learning resource materials to educate and engage a broad range of stakeholder, including local communities, health and other relevant professionals, and the media on the potential health impacts of climate variability and change and on appropriate measures to reduce climate-sensitive risk factors and adverse health outcomes.

(3) To ensure that health concerns are addressed in decisions to reduce risks from climate change in other key sectors: \uf0b7 Develop integrated strategies to incorporate current and projected climate change risks into existing policies, legislation, strategies and measures of key development sectors to control climate-sensitive health outcomes.

It has been pointed out that international assistance has prioritised disaster recovery efforts over adaptive capacity development in developing countries. 134 Capacity building at local, regional and national levels could contribute simultaneously to improving surveillance, disaster preparedness, health-seeking behaviour in extreme climatic events, and, overall, sustainable resilience to the health risks and consequences of climate change in the long run. Engagement of the community in collective efforts for adaptive capacity building is particularly considered critical.135 Involvement of affected communities such as those mentioned in the previous section and especially women needs to be proactively pursued, given their known high vulnerabilities to climate-sensitive health risks. The Commission on the Status of Women expressed in its 55th session in February 2011 that \u201c[G]ender equality and the effective participation of women \u2026 are important for effective action on all aspects of climate change.\u201d136 134 Mizra 2003. 135 Costello et al. 2009. 136 UNECOSOC 2011. 14 In response to growing awareness and evidence of climate-sensitive health risks, WHO and UNDP initiated in 2010 a project on public health adaptation to climate change.137 It is the first global project to focus on strengthening adaptive capacity of country\u2019s health systems including practitioners on the field to effectively address health risks associated with climate change. Seven countries were selected for this project, of which 3 are in the Asia-Pacific region: Bhutan, China and Fiji. The goal of this project is to \u201cincrease adaptive capacity of national health system institutions, including field practitioners, to respond to climate sensitive health risks.\u201d138 The common objectives of the project include strengthening early warning and early action; capacity building of national stakeholders; piloting risk reduction interventions on specific health issues; and documentation and sharing of lessons learned. Within these overarching common objectives, there are also country-specific objectives. 139 The project in Bhutan, for example, focuses the following areas: (1) strengthening metrological and surveillance systems to provide evidence on climate- sensitive health outcomes for awareness and action; (2) enhancing human and financial resources to address climate change risks in health activities; (3) integrating climate change concerns into ongoing relevant health programmes such as the National Vector- borne Disease Control Program; and (4) improving coordination among climate and health initiatives.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "20f40b27-3e9a-44a4-839e-cbeda3698c27": {"__data__": {"id_": "20f40b27-3e9a-44a4-839e-cbeda3698c27", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/16", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/16", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/16", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7f3b2dcfe973cbf7aad7c3a5cb79dcfdbdc59751b50b1f7c7520c7bb62deea08"}, "2": {"node_id": "f2cbb55a-0692-4d1d-87bb-9cc6a9656eda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/16", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cf95082f1de694ca03f861948d4a84ffd526fae2db4be5188719a0f5b90e48f6"}}, "hash": "5b50e0e0f90808ff9191cc57617ebc442c4f57b065716d84c1731a142a0f628b", "text": "The project is expected to increase awareness and capacity of health professionals and the community to better respond to climate-related health risks and impact mitigation.

It is submitted to the secretariat of UNFCCC, which qualifies the country to apply for funding from the LDC Fund (LDCF) of the Global Environment Facility to implement NAPA. Therefore, NAPA serves as the backbone of a country\u2019s response for climate change adaptation. Nepal, for example, submitted its NAPA in late 2010.141 It provides a comprehensive assessment of the country\u2019s climate change adaptation situation, needs, challenges and strategies in areas of priority. It covers agriculture and food security, water resources and energy, climate-induced disasters, forests and biodiversity, public health, and urban settlements and infrastructure, all of which have health implications. There are proposed activities for each of these priority areas. Proposed activities for adapting to climate challenges in public health in Nepal, budgeted at USD 15 million, include the following: (1) reducing public health impacts of climate change through evidence based research and piloting; (2) empowering 137 WHO n.d.-b. 138 UNDP and WHO 2010. 139 UNDP and WHO n.d. 140 UNFCCC 2011a. 141 Government of Nepal 2010. 15 communities through public education for responding adverse effects of climate change in public health; (3) investigating disease outbreak and emergency response; (4) scaling up programmes on vector borne, water and food borne diseases and disasters; and (5) strengthening forecasting/early warning and surveillance system on climate change and health. Under the LCDF, projects on climate change adaptation with strong health implications have been implemented in many countries in the Asia Pacific region, often executed by the Ministry of Environment or other relevant ministries. These include Afghanistan (Building adaptive capacity and resilience to climate change); Bangladesh (Community \u2013based adaptation to climate change through coastal afforestation); Bhutan (Reducing climate change-induced risks and vulnerabilities from glacial lake outbursts); Cambodia (Vulnerability assessment and adaptation programme for climate change within coastal zone of Cambodia considering livelihood improvement and ecosystems); Kiribati (Increasing resilience to climate variability and hazards); Lao PDR (Improving the resilience of the agricultural sector in Lao PDR to climate change impacts); Maldives (Integration of climate change risks into the Maldives safer island development programme); Samoa (Integrated climate change adaptation in Samoa); Tuvalu (Increasing resilience of coastal areas and community settlements to climate change); and Vanuatu (Increasing resilience to climate change and natural hazards). 142 One of the key concerns in responding to the health impact of climate change is financial requirements. Additional disease and financial burdens attributable to climate change could overwhelm already over-stretched health systems in many countries in Asia and the Pacific. In Bangladesh, for example, the cost of treating additional cases of diseases due to climate change was estimated to be USD 2.8 billion, which is equivalent to 3% of its GDP.143 The diseases included in this estimation are diarrhoea, kalazar, filarisis, dengue, malaria, and chikungunya, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, injuries, drowning, malnutrition and other diseases and events. In response to these projected additional health and financial burdens, the Bangladeshi government is taking action to reduce people\u2019s vulnerabilities, by developing a new health care delivery system and reinvigorating primary health care services.144 142 UNFCCC 2011b. 143 WHO and PAHO 2010. 144 Ibid. 16 Bibliography ADB (Asian Development Bank). 1999.

Email: p.balachandra@gmail.com i Abstract Energy drives development, economic as well as human, with advanced technologies as means to achieve this. The deprivations in energy in terms of quantity as well as quality causes lack of development thereby poverty and human sufferings. This technical paper is an attempt at providing deeper insights into these aspects with a focus on the developing countries of the Asia and the Pacific region. The paper begins with emphasizing the issues of securing energy needs of poor and climate change mitigation emerging as conflicting challenges, and their significance in the Asia-Pacific region in the global context. These challenges are extremely critical in the region because it has the highest energy deprivation among the poor at present and it is fast moving towards emerging as the biggest emitter of CO2 in the future. Further, the linkages between energy, poverty, sustainable development and climate change are analysed by developing different sets of indicators and the results suggested relatively strong association among these. Finally, the possibility of providing universal access to modern energy carriers for the households of the Asia-Pacific is explored by adopting a low-carbon pathway. Key words: Energy Access, Energy Security, Climate Change, Poverty The views expressed in this publication are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily represent those of the United Nations, including UNDP, or the UN Member States.

Poverty is an ongoing crisis whereas climate change is an impending crisis. Climate change is expected to intensify the sufferings of the poor by impacting the meager resources and assets owned by them. Poor with limited access to income as well as to other resources, goods and services are typically vulnerable to unpredictable events and disasters. Climate change is likely to result in many such events. Energy is at the center of the two \u2013 extent of access influences the poverty levels and consumption contributes to climate change by emitting GHGs. Modern energy is the driver of technology, which facilitates improvement in living standards, promotion of efficient use of resources, adaptation to local conditions and needs, and integration with other existing technologies. Technology has emerged as the driving force behind: structure of domestic production, advantage in market competition, opportunities for cross border trade, and growth in standards of living of people.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a9de0011-65b6-4940-aaf3-722c95a7c332": {"__data__": {"id_": "a9de0011-65b6-4940-aaf3-722c95a7c332", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e419cc26c502d06b7761f8d86b6b200706a316da1a706ea25b7c2732b9c70d0c"}, "2": {"node_id": "936c51b9-0783-4868-bdd6-9d6ad33ca558", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e203da755ed6fc34fa27b138b38c9bc5f777aa52dcf23c71ae8bd182937f866c"}}, "hash": "2921d8ea0d2516e4005cb9bfdb26a3a53b790e9621be726b5614bad4c7d7c04c", "text": "These are essential for eradication of poverty as well as for economic development.

The 2007 estimates suggest that out of a population of about 6.6 billion about 1.7 billion are living below an income of $1.25 a day and about 2.6 billion are living below an income of $2 a day. The number of energy poor is also equally significant at about 1.4 billion without access to electricity and about 3.1 billion without any access to modern fuels for cooking. From this, it could be easily hypothesized that income poor are also energy poor, and energy poverty spans beyond income poverty, if we define $2 a day as poverty line. About 860 million lack access to adequate water and about 2.5 billion do not have access to basic sanitation facilities. Thus, there is currently about 21% of the world population without access to electricity and on a more serious note, about 47% of the global population relies on solid fuels \u2013 coal, charcoal, wood, dung and agricultural residues \u2013 to meet their daily cooking needs. It appears that the majority of the deprived people live in Asia and the Pacific. The estimates for 2007 suggest that it is home to about 1.8 billion people who survive on less than $2.00 a day and 982 million people living below the poverty line of less than $1.25 a day. More than 406 million people in rural areas and 93 million people in urban areas lacks access to adequate water, while more than 1.9 billion people are living without basic sanitation facilities. About 800 million people in the Asia-Pacific do not have access to electricity and about 2 billion people rely on solid fuels for cooking. This situation has serious impacts on people\u2019s health and the condition of the natural environment. It also severely limits people\u2019s economic opportunities and ability to overcome poverty. According to World Energy Outlook 2009 of the International Energy Agency (IEA), the energy sector contributes 84% of global CO2 emissions and 64% of the world\u2019s greenhouse- gas emissions. If no action is initiated, the contributions will increase to about 91% of the global CO2 emissions by 2030 and the share in GHG emissions is likely to reach 71%. In absolute sense, energy related emissions are expected to increase from 28.8 Gt in 2007 to 40.2 Gt in 2030. To limit the global average temperature increase of 2oC, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere would need to be stabilized at a level of around 450 ppm xiii CO2e. According to IEA, in this scenario, the global energy related CO2 emissions are expected to peak at 30.9 Gt by 2020 and decline thereafter to 26.4 Gt in 2030. To achieve these reductions, the energy demand has to reduce substantially. The strategy as proposed by IEA is to increase contributions from renewable energy and adoption of energy efficiency. Developing countries are worried about what these reductions imply for continuing economic development and efforts in eradication of poverty. It is postulated that these reductions can have very serious implications for economic growth as well as sustainable development. Unless approached strategically by opting for optimally chosen options it can lead to catastrophic consequences for human development. Energy Access Status and Sources of Energy for Poor As stated, the most important indicators of energy poverty are the extent of access the population has to electricity and modern fuels for cooking. The status in Asia-Pacific suggest that as a whole about 77% of the population had access to electricity as against the world average of about 78%. This compares favourably with 26% access level in the sub-Saharan Africa. However, the region has countries like Papua New Guinea, Myanmar, Afghanistan, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Timor-Leste, Cambodia and Korea, DPR where the electricity access levels are lower than that of sub-Saharan Africa. The urban region with electricity access levels of almost 94% is almost on the verge of achieving universal access whereas still 43% of the rural population does not have access to electricity and this compares favourably with the 89% of the rural population without access in sub-Saharan Africa. However, in terms of absolute numbers Asia-Pacific region with about 807 million people without access to electricity lags behind sub-Saharan Africa at about 591 million without access.

Out of the 34 countries in the region, 8 have access levels lower than that in sub-Saharan Africa and another 8 have access levels of more than 80%. Out of these 8 countries with more than 80% access to modern fuels, 6 belong to small island countries. Even China, which has achieved spectacular success in providing access to electricity, has failed to achieve similar progress with access to modern cooking fuels with only 52% of population having access. About 74% of the urban population in Asia-Pacific use modern fuels for cooking whereas it is only 19% in the case of rural population. Except for few countries wood is the dominant fuel on which majority of the households depends for their cooking energy needs. Significant share of households in Mongolia and Cambodia rely on electricity for cooking. China and Mongolia depend on coal for meeting significant share of cooking energy needs. The pattern of cooking energy use suggests that it is quite varied and mostly relying on solid fuels. Among the population relying on solid fuels for cooking, about 30% use improved cookstoves and nearly 79% of them live in China. In total, the households of Asia-Pacific region consumed about 18,503 PJ of energy in 2005. Out of this, about 63% share is accounted by the solid fuels. Wood with about 42% share occupies the top position and electricity with nearly 14% share is a distant second. In poorer countries like Cambodia and Nepal, the solid fuels account for over 90% of the household energy consumption whereas it is around 85% in Mongolia and Solomon Islands. India is not far behind these countries with a solid fuel share of about 78%. xiv The total GHG emission from the household fuel use in the Asia-Pacific is in the range of 1,135 million tonne of CO2e to 1,853 million tonne of CO2e depending on how the wood is sourced either from sustainable or un-sustainable source. The share of wood fuel in the total emissions is in the range of 6.5%-42.7%. Emissions from coal account for about 14% of the total GHG emissions. With the sustainable wood assumption, China will be the major emitter with a share of nearly 47% and India coming second with a share of 18% in total GHG emissions. However, with un-sustainable wood, the respective shares for China and India would be 39% and 26%. The total emission of black carbon (BC) is about 1.05 million tonne in the region. Coal used in China contributes to about 68% of the BC emissions. Wood with a share of about 25% is the second most important contributor. China, because of its extensive dependency on coal, accounts for about 73% of the BC emissions in the Asia-Pacific. India with a share of nearly 16% is the second big emitter of BC. Emission of BC is mostly contributed by the poor who rely on solid fuels. Thus, expanding access to modern fuel for cooking has dual benefits \u2013 better life for the poor and high climate change mitigation potential. Sources of Energy in the Industrial Sector The Asia-Pacific region as a whole is a dominant industrial energy consumer with accounting for about 80% of the coal, 37% of the firewood, 47% of the bagasse, and 37% of the electricity consumed by the global industrial sector. This domination is mainly because of China, where the industries consume 70% of the coal and 82% of the electricity consumed by the industrial sector of the Asia-Pacific. The higher firewood share is because of high industrial consumption in Indonesia (45%) and India (43%) in the region. The industries of the Asia-Pacific region consumed about 31,700 PJ of energy in 2007 which works out to a share of about 40% of the world industrial energy consumption. Among the countries, China accounts for nearly 61% and India for 16% of the total industrial energy consumption in the Asia-Pacific. The two most dominant industrial energy carriers in the Asia-Pacific are coal with nearly 40% and electricity with 31% shares where as the dominant energy carriers in the world are electricity with a share of about 32% and natural gas with a share of about 27%. Solid fuels with about 48% share dominate the industrial energy scene in the Asia-Pacific whereas they account for only 26.6% in the world industrial energy consumption.

In the Asia-Pacific region, GHG emissions from electricity consumption with 57% and coal with 29% shares account for the largest contribution to the total emissions. It is obvious that with highest share in industrial energy consumption, China accounts for nearly 70% of the GHG emissions contributed by the Asia-Pacific region. The total emission of black carbon is nearly 285,000 tonne in the region and it accounts for nearly 38% of the world BC emissions due to industrial energy use. Diesel with 43% and bagasse with 38% shares are the major contributors to BC emissions in the region. China, because of its extensive dependency on coal, accounts for nearly 38% of the BC emissions in the region. Expanding Energy Access for Building Empowerment and Resilience Access to modern energy carriers brings in development \u2013 enhanced income, opportunities for economic activities, access to better education and health facilities, connectivity to external world through TV, internet and other media, gender empowerment, clean environment, access to information facilitating knowledge gains, enhanced social status with ability to participate and interact, ability to take informed decisions, etc. All these could significantly enhance the adaptive capabilities of individuals as well as society as a whole. xv Further, with the adoption of low-carbon pathways to expand energy access has significant environmental and ecological benefits. All these contribute to empowering the poor and build resilience to adversities. Thus, resilience could be built through economic, knowledge, human and social empowerments. As discussed earlier, energy development through expanded access to modern energy carriers has implications for economic development. This could happen through employment generation, skill development through education and information dissemination, establishment of small enterprises, access to markets, expansion of economic activities, etc. Thus, GDP per capita measures the level of economic development of a country and the poverty counts indicates the extent of reach of the economic development to the larger section of the population. Even though the average GDP per capita of Asia-Pacific region is just one-third of that of the world its share of extremely poor population (below $1.25 a day) of 23.5% is less than the global average of 26.2%. This is indicates the benefits of economic development, though low, is better distributed in Asia-Pacific. However, the share of poor population (below $2 a day) in the Asia-Pacific is high at 51.8% compared to the world average of 40%, which is an indicator of lower economic development in the region. The human development benefits associated with expanding energy access are related to better education facilities and opportunities, access to healthcare as well as better health conditions, access to information for knowledge empowerment, gender empowerment through reduced drudgery, productive endevours, enhanced security and clean working environment. In addition, the enhanced income levels and employment opportunities would significantly reduce the poverty levels thereby enhancing the living standards of the people. To make a comparison, indicators related to poverty, gender, human development, health, education and access to improved services are used. Asia-Pacific has a smaller poverty gap ratio compared to the world average indicating lesser depth in poverty. However, for countries like Nepal, Bangladesh, Cambodia and India there is a need for substantial efforts to bridge this gap. The high values associated with the multi-dimensional poverty index too points out to the deficiencies in these countries with respect to eradication of poverty and providing access to basic services. On an average, the human development is lower in Asia- Pacific compared to the world but far better than sub-Saharan Africa. The gender inequalities are highest among poor countries and those are having low energy access levels. China has the least gender inequality index (GII) value indicating higher levels of gender empowerment. The non-income HDI scores indicating the level of achievements with respect to life expectancy and education are relatively high for Tonga, Malaysia and Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka though a poor country in terms of per capita GDP has done well with respect to other development indicators. This is true even with respect to providing access to better sanitation and potable water with more than 90% of the people having access. Cambodia, India and Nepal are the worst performers with respect to providing access to good sanitation facilities. Their performance is same as that of sub-Saharan Africa. Except for Papua New Guinea and Cambodia, all other countries in Asia-Pacific have done well with providing access to clean drinking water to the majority of the population.

Cambodia with 1,304 deaths per million people in 2004 and India with 954 deaths occupy the top two positions. Next two countries with highest deaths are the neighbouring countries of India, namely, Nepal and Bangladesh. xvi The implications for environmental development are analysed keeping in mind the possibilities of mitigating the negative effects of climate change and building climate change resilience. In this regard, lack of modern energy access and over dependency on solid fuels has significant negative implications for climate change. In addition, the indicators of environmental/ecological development and degradation are used for assessing environmental development. The analysis suggests that all the developing countries of the Asia-Pacific together accounted for about 31% of the global energy related CO2 emissions with China accounting for almost 67% of this amount. In terms of per capita emissions only Malaysia and China have higher emissions compared to the global average. As a whole, Asia-Pacific appears to be a low carbon intensive region both in terms of per capita emissions as well as carbon intensity of GDP. The countries with highly inadequate energy development such as Bangladesh, Cambodia and Nepal have very low per capita emission levels. These low per capita emissions in these countries are an outcome of poverty and dependency on traditional biomass fuels. Ecological footprint is a measure of human demand on the Earth's ecosystems. The data for the Asia-Pacific suggest that on an average it has a better ecological footprint at 1.5 hectares per capita compared to the global average of 1.8 hectares per capita. The smaller Pacific Island countries exert higher pressure on the earth\u2019s resources with ecological footprint ranging from a high of 3.7 hectares per capita in the case of Fiji to 1.7 hectares per capita for Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea. Countries like Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Thailand with high share of protected areas could be less vulnerable to natural disasters. People living on the degraded land would be the most vulnerable to climate change related impacts. Cambodia, Mongolia and Sri Lanka with high share of population living on the degraded land expected to suffer more during disasters. Energy Access Policies and Programmes The status of modern energy access in the Asia-Pacific as in 2007 suggests that about 77% of the population had access to electricity and about 44% had access to modern fuels for cooking. Relatively high access level in electricity was the outcome many successful programmes implemented across Asia-Pacific. For example, in the early 90s China was electrifying villages at the rate of 30 per day and Viet Nam gave almost 400 people access to electricity per hour for 15 years. Though not as successful as in the case of electricity there were programmes targeting expansion of cooking fuel access. The biogas for cooking programmes implemented in China and India were reasonably successful. Broadly, the policies and programmes for expanding could be classified into \u2013 large-scale government initiated focused programmes, price controls to enhance affordability through energy subsidies and tax incentives, promoting technology dissemination and small-scale NGO and private sector initiated programmes with donor funding and government support. China\u2019s national electrification rate in 2009 was 99.4% as with rural electrification of 99% and 100% in urban areas, which is an outcome of government\u2019s focused rural electrification programme providing electricity to over 900 million people during the period 1950-2004. Key factors in China\u2019s success were the government\u2019s ability to mobilize contributions at the local level, creation of local enterprises and the domestic production of low-cost components. Viet Nam achieved extremely rapid electrification, expanding coverage from about 10% in 1986 to 96.6% in 2009. Access to low-cost finance, funding from multiple sources and insistence on cost recovery, through tariffs or from government budget, were important for this success. Many governments initiated large-scale programmes to support dissemination of renewable energy and energy efficient technologies. Most of these programmes had provision of access xvii to modern energy carriers to the people, especially in rural areas, as one of the objectives in addition to promoting technology dissemination. Biogas plants, advanced biomass cookstoves, micro-hydro power plants, biomass power generation systems, solar water heaters, solar PV and home lighting systems are some prioritized technologies chosen for dissemination. Most of these projects are implemented by the local NGOs, government agencies and private sector entities with funding from international donor agencies. Funding has been largely restricted to renewable energy technology-based energy access programmes with twin objectives of climate change mitigation and energy access.

Keeping this in mind, a proposal to achieve universal energy access in the Asia-Pacific is presented. It targets at 100% access to modern energy carriers/technologies for cooking, lighting and other basic electricity-based uses by 2030, i.e., in another 20 years starting from 2010. To ascertain the implications of 100% access to energy requirements, investments, operating and capital costs, GHGs and black carbon emissions, two scenarios are developed: Baseline Scenario (BS) tracking the expansion of modern energy access in 2015 and 2030 with a base year status as on 2009. This scenario is similar to the Current Policies Scenario of the World Energy Outlook 2010. Universal Energy Access Scenario (UAS) This assumes all will have access to modern energy carriers/technologies in 2030. Other inputs and assumptions are similar to that used for BS. The implications are analysed based on following: \uf0b7 The energy needs are to be met with a judicious mix of energy supply from both centralized energy systems (electricity grid and LPG) and decentralized energy systems (Mini-grid and Off-grid electricity systems, biogas from bioenergy systems, advanced biomass cookstoves). \uf0b7 An annual electricity consumption norm of 500 kWh per urban and 250 kWh per rural households and an average annual LPG consumption 22 kg per capita. The incremental electricity requirement for providing universal electricity access is about 74,000 GWh and the associated generation requirement is nearly 87,000 GWh. This estimate includes the electricity requirement of only those people who have been given access under the universal energy access programme. India accounts for nearly 54% of this requirement. The total incremental annual cost of providing universal electricity access is about US$ 12 billion by 2030 with India accounting for about US$ 6.5 billion. The total investment required over the period of 20 years is about US$ 40 billion with India accounting for more than 50% of it. The incremental CO2 emissions due to universal electricity access are negligible at about 25 million tonne per year by 2030. With respect to universal access to modern fuels for cooking, about 4 billion people in the world need to be provided with access in the next 20 years. Nearly 2.8 billion of them would be from the Asia-Pacific with India accounting for 1 billion and China for about 750 million. Annual LPG requirement for this incremental population would be about 24 million tonne in the Asia-Pacific and nearly 36 million tonne globally. Most of the incremental energy needed for cooking would be met from biogas plants and advanced cookstoves. Total investment required over a period of 20 years in the Asia-Pacific is about US$ 72 billion. xviii Universal energy access needs a robust implementation mechanism to achieve the time- bound targets. We have made some specific recommendations for designing of regulatory policies, programmes, institutions, financing and local delivery mechanisms, which may function as useful inputs for developing country-specific universal energy access programmes. Energy Access Policy: Enact energy access policies targeted at the poor who are vulnerable and have serious issues with affordability and it should \u2013 allow for lifeline energy consumption and affordable tariffs, enable establishment of institutions for programme implementation and delivery of energy services, enable creation of energy access funds to support implementation, provide for establishing distributed energy systems and flexible access to the grid, provide for tax incentives and support capacity development. National and regional institutions for implementation: Dedicated national and regional institutions for implementing programmes are critical for the success. The role of national institution is to design implementable programmes, support its actual implementation along with regional/state level institutions and many other stakeholders, and monitor its progress. Multi-stakeholder partnerships: These processes have to pass through a number of hurdles, which are created by various stakeholders of energy systems and their involvement is absolutely necessary to overcome them. Government/policy makers, energy organizations/utilities, technical institutions and R&D organizations, industries, entrepreneurs, financial institutions, donor agencies, NGOs and consumers need to join together to achieve the objective of universal energy access. The role of the stakeholders could be related to financing, advising, information dissemination, technology provision, capacity building and monitoring. Dedicated energy access funds: Obtaining the required financial support for programme implementation is crucial. The proposal is to establish dedicated energy access funds at the national as well as regional or state levels. These could be made up of contributions from national budgets, government grants, redeployed energy subsidies, contributions from multilateral agencies and international donors.

The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is one such mechanism. The low-carbon pathway adopted for expanding energy access would have large potential for certified emission reductions (CERs) through avoided GHG emissions and these could be traded in the carbon markets under CDM or similar carbon trading mechanisms. Institutions for local delivery of energy services: The success of these programmes depends mainly on the existence, effectiveness and efficiency of the local institution responsible for delivering energy carriers or services. This institution could be a small scale enterprise, an NGO or a community organization. These institutions need to be empowered with capacity to create and maintain the local energy infrastructure. Capacity Development: As proposed, multiple stakeholders at different levels are involved in implementation of this universal energy access programme. The awareness and knowledge levels, experiences and commitment levels are varied across the strata of individuals associated with these stakeholders. Successful implementation to a large extent depends on empowerment of these individuals through effective capacity development programmes. xix Energy Outlook for the Industrial Sector The industrial sector in the Asia-Pacific is expected to continue to have a dominant share in the final energy demand even in future. As per the estimates, the industrial sector accounted for about 35% of the total final energy demand in 2006, which is expected remain same in 2015 and marginally reduce to 33% in 2030. The energy related CO2 emissions is forecast to grow from 10,749 million tonne to 17,763 million tonne an increase of 65%. With majority of the developing countries in the region striving hard to attain high economic growths and sustain them in the long run these increases are bound to happen. However, with the climate change threats looming large and need for urgent actions towards mitigating these threats, these countries cannot escape from the responsibilities. According to IEA\u2019s reference energy scenario, the industrial sector energy demand is likely to be 1,793 MTOE in 2030. However, the 450 ppm climate change stabilization scenario requires this demand to reduce to 1,526 MTOE, a reduction of 267 MTOE. This reduction is to be achieved mainly through implementation of energy efficiency measures across industries. The expectations are that the large reductions in energy consumptions and associated GHG emission reductions will result partly from a shift to low-carbon economic structure. Most of the critical measures in the industrial sector are expected to be initiated in the region are in China and India. Some of the measures proposed are rebalancing of the economy, efficiency improvements in industries, increasing use of CCS. Globally, the incremental investment required to achieve these objectives is estimated at US$ 18 trillion over a period of 2010 to 2035.Out this, the industrial sector needs an investment of US$ 2 trillion. Conclusion The technical paper begins with emphasizing the issues of securing energy needs of poor and climate change mitigation emerging as conflicting challenges and their significance in the developing countries of the Asia-Pacific region in the global context. These challenges are extremely critical in the region because it has the highest energy deprivation among the poor at present and it is fast moving towards emerging as the biggest emitter of CO2 in the future. Energy deprivations measured in terms of lack of access to electricity and modern fuels/technologies for cooking are found to be critical in the region. The poor in the region mostly rely on solid fuels like wood, coal, cattle dung and agro-waste for most of their energy needs. Solid fuels accounts for about 63% of the total household energy consumption with significant contributions to both CO2e as well as BC emissions. Further, the linkages between energy, poverty, sustainable development and climate change are analysed by developing different sets of indicators and the results suggested relatively strong association among these. A composite development index is developed integrating the indicators of economic, energy, environmental and human developments and the selected developing countries of the region are compared against this index for empowerment and resilience. Finally, the possibility of providing universal access to modern energy carriers for the households of the Asia-Pacific is explored by adopting a low-carbon pathway. The proposal entails a total incremental investment of US$ 113 billion over the next 20 years for providing electricity access to about 734 million people and access to modern fuels to about 2,779 million people. This is equal to a per capita investment of US$55 for providing access to electricity and US$26 for access to modern fuels.

Overall, it appears a win-win proposition for all the stakeholders. 1 Energy and Poverty in the Context of Climate Change 1. Introduction Poverty and climate change are the two greatest challenges being faced by the humanity. Poverty is an ongoing crisis whereas climate change is an impending crisis. Climate change related impacts are expected to intensify the sufferings of the poor by impacting the meager resources and assets owned by them. Poor with limited access to income as well as to other resources, goods and services are typically vulnerable to unpredictable events and disasters. Climate change is likely to result in many such events. Energy is at the center of the two \u2013 extent of its access determines the poverty levels and it contributes to climate change by emitting green house gases (GHGs). Energy, more specifically the modern energy, is the driver of technology and in general, technology is viewed as a mechanism, which transforms the natural resources into goods and services useful for the survival of human life. The technologies are expected to facilitate improvement in living standards, promotion of efficient use of resources, adaptation to local conditions and needs, and integration with other existing technologies. In short, the technologies are expected to meet both the livelihood and lifestyle needs of people in a sustainable manner. In the era of liberalized and interdependent global economy, technology has emerged as the driving force behind: structure of domestic production, advantage in market competition, opportunities for cross border trade, and growth in standards of living of people. These are essential for eradication of poverty as well as for economic development. However, this technology-related development has increased the demand for energy as well as associated emissions of green house gases (GHGs). The concern is more serious with developing countries because they are adopting various policies for speeding up the process of economic development in attempting to catch up with developed countries. As recognition of increasing concern about environmental impacts, the international community is again looking towards technologies to provide a solace to this problem. It is thus not surprising that a frequently expressed view on global climate change has been \"If the introduction of technologies created the problem, other new technologies will help in solving it\". Thus, the environmental issues arising out of energy-technology interactions are a cause of concern. Even though the main concern of developing countries was to meet the ever increasing demand for energy by its huge population, the global concern was how to mitigate the harmful environmental impacts of energy use. Climate change is one of the key challenges facing the international community. It will have severe negative implications for environmental, economic and social systems. This growing concern is mainly about global warming due to the increased concentration of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, etc.) and the resulting socio-economic impacts. As stated above, the other concern is poverty. Though, in general, poverty is measured in terms of income it reflects in several non-income dimensions involving the interface of environment, health, vulnerability, and empowerment and manifested in the quality of natural resource base, ecosystem services, property rights, air and water quality, access to water and sanitation, typology of energy use, quality of housing, and existence of slums (Bojo and Reddy 2003). The spectacular economic development measured in terms of GDP growth rates and technological advances is masking the human poverty prevailing in the world. The 2007 estimates suggest that out of a population of about 6.6 billion about 1.7 billion are living below an income of $1.25 a day and about 2.6 billion are living below an income of $2 a day (UNESCAP 2010a, World Bank 2009). The number of energy poor is also equally significant at about 1.4 billion without access to electricity and about 3.1 billion without any 2 access to modern fuels for cooking. From this data, it could be easily hypothesized that income poor are also energy poor, and energy poverty spans beyond income poverty, if we define $2 a day as poverty line. About 860 million lack access to adequate water and about 2.5 billion do not have access to basic sanitation facilities (UNDP 2010a). It appears that the majority of the deprived people live in Asia and the Pacific. The estimates for 2007 suggest", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8299826d-13a7-48fa-9de4-4b4ba338a5fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "8299826d-13a7-48fa-9de4-4b4ba338a5fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4f84a9277ef21906ca59c35fc397e1b3d5cdb37dd0dee0a0aba4a87cc480ad91"}}, "hash": "4f84a9277ef21906ca59c35fc397e1b3d5cdb37dd0dee0a0aba4a87cc480ad91", "text": "that Asia and the Pacific is home to about 1.8 billion people who survive on less than $2.00 a day and 982 million people living below the poverty line of less than $1.25 a day (UNESCAP 2010a, World Bank 2009). More than 406 million people in rural areas and 93 million people in urban areas lacks access to adequate water, while more than 1.9 billion people in the region are living without basic sanitation facilities (ADB 2010a). About 800 million people in Asia and the Pacific do not have access to electricity and about 2 billion people rely on solid fuels for cooking and heating (WHO 2010a). Thus, there is currently about 21% of the world population, mostly in rural areas, without electricity and relying on kerosene for meager lighting. On a more serious note, about 47% of the global population relies on solid and polluting fuels \u2013 coal, charcoal, wood, dung and agricultural residues \u2013 to meet their daily heating and cooking needs. This situation has serious impacts on people\u2019s health and the condition of the natural environment. It also severely limits people\u2019s economic opportunities and ability to overcome poverty. Major changes in the energy service delivery system are needed so that expansion of energy access can become an important instrument for sustainable development. Without access to an adequate quantity and quality of modern energy services, achievement of the MDGs will not be possible. With human development being strongly linked to sustainable economic development (in terms of scope, growth, reach and spread) energy becomes the natural binder. Expanded energy services are essential to meet the MDGs for reducing hunger and poverty, improving health care and educational opportunities, and addressing gender equity. In addition, energy is central to all aspects of sustainable development, including access to water, agricultural and industrial productivity, health care, educational attainment, job creation and climate change impacts. Affordable, accessible and reliable energy supply for delivering modern energy services is critical for uplifting the poor as well as for economic growth of a country. In many developing countries, especially in sub- Saharan Africa and South Asia, large numbers of people still live without any access to modern energy services. Thus, there appears the world, especially the developing world, is facing a herculean task of expanding access to modern energy carriers to majority of its population in order to achieve the desirable objectives of economic and human development with minimum contributions to climate change. The only choice available for the developing countries is to adopt a low- carbon pathway to development aiming at achieving universal energy access. 1-1. Objectives and Scope The overall objective of this technical paper is to develop an evidence-based research paper analyzing issues, challenges and solutions related to energy-poverty nexus and their linkages with climate change from the human development perspective, focusing on the developing countries of Asia-Pacific. The specific objectives of the study are: 1. To illustrate that the economic growth in Asia-Pacific countries is reliant on the energy sector. 3 2. To analyze the patterns and cross-country differences in energy needs for poverty reduction and development, focusing on achievement of the MDGs. 3. To analyze the disparity in per capita energy use across countries and across population groups in Asia-Pacific? 4. To analyze the role of households and industrial sectors in energy consumption and their impact on GHG emissions. 5. To discuss the challenges and opportunities for pursuing more sustainable energy use strategy that contributes to reduction in GHG emissions. 6. To identify the main issues and challenges regarding energy access and availability to the poor and the vulnerable groups and study how can greater access help reduce climate change vulnerabilities and build resilience. 7. What are the main gaps in current energy and climate policies in the region? How can they be improved to include the specific concerns of the poor more effectively? 8. To discuss role of regulatory, institutional and incentive frameworks to support the region\u2019s management of energy use, as well as access for the poor. 9. What are the opportunities for promoting greater access to energy use by the poor, for example, while heightening efforts to reduce GHG emissions? 10. What are the barriers (policy/regulatory/technical/financial/attitudinal) to change in terms of transitioning to innovative, efficient and modern energy forms? What are the appropriate ways of overcoming these barriers? In assessing the energy poverty, we have limited our analysis to two indicators, access to electricity for lighting and other basic end-uses, and modern fuels for cooking/heating, in the residential sector. The modern fuels for cooking include Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), Natural Gas, Kerosene and Electricity.

Energy Security of Poor and Climate Change Mitigation: Conflicting Challenges Energy security, fulfilling one\u2019s energy needs in a sustainable manner, is an important issue both from the perspective of economic development aiming at eradication of prevailing extreme poverty and climate change which is threatening the existence of humanity. Energy, development and climate change are correlated and the causation is both ways. Higher energy use enhances production, promotes economic development and improves standard of living of people. These in turn, promotes higher energy consumption and thereby increased emissions of greenhouse gases. Energy is closely linked to economic opportunity, security and empowerment. Majority of the households in the developing world, especially in the Asia-Pacific, can neither afford to have modern energy carriers nor reconcile to have standard of living below poverty line because of energy starvation. Energy poverty defined in terms of lack of access to modern energy services is a direct outcome of income poverty. The poor cannot afford modern energy carriers and live in houses, which are unfit to be connected to the modern energy systems, for example, to the electricity grid or to a gas network. Similarly, a poor nation is constrained by inadequate access to energy and capital resources, and therefore cannot build adequate infrastructure to create connectivity to modern energy carriers. Thus, \u201cun-affordability\u201d due to poverty and \u201cinaccessibility\u201d due to inadequate infrastructure are the root causes of lack of access to modern energy. Lack of energy access has implications for economic development, livelihoods, social dignity and environmental sustainability. Access to energy has strong links with poverty reduction through income, health, education, gender, and the environment (Saghir 2005). With energy being the driver of technology which in turn drives the economy, access to education, water, health, sanitation, information, employment and other essential services rely completely on energy access. It is a vicious circular chain of linked events, one leading to another and finally getting back to original position of poor \u201cindividual\u201d and \u201ccountry\u201d (Balachandra 2010).

The authors (Modi et al, 2005) of the report Energy Services for the Millennium Development Goals, published in 2005 by the World Bank/ESMAP, UNDP and the UN Millennium Project, recommend that national governments \u201cplace the issue of energy services at par with other MDGs\u201d. They also recommend that countries systematically integrate their energy sector development strategies into a comprehensive MDG-based national development strategy (Modi et al, 2005). Thus, it is not an exaggeration to state that expanding energy access is at the core of achieving MDGs. Many stakeholders including national governments, international organizations, NGOs have recognized these linkages as well as the need for expanding energy access. However, the experiences as well as the literature suggest that the gap between recognition of the need for expanding energy access and action towards this is very wide and ever expanding. The issues of energy access are only treated superficially in national and international development plans (UNDP 2007a). Partially, this is because energy governance is always biased towards \u201csupply-side\u201d and suggested solutions always revolve around \u201chardware\u201d aspects. The \u201cdemand-side\u201d aspects of energy have always been neglected. Energy service for sustainable development has never been the focus of energy planning. The focus of the energy sector is usually on expanding electrical generation and refinery capacity, and transmission & distribution lines, and maintaining steady supply of fossil fuels (Balachandra 2010). The outcome of such lopsided energy policies is the large number of energy poor in the developing countries of the world living with primitive energy lifestyles. As in 2007, there were 1.4 billion (22%) without access to electricity and 3.1 billion (40%) depending on solid fuels for cooking out of a total of 6.6 billion world population. Most of the deprived population lives in the rural regions of the developing countries. Out of the total global rural population of 3.3 billion about 79% (2.6 billion) depends on solid fuels for cooking and about 37% (1.2 billion) is without access to electricity (IEA 2009, UNESCAP 2010a). Energy empowerment through access to modern energy services is an essential component of any policy aiming to address health, education or welfare issues of rural people. Climate change is the most important global environmental challenges facing humanity with implications for food production, natural ecosystems, fresh water supply, health, coastal settlements, etc. Historically, compared to the developed countries, developing countries have contributed little to the climate change in the form of GHG emissions. However, this cannot be said about the future. The developing countries, especially in the Asia-Pacific, are experiencing spectacular economic growth and thereby enhanced energy consumption levels as well as consumption of other resources. This indicates that the Asia-Pacific region is likely to emerge as one of the significant emitters of GHGs. In most of the countries, the benefits of high economic growth are yet to reach the large section of the population. Imperatives of high GDP growth and all inclusive development will cause high demand for resources and resultant emissions. There will be pressures internally as well as internationally to alter the path of development by adopting environment friendly alternatives. In the long run this might prove advantageous to the country. Climate change is the buzzword in international negotiations, national planning and academic interactions. It is due to the inevitable catastrophic events predicted to happen in the next 30\u2013 100 years and threaten the existence of humanity in its current form and style. Global community, including scientists, economists, policy makers, is calling for immediate action to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change. Actions are being initiated and at the 6 same time there are calls for more action and unhappiness over the inaction or limited action by the major polluters. Critical issue in this sphere of action and no action is the indecisiveness of the politicians and policy makers. There is indecisiveness with regard to who needs to take action to mitigate climate change and who has to pay for it. Also, there is a critical need for making the large majority of the poor part of the development process. Science of global warming is well established, however, the resulting impacts are still probabilistic. Thus, scientific, political, economic and social reasons have contributed to make climate change a challenging issue. Global warming is caused by indiscriminate use of resources for variety of human needs and is largely responsible for climate change. Past actions of greedy mankind and continued desire to pursue the same path has resulted in such an outcome.

While meeting development needs of human kind, the production and use of energy also contributed to the degradation of the environment. Thus, energy production and use are the main causes of global warming. Among the greenhouse gases (GHGs), which are responsible for global warming, CO2 is the most prominent one. According to World Energy Outlook 2009 of the International Energy Agency (IEA), the energy sector contributes 84% of global CO2 emissions and 64% of the world\u2019s greenhouse- gas emissions (IEA, 2009). If no action is initiated, the contributions will increase to about 91% of the global CO2 emissions by 2030 and the share in GHG emissions is likely to reach 71%. In absolute sense, energy related emissions are expected to increase from 28.8 Gt in 2007 to 40.2 Gt in 2030. To limit the global average temperature increase of 2oC, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere would need to be stabilized at a level of around 450 ppm CO2e. The energy sector contribution is expected to be very significant to achieve this target. According to the IEA, in this scenario, the global energy related CO2 emissions are expected to peak at 30.9 Gt by 2020 and decline thereafter to 26.4 Gt in 2030, a reduction of 2.4 Gt from the 2007 level and 13.8 Gt below that in the business-as-usual or reference scenario in 2030. To achieve these reductions in CO2 emissions, the energy demand has to reduce substantially. The projections suggest that in the 450 ppm scenario, the estimated energy demand would be 13,600 mtoe in 2020 and 14,389 mtoe by 2030. The corresponding figures in the case of reference energy scenario are 14,450 mtoe in 2020 and 16,790 mtoe in 2030. This indicates a reduction in energy demand of 850 mtoe by 2020 and 2401 mtoe by 2030 (IEA 2009). The strategy as proposed by IEA is to increase contributions from low carbon energy technologies like renewable energy, hydro, nuclear and natural gas. In addition, energy efficiency is expected to be one of the largest contributors to abatement of CO2. Developing countries are worried about what these reductions imply for continuing economic development and efforts in eradication of poverty. Does climate change mitigation results in sacrificing human development? It is postulated that these reductions can have very serious implications for economic growth as well as sustainable development of the poor countries. Unless approached strategically by opting for optimally chosen options it can lead to catastrophic consequences for human development. 1-3. Emphasizing the Asia-Pacific Region in the Global Context Asia and the Pacific is the dominant region with a population of 3.72 billion out of a total world population of 6.61 billion in 2007 accounting for a share of about 56% (UN Data 2009). The developing countries in the region account for more than 94% of the total Asia-Pacific population. Though not at same scales, the economy of Asia-Pacific region is also significant with about 25% share in the total world GDP of about 61 Trillion US$ in 2008 (UNESCAP 2010a). Though developing Asia-Pacific accounts for 94% of the population its economic 7 dominance is limited to only 51% share in the total Asia-Pacific GDP of about 7.6 Trillion US$ in 2008. Since our focus is on the developing countries of Asia and the Pacific all the future comparisons are made between the developing Asia-Pacific and the World to show the significance of the region both in terms of development and deprivation. A comparison of some of the important indicators of energy, economic and human development as well as contributions to climate change is presented in Table 2 to show the significance of the developing Asia-Pacific in the global context. A ratio of World by Asia- Pacific for every indicator is developed for making easy comparison. For indicators, which contribute positively to the development (economic, human, environmental, efficiency, productivity, etc.), any value above one for the ratio indicates that Asia-Pacific is worse off compared to the world average and higher values suggest the extent of bad performance. Any value lower than one for these indicators, convey a favourable situation for the Asia-Pacific. Similarly, for the indicators, which contribute negatively to the development, the ratio value greater than one indicates a favourable situation for the Asia-Pacific and any value lower than one connotes the opposite. The indicators related to per capita energy consumption suggest that the developing countries of Asia-Pacific need to do a lot to catch up if they like to reach the consumption levels of world at large.

However, per capita wood fuel consumption in Asia-Pacific is lower than the world average. Asia-pacific is energy inefficient as indicated by the higher energy intensity of GDP (Table 2). About a quarter of energy production and consumption in quantitative terms occurs in the developing countries of Asia-Pacific. It appears that the energy supply in Asia-Pacific is more sustainable which is indicated by the higher share of renewable energy. However, this may be largely due to the high dependency of residential sector on traditional biomass for cooking and heating. Indicators of economic development suggest that the developing countries of Asia-Pacific on an average have only a third of per capita GDP of the world. However, the share of extremely poor people in Asia-Pacific is a shade better than world share where as more than half of the population in Asia-Pacific is moderately poor. Indicators of human development show that countries of Asia-Pacific, except for access to sanitation, are marginally inferior compared to the world average. In terms of contributions to GHGs, on an Average Asia-Pacific performs better than world as a whole (Table 2). The region fares better both in terms of per capita emissions of CO2 as well as carbon intensity of GDP. Low carbon intensity of GDP is noteworthy considering that fact that China dominates the world in manufacturing, which is typically energy intensive. Low per capita emissions are mainly due to large scale modern energy (mostly fossil fuel based) deprivation prevailing in the region. Overall, the comparison of indicators of energy, economic and human development suggests that the countries of Asia-Pacific need to perform a lot to reach the global average levels. Only solace is the performance on the climate change contribution front. However, in the process of achieving the development targets it is natural to expect worsening of the climate change performance. In other words, carbon emissions are bound to rise. However, the global priorities are towards reducing the carbon emissions and there is insistence for the involvement of major developing countries of Asia-Pacific in such efforts. In such a situation the suggested alternative is to adopt low carbon pathway to achieve the development targets. Thus, energy efficient technologies and processes, renewable energy sources and other non- 8 fossil fuel-based energy sources should become equally important alternatives for meeting the ever growing energy demand.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c8946d04-8669-449b-87b2-b648d8c8fa9c": {"__data__": {"id_": "c8946d04-8669-449b-87b2-b648d8c8fa9c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b226055cbc4cec299af15229f3e9e7a7577b9e9a3109f063173dd69e8485353"}, "2": {"node_id": "d543b641-c5da-4e78-b443-0ebc1a6e8efb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2ac1a89d3e6805f6376605e857d8d3c6a0235c610e0a95958ff591a4d8972a19"}}, "hash": "390aaf7da3ad9d9b3e6a911b480171d76d77a322016aad314291c8da9a68997e", "text": "Table 2: Developing Asia-Pacific in the global context \u2013 Comparing indicators Indicators Asia- Pacific World Share (%) Ratio of World to the Asia-Pacific Population in 2007 (Million) 3,509 6,614 53.05 1.88 Per capita Energy Consumption (GJ) Primary Energy 40.3 76.4 1.89 Electricity 4.57 11.66 2.55 Wood Fuel 2.22 2.84 1.28 Household electricity 0.73 2.49 3.41 Energy/GDP ( in '000 GJ; 2005 PPP$) 10.5 7.8 0.74 Energy Supply and Demand Gross electricity production in 2007 (TWh) 4,969 19,855 25.02 4.00 Primary Energy Production in 2007 (MTOE) 3,045 11,974 25.43 3.93 Primary Energy Consumption in 2007 (MTOE) 3,133 12,137 25.81 3.87 Production-Consumption Ratio 0.97 0.99 1.02 Share of fossil energy in primary energy supply (%) 64.9 79.0 1.22 Share of renewable energy in primary energy supply (%) 34.8 21.0 0.60 Indicators of Economic Development GDP Per capita in 2008 (2005 PPP$) 3,172 9,634 3.04 % Population living below $1.25 (2005 PPP) 23.5 26.2 1.11 % Population living below $2.0 (2005 PPP) 51.8 40.0 0.77 Indicators of Human Development Human Development Index (HDI) Value 0.564 0.624 1.11 Gender Inequality Index (GII) 0.637 0.560 0.88 Non-income HDI value 0.633 0.663 1.05 Life expectancy at birth in 2010 (years) 67.9 69.3 1.02 Mean years of schooling in 2010 (years) 6.6 7.4 1.11 Population with access to Water (%) 83 87 1.05 Population with access to Sanitation (%) 65 62 0.96 Indicators of Climate Change CO2 Emissions from the Consumption of Energy (Million Tonne) 9,378 29,784 31.49 3.18 CO2 emissions (tCO2/capita) 2.67 4.50 1.68 Carbon Intensity using (tCO2/'000 2005 PPP$) 0.37 0.46 1.26 Source: Estimated based on ADB 2010a, EIA 2010, UNDP 2010b, UNESCAP 2010a, UN Data 2010, Nation Master 2011 Most discouraging fact is the extent of energy deprivations prevailing in the developing countries of Asia-Pacific.

With about 61% of the world rural population living in Asia-Pacific, the burden of energy deprivation in terms of lack of access to modern fuels for cooking is more than its share of rural population. However, with 55% of the world rural population lacking access to electricity belonging to Asia-Pacific, which is less than its share of rural population, the performance of Asia-Pacific could be said better than the world performance in expanding electricity access. Figure 1: Asia-Pacific region has higher energy deprivation Source: Based on WHO 2010a, UNESCAP 2010a 1-4. Energy Access \u2013 Concept and Definition Energy access is a term mostly used in the context of describing the energy use pattern of poor people in the world (Sagar 2005, IEA 2010b, UNDP-WHO 2009). It basically means extent of access these poor people have to the energy end-use services delivered by the modern energy carriers like electricity, petroleum products and modern biofuel. The typical energy end-uses considered for determining access levels are household cooking and lighting, which are treated as basic energy needs. In some cases, end-uses contributing to productive livelihoods like mechanical power are also included. Residential uses of energy are expected to positively impact the rural quality of life or improve rural living standards. Thus, access to electricity enables satisfaction of need for energy services like lighting, space cooling, information and communication and income generating livelihoods. The productive use of energy in rural areas is expected to result in increased rural productivity, greater economic growth, and a rise in rural employment, which would not only raise incomes but also reduce the migration of the rural poor to urban areas (Cabraal et al 2005). In the present context, only two residential end-uses, cooking and lighting are included for assessing the energy access levels. In the present study, the modern energy carriers considered for cooking are liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), kerosene, cattle dung or soft biomass based biogas and 10 electricity, and that for lighting it is electricity. In general, energy access does not mean just a physical access to the energy carrier, it is beyond that. We have made an attempt here to present a broader concept of energy access (Balachandra, 2011a). Conceptually energy access means that modern energy services should be physically accessible and available to the people, should be of acceptable quality, reliability and preference, should be affordable in terms of low capital and operating cost, and also in the context of income levels, and finally it should be adequate in terms of abundance. In the case of electricity access for lighting and other end-uses, for example, mere extending the electricity grid to the village and connecting the household to the grid alone do not ensure \u201cEnergy Access\u201d as defined above. Opening a LPG agency in the village, installing biogas plants and having a PDS kerosene shop alone do not ensure access to modern cooking fuels. Only when it conforms to above conditions and provides modern energy-based end-use services for meeting the basic and livelihood needs for all, one could say that the goal of energy access is achieved. Thus, lack of energy access could be due to any of the following reasons: \uf0b7 Lack of physical access because the villages remain un-electrified or the house is not connected to the grid in an electrified village or the building/house is unfit for electricity connection. In the case of cooking energy, lack of access could be due to absence of LPG or PDS kerosene outlets in the vicinity or lack of biogas plants or other decentralized energy systems in the village. Lack of motorable roads for transporting cooking fuels is another reason for not having physical access. \uf0b7 Lack of physical availability because of no locally available energy resources to produce required energy carriers, lack of adequate generation and supply capacity resulting in power blackouts, power cuts and load shedding, diversion of energy carriers to other sectors or un-intended end-uses, stock-outs, non-availability of skilled human resources for operation and maintenance and repairs, \uf0b7 Lack of acceptability due to low quality of electricity supply with frequent interruptions, and voltage fluctuations.

Energy Supply and Consumption in Asia-Pacific: An Overview The energy scene in the Asia-Pacific region is dominated by the supply and use of fossil fuels with a share of around 85%. In fact, the fossil fuel share in total primary energy supply has gone up from 84.4% in 1990 to 85.5% in 2006. Figure 2 shows the source composition of primary energy supply in the Asia-Pacific region2 for the selected years during the last 16 years (ADB 2009c). The analysis of the trend suggests that the total primary energy supply has grown at an annual rate of 4.1% to reach a level of 4,007 MTOE in 2006 from 2,095 MTOE in 1990. Geothermal energy experienced the highest growth rate of 5.3% followed by coal at 4.9%. It is disheartening to note that the share of renewable energy sources in primary energy supply has declined from about 12% in 1990 to 10.8% in 2006. The analysis of the data for 2006 shows that coal with a share of about 45%, oil with a share of 29% and gas with a share of 11.4% are the dominant fuels in the total primary energy supply. It is crucial to note that the share of coal in primary energy supply has increased from 40% in 1990 to 45.1% in 2006 indicating increasing reliance on coal has a primary fuel for driving economic growth. Both China and India are the major coal consumers mainly for power generation. This trend requires to be reversed if climate change issues need to be addressed. Figure 2: Fuel-wise trends in primary energy supply (MTOE) in Asia-Pacific Source: Based on ADB 2009c The trends in sector-wise final energy consumption in the Asia-Pacific region are shown in Figure 3. A detailed analysis of the data suggests that the final energy consumption in the commercial sector is growing at the rate of 5%, which is highest compared to other sectors. Transport sector at 4% is placed second. The energy consumption in both the industrial and residential sectors is growing at slower rates at 2.8% and 2.4% respectively. The share of 2 In this particular analysis (discussed in section 2), the Asia-Pacific region is as defined by the ADB classification, which includes the developed and developing countries of the region as well as those from the central Asia, and excludes Iran. However, in the cases of all the remaining analyses, only the developing countries of the Asia-Pacific region are considered, which include Iran but exclude countries of the central Asian region. 12 industrial sector in total final energy consumption has in fact declined from 44.6% in 1990 to 41.9% in 2006. The decline may be mainly due to improvements in energy use efficiencies in the industrial sector resulting in reduced energy intensities. Two sectors, namely transport and commercial, experienced increase in the shares of final energy consumption during this period. Figure 3: Sector-wise trends in final energy consumption (MTOE) in Asia-Pacific Source: Based on ADB 2009c Among the energy carriers, oil has the dominant share in the total final energy consumption in the Asia-Pacific (Figure 4). The final energy consumption accounts for only the direct energy consumption. For example, coal and gas used for power generation is accounted under electricity. The trends for the last 16 years suggest that the direct consumption of coal is growing merely at 0.6% whereas electricity consumption at 5.5%, gas at 4.3% and oil at 3.7% are showing relatively high growth rates. Deeper analysis of the data shows that the share of coal in total final energy consumption has declined sharply from 30.5% in 1990 to 20.1% in 2006. On the other hand the share of electricity consumption has increased from 12.8% to 18.3% during the same period, oil consumption from 35.4% to 38.4% and gas from 7.1% to 8.5%. This indicates that the dirtier coal as a main fuel is slowly getting replaced by other cleaner fuels. However, it is important to note, from the previous analysis that though the direct use of coal is declining its use in power generation is increasing rapidly", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d2ca7799-1a48-4ad1-91a4-c977dd31919a": {"__data__": {"id_": "d2ca7799-1a48-4ad1-91a4-c977dd31919a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "476c38f8574fe13bd76725060fbb12cf84d3513f4e4db8e56c48b2b37f8b8a74"}, "3": {"node_id": "7dbe59ca-7124-4004-a9ae-fc31b31072c6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "938bafaddeb05c55d33606d2ffba5f99984f6b5d99ed23c8be3b4b691ccec86a"}}, "hash": "fe893157a9749ee1266bcc996274a79de8bc0cf6805eef2bea3b595448bf9430", "text": "in the Asia- Pacific region. 13 Figure 4: Source-wise trends in final energy consumption in Asia-Pacific Source: Based on ADB 2009c The summary of the status of energy production and consumption for the selected developing countries of Asia-Pacific is given in Table 3. We may observe from the table that the developing countries of Asia-Pacific together account for about 25% of the gross electricity as well as the primary energy produced in the world whereas the primary consumption is about 26% of the world consumption. Another interesting aspect is that nearly 35% of the primary energy supply in Asia and the Pacific is provided by the renewable sources of energy whereas this is just 21% for the world as a whole. This high share may be mainly due to the inclusion of traditional biomass in the total primary energy supply. China is the dominant energy producer as well as the consumer in Asia-Pacific accounting for 66% of the electricity production, 59% of primary energy production and 63% of the primary energy consumption. India is a distant second in all these aspects. Energy supplies appear to be environmentally sustainable in countries like Nepal and Cambodia, and to a certain extent in Sri Lanka and Vietnam with a dominant share by renewable energy sources. However, it is important to verify how much of this is accounted by the traditional biomass sources, which are typically used inefficiently. Higher values of ratio of production to consumption indicate the extent of a country\u2019s dependency on its own resources for energy supply. Countries like Indonesia, Malaysia and to a certain extent Vietnam are relatively more energy secure with ratios of above one. However, countries such as Cambodia, Sri Lanka, and Pacific Island countries, Solomon Island, Tonga and Vanuatu are highly vulnerable with mostly depending on energy imports for their commercial energy needs. 14 Table 3: Status of energy production and consumption in 2007 Country Gross electricity production (GWh)* Primary Energy Production (MTOE)@ Primary Energy Consumption (MTOE)@ Production- Consumption Ratio Primary Energy Supply (MTOE)* Share in primary energy supply (%)$ Fossil fuel Renewable Bangladesh 24,378 15.44 20.22 0.76 25.8 66.2 33.8 Cambodia 1,349 0.014 1.66 0.01 5.1 29.1 70.6 China 3,279,233 1803.1 1965.6 0.92 1,955.8 86.9 12.3 India 803,409 329.8 475.0 0.69 594.9 70.0 29.2 Indonesia 142,236 292.6 142.0 2.06 190.6 68.8 31.2 Malaysia 101,325 88.7 58.6 1.51 72.6 95.2 4.7 Mongolia 3,833 2.10 2.21 0.95 3.1 96.0 3.4 Nepal 2,806 0.74 1.85 0.40 9.6 10.7 89.2 Philippines 59,611 12.97 32.8 0.40 40.0 57.0 43.0 Solomon Islands 73 0.000 0.076 0.00 0.086 Sri Lanka 9,901 0.97 5.60 0.17 9.3 45.5 54.5 Thailand 143,378 47.24 97.4 0.49 104.0 81.2 18.5 Tonga 52 0.000 0.064 0.00 0.064 Vanuatu 42 0.000 0.040 0.00 0.051 Viet Nam 69,487 36.01 35.0 1.03 55.8 51.4 48.6 Asia-Pacific 4,968,647 3,045 3,133 0.97 3,329 64.9 34.8 World 19,854,871 11,974 12,137 0.99 12,029 79.0 21.0 Source: *UNESCAP 2010a, @EIA 2010, $UNDP 2010b, UNESCAP 2008, The data on final energy consumption again suggests that China accounts for more than 55% of that consumed by the whole of Asia and the Pacific (Table 4). This is more than proportionate to its population share which is nearly 38%.

Among these developing countries, the countries with higher industrial energy shares appear to be economically more developed compared those having higher residential energy shares. Comparatively countries like Malaysia and China are better performing than Nepal and Cambodia. The industrial energy consumption contributes to economic development through the production of goods and services. The industrial sector in Asia-Pacific as a whole accounts for 38.3% of the final energy consumption, which is higher than the 27.5% observed for the global average. Similarly, the share of residential sector is also higher in Asia-Pacific at about 31% compared to about 23% in the case of world as a whole. The higher share of traditional fuel in residential energy consumption in the case of Asia-Pacific may be the reason for such a difference. This is indicated by the significant consumption of wood fuel, which predominantly happens in the residential sector (Table 4). 15 Table 4: Final energy consumption and its distribution in 2007 Country Final Energy consumption ('000 TOE)* Sectoral share in total final energy consumption (%)* Wood fuel Consumption ('000 M3)$ Industry Transport Residential Others Bangladesh 19,899 15.0", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2a8f9c8b-7a33-4524-9b02-6976d7bcefec": {"__data__": {"id_": "2a8f9c8b-7a33-4524-9b02-6976d7bcefec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7146f4946555d6bebe6242ef134f1c1e4a29bdaa8bd92a027e9cc5acb0911444"}, "3": {"node_id": "5c071df6-0b0d-49da-b045-8764307e4752", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5bbdcb179023dd34496c19d8958f135096cbe6c5166982bde5d3ab560d975791"}}, "hash": "ac3d1d84e0e03ef38242029b858aece4033bb2a04eea1d86ad3c9d4a965c34cb", "text": "8.2 58.1 18.7 27,662 Cambodia 4,592 1.7 8.5 86.5 3.3 9,221 China 1,248,225 45.9 11.1 25.3 17.7 207,251 India 392,905 29.0 10.4 41.4 19.1 305,485 Indonesia 145,109 32.6 16.8 39.0 11.7 82,194 Malaysia 43,400 44.3 31.2 9.3 15.2 3,068 Mongolia 2,207 34.3 24.1 26.1 15.4 621 Nepal 9,470 4.6 3.1 89.6 2.7 12,692 Philippines 22,870 23.6 37.9 27.7 10.9 12,950 Solomon Islands 122 Sri Lanka 8,317 25.4 25.7 41.5 7.5 5,584 Thailand 69,645 33.3 26.1 15.2 25.3 19,866 Tonga 2 Vanuatu 42 Viet Nam 48,538 21.3 16.2 56.6 6.0 26,350 Asia-Pacific 2,258,638 38.3 13.5 31.0 17.2 750,371 World 8,286,068 27.5 27.7 23.4 21.4 1,920,253 Source: *UNESCAP 2010a, $Gumartini 2009 The estimates of per capita energy consumption given in Table 5 show varied levels energy development across the countries of Asia-Pacific. Only Malaysia enjoys higher per capita primary energy consumption compared to the global average. This is true even for electricity consumption. Countries from South Asia have the lowest energy consumption per capita indicating large-scale energy deprivation. They have per capita energy consumption levels, both primary energy and electricity, lower than that observed for the sub-Saharan Africa. The people of Bangladesh and Nepal are deprived of the most modern and versatile energy carrier electricity. The four of the five least developed countries (LDCs) chosen for analysis such as Solomon Islands, Nepal, Cambodia and Bangladesh have the least per capita household electricity consumption levels. Only exception is Vanuatu. This indicates the close association between income and energy poverty. All these four countries have higher per capita wood fuel consumption indicating high dependency on traditional fuel which is mostly available free of cost. The energy intensity of GDP, a measure of energy efficiency of the economy, is low for all the Pacific Island countries. The reason could be that the major share of GDP coming from the non-manufacturing sectors like agriculture, forestry, etc. Both Nepal and Cambodia have high energy intensities, which are detrimental to sustainable development considering that they are LDCs. Asia-Pacific as a whole is relatively energy inefficient in relation to the World average; however, its performance is better than sub- Saharan Africa (Table 5). 16 Table 5: Energy consumption indicators in 2007 Country Per capita Energy Consumption Energy consumption per unit of GDP (kgoe/'000; 2005 PPP $)** Primary Energy (kgoe)# Electricity (kWh)@ Wood Fuel (m3/year)* Household electricity consumption (kWh)$ Bangladesh 163 144 0.32 60 139 Cambodia 358 94 0.66 43 209 China 1484 2332 0.16 273 292 India 529 542 0.27 104 203 Indonesia 849 566 0.36 211 241 Malaysia 2733 3667 0.12 700 214 Mongolia 1182 1138 0.24 316 387 Nepal 338 80 0.47 30 343 Philippines 451 586 0.15 185 141 Solomon Islands 124 0.26 22 58 Sri Lanka 464 417 0.29 160 116 Thailand 1553 2055 0.32 419 212 Tonga 459 0.02 104 Vanuatu 186 0.2 213 42 Viet Nam 655 728 0.31 273 267 Asia-Pacific 960 1271 0.22 203 250 Sub-Saharan Africa 662 550 0.77 312 World 1819 3240 0.29 693 186 Source: *Gumartini 2009, $UNESCAP 2010a, #World Bank 2010, @ADB 2010a, **EIA 2010, Nation Master 2011 The summary of the past and future trends in primary energy demand for the selected countries as well as for the Asia-Pacific region is presented in Table 6 (ADB 2009b).

Energy Access Status and Sources of Energy for Poor 3-1. Status of Energy Access As stated earlier, the most important indicators of energy poverty are the extent of access the population has to electricity and modern fuels for cooking. Table 6 contains details of the status for the region as a whole as well as for the selected countries where as the Figure 2 shows the access status for all the developing countries of the region. The status in Asia- Pacific suggest that as a whole about 77% of the population had access to electricity as against the world average of about 78% (Table 7). This compares very favourably with the 26% access level observed in the case of sub-Saharan Africa. However, the region has countries like Papua New Guinea, Myanmar, Afghanistan, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Timor-Leste, Cambodia and Korea, DPR where the electricity access levels are lower than that is observed in sub-Saharan Africa (Figure 5). In the region, countries such as Malaysia, China and Thailand have almost achieved universal access to electricity. The estimates suggest that the lack of electricity access is a serious issue in the rural region of the Asia-Pacific. The urban region with electricity access levels of almost 94% is almost on the verge of achieving universal access. In the Asia-Pacific region, 20 of the 33 countries for which data is available have achieved urban electricity access levels of 90% or more. However, still 43% of the rural population does not have access to electricity in the region and this compares favourably with the 89% of the rural population not having electricity access in sub-Saharan Africa. Low access levels are mostly prevailing in LDCs with Myanmar, Korea, DPR, Afghanistan and Cambodia having provided electricity access to less than 12% of its rural population.

India with about 400 million people without access to electricity takes the lead position. The poor people without access to electricity rely mostly on kerosene for lighting. Other choices available for the poor are either to live in dark or depend on vegetable oils, candles and firewood. The status of access to modern fuels for cooking is far worse than that for electricity access for lighting and other end-uses (Table 7 and Figure 5). About 44% of the population of the Asia-Pacific region had access to modern fuels like LPG, electricity, kerosene, natural gas, and biogas for cooking in 2007 compared to 53% in the world and just 17% in sub-Saharan Africa. As in the case of electricity access, there are significant variations across countries in providing access to modern fuels. Out of the 34 countries in the region, 8 have access levels lower than that in sub-Saharan Africa and another 8 have access levels of more than 80%. Surprisingly, out of these 8 countries with more than 80% of the people having access to modern fuels 6 belong to small island countries (SIDs) (Figure 5). Even China, which has achieved spectacular success in providing access to electricity for 99.4% of its population, has failed to achieve similar progress with access to modern cooking fuels with only 52% of 19 population having access. The urban-rural comparisons suggest that a significant majority of the people using modern fuels for cooking belong to urban areas. About 74% of the urban population in Asia-Pacific use modern fuels for cooking whereas only 19% of the rural population has access to modern fuels (Table 7). These shares are comparable to the world averages and significantly better than sub-Saharan Africa.

Out of a 20 total population of 3,109 million relying on solid fuels in the world about 2,280 million belong to Asia-Pacific and about 662 million to sub-Saharan Africa. India with about 801 million and China with 765 million are two countries with largest number of people without access to modern fuels. As in the case of electricity access, south-Asian region with about 1,119 million people (accounting for 49% of the population without modern fuel access in Asia-Pacific) using solid fuels has the highest number of deprived people. Table 8 contains details of the shares of households using different fuels for cooking in the selected countries of Asia-Pacific. Except for few countries wood is the dominant fuel on which majority of the households depends for their cooking energy needs. Almost 96% of the Malaysian households use LPG for their cooking needs. Kerosene is the second most dominant fuel for cooking in Indonesia (Table 8). Significant share of households in Mongolia and Cambodia rely on electricity for cooking. Solomon Islands is the only country in the region which depends on Charcoal for cooking. China and Mongolia depend on coal for meeting significant share of cooking energy requirements. All the major developing countries of the region have diversified into different types of fuel for cooking. The pattern of cooking energy use suggests that it is quite varied and mostly relying on conventional fuels. It appears from the above analysis that, in terms of prioritizing global efforts in providing universal access to modern energy carriers, the focus should be on the south-Asian region. This region has the highest number of energy poor population in the world with about 1,119 million lacking access to modern fuels for cooking and about 605 million people living without electricity. Any action on mitigating the impacts of climate change or building resilience to adapt to climate change cannot ignore such a large population deprived of modern energy and living in poverty. Among the population relying on solid fuels for cooking a significant proportion use improved cooking stoves. The estimates suggest that about 30% of the population relying on solid fuels for cooking use improved cookstoves (Table 9). In the rural regions of the Asia- Pacific, about one-third of the people relying on solid fuels use modern cookstoves.

Sources of Energy for Poor The poor households in the developing countries of Asia and the Pacific mostly depend on various kinds of solid fuels as main sources of energy for their day-to-day cooking and heating needs. A minority of relatively high income earning households use LPG, electricity and kerosene as main energy carriers. This situation is more prevalent in the industrialized countries like Malaysia and Thailand, where these energy carriers have a major share. Electricity is mainly used for lighting in addition to other end-uses like audio/video, space cooling, etc. Table 10 contains the details of the quantity of various energy carriers consumed by the households in 2005. Because of their sheer population size and inadequate access to modern cooking fuels, both India and China consume large quantity of fuel wood. In addition, India consumes other types of biomass like cattle dung and agro-waste. A significant share of rural population in China depends on coal for meeting their cooking and heating energy needs. Use of cattle dung for energy purpose mainly prevails in the countries of south Asia. India and Indonesia are the major consumers of Kerosene. In rural India, kerosene is mostly used for lighting. To assess the significance of various types of fuels consumed by the households, especially the poor households, the quantum of consumption given in individual units", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f5e24982-49a0-4aee-aee2-57fd5a0715a4": {"__data__": {"id_": "f5e24982-49a0-4aee-aee2-57fd5a0715a4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aef8cf8cfa9e0690dad740f117dedab7f4a50a96d4a6df5e3dc1605787604d0d"}, "3": {"node_id": "5e87dbec-f8a7-4c54-82ed-76c572e55b5e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1ea399a98d4d6695a8d4634daa7d385ea7e7383a124bd89730520ff1176f7bc4"}}, "hash": "4ecaef6023f72e98ba5109e31128c793a35cd559a001c6c5ed993b2306e0b0a4", "text": "(Table 10) have been converted into common unit (TJ) and presented in Table 11. The quantities of different types of fuels are comparable only in terms of energy inputs to the end-use devices and the actual useful energy derived will vary according their efficiency of use. In total, the 23 households of Asia-Pacific region consumed about 18,503 PJ of energy in 2005. Out of this, about 63% share is accounted by the solid fuels and the remaining by modern fuels. Wood with about 42% share occupies the top position and electricity with nearly 14% share is a distant second. In poorer countries like Cambodia and Nepal, the solid fuels account for over 90% of the household energy consumption (Table 11). Among the selected countries, the households of Mongolia and Solomon Islands again depend on solid fuels with around 85% share. India is not far behind these countries with about 78% of household energy coming from solid fuels. This indicates seriousness of energy deprivation in these countries and low efficiency levels with which the solid fuel is being used. It is interesting to note that the households of both China and India consume same amount of energy with a share of about 32% each in the total household energy consumption in the Asia-Pacific. Together these two countries account for almost 65% of the total household energy consumption in the Asia-Pacific, which is reasonable considering that they account for nearly 70% of the population. The unfortunate aspect is that most of this energy is derived from the conventional solid fuels. In summary, the earlier analysis suggests that in the Asia-Pacific region nearly 52% of the population is poor (surviving on less than $2.00 a day). This includes the 24% of the extremely poor population surviving on less than $1.25 a day. Further, in Asia-Pacific 56% of the population use solid fuels for meeting their cooking and heating needs and 23% lack electricity access. A simple hypothesis based on comparing these figures suggest that the poor in Asia-Pacific use solid fuels for cooking and the extremely poor do not have access to electricity. Thus, poverty appears to be most important cause as well as an outcome of lack of access to modern energy. The subsequent sections elaborate on these aspects by empirically showing the relationship between poverty and energy access, and possible implications of these on socio-economic, human and environmental systems. 3-3. Implications of Household Energy Consumption for Climate Change Dependency on traditional fuels has implications for both local and global pollution. Emissions from burning solid fuels in open fires and traditional stoves also have significant global warming effects, due to incomplete combustion of fuel carbon (UNDP-WHO 2009, Smith et al. 2000). In reality, however, household energy consumption has never been the focus for climate change mitigation related interventions. This is because most solid fuels (excluding coal) are considered renewable with zero net addition of CO2 to the atmosphere. The underlying assumption is that most of the energy consumed is for cooking or heating and this is mostly derived from renewably harvested fuel wood or agricultural waste, which are considered carbon neutral. This reliance by the households on the so-called \u2018climate- friendly\u2019 biomass energy sources combined with their low levels of energy use has resulted in a lack of motivation for policy-makers and NGOs to focus on household energy use in the context of climate change (Sagar 2005). However, if the wood burned is not replaced with new plant growth, then a net addition of CO2 to the atmosphere does occur (Sagar 2005, Bond et al. 2004). It is agreeable that all the cattle dung, crop waste and a large share of fuel wood is harvested on a sustainable basis and the carbon is recycled within a short period compared with climate change processes (Smith et al. 2000). Earlier studies have reported that on an average, in India, 40% of the fuel wood is typically obtained from unsustainable means in the sense that it is not from renewable biomass source (Parikh and Reddy 1997).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"},

Source: Nation Master 2011, FAO 2010 26 It has also been shown that inefficient combustion of traditional biomass fuels in cookstoves yields significant gaseous products of incomplete combustion (PICs) that are GHGs (Smith et al., 2000). This incomplete combustion results in emission of black carbon, which is a potent GHG. Another contribution of household fuels is emissions of light-absorbing carbon particles known as black carbon and of the gases that form ozone. Together, the warming effect is around 40 to 70% of that of CO2 (Wallack and Ramanathan 2009). According to the authors, limiting their presence in the atmosphere is an easier, cheaper, and more politically feasible proposition than the most popular proposals for slowing climate change. Thus, black carbon from biomass combustion and access to modern energy services, have implications for climate change mitigation and adaptation respectively (Johnson and Lambe 2009). Household sector is considered as one of the major contributors of black carbon (BC), which contributes to global warming. It has been estimated that the global warming effect of black carbon is equal to 20 to 50% of the effect of CO2 (Wallack and Ramanathan 2009). In other words, it is in general agreed that about 10-20% of the gross warming is due to black carbon (Baron et al, 2009) compared to about 40% by CO2. Approximately, the residential sector is contributing 18% to 25% of the black carbon in the world (Baron et al. 2009, Smith 2009). In addition to all these, the biomass combustion in cook stoves emits other GHGs like CH4 and N2O. For example, in India, cattle dung is first converted into cakes (mixing the wet dung and loose biomass from crop waste) and dried sufficiently before being used in conventional stoves for cooking. This open exposure of cattle dung results in release of CH4 to the atmosphere. The experiments reveal that from one tonne of dung about 26% of gas potential is released", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9391f63c-6146-46d8-be12-9fb66106c5eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "9391f63c-6146-46d8-be12-9fb66106c5eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c4ae1031cd6a5009b52a7ee865dd74a5deb591ff296f6731a20501c03153f267"}, "3": {"node_id": "67d010f6-298f-4c89-b2b1-ef5645486121", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7ed3e79e1141dffe863d08f04b1a0b302b01cecb9dec7c0d022ff650264b83f3"}}, "hash": "a2d4b5e0d6a7875e2adec0faaf05be5a3fb79871941e38e50b5d0017ce23672b", "text": "when it is stored untreated in pits for a week to 10 days and when drying is slow. Thus, out of the gas potential of 45m3 /tonne dung, 25.73% = 11.58 m3 of biogas with 60% methane (6.95 m3 or 4.96 kg of CH4) is wasted to the atmosphere. This is equal to about 104 kg CO2 equivalent per tonne of cattle dung (Chanakya and Balachandra 2010). Same emission factor is used for other countries where cattle dung is used for cooking. In addition to biomass, the households also use LPG, kerosene, natural gas and coal for meeting their cooking and heating needs. Similarly, these households use electricity and kerosene for lighting purpose. Electricity is also used for many other end-uses. Thus, total emissions of GHG from all these energy carriers are likely to be significant. In this study an attempt has been made to estimate the GHG as well as black carbon emissions from the household energy use given in Table 8. For this purpose, the emission factors of various types of pollutants are obtained or derived from various secondary sources (Balachandra 2010, Smith et al. 2000; Chanakya and Balachandra 2010, EIA 2007, Venkataraman et al. 2005, Baron et al. 2009, Herold 2003). The emission factors, thus obtained, are given in Table 12 for all the energy carriers that are being used by the households in the Asia-Pacific. As explained above, if the firewood supply is assumed to be obtained from unsustainable sources then the CO2 has to be fully accounted and it will be zero if the wood is sourced from sustainable sources. Thus, we have two emission factors for firewood, one for sustainable firewood and second one for un-sustainable firewood. The emission factor for sustainable firewood includes emissions of CH4 and N2O whereas that for un-sustainable firewood includes emission of CO2 in addition to CH4 and N2O. The emission factor for agro-waste includes just emissions of CH4 and N2O. In the case of cattle dung, the CH4 emission from dung storage is included in addition to CH4 and N2O released during combustion for estimating the emission factor. All the GHG emission factors are in terms of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) and include emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O (Table 12). 27 Table 12: Emission factors for household energy carriers Fuels GHG emissions Black Carbon (gBC/kg) gCO2e/kg gCO2e/MJ Sustainable firewood 142.9 9.5 0.51 Un-sustainable firewood 1536.2 101.7 Cattle Dung 218.9 18.6 0.13 Agro-waste 114.9 8.8 0.58 Kerosene 3047.6 70.7 0.15 LPG 3091.6 67.4 0.01 Electricity (gCO2/kWh) 827.0 229.7 \u2014 Coal 1800.0 90.1 8.00 Natural Gas (kgCO2/M3) 1.57 56.1 \u2014 Charcoal 3449.6 112 0.20 Source: Based on Balachandra 2010, EIA 2007, Venkataraman et al. 2005, Smith et al. 2000, Chanakya and Balachandra 2010, Baron et al. 2009, Herold 2003 Note: \u201c\u2014\u201d indicates not applicable The estimated total GHG emissions from household fuel use for the selected countries of Asia-Pacific as well as for the whole region are given in Table 13. Two sets of estimations of GHG emissions from wood are made, one with an assumption that all the wood is from sustainable sources and the second one assumes all the wood is from un-sustainable sources. The actual emissions would be somewhere in between the two extremes. Thus, the total GHG emission from the household fuel use in the Asia-Pacific is expected to be in the range of 1,135 million tonne of CO2e to 1,853 million tonne of CO2e depending how the wood is sourced.

Thus, expanding access to modern fuel for cooking has dual benefits \u2013 better life for the poor and high climate change mitigation potential. 28 Table 13: CO2e emissions from household energy consumption in 2005 ('000 tonne) Country Coal Charcoal Sustainable Wood Un- sustainable wood Dung Electricity LPG Kerosene Natural Gas Other biomass & wastes Total with Sustainable wood (Million tonne) Share (%) Total with Un- sustainable wood (Million tonne) Share (%) Bangladesh 0 0 2,565 27,579 507 7,828 61 2,146 4,218 942 18.27 1.61 43.28 2.34 Cambodia 0 0 855 9,193 2 514 0 128 0 0 1.50 0.13 9.84 0.53 China 157,302 0 19,218 206,632 0 297,636 40,774 774 16,603 0 532.31 46.89 719.72 38.84 India 630 0 28,328 304,572 10,202 96,741 30,230 28,577 1,481 10,335 206.52 18.19 482.77 26.05 Indonesia 0 1,852 7,622 81,948 0 39,372 2,289 24,634 41 0 75.81 6.68 150.14 8.10 Malaysia 0 0 284 3,059 0 15,370 2,064 153 12 0 17.88 1.58 20.66 1.11 Mongolia 146 0 58 619 78 514 0 0 0 0 0.80 0.07 1.36 0.07 Nepal 0 0 1,177 12,654 246 697 107 792 0 189 3.21 0.28 14.69 0.79 Papua New Guinea 0 0 70 752 0 994 0 67 0 0 1.13 0.10 1.81 0.10 Philippines 0 0 1,201 12,911 0 13,573 2,038 677 0 0 17.49 1.54 29.20 1.58 Solomon Islands 0 0 11 122 0 9 3 6 0 0 0.03 0.003 0.14 0.01 Sri Lanka 0 0 518 5,567 0 2,648 347 619 0 0 4.13 0.36 9.18 0.50 Thailand 0 13,616 1,842 19,807 0 23,209 5,079 21 0 0 43.77 3.86 61.73 3.33 Tonga 0 0 0 2 0 3 9 0 0 0.01 0.001 0.01 0.001 Vanuatu 0 0 4 42 0 40 3 0 0 0.05 0.004 0.08 0.005 Viet Nam 2,767 2,177 2,443 26,271 0 19,226 1,608 427 0 0 28.65 2.52 52.47 2.83 Asia- Pacific 160,844 17,978 73,607 791,404 11,702 588,263 92,670 77,090 101,507 11,616 1,135.3 100 1,853.1 100 Share (%) 14.17 1.58 6.48 0 1.03 51.82 8.16 6.79 8.94 1.02 100 Share (%) 8.68 0.97 0 42.71 0.63 31.75 5.00 4.16 5.48 0.63 100 Source: Author\u2019s calculations based on Table 10 and Table 12 29 Table 14: Black carbon emissions from household energy consumption in 2005 (tonne) Country Coal Charcoal Wood Dung LPG Kerosene Other biomass & wastes Total Share (%) Bangladesh 0 0 9,217 301 0 84 4,755 14,358 1.37 Cambodia 0 0 3,072 1 0 5 0 3,079 0.29 China 699,120 0 69,056 0 133 30 0 768,339 73.22 India 2,800 0 101,788 6,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6a1e2520-8c49-4ade-b49c-b52701fe2e72": {"__data__": {"id_": "6a1e2520-8c49-4ade-b49c-b52701fe2e72", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "69e24cc20499a48dac06d3af66c92a3e64ee1cd1a5ab72cac27c4d259cc0aa71"}, "2": {"node_id": "2e0a7d5b-2ce2-4403-a4fc-7abb5d61cd3f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4a2dcd5baa3f54f3e2a25d1bc54de12793322042cb80ddd1df7ac3afdee1dc85"}}, "hash": "bc56b3a4e3105e362b5a5340f853cdbf55d25cc34e80af30e433af7d9fcddfb1", "text": "339 73.22 India 2,800 0 101,788 6,059 99 1,125 52,171 164,041 15.63 Indonesia 0 107 27,387 0 7 970 0 28,472 2.71 Malaysia 0 0 1,022 0 7 6 0 1,035 0.10 Mongolia 648 0 207 46 0 0 0 901 0.09 Nepal 0 0 4,229 146 0 31 953 5,360 0.51 Papua New Guinea 0 0 251 0 0 3 0 254 0.02 Philippines 0 0 4,315 0 7 27 0 4,348 0.41 Solomon Islands 0 0 41 0 0 0 41 0.004 Sri Lanka 0 0 1,861 0 1 24 0 1,886 0.18 Thailand 0 789 6,619 0 17 1 0 7,426 0.71 Tonga 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0.0001 Vanuatu 0 0 14 0 0 0 0 14 0.001 Viet Nam 12,296 126 8,780 0 5 17 0 21,224 2.02 Asia-Pacific 714,864 1,042 264,486 6,950 302 3,035 58,638 1,049,317 100.00 Share (%) 68.13 0.10 25.21 0.66 0.03 0.29 5.59 100.00 Source: Author\u2019s calculations based on Table 10 and Table 12 30 3-4. Access to Modern Energy Carriers: The Rich-Poor Divide The previous discussions pointed towards the suggestion that income poor are most likely to be energy poor because of their incapability to afford highly priced modern energy carriers. The synthesis of the data suggested that the poor in Asia-Pacific use solid fuels for cooking/heating and the extremely poor live without electricity, mostly depending on kerosene or vegetable", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "33d905ca-a3b4-4070-b29b-24b1efa52977": {"__data__": {"id_": "33d905ca-a3b4-4070-b29b-24b1efa52977", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher":
