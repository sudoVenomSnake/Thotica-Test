Extent of trade According to FAO\u2019s global catch production statistics (1981-2016), total landings of Isurus oxyrinchus increased by 69% from 2004-2009 (54,155 t total in the period) to 2010-2016 (91,989 t total in the period, reported in the SS as 45,956). In the period from 2010 to 2016, the Atlantic contributed 50% of the total catches (45,956 t total for the period), the Pacific with 34% (31,838 t total) the Indian Ocean with 15% (14,043 t total) and the Mediterranean with less than 1% (152 t total). In these periods, the average catches per year were 9,025 t in the period from 2004 to 2009 and 12,141 t/year between 2010 and 2016 (calculated at 13,141 t/year for this IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 42 230 analysis). Spain, Taiwan Province of China and Portugal represent 62% of the annual catches reported to FAO between 2006 to 2016 (35%, 15% and 12% respectively). Vulnerability An ecological risk assessment (ERA) concluded that Isurus oxyrinchus was the second shark species most vulnerable to the Atlantic longline fisheries, and the most vulnerable in the Indian Ocean. In 2015, the ERA was reviewed, finding that Isurus oxyrinchus were the most vulnerable to pelagic longline fisheries in the Atlantic Ocean and are among the most vulnerable species (vulnerable to catch and mortality) from the biological point of view. The breeding areas identified to date have been the product of fishery-dependent data, which is why there is likely to be direct exploitation pressure on them. In terms of fishing gear, Isurus oxyrinchus have a post-release survival of up to 70% (depending on management and release time), higher than other shark species, making it feasible to implement measures of selective fishing management. In southeastern Australia, it was estimated that Isurus oxyrinchus caught by recreational fishermen on the southeastern coast of Australia (n = 30) had a survival rate of 90%. Inclusion in Appendix II to improve control of other listed species A) Specimens in trade resemble those of species listed in Appendix II under Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) Annex 2 a or listed in Appendix I Isurus paucus is very similar in appearance to Isurus oxyrinchus, although it has longer pectoral fins. Isurus spp. are grouped for the catch, landings and trade data, although a study differentiated the fin clips of the two species in 2017. Isurus paucus is the rarest species, its habitat and behavior are little known, but it is thought to have a more tropical distribution in oceanic waters. Of the two species, Isurus paucus is less abundant, but according to a study in 2006, most traders reported that they placed these fins on the same market category as Isurus oxyrinchus and the thresher sharks (Alopias spp. listed in Appendix II of CITES), due to its similarity in appearance and market value. The dorsal fins of Isurus oxyrinchus and Isurus paucus are similar; both are dark grayish brown, have a short free tail tip, and are very erect due to the steep angle of the anterior border. The second dorsal and anal fins are extremely small. The pectoral fins differ considerably in size between the two species (Barreto, in litt., 2019), and are shorter than the length of the head, and their ventral surface is uniform white or light in color, with no obvious dark markings. There are strong lateral keels on the caudal peduncle. The caudal fin is crescent shaped, with symmetrical upper and lower lobes. Despite the similarity it presents with Isurus paucus, the fins of Isurus oxyrinchus are easy to visually identify whether fresh or dry, since there are differences in the dermal denticles of the two species. Additionally, these two species differ in the lower jaw with 11-13 rows of teeth in Isurus paucus and over 13 rows in Isurus oxyrinchus. However, since both species are traded for the value of their meat (more than 90% of the total volume of their body), most of the volume traded will be difficult to identify.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c9053f3-4cc3-42c5-87d5-b2ebbdd12ce2": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c9053f3-4cc3-42c5-87d5-b2ebbdd12ce2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fa0ee710cbcadf3b5efb7018d4ccf40e5208b09b5d1b742c2b79077704d0469c"}, "2": {"node_id": "89aa7bf1-55e1-4c07-a4c6-cadc7589a8f0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "13cafc5718b67f12e19f5cc7e29c4528c1b286a90d3e12eaaa8aa835682aaa6a"}}, "hash": "1c9e1a01a87316d72c642eaeb12c0e1dc43b16a67acf98d645edcfae4c1418e6", "text": "Additional Information Threats As noted above, the main threat to Isurus oxyrinchus (and presumably Isurus paucus) is fishing, since it is caught as a directed and incidental catch in multispecific fisheries throughout its range, particularly in pelagic longlines, targeting tuna, billfish and swordfish in national and international waters. Isurus oxyrinchus is also a target of sport fishing in the USA, New Zealand, South Africa and some European countries.

Conservation, management and legislation National Range States have adopted a variety of national instruments, some applied through laws and regulations on fisheries and trade, others through wildlife legislation or other environmental legislation. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 42 231 International General measures across all sharks have been adopted by Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) in the form of recommendations or resolutions which contracting parties must then implement and report. Almost all have adopted a ban on the practice of finning (cutting shark fins and discarding the body at seas), and members require that their vessels do not have fins that add more than 5% of the weight of sharks on board, until the first landing point. Isurus oxyrinchus is considered a highly migratory species in Annex I (adopt measures for the conservation of species) of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and Appendix II (species conserved through agreements) of the Convention on Migratory Species. In turn, several RFMOs recommend their Parties to a number of measures such as improving data collection and having population and risk assessments. Isurus oxyrinchus is listed in Annex 3 of the Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats (species that need protection but can be exploited in exceptional cases) and is one of the 20 sharks and rays listed in the Annex II of the Protocol on Specially Protected Areas and Areas of Biological Diversity in the Mediterranean (under the Barcelona Convention). The General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) adopted the list in Recommendation GFCM / 36/2012 / 3. Likewise, the Contracting Parties and Cooperators (CPC) were requested to protect these species from fishing activities and release them. They cannot be retained on board, transshipped, disembarked, stored, exhibited or sold. The recommendation, I / OAT 17/08, requires (with some exceptions and conditions) that vessels promptly release live Isurus spp. retained in the North Atlantic; dead sharks can be preserved, and in some cases also live sharks over a minimum size. Records should be retained and sent to ICCAT, and landings should not exceed the previous average of vessels for Isurus oxyrinchus. The current measure will be evaluated and will expire on December 31, 2019. The scientific advice for this overfished stock is that harvest should not exceed an annual catch of 500 t, to stop overfishing and begin to rebuild the stock. The measures adopted will probably result in catches well above this minimum. The recommendation is oriented towards the conservation of Isurus oxyrinchus stock of the North Atlantic, considering that it is caught in association with ICCAT fisheries and presents a state of overexploitation and overfishing. In 2008, the CMS proposal to include Isurus oxyrinchus in Appendix II identified a number of national protection measures, including: incidental catch and recreational bag limits - South Africa; management under a quota system - New Zealand; regulation of fishing gear for artisanal fisheries - Chile; commercial quotas, limited entry and time closings, and recreational bag limits - United States Atlantic; closure of the directed longline fishery, recreational fishing limits in California and catch guidelines for California, Oregon and Washington - United States Pacific; COSEWIC assessment as an \"at-risk\" species, catch and incidental catch limits, license limits, fishing gear restrictions, area and season bans, single hook and recreational dump - Canadian Atlantic; limited closures of entry and time - Pacific of Canada. Potential risk(s) of a listing There is currently legislation in place in its range where population trends are declining. It is unclear whether this legislation is having a conservation benefit yet as it is difficult to assess the extent to which they are being implemented and the extent to which they are reducing declines. However, any CITES listing should be careful not to have a detrimental affect on the current legislation or be seen as replacing current legislation. References Barreto, R. (2019).

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 43 Inclusion of Guitarfish Glaucostegus spp. in Appendix II Proponents: Bangladesh, Benin, Bhutan, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Chad, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Egypt, European Union, Gabon, Gambia, Maldives, Mali, Mauritania, Monaco, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, Palau, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, Syrian Arab Republic, Togo and Ukraine Summary: Giant Guitarfish species in the family Glaucostegidae are shark-like batoid species occurring in the coastal waters of the Mediterranean and Black Sea, Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. There are six species in the family, all in the genus Glaucostegus. The majority of the species are strongly associated with soft bottom habitats in shallow (<50 m) warm-temperate to tropical coastal waters. Species in the Glaucostegidae family grow slowly, mature late, have a generation length of 10\u201315 years, and exhibit low to medium productivity with many growing larger than 2 m in total length. The global population sizes are unknown for all of the species of Glaucostegidae. There are no known stock assessments for any of the species and all information on population trends is based upon fisheries landings and inferred from fishing effort. All six species in the family have recently been assessed by IUCN as Critically Endangered with estimated declines of greater than 80% over the last three generations having occurred (accepted for publication in the July 2019 Red List update). These estimates have been based on new datasets documenting global population reductions. The primary threats to Glaucostegidae are considered to be unmanaged and unregulated fisheries. Some of the catch is targeted and incidental catch is often retained. Fishing techniques used in these coastal regions mean that species of Glaucostegidae are exposed to intensive fishing. Coastal development is also a threat to these species with human populations increasing, leading to increased fishing pressure, but also habitat degradation, threatening key habitats in the species\u2019 life cycle. Scant species-specific catch or trade data are available; information is often reported using generic terms such as \u201cguitarfish\u201d, \u201cgiant guitarfish\u201d or \u201crhinobatid\u201d, which likely also include species from other families. Glaucostegids are also known to be caught and reported alongside Rhinidae (wedgefish) species using terms such as \u201cguitarfish etc, nei\u201d. Localised landing declines have been reported, for example, in India, an 86% decline in landings reported as guitarfish and wedgefish has been observed from one landing site over a five-year period (2002\u20132006). In Iran, 66% declines in \u201cgiant guitarfish\u201d landings occurred over 20 years (1997\u20132016), while in Pakistan landings data for \u201crhinobatids\u201d at two sites showed landings decline by 72% between 1999 to 2011, and 81% between 1994 and 2011. While most of the declines have been reported for species in the Indo-West Pacific, it is highly likely that similar declines are occurring in other regions where fishing pressure is likely to be similar.

The form that species are traded in (fins, meat) makes it hard to differentiate between species within the Glaucostegidae family, often requiring genetic analyses. There is conflicting information on whether Glaucostegidae fins are morphologically similar to those from the family Rhinidae (subject to a separate listing proposal, Prop. 44) and Pristidae (listed in Appendix I in 2007except Pristis microdon which was transferred from Appendix II to I in 2013), once removed from the whole animals, particularly in the processed form. Legislation and regulation for Glaucostegidae vary by location and country; where they exist, they primarily cover a range of measures involving either the banning of commercial fishing of sharks in certain zones, size limits or banning the practice of finning. Fishing restrictions in Mauritania have apparently resulted in increases in relative abundance of Glaucostegus cemiculus. Analysis: Species of Glaucostegidae are found in coastal waters in the Mediterranean and Black Sea, Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. While their meat appears to be utilised locally, fins from these species have been observed in international trade, which is presumed to drive the retention of the species as incidental catch. In the most recent IUCN Red List assessments (to be published July 2019), all six of the species were said to have undergone declines of greater than 80% over the past three generations and therefore already meet the biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I owing to a marked recent rate of decline. Over-harvest is identified as the main factor driving these declines. Therefore, it is likely that for all of the species in this family, regulation of trade is required to ensure that harvest from the wild is not reducing populations to levels where survival might be threatened by continued harvest or other influences. Management measures have shown to be successful in restoring populations where they are implemented. Due to the difficulties in differentiating the species in the form that they are traded in, if any of the species are considered to meet the criteria then all should be listed. Other Considerations: Species of Rhinidae (subject to a separate listing proposal, Prop, 44) and Glaucostegidae are often landed and traded together. Therefore, if one of the proposals is accepted then the species in the other family should be included in Appendix II to ease implementation. Summary of Available Information Text in non-italics is based on information in the Proposal and Supporting Statement (SS); text in italics is based on additional information and/or assessment of information in the SS. Taxonomy Glaucostegidae (Giant guitarfishes) are one of five families in the Order Rhinopristiformes which is comprised of four families of \u201cguitarfishes\u201d (Rhinobatidae (guitarfishes), Rhinidae (wedgefishes), Trygonorrhinidae (banjo rays), and Glaucostegidae (giant guitarfishes)) and family Pristidae (sawfishes). There are six species in the Glaucostegidae family. Some recent changes in the systematics of the genus Rhinobatos have elevated the subgenus Glaucostegus to full generic status and placed this genus into a family of its own: Glaucostegidae (Compagno et al., 2005, Last et al., 2016). Therefore, some of the information below may be originally reported as Rhinobatos but where possible notes are provided on what was originally reported and which species it should be interpreted as. IUCN Global Category and Range The species in the Glaucostegidae family have recently been reassessed for the IUCN Red List, with new assessments being accepted for publication in the July 2019 Red List update. All species have had their Red List category changed due to new datasets documenting global population reductions in Glaucostegidae.

There are no stock assessments for any Glaucostegidae. All information on population trends centres upon fisheries landings. Population trends Both Glaucostegus cemiculus and G. granulatus populations have significantly declined, new datasets suggest that both species are likely to have decreased by >80% over the last three generations (IUCN Red List assessments, accepted for publication in the July 2019 Red List update). Historically, giant guitarfish (presumed to mean Glaucostegidae) catches have only been reported at the genus level, making it difficult to determine levels of population declines at the species-level. Glaucostegus cemiculus Atlantic Ocean In recent years, overall catches of sharks in the east Atlantic have decreased. Some species, such as sawfish, have almost completely disappeared, while formerly common species such as giant guitarfish (presumed to mean Glaucostegidae) have become very rare, indicating sharp population declines. Prior to the 1970s elasmobranchs were caught primarily for local consumption. Starting in the 1970s, in response to the high demand for shark fins in eastern and southeastern Asia (primarily China), an unsustainable shark fishing industry IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 43 237 developed and grew rapidly. Because of this new demand, in addition to being targeted for their meat, guitarfishes were targeted for their fins, which are regarded as highly valuable. This combined with an increase in coastal populations resulted in the over-exploitation of marine resources with significantly increasing fishing effort and decreasing yields beginning in the 1990s, including the overfishing of demersal species. Since 2003, there has been a significant decline in elasmobranch landings. In the sub-region, elasmobranch fishing was initially concentrated in Gambia and Senegal, but it has spread to the other member countries as fishers migrate in response to areas becoming over-exploited. Glaucostegus cemiculus used to be taken in great numbers in Senegal, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau and Sierra Leone, until increased fishing pressure on shark stocks since the 1980s depleted populations of the more susceptible species within these waters. Giant guitarfishes (presumed to mean Glaucostegidae) have almost completely disappeared from the region. In Senegal, landings have dropped by 80% in 7 years\u2014from 4,050 t in 1998 to 821 t in 2005\u2014indicating a severe drop in the population of this species. In the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) statistics, Senegal reported 171 t in 1998 and 920 t in 2005 for \u201cGuitarfishes, etc. nei\u201d from the eastern central Atlantic (FAO, 2018). It is unclear why this difference exists with the SS. Data collection in the region is poor, and much of the species\u2019 decline must be inferred from reduction in catches, particularly since fishing pressure in the region has increased as additional people have moved into coastal regions. This needs to be interpreted with the knowledge that fishing effort in the region has not decreased during this period (C. Simpfendorfer, in litt., 2019). As one of the most heavily fished coastal regions in the world, these declines in catch are a useful indicator of declining abundance (C. Simpfendorfer, in litt., 2019). There is evidence that 95% of Glaucostegus cemiculus that are caught are below their size at maturity, affecting the ability of the population to reproduce and recover. In addition, populations of G. cemiculus are suspected to decline on the basis of the severe declines in other guitarfishes and wedgefishes, the continuation of fishing pressure in shallow coastal habitats, the potential for fishing effort to shift towards the further targeting of guitarfish in light of their highly valued fins, particularly in the absence of other sharks (Notarbartolo di Sciara et al., 2016).

In a Regional Red List assessment for the Mediterranean in 2016, a projected decline of \u226550% within three generations (15\u201330 years) was suspected based on i) the disappearance of G. cemiculus from localised regions of the Mediterranean Sea; ii) severe declines in other guitarfishes (family Rhinobatidae) and wedgefishes (family Rhyncobatidae); iii) the continuation of fishing pressure in shallow coastal habitats; and iv) the potential for fishing effort further to target guitarfishes for their highly valued fins, particularly in the absence of other overfished shark species (Soldo and Bradai, 2016). Glaucostegus granulatus Arabian Sea and adjacent waters Glaucostegus granulatus is endangered in the Arabian Sea and adjacent waters region. Although it was the most commonly reported shark-like batoid in research trawl surveys in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) during 2002\u2013 2003, a 2016 trawl survey did not record any specimens. Recent estimates have put G. granulatus population declines at 50\u201380% over the past three generation periods (39 years) in the Arabian Sea. With consistent ongoing high levels of fishing pressure, especially in coastal areas, declines will most likely continue into the future (2017\u20132056) unless effective management measures are introduced. Indian Ocean Fishing efforts for shark-like batoids are particularly high in South-east Asia, where steadily decreasing population sizes have been inferred from declining catch rates. In India, a decline of 86% was noted in the landings of wedgefishes and guitarfishes, including Glaucostegidae species (Glaucostegus granulatus and G. obtusus, and likely to include G. typus and G. thouin (Kyne et al., 2019b), over the five-year period 2002\u20132007. At the species level, G. granulatus (reported as IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 43 238 Rhinobatos granulatus) landings had declined by 94% (Mohanraj et al., 2009). It should however be noted that this data is from one landing site only in Chennai and care needs to be taken extrapolating when additional data are not available. However, R. Jabado (in litt., 2019) notes that fishing pressure is intense and increasing along the whole coast of India. \u201cGiant guitarfish\u201d (a grouping which likely includes Glaucostegus granulatus and G. halavi) landings data are available from Iran for 1997\u20132016 (FAO, 2018). Landings declined by 66% over this period, which is the equivalent of 81\u201399% population reductions over the last three generations of wedgefishes and guitarfishes (30\u2013 45 years) (Kyne et al., 2019b). Landing data for the \u201crhinobatid\u201d category are available from Pakistan for 1993\u20132011 (19 years) covering the country\u2019s two coastal provinces (M. Gore, unpubl. data).

B) Regulation of trade required to ensure that harvest from the wild is not reducing population to level where survival might be threatened by continued harvest or other influences From 2004 to 2010, the number of trawlers in the Gujarat region of India increased from around 6,600 to 11,500 boats, but no regulations were introduced to manage this increased threat to the guitarfishes and other vulnerable species. In UAE, bodies of glaucostegids landed were either sold fresh at market stalls after the fins were removed, or whole bodies were sold dried at the market with fins attached (Jabado, 2018). Bodies of small rhinobatids and glaucostegids (with fins removed) sold for less than AED 30 (USD 8) (Jabado, 2018).

In West Africa, the price paid to fishermen for shark fins (not clear what falls under \u201cshark fins\u201d) may be as high as USD100 per kg or EUR100 per kg for Glaucostegus cemiculus (based on a personal communication, as reported in Notarbartolo di Sciara et al., 2016). Glaucostegus cemiculus meat is consumed domestically as fresh or dried fish, known as \u201csali\u201d. Glaucostegus cemiculus landed in The Gambia have their dorsal and caudal fins removed, likely for export because of their high value. Glaucostegus cemiculus fins have been seen in shops in Hong Kong SAR after genetic analysis of Qun chi category fins (Bloom, 2018), for auction and sale in Oman and United Arab Emirates (Jabado, 2018), and in some instances in Bangladesh, where large numbers of G. granulatus are caught (Haque et al., 2018). Because no part of the animal goes to waste, but no shark fin soup is consumed within Bangladesh, these high value fins are likely sold for export. 15,000 kg of guitarfish products (including G. granulatus and G. obtusus) were recorded moving through a single processing centre in Cox\u2019s Bazar from 2012\u20132015. Giant guitarfish (presumed to mean Glaucostegidae) products enter trade legally, unless taken in contravention of national legislation or regional fisheries management measures (although R. Jabado (in litt., 2019) reports that there are no regional fisheries management measures in place for these species). Because management is so scarce, almost all trade of Glaucostegidae products is legal. Due to this, illegal trade does not occur, however, trade can occur in illegally harvested specimens when specimens are caught within marine protected areas and shark sanctuaries, and those that are finned in range States or fisheries where shark finning is prohibited. The regions that these two species occur in are some of the most heavily fished coastal regions in the world (C. Simpfendorfer, in litt., 2019).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6f2ce7cc-988b-4035-9cbb-ffc0ba913494": {"__data__": {"id_": "6f2ce7cc-988b-4035-9cbb-ffc0ba913494", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "215d559934cbb0b97cc34705d6803a061a70a12949e3d787d3e482f41de88ecb"}, "2": {"node_id": "6c13a852-73db-425d-b7b2-88b4fd48b0b0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9dcff8a30575126c687fac8ffaceac38bb861dd2a376c688dc9f8fe633a6dc90"}}, "hash": "7ce2452811cd8817cbb00228d0a6f48780fb862033b0183ba84cbeb2cc28d52d", "text": "Given their coastal distribution, and the massive fleets of vessels fishing these areas, I would conclude that declines of these species will continue unless significant action is taken (C.

This issue is not unique to giant guitarfish (presumed to mean Glaucostegidae), but rather is common across all Rhinopristiformes. Identification even of whole bodies of giant guitarfish (presumed to mean Glaucostegidae) species from this family can be difficult, which is why these are proposed for listing as lookalikes for G. cemiculus and G. granulatus. Fins from the family Glaucostegidae are morphologically similar to those from the family Rhinidae (wedgefishes) and Pristidae (sawfishes), once removed from the whole animals. Although, visual identification to the family level for unprocessed fins is possible, it makes identification of fins between these three groups that have been heavily processed (skin removed) challenging. Jabado in litt., 2019 reported that the fins from the family Rhinidae are not morphologically similar to those from the family Glaucostegidae, they are similar to each other in the family\u2014but Rhina and Rhynchorhina are distinct (dark, spotted)\u2014and the fins of the remaining Rhynchobatus are different from the giant guitarfishes (Glaucostegidae) because of the enlarged denticles present on those (vs lacking on Rhinidae) for the dorsal fins\u2014and for the caudals (which are usually sold whole) Rhynchobatus have a distinct upper and lower caudal lobe whereas Glaucostegidae species don't. C. Simpfendorfer (in litt., 2019) reported that there is morphological similarity between the species in Glaucostegidae. It is especially true in the form that they are traded in (fins, skins and meat) that can only be delineated with confidence using genetic techniques (C. Simpfendorfer, in litt., 2019). IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 43 240 B) Compelling other reasons to ensure that effective control of trade in currently listed species is achieved The SS states that with similar demand, high value, morphological, genetic, and life history characteristics to sawfishes, whose declining populations were ignored by fisheries and trade management for almost three decades and whose populations are now unlikely to recover, the trade of giant guitarfish (presumed to mean Glaucostegidae) species must be regulated in order to prevent a similar fate of near extinction. Additional Information Threats The primary threats to Glaucostegus cemiculus and G. granulatus are unmanaged and unregulated fisheries and trade. Glaucostegus cemiculus and G. granulatus are targeted species in West Africa, north-western Indian Ocean, and South Asia, largely due to their highly valuable fins. Furthermore, females are more susceptible to fisheries because they are often larger than males, with more valuable fins, and move in closer to shore to give birth and mate. With an increase in coastal development, and the increasingly high demand for their large fins, population declines will likely be further accelerated. Coastal development is a major threat to giant guitarfish species, impacting the habitat where they mainly occur and particularly threatening their inshore breeding, nursery and mating grounds. Conservation, management and legislation Management is likely to vary by species and geographic areas, examples of species-specific legislation are provided below. Glaucostegus cemiculus Mediterranean As reported by Newell (2016), in 2009, Glaucostegus cemiculus was listed on Specially Protected Areas and Biological Diversity Annex III: List of Species Whose Exploitation is Regulated, which was adopted under the Barcelona Convention in 1995 (Bradai et al., 2012). In 2012 it was uplisted to Annex II: List of Endangered of Threatened Species. This protocol charges all parties with identifying and compiling lists of all endangered or threatened species in their jurisdiction, controlling or prohibiting (where appropriate) the taking or disturbance of wild protected species, and co-ordinating their protection and recovery efforts for migratory species, among other measures that are likely less relevant to G. cemiculus (RAC/SPA 1996). Currently all coastal Mediterranean countries where this species occur are contracting parties (European Commission, 2016). Further, since 2012, it has been protected by General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) recommendation GFCM/36/2012/3.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fafe998e-83ff-4e5c-97bf-d1a072ebd1fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "fafe998e-83ff-4e5c-97bf-d1a072ebd1fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a56f7076762cd2518c370135a8808e0b181e13ab93933b49d8b45346c96dfbfa"}, "2": {"node_id": "0678639d-b1ea-4e36-b5f9-4189445978f7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4935e18741977493253410bf343e198de9ffdf1a1e0d94aa3b17dc3727398c85"}}, "hash": "f7f777870c191cb623e1f022ede720b988b238cefba2b9aeedfcd33d994be05e", "text": "To protect elasmobranchs this recommendation prohibits the sale of sharks that cannot be identified before the first point of sale, such as those that have been finned, skinned, or beheaded, and it prohibits trawling in the first three nautical miles off the coast or up to the 50 m isobaths (whichever comes first).

Mauritania This species is protected as part of a ban on directly targeted elasmobranch fishing in the Banc d'Arguin, Mauritania, which was implemented in December 2003 (R. Jabado (in litt., 2019), reports that some traditional fishing using nets is still allowed and there is a high level of bycatch of sharks and rays). In this national park, management measures specific to this species were also introduced (Notarbartolo di Sciara et al., 2016). The fishery was closed from February to September, to avoid the parturition period and therefore the capture of pregnant females. After negotiations with local fishermen, gear restrictions were introduced (to stop fishing with bottom gillnets of 1\u20132 m height and 11\u201316 cm (one side) square mesh). Increased abundance has been observed in and around the bank, suggesting the protection was effective (Notarbartolo di Sciara et al., 2016). Sierra Leone There are no species-specific regulations for the management of shark and shark fisheries in Sierra Leone. However, a licensing system for artisanal fishing canoes, both foreign and Sierra Leone owned is payable to the IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 43 241 Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources and the Local Government Administration (Seisay, 2005). A National Action Plan for the conservation and management of sharks is being proposed. Some of the recommended management measures include: area and seasonal closure to shark fisheries, effort limitation of the shark fishery and discarding of immature and/or juvenile shark and ray species. Guinea-Bissau There are marine protected areas inside the Bijagos archipelago (the Formosa Islands UROK marine reserve), the PNO marine reserve (Orango Islands) and the PNMJVO marine reserve (Joao Vieira and Poilao Islands). Within these areas, trawling and the use of nets is forbidden, the only gear type allowed is fishing with longlines. Furthermore, fishing is only allowed for subsistence purposes, commercial fishing is not permitted (Bucal, 2006). Glaucostegus halavi Kuwait and Pakistan are the only countries across the range of this species with regulations specifically banning catches of rays. Kuwait bans the catches of all rays, while Pakistan protects all guitarfishes, wedgefishes and the Bowmouth Guitarfish Rhina ancylostoma and therefore has specific regulations protecting this species. The United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman have banned trawling in their waters (since 1980, 1993 and 2011, respectively) while the Islamic Republic of Iran, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have seasonal trawl bans that might benefit the species. However, incidental catches occur in other fisheries (e.g., gillnetting). Finning has also been banned in the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Iran, yet trade statistics indicate that some trade in the fins and meat of this species still occurs. Implementation challenges (including similar species) As they are often being caught in multi species net fisheries, they are likely to continue being caught. The species survival probability after capture will be important when determining whether implementation will have conservation benefits.

They inhabit shallow, inshore continental waters of the east Atlantic, Indian and western Pacific Oceans, often occurring in muddy enclosed bays, in estuaries and on coral reefs. They are not known to penetrate fresh water. Little is known about their biology, but some species are known to grow to 3 m in total length, and they are considered low productivity species with a generation length of 10\u201315 years. Whilst the global population sizes are unknown for all Rhinidae species, populations are reportedly declining based on inferences from fisheries landings, fishing effort, or declines of similar species. Eight species of Rhinidae have recently been assessed by IUCN as Critically Endangered (declines of greater than 80% over the last three generations), with one additional species assessed as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) and one as Near Threatened (with declines of 20\u201330% over the last three generations). The primary threats to these species are considered to be unsustainable and unregulated fishing throughout their range. Their retention in catches appears to be driven by the value of their fins on the international market, with fishing pressure being intense across much of their range. Their dependence on inshore habitats makes them susceptible to habitat damage and loss due to anthropogenic impacts. Where shark protective nets occur near beaches, some species get tangled. In South Africa species are sought by sports anglers because of their fighting ability, although they appear to be released live afterwards. Very little species-specific catch or trade data are available. Information is often reported using generic terms such as \u201cwedgefish\u201d or \u201crhinobatids\u201d. Rhinidae are also known to be caught and reported alongside Glaucostegidae (Guitarfish) species using terms such as \u201cguitarfish etc, nei\u201d. Localised landing declines have been reported, for example in India (87% for Rhynchobatus djiddensis and 86% for Rhina ancylostoma over a five-year period), Pakistan for \u201crhinobatids\u201d and Indonesia for Wedgefish. Detailed information is given below for two species known to be affected by trade: - Rhynchobatus australiae: a recent IUCN Red List assessment categorised this species as Critically Endangered due to declines of >80% over the last three generations. Declines in this species have been inferred from landing data in Indonesia, India and Pakistan. The species' distribution may not be fully defined due to confusion with other members of the Rhynchobatus djiddensis species- complex. - Rhynchobatus djiddensis: a recent IUCN Red List assessment also categorised this species as Critically Endangered due to declines of >80% over the last three generations. Declines in this species have been inferred from landing data in the Islamic Republic of Iran, Oman and United Arab Emirates, and fishing pressure is thought to be particularly high in east Africa where it is targeted alongside hammerhead sharks. As with Rhynchobatus australiae, the species\u2019 distribution may not be fully defined. While it appears the meat from these species is primarily used domestically, the fins of these species are reported to be exported, and the factor driving the retention of these species when caught. Fins from species in the Rhinidae family have been identified in the \u201cQun chi\u201d category of fins in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) as having the highest value, and have also IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 44 244 been observed in markets in Singapore. Whole Rhynchobatus specimens were reported to be sold for USD 680 in the United Arab Emirates and Oman between 2010 and 2012. The forms in which species are traded (fins, meat, skins) make it hard to differentiate between species without genetic analysis. There is conflicting information on whether Rhinidae fins are morphologically similar to those from the family Glaucostegidae (subject to a separate listing proposal, Prop. 43) and Pristidae (listed in Appendix I in 2007), once removed from the whole animals, particularly in the processed form.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "33c7c410-ef44-41f6-a2ef-cca8f524535e": {"__data__": {"id_": "33c7c410-ef44-41f6-a2ef-cca8f524535e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e063e4e81e01dbf17d71764747f4f5e3db6a0de385c30608a844a93fbc21ce91"}, "2": {"node_id": "c0ca9db4-09eb-45d3-b48d-91b71732ad32", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4b84d6ce42176614e6e067a11fbba297ab0ec5cb766219d0e4a65ef996d60361"}}, "hash": "d5e3349c1fc6ffe274da69bf08ae34c28bdcd87c0d640af0f2d233929953d021", "text": "Legislation and management for the Rhinidae is limited and varies by location and country.

The final species (Rhynchobatus palpebratus) has undergone declines of 20\u201330% (Near Threatened) in the same time period. Over-harvest is identified as the main factor driving these declines. Therefore, it is likely that for all of the species in this family regulation of trade is required to ensure that harvest from the wild is not reducing populations to levels where survival might be threatened by continued harvest or other influences. Due to the difficulties in differentiating the species in the form that they are traded in, particularly with the taxonomic confusion there is within this family, if any of the species are considered to meet the criteria then all other species in this family should be listed under look-alikes. Other Considerations: Species of Rhinidae and Glaucostegidae (subject to a separate listing proposal, Prop. 43) are often landed and traded together. Therefore, if one of the proposals is accepted then the other family would meet the criteria in Annex 2bA of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17). It is unclear for species in the Rhinidae family what proportion of animals survive if released after capture. It appears from limited information that initial survival after capture is high. In some instances, incidental catch levels are as high as target catches and therefore survival after potential release could be crucial in determining whether regulation is likely to have conservation benefits. In northern Australia, catches of large elasmobranchs have been reduced after the introduction of turtle exclusion devices (TEDs); Rhynchobatus australiae were caught in significantly lower numbers in nets with TEDs. The species in the family Rhinidae are subject to little or no management across their range; an Appendix-II listing could help support the improved management of these species in their range States. Summary of Available Information Text in non-italics is based on information in the Proposal and Supporting Statement (SS); text in italics is based on additional information and/or assessment of information in the SS As the taxonomy and with it the distributions of described species has changed in recent years (2016), information on species before this time may have related to previous understanding of the species and their distributions. We have not attempted to cross check to current taxonomy and distribution, and have presented data as reported. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 44 245 Taxonomy Wedgefish species in the family Rhinidae are shark-like batoid species possibly comprising ten species, in three genera (Rhynchobatus, Rhynchorhina and Rhina). Trade information is often reported using generic terms such as \u201cwedgefish\u201d or \u201crhinobatids\u201d. Species of Rhinidae are also known to be caught and reported along Glaucostegidae (guitarfish) species using terms such as \u201cguitarfish etc, nei\u201d. Species-specific information has been difficult to collect, due to recent taxonomic revisions within the genus, and the difficulties identifying morphologically similar species. All Indo-West Pacific Rhynchobatus species were considered Rhynchobatus djiddensis prior to the late 1990s, when five separate species were either reinstated or newly described. In Australia, landings are reported as Rhynchobatus spp., comprised of a complex of three species: Rhynchobatus australiae, R. laevis and R. palpebratus.

Eight species have been assessed by IUCN as having declines of >80% over the last three generations, with one assessed as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) and one with declines of 20\u201330% over the last three generations. Southeast Asia and Oceania Data from Indonesia indicates significant declines in catch rates in the target gillnet fishery for rhinids and rhynchobatids, of which Rhynchobatus australiae is a key part, indicating local population declines. Given its susceptibility to multiple gear types and evidence of local population declines, it is likely populations of R. australiae have been locally reduced throughout its range. Landings data for \u201cwhitespotted wedgefishes\u201d are available from Indonesia for 2005\u20132014 (10 years) (DGCF, 2015). This grouping likely includes Rhina ancylostoma, R. australiae, R. cooki, R. palpebratus and R. springeri (this grouping may also include species in the Glaucostegidae family, but trends are likely to be representative). Landings declined by 74% over this period, which is the equivalent of 98\u201399% population reductions over the last three generations of wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes (Kyne et al., 2019e). The Aru Islands (Indonesia) rhinid and rhynchobatid gill net fishery first began in the mid-1970s and rapidly expanded to reach a peak in 1987, with more than 500 boats involved. In subsequent years the catches declined very rapidly with only 100 boats fishing in this area in 1996. The decline in catch rates and number of boats is based on a personal communication with F. Amir in the original text. A similar fishery also exists in Merauke (south Papua, Indonesia) with gillnet boats operating in the Arafura Sea, close to Australian waters, and the frozen catch sent by boat to processing areas in Jakarta (Blaber et al., 2009). A study of Australia\u2019s Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF) assessed its sustainability to elasmobranch incidental catch finding that Rhynchobatus djiddensis and Rhina ancylostoma fishing mortality rate were well below the maximum sustainable mortality rate suggesting the population was in a good state (Zhou and Griffiths, 2008). C. Simpfendorfer in litt., 2019 report that the assessment was for R. djiddensis, meaning it was likely a complex of R. australiae, R. palpebratus and R. laevis. Southern Asia Significant declines of guitarfish, around 86% over a five-year timeframe have been documented on the west coast of India at a landing site in Tamil Nadu, despite increasing fishing effort (Mohanraj et al., 2009). This is likely to include Rhynchobatus australiae as a significant component of the catch, and possibly R. djiddensis depending on its full range. The original paper reports Rhynchobatus djiddensis and Rhina ancylostoma, with declines of 87% and 86% respectively over the five-year period from trawl net fishing (Mohanraj et al., 2009). It should however be noted that this data is from one landing site only in Chennai and care needs to be taken extrapolating when additional data are not available. However, Jabado in litt., 2019 notes that fishing pressure is intense and increasing along the whole coast of India. In Pakistan data on wedgefish and guitarfishes (which includes all the family Rhinidae present in their waters\u2014 including Rhynchobatus australiae, reported as \u201cGuitarfishes, etc. nei\u201d) shows significant declines over one generation\u2014from over 2,018 t (reported as 2,185 t) landed in the year 2000, to 403 t in the year 2011. However, from 2014, 2015 and 2016 reported landings were 2,136, 2,266 and 1098 t respectively. Landings data for the \u201crhinobatid\u201d category are available from Pakistan for 1993\u20132011 (19 years) covering the country\u2019s two coastal provinces (M. Gore unpublished data).

Landings declined by 66% over this period, which is the equivalent of 81-99% population reductions over the last three generations of wedgefishes and guitarfishes (30-45 years) (Kyne et al., 2019e). Historical and current fishing pressures have driven declines in abundance of Rhynchobatus australiae and R. djiddensis in fisheries in the United Arab Emirates and Oman. Rhynchobatus species made up 56% of the landings of rhinopristoids, with Rhynchobatus australiae and Rhynchobatus djiddensis a significant component of that catch (Rhynchobatus laevis were also included in these landings) between 2010-2012. Individual specimens were reported as selling for as much as AED2500 (USD680), with landings noted to have declined in a short timeframe of less than 10 years, despite increasing fishing effort. A study in 2017 concluded that all species of wedgefish have declined in the Arabian Sea and adjacent waters, and that populations of Rhynchobatus australiae and Rhynchobatus djiddensis (along with a sympatric species Rhynchobatus laevis) have suffered declines estimated between 50-80% over the last three decades. These species are now assessed as Endangered in this region due to intensive fishing pressure, that is likely to continue into the future and drive additional declines. Eastern Africa Although high quality data from the region are lacking, fisher, trader and local community survey work suggest declining population trends attributed to fisheries targeting both Rhynchobatus australiae and Rhynchobatus djiddensis for their high value fins. Fishing pressure in East Africa is noted to be particularly high for Rhynchobatus djiddensis, where it is targeted alongside hammerhead sharks, due to the high value of their fins in export markets. Reports from artisanal fisheries in Mozambique indicate that fishing pressure has had a significant impact on local populations; many specimens observed by locally-based marine scientists that were caught were mature females, and numbers are reduced to very low levels on reefs where they had been abundant before long-line fisheries began locally in the early 2000's. A survey of fishers and traders in Zanzibar, Tanzania, noted that shark like rays (potentially both Rhynchobatus australiae and Rhynchobatus djiddensis) are of particular interest due to the high value of their fins\u2014noted as among the highest value by fin traders surveyed. Fishermen reported that they catch this species in high numbers; however, its numbers are declining, and it is now considered by some a rare species\u2014one fisher stating that this was because so many people were catching it for its fins. Fishers perceived changes in elasmobranch catch as the result of a range of factors such as overfishing, with an increased number of vessels and more efficient gear. Changes in value were perceived due to combined factors of lower catch and increased demand as well as a higher cost of living. However, some of the reasons cited by different fishers were contradictory, for example, some thought the demand for elasmobranch products had increased, whilst others thought it had decreased along with the sale value. This could result from the large variation in the number of years fishers had been fishing and requires further investigation. Some fishers commented that larger sharks had decreased in number whilst smaller sharks had remained the same. This may be a result of the typically greater vulnerability of larger elasmobranch species and corroborates the likely overexploitation and partial collapse of Zanzibar's elasmobranch fishery.

A genetic analysis was undertaken of processed fin trimmings (by-products from preparing imported fins for consumption) purchased in Hong Kong SAR, the global hub of the shark fin trade, in 2014. This revealed the presence of multiple species in the family Rhinidae: Rhynchobatus australiae, Rhynchobatus cf. laevis, and Rhynchobatus djiddensis. Collectively, these made up at least 0.1% of the trimmings collected, ranking them in the top 20 most common among 86 species or species groups recorded in the fin trade. Blue Shark Prionace glauca and Silky Shark Carcharhinus falciformis made up 34 and 10% of samples respectively, hence other species making up a smaller proportion. A recent study in Singapore, the world\u2019s secondary shark fin trade hub after Hong Kong SAR, collected 207 samples of shark and ray products that were on sale to the general public. Of the 106 products labelled as \u2018shark\u2019, 17% (18% reported in paper) were identified as Rhynchobatus australiae, with the species noted as being highly prized for its fins. This was the largest percentage of any \u2018shark\u2019 species found within the Singapore trade in the study. The global trade demand for their high value fins drives wedgefish mortality in many fisheries and represents the principle threat to Rhynchobatus australiae and Rhynchobatus djiddensis, wherever they are found. There is clear evidence that trade in Rhynchobatus fins is the major driver in the retention of these species by fishers, and hence declines experienced (Simpfendorfer in litt., 2019). North western Indian Ocean Interviews with fishermen and traders in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) suggests that guitarfishes have replaced sawfish as the most sought-after species for the international fin trade market and are increasingly targeted and retained due to the high value of their fins. Based on observations during field surveys in the United Arab Emirates, rhinopristoids were always landed and auctioned whole (Jabado, 2018). Fins were then removed at the auction sites and sold separately to the highest bidders. The meat of larger species, such as rhinids, was either cut into fresh fillets and sold for local consumption, or the body was sold whole and sent for further processing (meat usually cut into small square pieces, salted, dried, and processed for the export market). The most valuable species were wedgefishes with specimens over 2000 mm TL each selling for AED 2500 (USD 680). Conversely, individuals of Rhina ancylostoma were the least valuable and whole specimens of over 1500 mm TL each sold for AED 50 (USD 14). Southern Asia Fishing pressure that will directly impact both species is intense and increasing in the region. The number of trawlers operating in Gujarat waters has increased from ~6,600 boats in 2004 to ~11,500 boats in 2010, and about 2,000 trawlers operate in Pakistan shelf waters. Rhina ancylostoma were encountered in processing centres in Bangladesh (Haque et al., 2018). It is not clear what volume were encountered. Rhynchobatus australiae are heavily exploited in Southeast Asia for their fins, which are considered some of the most valuable in trade. Much of their range occurs in areas of high fishing pressure and they are susceptible to capture both as target and incidental catch by trawl, net and longline gear. Rhynchobatus australiae is one of the most sought after elasmobranchs in southeast Asia (particularly Indonesia), with the dorsal fins and upper caudal fin considered to be of premium quality and fetch the highest prices (Chen, 1996). A set of fins from a single individual have been reported to have fetched up to Rp 900,000 or USD 396/kg (Chen, 1996).

Fins are apparently sold-on to Chinese buyers in Maputo. Inclusion in Appendix II to improve control of other listed species A) Specimens in trade resemble those of species listed in Appendix II under Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) Annex 2 a or listed in Appendix I Rhynchobatus spp. in the Arabian Sea and adjacent waters appear to be comprised of several species including the Rhynchobatus djiddensis, Rhynchobatus laevis and Rhynchobatus australiae. These have been documented from the Arabian Sea, Sea of Oman, and the Gulf, and are consistently confused in the literature and require further taxonomic work (Last et al., 2016). Within this complex, species identification relies on relatively small differences in the number and pattern of white and black spots around the spiracles and gills, variations in fin size ratios, and the absence or presence of dark bars between the eyes (Last et al., 2016; White et al., 2014). The fins from Rhynchobatus australiae are distinctive, and dried, unprocessed (skin on) Rhinopristiform fins can be visually identified at least to the family level (i.e., Rhinidae, Glaucostegidae, Pristidae \u2013 the three families most regularly found in trade). This ability to visually identify the primary product in trade will aid in the implementation and enforcement of this proposed listing. Intra-species variability in fin morphology within the family Rhinidae makes identification to a species level challenging. For example, the highly prized dorsal fins are morphologically similar (in size, shape and colour) for many of the species within the family Rhinidae. Fins from the family Rhinidae are morphologically similar to those from the family Glaucostegidae (giant guitarfishes) and Pristidae (sawfishes), once removed from the whole animals. Although, as noted above, visual identification to the family level for unprocessed fins is possible, it makes identification of fins between these three groups that have been heavily processed (skin removed) challenging. Jabado in litt., 2019 report that the fins from the family Rhinidae are not morphologically similar to those from the family Glaucostegidae, they are similar to each other in the family - but Rhina and Rhynchorhina are distinct (dark, spotted) - and the fins of the remaining Rhynchobatus are different from the giant guitarfishes (Glaucostegidae) because of the enlarged denticles present on those (vs lacking on Rhinidae) for the dorsal fins - and for the caudals (which are usually sold whole) Rhynchobatus have a distinct upper and lower caudal lobe whereas Glaucostegidae species don't. Genetic techniques can address fin identification challenges. With Sawfishes already listed at the family level on CITES Appendix I, monitoring, enforcement and compliance measures should already be in place for fins originating from the Order Rhinopristiformes. Simpfendorfer in litt., 2019 report that there is morphological similarity between the species in Rhinidae. It is especially true in the form that they are traded in (fins, skins and meat) that can only be delineated with confidence using genetic techniques (Simpfendorfer in litt., 2019). B) Compelling other reasons to ensure that effective control of trade in currently listed species is achieved The SS states that given these species\u2019 large size, restricted habitat use, high fin value in international markets, and the current and increasing fishing pressure throughout their range, Rhynchobatus australiae and Rhynchobatus djiddensis are believed to be at a particularly high risk of a similar fate to the sawfishes (family Pristidae), that have been extirpated from almost all of their historic range and were consequently listed on CITES Appendix I. Additional Information Threats The primary threat to these species is unsustainable and unregulated fisheries mortality throughout their range. Both Rhynchobatus australiae and Rhynchobatus djiddensis are caught by artisanal and commercial fisheries both as a target species and as incidental catch in demersal trawl, net, and longline fisheries \u2013 with retention incentivized due to the very high value of their fins in international trade.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "390f3216-5dcf-4f16-afd7-2ea0cea5dfec": {"__data__": {"id_": "390f3216-5dcf-4f16-afd7-2ea0cea5dfec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "edaaabb529ea0c83f56291b55996eee0d4b825db9ed0625fdd1b707bc7a51af1"}, "2": {"node_id": "870127a8-b332-48fb-94e0-0a1f04030868", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dd0d64b00148e14b431064246afc3c2c86429797e178c609a2b0d8a68a080795"}}, "hash": "11ca24cb039aa015edec4bdf02f70a83c712c6d3f5f7897ee9aa6af3d31bb9b8", "text": "Their use of inshore habitat and susceptibility to multiple gear types makes them particularly vulnerable, and that is compounded as their range includes some of the world\u2019s most heavily fished coastal regions.

It is a popular target species for shore anglers because of its fighting ability, although it is common practice to release the species. Catch rate (number of fish per angler hour) in competition shore angling in KZN showed an increase in the period 1977-2000, as did the mean mass of animal caught (Pradervand, 2003). By contrast anecdotal reports from anglers indicate that the species is less commonly caught than in previous years (Mann, 2003). Conservation, management and legislation Rhynchobatus australiae and Rhynchobatus djiddensis are subject to limited management globally, and with their inshore range are subject to the national laws of countries throughout their range, rather than those of regional fisheries bodies and agreements. It is assumed that the vast majority of international trade in their fins and other products is legal, but from widely unregulated fisheries. Where shark finning is banned, but still occurs these could be species illegally finned due to the exceptionally high value of their fins when traded internationally, and the comparatively low value of their meat. Rhynchobatus djiddensis is listed on Schedule 1 of the Bangladesh Wildlife Protection Act, 2012, and on India\u2019s Wildlife Protection Act 1972, which prohibits the hunting, trade and any other form of exploitation of these species. Pakistan have species-specific regulations banning the catching of rhinids and rhynchobatids, specifically the Department of Fisheries of two of Pakistan\u2019s maritime provinces, Sindh and Balochistan, have banned the catching, landing and marketing of all guitarfish, and a complex of wedgefishes including Rhynchobatus australiae is managed in a mixed fishery in Australia. Apart from these limited examples of management, species in the family Rhinidae are subject to little or no management across their range, including in hotspots of inshore fishing pressure where significant declines in their populations have been noted, such as Eastern Africa and the north-western Indian Ocean. In the Australian state of Queensland Rhynchobatus spp. have a trip limit of 5 for commercial fishers (Simpfendorfer in litt., 2019, White et al., 2013). Rhynchobatus australiae is listed on CMS Appendix II. Rhynchobatus australiae, Rhynchobatus djiddensis and Rhynchobatus laevis are also listed on the Shark MoU as of December 2018 (Jabado in litt., 2019). The recreational line fishery in South Africa is managed by a bag limit of one/species/person/day for unspecified chondrichthyans, which includes Rhynchobatus djiddensis (Dudley and Cavanagh, 2006). A study in the Northern Prawn Fishery has found that the use of turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) have resulted in significantly lower proportions of Rhynchobatus australiae being caught in nets with TEDs than without (M. Campbell, in litt., 2019). Other comments As species in the Rhinidae family are often being caught in multispecies net fisheries, they are likely to continue being caught. The species survival probability after capture is therefore important when determining whether implementation will have conservation benefits. Rhynchobatus djiddensis is taken as incidental catch by demersal prawn trawlers in central KZN, primarily in the summer and at a rate of 123 to 231 per year (Fennessy, 1994). Most (82%) of those caught in a sample of 100 trawls were alive and released, although subsequent survival is not known. Rhynchobatus djiddensis (probably Rhynchobatus australiae) was found to be one of the four most commonly caught elasmobranchs in the incidental catch of the trawl fisheries (prawn and fish) in northern Australia, with approximately 10% dying in the trawl net (Stobutzki et al., 2002). Survival increased with the length of the individual (Stobutzki et al., 2002). Since the introduction of Turtle Exclusion Devices (TEDS) in some northern IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 44 253 Australian trawl fisheries, catches of large elasmobranchs have been reduced (Brewer et al., 1998) and thus Rhynchobatus australiae are probably caught in lower numbers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "79651982-a844-48a5-bc7c-a7c8e7ad7185": {"__data__": {"id_": "79651982-a844-48a5-bc7c-a7c8e7ad7185", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "66a51d155063c20784037765d579ae6241fa347914a62545db7fa91915ca7989"}, "2": {"node_id": "1c09834e-9fd4-4de2-8b0e-aea415fb0f3f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6efcdf54939005d948ef9ed5a64a2094fec44a40a5a3b17af20538e1adea044d"}}, "hash": "96c25e20a28aa41bf9987a47a12cee273f2e8be7d6735ff1faf4df6f3ccdaa3f", "text": "References Blaber, S.

The genus Holothuria contains more than 20 subgenera, of which the subgenus Holothuria (Microthele) contains four species. Three species within the subgenus are commonly referred to as teatfish due to their lateral protrusions, whilst the fourth species Holothuria fuscopunctata is known as a trunkfish and lacks teats. The presence of teats (in the three species which display them) differentiate this group from other sea cucumbers, even in dried form, and it is only these three species subject to this listing proposal: Holothuria fuscogilva: Varies in colour from a dark colour with light spots to a light colour with dark spots, with large lateral protrusions (teats) along its flanks. Length and weight vary from 28\u201357 cm and 2.4\u20133 kg based on location. This species can be found on reef slopes, sandy areas and seagrass beds between 0\u201350 m in depth. This species occurs throughout the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Holothuria nobilis: Black in colour with white blotches on the sides of the animal and 6\u201310 large lateral protrusions (teats) along its flanks. Length varies from 14\u201360 cm and weight from 0.23\u20133 kg based on location. This species can be found on shallow coral reef habitats, seagrass beds and sandy substrates between 0\u201340 m in depth. This species only occurs in the African and Indian Ocean region. Holothuria nobilis also includes a yet undescribed species which is likely to be separated from H. nobilis named Holothuria (Microthele) sp. \u201cpentard\u201d. This yet undescribed species has an average length of 30 cm and weight of 1.7 kg and has been found to prefer sandy substrates at a depth between 10\u201350 m. Holothuria whitmaei: Uniformly black dorsally and grey ventrally with 5\u201310 large lateral protrusions (teats) along its flanks. Length of live specimens varies from 23\u201354 cm and weight is an average of 1.8 kg. This species inhabits shallow waters between 0\u201320 m and is found in coral reef flats and slopes and sandy seagrass beds.

Very little is known about generation length and recruitment in Holothurians, but the IUCN Red List assessments suggest that species within this subgenus could live from up to 12 years to several decades. Trends in populations are derived from density estimates, but due to the large ranges of the three species proposed, very little evidence of overall population trends exists. The FAO Expert Advisory Panel noted that there is a general negative trend in populations in all three species throughout their ranges and that many populations have lower densities than the recommended threshold density (10 per ha) for healthy populations. From surveys in specific sites: - densities of Holothuria nobilis in Sri Lanka were less than one individual per hectare (2010). - in Zanzibar, H. nobilis was not located outside of protected areas, and inside protected areas was found at densities of 1.2 individuals per hectare (2010). - declines in densities in previously fished areas of 80% over five years in Australia (1998\u2013 2005) and 83% over 16 years in Egypt (2000 \u2013 2016) were observed for H. whitmaei. - in the same studies, H. fuscogilva densities decreased by 86% over five years in Australia (1998\u20132005) and 94% over 16 years in Egypt (2000\u20132016).

Annual global capture of sea cucumbers showed a six-fold increase in the 1980s and from 1990 onwards has been steadily increasing to a weight of 31,000 t in 2016. One species-specific example of trade comes from the Seychelles, where capture data between 2001 and 2016 totalled 1,700 t of Holothuria fuscogilva and 180 t of H. nobilis. Complementary density data showed a 54% decline in H. fuscogilva density and a 73% decline in H. nobilis density between the two survey periods in 2003\u20132004 and 2011\u20132013. Holothuria fuscogilva was assessed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List in 2010; the population is estimated to have declined by 30\u201350% since the 1960s. Both H. nobilis and H. whitmaei were assessed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List (2010) with declines since the 1960s estimated at 60\u201370% in at least 80% of its range for H. nobilis and 60\u201390% in most of its range for H. whitmaei. Sea cucumber fisheries are not regulated in several countries, although some have employed various measures. Australia and Egypt both employed closed fishing areas and India employed a total ban on sea cucumber fishing, but these are not widely adopted strategies and there have been issues with implementation. Limited-access fisheries have also restricted the number of vessels/harvesters in a given area. Total Allowable Catches (TACs) or quotas have also been established in Australia and Papua New Guinea. Minimum catch sizes are implemented in Australia, Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Tonga. However, large areas of these species\u2019 ranges are not protected or regulated. Analysis: Holothuria fuscogilva, H. nobilis and H. whitmaei are the target of fisheries driven by the international trade of beche-de-mer mainly to Asian markets. Information on the productivity and recruitment of all three species is relatively unknown, but threshold densities are thought to be required to ensure successful reproduction. Although very little information on species-specific trade is available, all three species have been observed in markets. The only specific data on the impact of fishing, over a period of 11 years in the Seychelles, showed declines in density of 54% for Holothuria fuscogilva and 73% for H. nobilis. The FAO Expert Advisory Panel Report noted that both historic and recent declines have been observed in the densities of all three species which are consistent with the indicative guidelines for inclusion in Appendix II of commercially exploited aquatic species suggested in the footnote to Annex 5 of Resolution 9.24 (Rev. CoP17). These declines are from studies in limited areas of the ranges of these three species, however fishing pressure is likely over much of their range. The IUCN Red List assessments have estimated the overall declines as: H. fuscogilva 30\u201350% since the 1960s, H. nobilis 60\u201370% in at least 80% of its range, and H. whitmaei 60\u201390% in the majority of its range. Many of the densities considered in the FAO Panel\u2019s report were below the \u201crule of thumb\u201d threshold for healthy breeding populations. As international trade is likely to be driving the majority of fishing for these species, it would appear that regulation of trade is required to ensure that harvest from the wild is not reducing population to a level where survival might be threatened by continued harvest or other influences.

The size of teatfish populations may vary by location, by year and by sampling method; biases may therefore appear. The FAO Expert Advisory Panel described a \u201crule of thumb\u201d threshold density of 10 ind. ha-1 which describes a baseline threshold for \u201chealthy\u201d teatfish stocks (FAO, 2019). The Expert Advisory Panel also performed an in- depth review of literature relating to the three proposed species in 16 countries within their range (up to 25 sites per species). Analysis from the Advisory panel show how populations at different sites for each species compare to the \u201crule of thumb\u201d density: Holothuria fuscogilva: The panel reviewed literature for 25 different sites and concluded that H. fuscogilva densities were above the threshold at three sites, at or below the threshold at 14 sites and that there was insufficient evidence at eight sites.

Overall, teatfish populations are depleted or over-exploited in most range countries. According to an evaluation of the IUCN Red List published in 2013, populations of Holothuria nobilis, H. whitmaei and H. fuscogilva are declining. Populations of Holothuria nobilis have been estimated to have declined by between 60% and 70% in at least 80% of its range since the 1960s in the IUCN Red List assessment (Conand et al., 2013a). Global declines of Holothuria fuscogilva were estimated by the IUCN Red List to be between 30% and 50% since the 1960s (Conand et al., 2013). Declines of between 60% and 90% have been estimated by the IUCN Red List for Holothuria whitmaei since the 1960s (Conand et al., 2013b). There is currently no IUCN Red List assessment for H. \u201cpentard\u201d as the species has not yet been described. It should be noted that the reported Red List assessment declines for the three species listed are estimates and should be treated with caution. The FAO Export Advisory Panel noted \u201ca general negative trend in population measures across their range, and low or depleted abundances when compared to recognized baselines for \u201chealthy\u201d stocks\u201d (FAO, 2019).

In Tanzania, this species previously comprised a very small percentage of the total of sea cucumber species but dominated the catch. In the Chagos Marine Protected Area, populations have also declined over the past 4 or 5 years due to illegal fishing. In the Seychelles catches for this species were relatively stable from 2003 to 2006, with a peak of 10,371 individuals and then decreased in 2007 and 2008 to 5,687 individuals. This species has also been depleted in Mozambique, India, Sri Lanka, the Red Sea, the Maldives and possibly Kenya due to overfishing. On the basis of these references, it is estimated that there has been at least 60% to 70% decline in more than 80% of its distribution. The percentage decline noted above is also the figure given in the Red List assessment for Holothuria nobilis (Conand et al., 2013a). In Sri Lanka densities of Holothuria nobilis in two survey sites were observed to be less than 1 ind. ha-1 (Dissanayake & Stefansson, 2010). A survey of four sites in Zanzibar located Holothuria nobilis in one protected area at a density of 1.2 ind. ha-1, in the three other areas (where collection is permitted), H. nobilis was absent (Eriksson et al., 2010). The FAO expert panel studied the literature at nine different locations/countries looking at population trends for Holothuria nobilis. They concluded that there was insufficient population trend data to determine if the Appendix II criteria had been met, but from snapshot density estimates showed that at six locations, H. nobilis densities fell below the \u201crule of thumb\u201d density for a healthy population (FAO, 2019). Holothuria whitmaei: In Saipan, Northern Mariana Islands, a fishery targeted this species but stopped in 1997 due to a decline in the CPUE (Catch per unit effort). In the Marshall Islands and the Cook Islands, this species is rare. In Tonga, sea cucumber stocks are depleted. In Papua New Guinea, sea cucumber stocks are depleted, with low densities of commercial holothurians (21 per ha) and comparisons with historical catch data show that this species has been grossly over-exploited. In the Solomon Islands, the species was observed in low densities. This species has been over-exploited in the Torres Strait since the 1990s, and its population has decreased by 80% in the Great Barrier Reef in recent decades. In Ashmore Reef, populations of this species were considered to be severely depleted in 2000. In the Philippines, this species is considered as over-exploited in view of the decrease in the number of exports. The species is also over-exploited in Indonesia. Data collection on Ashmore reef (Australia) has seen population densities of Holothuria whitmaei decrease by 80% between the year 2000 (0.5 ind. ha-1) and 2005 (0.1 ind. ha-1) (Ceccarelli et al., 2011). It should be noted that this area was designated as a Marine Protected Area in 1983 but is surrounded by areas which are heavily fished. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 45 259 In the Abou Ghosoun area of Egypt, Holothuria whitmaei abundance has decreased 83% in 16 years between 2000 and 2016 (Hasan, 2019). In Tonga, Holothuria whitmaei occurrence was observed to be decreasing between 1984 and 2004 and even after a seven-year moratorium on fishing, occurrence observations did not increase to original levels (Friedman et al., 2011). Some caution should be taken with these results as a variety of data collection methods were used during the different time-periods of the survey. Between 2003 and 2009 in Fiji, both occurrence and density values decreased when Reef Benthos transect methods were used, no difference was observed in the two time periods when Manta surveys were performed (Friedman et al., 2011). Further declines in density from the 2009 level in Friedman et al., (2011) have been reported for H. whitmaei in 2013, but these declines are on a much more local scale (Jupiter and Vave, 2013).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "77b51029-ac86-45ee-b200-b1a91063e878": {"__data__": {"id_": "77b51029-ac86-45ee-b200-b1a91063e878", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a5de5d68177ab6d43efb1c514b19867dd6ab267930c086153412d91aa242e27c"}, "2": {"node_id": "090d8896-df27-4755-8e2b-ea5dfe7e752a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "26a86c9b1d3f28c2700ea1da012b3690735edc70a816ce5160c6318c5372f35b"}}, "hash": "a722f1ba47da826ef9c4607df8dff4ce72c3a8239e9d57ad7fadd0c5e2cb4bf0", "text": "The FAO expert panel looked at population trends at 15 different sites for Holothuria whitmaei.

Further declines in density from the 2009 level in Friedman et al., (2011) have been reported for H. fuscogilva in 2013, but these declines are on a much more local scale (Jupiter & Vave, 2013). Declines in occurrences of H. fuscogilva were also recorded in Tonga between 1984 and 2004 (Friedman et al., 2011). Some caution should be taken with these results as a variety of data collection methods were used during the different time-periods of the survey. The FAO expert panel reviewed population density data at 25 sites/countries for Holothuria fuscogilva. It was concluded that population densities had recently declined by more than 80% at two sites/countries, two sites had seen density declines of less than 30% and one site had not seen a recent decline in population density. There was insufficient time series data to make a determination of a decline at 20 of the sites/countries, but of these 20, 14 sites/countries were found to have snapshot densities of at or below the \u2018rule of thumb\u2019 threshold for healthy populations (FAO, 2019). A visit to a holothurian processing plant, conducted at a workshop on the Indian Ocean Holothurian fisheries in Tanzania (Zanzibar), allowed the observation that teatfish (Holothuria nobilis, H. fuscogilva and H. \u201cpentard\u201d) which have a high commercial value, accounted for only a tiny fraction of the large number of drying products. In addition, most individuals were small. This suggests that populations of highly valued species are decreasing both in size and total landings, which explains why catches increasingly concern low- and medium-value species. The FAO Expert Advisory Panel found limited evidence of population increases, although one example from Australia presented data that suggest that it required 17 years for stocks of Holothuria whitmaei to recover to pre- fishing levels. For further information on population recoveries, please refer to the FAO report from the Expert Advisory Panel (FAO, 2019). IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 45 260 B) Regulation of trade required to ensure that harvest from the wild is not reducing population to level where survival might be threatened by continued harvest or other influences The main threat to teatfish populations is overfishing in order to meet the demand for beche-de-mer, teatfish are also used for biomedical research. Sea cucumbers are sedentary animals that are particularly vulnerable to over- exploitation because they are large in size, easy to collect due to their shallow area of occurrence, and do not require sophisticated fishing techniques. Strong fishing pressure causes a decrease in species biomass density and populations are unable to replenish once they have fallen below critical mass. To reproduce, teatfish release their gametes in water and the success of the fertilisation depends on the proximity of the individuals during the spawning period (and therefore on the density of the population).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "482a250e-6f7b-4b04-8146-57bb09e64b0c": {"__data__": {"id_": "482a250e-6f7b-4b04-8146-57bb09e64b0c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "da15be5456baaa92ad7d27a326a0b2b3c89983e77ab7d376f4cf2a23904c1d52"}, "2": {"node_id": "155cddfe-27d6-4c29-b990-455921fa55f0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a8bc90ae170666a30bc3c3b09ce102a6de55a891fe4743c02a86c08d6fea4f95"}}, "hash": "86330b143a1e57a64b4947e66ac77dbbf2b2b1ddbf55a2f60ba506130e3443cc", "text": "Due to the reduction in population density caused by fishing, individuals may be unable to reproduce successfully, the distance between males and females being too large.

In the 1980s and 1990s, more and more countries began to export Holothurians and world production increased. The global catch of sea cucumbers was estimated at 25,000 t (live) in 1983. The catch consisted mainly of tropical Indo-Pacific species. Global captures increased three-fold between 1985 and 1986 and doubled during the 1987\u20131989 period, in response to increased demand in Asian markets. In 1989, catches totalled 90,000 t worldwide, broken down as follows: 78,000 t from the South Pacific and South-east Asia. The sea cucumber fishery continued to increase, with a global harvest of 120,000 t in the early 1990s. More recently global captures have steadily increased between 1990 and 2016, from a low of 12,140 t in 1993 to a high of 31,287 t in 2016 (Figure 1). Data in Figure 1 show a fairly even annual capture rate in the Pacific Ocean whereas annual captures of sea cucumbers have been recently decreasing (2008\u20132016) in the Indian Ocean and increasing in the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent seas. Reductions in captures from the Indian Ocean fit with the theory that Holothuria fisheries are \u201cboom and bust\u201d industries that over-exploit resources until they are depleted (Anderson et al., 2011; Purcell et al., 2013). Seven of the top ten countries with the highest weight of sea cucumber captures between 1990\u20132016 are range States of H. fuscogilva, H. nobilis (including H. \u201cpentard\u201d) and/or H. whitmaei (Indonesia, Madagascar, Sri Lanka, Philippines, Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia and the Solomon Islands).

The main exporting countries to the Hong Kong SAR were Indonesia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Singapore and Fiji. It is estimated, however, that the available trade figures would underestimate the total volume of world trade, given that trade chains are complex, incomplete export data and individual species rarely differentiated in trade statistics. FAO trade figures on world exports are low due to the lack of data published/provided by exporting countries. Despite over-exploitation, global catches have increased due to the change of species composition and the opening of new fishing zones. However, it is also possible that catches are better reported than before and/or that more species are harvested. Further examination of Holothuroidea fisheries suggests that the majority of fisheries follow a boom and bust pattern of high exploitation, followed by a collapse, with fisheries developing further away from target markets in Asia to feed demand. High value species (such as Holothuria nobilis, H. fuscogilva and H. whitmaei) are exploited first in shallower, near-shore areas and then spatial expansion occurs in off-shore areas until the resource is depleted and lower value species are targeted (Anderson et al., 2011). Based on an analysis of Purcell et al., (2013), the current Holothurian fisheries in the Indo-Pacific regions are predominantly over-exploited or depleted. Species level capture data has been reported by the Seychelles for both Holothuria fuscogilva and H. nobilis since 2001 (FAO, 2019) and during that period the Seychelles has captured a total of 184 t of H. nobilis and 1,724 tonnes of H. fuscogilva (Figure 2). During data collection in 2003\u20132004, a survey estimated densities of H. fuscogilva and H. nobilis at 0.63 and 1.98 ind. ha-1 (Aumeeruddy & Conand, 2008). Data were collected again in 2011\u20132013 and reported densities of 0.29 ind. ha-1 and 0.53 ind. ha-1 for H. fuscogilva and H. nobilis respectively (Koike, 2017). These results show a recent decline in density of 54% for H. fuscogilva and 73% for H. nobilis in the Seychelles. Figure 2: Capture production figures (in tonnes) for Seychelles for H. nobilis and H. fuscogilva between 2001 and 2016 (FAO, 2019). Inclusion in Appendix II to improve control of other listed species A) Compelling other reasons to ensure that effective control of trade in currently listed species is achieved Successful reproduction of sea cucumbers is density-dependent, due to their benthic nature and reproduction via broadcast spawning, fertilisation of eggs can be greatly impaired by low population densities (Bell et al., 2008). This phenomenon has been referred to as the Allee effect (Courchamp et al., 1999) and can cause progressive decline as population growth decreases leading eventually to extirpation. It is not known what the critical density for specific Holothurian species is to prevent extirpations, but there are examples of H. nobilis populations not recovering in Australia, even two years after commercial fishing in the area had been stopped (Uthicke et al., 0 50 100 150 200 250 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Seychelles Capture Production (t) Holothuria nobilis Holothuria fuscogilva IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 45 263 2004).

In several countries, sites were closed soon after the opening of the fishery due to over-exploitation and rapid biological or commercial disappearance. At some sites, the taking of teatfish species is prohibited because of their rarity. Historically, management of sea cucumber fisheries is based on tenure systems owned by local communities, particularly in traditional fishing areas. However, with the expansion of this activity into non-traditional areas, loss of ancestral crops and increased demand, commercial fisheries are often poorly managed, resulting in the implementation of an inventory once depletion has already begun. In most developing countries, new fisheries are starting up under open access regimes, and management plans or regulations such as prohibitions (e.g. closure of an area) or fishing seasons are introduced in order to try to mitigate the decline of the resource. In the tropics, fishing is done at a small-scale but is of great socio-economic importance. Management measures have been taken in some tropical countries. In most of teatfish range countries, government management of sea cucumber fisheries is in place. Unfortunately, such management is generally poorly applied, probably due to poor human resources and other resources, capacity to implement and control regulations, effective scientific monitoring mechanisms and adequate management measures taking scientific information into account. The different types of management measures taken for sea cucumbers are detailed in the SS and summarised as follows: \u2212 Prohibited fishing zones: around the world, fishing exclusion zones are recognised for the benefits they bring to exploited species. There are a few rare examples for sea cucumbers. In Egypt, prohibited fishing areas had a greater diversity and density of commercial species of sea cucumber. In Australia, Holothuria whitmaei densities were 75% higher in prohibited fishing areas than in fishing areas. Prohibited fishing areas can be beneficial especially when they have been established and approved in conjunction with actors such as fishermen. However, their success depends largely on the continued support of fishing communities, the effectiveness of enforcement measures and the fight against fraud, and tangible benefits for local actors. Selection criteria for the establishment of prohibited fishing areas should take into account the type, size, shape and number of habitats, as well as the characteristics of other prohibited fishing areas. \u2212 Complete closure of fisheries: in India, in 2001, all species of commercialised Holothurians were listed in annex I of the Wildlife Protection Act (1972), which prohibits all fishing activities. This decision was aimed at promoting the recovery of over-exploited populations; nevertheless, illegal fishing continues, and most stocks are or remain severely depleted. Despite its potential benefits for wild populations, a total ban on sea cucumber fishing has significant socioeconomic consequences and has not proved to be effective in practice. For fishermen such a prohibition, if not accompanied by an alternative, means a significant loss of income and may incite them to fish illegally. Such situations may be even more detrimental to sea cucumbers and unfavourable to humans because they cannot enforce biological thresholds and pay a fair and equitable price. \u2212 Limited access: in general, limited access is a licensing system whereby the number of fishers or vessels involved in fishing is limited. This management tool can curb the competition between fishermen and help maintain a fishery. This system also improves compliance with management measures and can help ensure that economic benefits accrue to local communities. Granting land rights to fishermen's co-operatives can help manage open access fisheries. This management approach appears to be effective in developed countries IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 45 264 where there are other alternatives for sea cucumber fishers who have been displaced (e.g. in Australia). However, in traditional systems, this procedure is difficult to apply since all fishermen have equal rights to exploit their resources. Moreover, this procedure may, as such, prove to be binding on the managing authorities fishing, and even social disturbances and conflicts. Fishermen's co-operatives should be organised so that licences are only granted to people whose main source of income is the sea cucumber fishery and not to any member of the co-operative. In Fiji, only indigenous fishermen are allowed to fish for sea cucumbers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bd0620d0-be02-445f-a802-f9f818d50425": {"__data__": {"id_": "bd0620d0-be02-445f-a802-f9f818d50425", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3d65e0cfbb5b86fd173ba7a172afc75385d65b8f8958d7b663b8303144dddf0a"}, "2": {"node_id": "6d88c67e-2dd4-4f70-b008-875607176340", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0932cb4075557a59a210af9935f05f8d4fcdd91aa7a9b5c23536bac93e786eda"}}, "hash": "055061f883886b2dd3138e9a31932acc2f93dbdd54a97b2a6f905f526fc4087b", "text": "In Fiji, only indigenous fishermen are allowed to fish for sea cucumbers. \u2212 Quotas: quotas or total allowable catches (TACs) are the maximum number of individuals or biomass that can be exploited each year during a fishing season or fishing expedition in certain areas, etc. In the sea cucumber fisheries on the eastern coast of Australia a TAC for the species Holothuria fuscogilva was introduced after the collapse of the H.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5ac6ce34-b028-4ca8-bca5-27e85c600d12": {"__data__": {"id_": "5ac6ce34-b028-4ca8-bca5-27e85c600d12", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7fcc05b9300c319b32047191ff3cf8ddb6b20adc4be5e8e60a0447e4e36c3f43"}, "3": {"node_id": "60d8fe62-0a23-4931-b8e5-6fbe2fc57f69", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "19791a18458ebc5cf0bfdeb0265e3d05f1fba8d64fda8d89c19a0f787c33bc1a"}}, "hash": "245e088c4e09b3ae40672cdafbaa85a0b882fc48430e4a711d015ac3ac08b19b", "text": "whitmaei fishery in 1999. The TAC for H. fuscogilva is examined each year while H. whitmaei is banned from fishing. In Australia, in the Northern Territory, a TAC of 127 t was set for H. fuscogilva. It is combined with a mixture of input and output controls, including temporal and spatial management tools, size and gear restrictions. In Papua New Guinea, a quota has been set for each province but is often exceeded. \u2212 Minimum catch sizes: the minimum catch sizes are based on size at maturity to ensure reproduction of the stock at least once before entering the fisheries. This can help prevent a population collapse due to recruitment failure. In addition, this management tool facilitates the targeting of large individuals who reach higher prices in the market. However, the size and weight of sea cucumbers are largely dependent on the amount of live and processed individuals in the water, which can pose problems. For many commercial species, biological information is lacking to determine the minimum harvest size. This management tool is also used in Australia, Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Tonga, with other regulatory methods such as quotas. Nevertheless, the minimum sizes set vary by country, region and species. For example, on the west coast of Australia, the minimum landing size was set at 15 cm for all commercial sea cucumber species, while in the western region this minimum size varies by species. It is important to improve the training of fishermen so that they avoid taking too small individuals. It is also possible that sea cucumbers rejected because of their small size are sold on the black market at lower prices. Given the importance of densities for healthy breeding populations, ensuring fishing does not deplete densities to below this level could be a useful management measure, and should not be technically difficult. Artificial propagation/captive breeding To protect their Holothurian populations from overfishing, countries have developed new methods to produce beche-de-mer. These measures have gained importance since methods of reproduction and rearing of larvae and juveniles have been developed for some commercial species. However, access to technology for juvenile production is not sufficient to initiate stock rebuilding and enhancement programmes. The Sandfish Holothuria scabra (not a teatfish, but a member of the same genus) has been identified as one of the most promising species of sea cucumbers for aquaculture and has been subjected to captive breeding experiments in Australia, India and Viet Nam. Unfortunately, the results to date with other experimental species in aquaculture enterprises have not been positive, especially for species H. nobilis and H. fuscogilva. Ranching operations have also been developed in the Northern Territory of Australia, since 2015, with further juvenile releases planned for 2019. More recent data suggest that aquaculture production of sea cucumbers (almost entirely made up of Apostichopus japonicus), has accounted for more sea cucumber production than capture fisheries since 2011, but this drastic increase in aquaculture production of sea cucumbers has not reduced the annual amount of sea cucumbers captured from the wild (Figure 3). Even though the majority of sea cucumbers produced from aquaculture do not come from the Holothuria genus, recent studies have seen successful hatchery efforts that allowed a single technician to produce 18,800 juvenile Holothuria scabra (Militz et al., 2018). Furthermore, some Pacific island countries have completed successful research trials of hatchery and release techniques and are at a stage to scale up, with the Federated States of Micronesia having a project for hatchery-based releasing of H. nobilis (Pickering & Hair, 2012).

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 46 Inclusion of Ornamental Spiders Poecilotheria spp. in Appendix II Proponent: Sri Lanka and United States of America Summary: There are currently 15 recognized species of ornamental spiders in the genus Poecilotheria, with four described since 2006. Eight species are endemic to India, five are endemic to Sri Lanka, and two species occur in both countries. The IUCN Red List categorises two Poecilotheria species as Critically Endangered, three as Endangered, one species as Vulnerable, one species as Least Concern and one species as Data Deficient. The remainder are yet to be assessed. Poecilotheria spiders live in forested areas including some species in teak and banana plantations. They live in pre-existing holes or cavities in trees or behind loose bark and have been found in crevices of buildings located nearby to forested areas. The main threat to Poecilotheria species appears to be habitat loss and fragmentation. Due to the cryptic nature of Poecilotheria, their nocturnal habits and sensitivity to vibrations by human surveyors they are difficult to study. Therefore, current and historical population estimates and status for these species are lacking and population trends are unknown. Although many of these species\u2019 habitats are known to be declining, knowledge on the distribution of some species continues to increase as new localities are recorded extending their known range. Poecilotheria are currently protected from wild harvest in Sri Lanka, however they can be legally collected in India except within protected areas. This genus of tarantulas is popular in the pet trade due to their coloration and size, with the USA and Europe the main destinations. US import data revealed 20,000 live specimens imported between 2008 and 2017, the majority (97%) were reported as captive-bred mostly coming from European countries. According to some experts, most species are considered easy to breed and the number of individuals bred in captivity is likely enough to sustain the overall demand of those species. However, morphological and genetic diversity is said to be highly sought after in the hobby and there are some concerns over ongoing offtake from the wild. Imports into the USA of wild-caught Poecilotheria totalled 643 over the same time period and included at least 10 species: P. metallica (253), Poecilotheria spp.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d262e214-1a4c-43fc-bd76-6830de7f07aa": {"__data__": {"id_": "d262e214-1a4c-43fc-bd76-6830de7f07aa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b6da2aa9ae99c21d4fac204839224e04d47c0135152c8a6be3e015af7be9a3a7"}, "2": {"node_id": "e7cfbd97-3bf4-466a-be88-dc02f4f4dbec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bcc61d121f4d3024171239596c89ebea32eff94c9cbabb74801f244e49cdd825"}}, "hash": "d36b4080bcb976e3c2c653e94b412805fdcae144e71bf39ebe7f6ff4a46547d6", "text": "(124), P. rufilata (69), P. tigrinawesseli (42), P. regalis (38), P. formosa (30), P. fasciata (26), P. ornata (26), P. striata (16), P. miranda (14) and P. subfusca (5). Few wild sourced specimens where reported as originating in a range State and most were imported from Europe. Poecilotheria metallica (Indian endemic) was the most commonly imported species into the USA (7,900 live, of which 253 were wild) and was assessed in 2008 by IUCN as Critically Endangered because its range was limited to <100 km2 which was declining and severely fragmented. Poecilotheria regalis (Indian endemic) was one of the species most commonly imported into the USA (1,700 live, of which 38 were wild) and was assessed in 2008 by IUCN as Least Concern as it was widely distributed in India and although its available habitat was known to be shrinking and faced several threats, it was considered one of the most abundant of all Poecilotheria species. Poecilotheria hanumavilasumica (first described in 2004) was assessed as Critically Endangered in 2008 due to a limited distribution (<6 km2) and continuing decline in area, quality, populations and number of mature individuals. In 2015, this species was discovered in Sri Lanka, extending its known range. A total of 114 live specimens (all reported as captive-bred) were imported into the USA between 2008 and 2017.

Several other threatened species were reported in trade, most of which was reportedly captive-bred, although some limited wild trade was reported and for some species international trade was said at the time to be a threat although it is not known if this is still the case. Some species of Poecilotheria appear to be morphologically distinct, such as P. metallica and could be easily identified by enforcement authorities. However, other species such as IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 46 268 P. hanumavilasumica closely resemble other species and could pose challenges in enforcement. The ventral leg markings of the species are the primary identifiers of most species, leg-banding patterns appear to be relatively conserved with little intra-specific variation between individuals and the taxonomy of the group is unresolved. Analysis: Information on the historical and current wild population sizes of Poecilotheria species is lacking and therefore population trends are unknown, although most populations are believed to be fragmented with limited ranges. Poecilotheria are currently protected in Sri Lanka, but can be legally collected in India outside of protected areas. Available information indicates that the main threat faced by Poecilotheria species is habitat loss and fragmentation. Of the species which appear in international trade, at least one, P. regalis is widespread and considered by IUCN to be Least Concern. The USA is thought to be one of the main markets (as well as Europe). Based on US import data, trade in wild specimens is low and it is unlikely the species meets the criteria for inclusion in Appendix II. Other species such as P. hanumavilasumica and P. metallica have restricted ranges and declining habitat and may already meet the biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I, although much of the trade into the USA is reported to be from captive-bred sources and therefore it is unclear what impact trade is having on these species in the wild. It would seem to be precautionary to list these two species in Appendix II. Species within this genus are distinguished through their leg-banding patterns. P. metallica could be easily identified by enforcement authorities, whereas P. hanumavilasumica closely resembles other species including P. fasciata and P. striata. It is also likely that the taxonomy will continue to evolve. Thus, if Parties consider P. hanumavilasumica and P. metallica to meet the criteria for inclusion in Appendix II, then it would be deemed appropriate to list the genus in order to facilitate implementation. Other Considerations: If the proposal is rejected, the range States could consider an Appendix-III listing for their species. In this case stipulating a zero-export quota for wild specimens with the listing for Sri Lanka would reflect that export from there is illegal.

A study in 2000 (Molur, 2003) in India found specimens of Poecilotheria in habitats including teak plantations, banana plantations, primary evergreen forest, secondary moist and dry deciduous forest, highly degraded secondary forest and human settlements. There is a lack of data on the distribution and biology of Poecilotheria; however, it is assumed that many species in the genus have decreasing populations based on habitat loss and degradation. Recent studies have attempted to gain a better understanding on Poecilotheria population and distribution. In Sri Lanka one study looked at the occurrence of species across sites (selected for their likelihood of being appropriate habitat) using a capture and release method and found only three of 71 sites where no species were observed. In the other 68 sites a total of 112 sightings were made; P. fasciata (61), P. ornata (18), P. subfusca (9), P. smithi (2), P. pederseni (now P. vittata (7)) and P. hanumavilasumica (3) were recorded. This survey recorded two tarantulas which had not been previously described and considered likely to be new species (Nanayakkara et al., 2012). The known distribution for some species such as P. smithi, P. striata and P. hanumavilasumica are larger than previous estimates (Nanayakkara et al., 2013, Siliwal et al., 2013 & Nanayakkara et al., 2015). Poecilotheria hanumavilasumica is currently categorised as Critically Endangered by IUCN (2008) due to its limited distribution which is now known to extend across two range States. Although it was noted that the collection of females and the killing of males by locals could have serious consequences on the populations, more studies are necessary to determine the impacts of harvests and habitat change on Poecilotheria densities (Molur, 2003). Poecilotheria are considered to be affected by habitat loss and fragmentation. Collection of these spiders from the wild may have a significant effect on wild populations; the loss of individuals from a single location or population could significantly decrease the genetic diversity of the species and make the survival of that population more vulnerable to natural or anthropogenic threats. It appears that some species may adapt better than others to changing habitats, for example Poecilotheria regalis was observed in mixed vegetation, primary and secondary forests but did not adapt well to degraded habitats (Molur et al., 2004). The 15 species of Poecilotheria listed on the World Spider Catalog (2019) (which match those in the SS) have not been molecularly researched to determine if some of these species are synonymous and thus could potentially extend a senior synonym\u2019s species range by the combination of two or more species (R. West, in litt., 2019). Surveys have also found Poecilotheria species which could not be confidently assigned to any of the known species, which artificially increases the range of current described species (S. Henriques, in litt., 2019). Trade Poecilotheria are valued in the pet trade with main destination markets in Europe and America. Captive-bred specimens have consistently made up most of the trade over those declared as wild-origin. Between 2006 and 2017, the USA imported 22,918 live individuals of Poecilotheria spp. Poecilotheria metallica, P. regalis, P. ornata and P. rufilata were the most commonly traded species and a large majority were imported from European countries. From 2013-2017, the most recent 5-year period with complete data, the number of declared imports of Poecilotheria spp. was 16,510 and the number of declared exports was 145. The demand for specimens of this genus has risen considerably over the past three decades.

Henriques & E. Cooper, in litt., 2019). A documented case of wild-caught species used for parental captive stock was for the species P. regalis (Gabriel et al., 2011a), which is found in India and was assessed by IUCN (2014) as Least Concern. Poecilotheria spp. are not a protected species in India and therefore collection of individuals outside of protected areas is legal. 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 No. of Individuals W F C IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 46 271 The following species (in order of trade levels) are those that are most in trade and/or threatened (all US import data is from LEMIS): Poecilotheria metallica: Assessed as Critically Endangered in 2008, because its range was limited to <100 km\u00b2 in a single location (despite surveys conducted in adjacent areas) and continuing decline in habitat quality (Molur et al., 2008). The species was rediscovered in 2001, after 102 years from the last observation in the wild. The habitat where the species occurs is completely degraded and under intense pressure from the surrounding villages as well as from insurgents (Molur et al., 2008). A total of 7,900 live specimens were imported into the USA between 2008 and 2017: 253 of which were wild and 7,647 captive-bred. An incident of smuggling was recorded in 2002 when two Europeans took a few specimens out of the country and advertised them for sale on the internet. There are also reports available of other such incidents since then (Molur et al., 2008). Since 2001 it is said to have been successfully bred in captivity (Dye, 2012) and appears easier to breed than other species of Poecilotheria (although there have been documented cases of cannibalism when rearing spiderlings (Gabriel, 2011b)). Poecilotheria regalis: Assessed as Least Concern in 2008, as it is widely distributed in India, throughout northern Western Ghats and present in a few locations in the Eastern Ghats (Molur et al., 2008) Is considered to have the widest distribution of Poecilotheria spp. and possibly the species with the longest and most extensive captive breeding history (S. Henriques, in litt., 2019). The known and inferred extent of occurrence for P. regalis is estimated to be >50,000 km2 and area of occupancy is likely to be >2,000 km2 (Molur et al., 2008). This species has been found to utilize various wooded habitats, from medium to old-growth teak plantations, primary forest in addition to severely degraded forest and banana plantation (although based on one specimen).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "37ca3cff-3be6-49d3-8005-cbe55b86e1b6": {"__data__": {"id_": "37ca3cff-3be6-49d3-8005-cbe55b86e1b6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4b7fab651cedea7812048277edf06c94f01a4d821a3db61c47eaddd93001db1d"}, "2": {"node_id": "40155463-16fb-498e-a67d-790ac12cd5b7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2a72c32540260e161f36f95f63ee17b1e159efdc946ae945154d0e0b037f5b91"}}, "hash": "df3a437a21a371b3f331590f4f40e4d1eb1f644805753c6fc6c10d092b918f35", "text": "It appears to have adapted to changing habitats but does not do well in degraded habitats (Molur et al, 2004).

This species was introduced to the hobby from a parental stock of approximately 16-19 individuals which were exported to Germany, most of the captive stock has been produced from these original specimens (Gabriel, 2012). A total of 1,374 live specimens were imported into the USA between 2008 and 2017: 26 of which were wild and 1,347 were captive-bred and 1 captive-born. Poecilotheria rufilata: Assessed as Endangered in 2008. The species is limited to fewer than five fragmented locations in the southern Western Ghats, and the area of occupancy is estimated to be less than 2,000 km2. Population information is not available, but it is said to be decreasing. The species suffers from the threats of habitat degradation and loss and is sometimes killed by humans, in addition to collection for the international pet trade (Siliwal et al., 2008). A total of 1,218 live specimens were imported into the USA between 2008 and 2017: of which 69 were wild and 1,149 captive-bred. There are conflicting reports on how easy the species is to breed: with some considering that it requires a continuous influx of wild individuals (Siliwal et al., 2008), and others reporting that can be easily bred in captivity (Gabriel, 2012). Poecilotheria tigrinawesseli: Assessed as Data Deficient in 2008. This species is endemic to India and recorded from only six locations in the Eastern Ghats (Siliwal et al., 2008). The extent of occurrence encompassing known and inferred distribution is more than 20,000 km2 and the area of occupancy is unknown. This species suffers from the threat of habitat loss which is considered a general threat in the Eastern Ghats. A total of 932 live specimens were imported into the USA for the purpose of commercial trade between 2008 and 2017: 42 of which were wild and 890 captive-bred. Poecilotheria miranda: P. miranda was assessed as Endangered in 2008 as it is recorded only from a few locations in the Chhota Nagpur region (area of occupancy <less than 2,000 km\u00b2) (Siliwal et al., 2008). Threats include severe fragmentation, loss of habitat, loss of habitat quality, and indiscriminate collections by several European pet traders. A total of 838 live specimens were imported into the USA between 2008 and 2017: 14 of which were wild and 824 captive-bred. Poecilotheria formosa: Assessed as Endangered in 2008 as it was known from only three sites in two areas of the highly degraded Eastern Ghats. The species has a small range and its extent of occurrence (less than 5,000 km\u00b2) and area of occupancy (less than 500 km\u00b2) was limited due to past and continuing decline in the extent, area and quality of habitat. The population is additionally affected by factors including human interference in the form of persecution, collection for pet trade and other developmental activities (Molur et al., 2008). Collection for IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 46 272 international trade is considered an additional pressure. A total of 539 live specimens were imported into the USA between 2008 and 2017: 30 of which were wild and 509 captive-bred. Poecilotheria fasciata: Assessed as endangered in the Sri Lanka National Red List (2012) (MOE, 2012). It is found to occur in forests below 200m elevation in Sri Lanka\u2019s dry and intermediate zones north of Colombo and is estimated to occupy an area of <500 km2 of its range (MOE, 2012). It has been documented to occupy coconut plantations however, this colonization was considered a result of a drought and pressure on their traditional habitat located adjacent to the coconut plantation (Smith et al., 2001). Poecilotheria fasciata are one of the easiest Poecilotheria species to breed in captivity (Gabriel, 2005a). A total of 481 live specimens were imported into the USA between 2008 and 2017: 26 of which were wild and 455 captive-bred.

A total of 344 live specimens were imported into the USA between 2008 and 2017: all reported to be captive-bred. Poecilotheria vittata: Poecilotheria vittata has been assessed as endangered in the Sri Lanka National Red List (2012) (MOE, 2012) and is reported to be present in both India and Sri Lanka, although exact distribution is unknown (Dhali et al., 2016). Poecilotheria vittata was removed from the synonymy with Poecilotheria striata and is now considered to be the parent synonym of Poecilotheria pederseni (Gabriel & Gallon, 2013). All reported trade of P. vittata into the USA are reported as P. pederseni. A total of 248 live specimens were imported into the USA between 2008 and 2017: all of which were reported to be captive-bred. Poecilotheria hanumavilasumica: Assessed as Critically Endangered in 2008 (requires updating) due to small distribution, and continuing decline in the quality and extent of available habitat, populations and mature individuals. This species was first described in 2004 (Smith, 2004) and was believed to be limited to a few tamarind, casuarina and mix dry deciduous tree and palm plantations (all on private land) on the island of Rameshwaram and on the mainland close to the island (Siliwal et al., 2008). In 2015 Nanayakkara et al. (2015) discovered P. hanumavilasumica present on the island of Mannar in Sri Lanka, extending the known range for this species. With the new localities discovered P. hanumavilasumica has been recorded from eight subpopulations and <15 severely fragmented locations (Nanayakkara et al., 2015). Although not found extensively in pet trade, a few adult males and females along with subadults and juveniles were taken out of the country (Siliwal et al., 2008). A total of 114 live specimens were imported into the USA 2008 and 2017: all were reported as captive-bred. Poecilotheria subfusca: Assessed as endangered in 2012 under Sri Lanka\u2019s National Red List Assessment (MOE, 2012) and is endemic to Sri Lanka. It is found to occur in Central Province of Sri Lanka (Smith et al., 2002). The species suffers from threats of habitat loss and degradation due to intensive agricultural activity and illegal firewood collection (Smith et al., 2002). A total of 74 live specimens were imported into the USA between 2008 and 2017: 5 of which were wild and 69 captive-bred. Much of what is known about the biology of the genus has been observed in captive specimens, and large knowledge gaps remain. Though many Poecilotheria specimens are declared captive-bred and many pet traders advertise their spiders to be captive-bred, according to the Supporting Statement the low reproductive rate of this genus (Poecilotheria females in general have low reproductive rates, producing an average of only 100 eggs per yearly egg sac) and the restricted gene pool of the captive population have made attempts to breed them in high numbers unsuccessful. However, there has been both published documentation on observations of Poecilotheria breeding in captivity and Poecilotheria species are commonly bred in captivity by amateur hobbyists as well as vendors and are available as captive-bred young in the pet trade in the USA, Europe and elsewhere (USFWS, 2018). It appears that the captive breeding of Poecilotheria is generally successful and the whole genus has been bred, most species are considered easy to breed (J. Wu, in litt., 2019). Although the number of individuals bred in captivity is likely enough to sustain the overall demand of some of the species, logistical and genetic issues might make sustainable captive reared populations of some species unfeasible or unpractical while sought after morphological and genetic diversity makes wild parental stock appealing to breeders (S. Henriques, in litt., 2019).

Sri Lanka stated their intention to list the genus in Appendix III (USWFS, 2018) but it does not appear this has been done. India: The Indian Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 (WLPA) provides for the protection of animals and plants to ensure the ecological and environmental security of India. This legislation establishes protected areas, regulates trade in wildlife parts and products, and provides a framework to regulate hunting and to protect and manage wildlife habitats. The WLPA does not currently list any Poecilotheria as protected. Protected areas established under the Act; such as National Parks, prohibit use of wildlife resources and collection in these areas would be illegal. Sri Lanka: The primary legislation for the protection of wildlife and plant species is the Fauna and Flora Protection (Amendment) Act, No. 22 of 2009, part of the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance of Sri Lanka. The FFPA affords protection of habitat and wildlife through designation of protected areas and provides protection for certain species outside of protected areas. Under the FFPA, commercial collection and export of Poecilotheria species is prohibited. Though Sri Lanka has a legislative framework for the conservation of this genus, enforcement is said to be weak. Poecilotheria is currently not protected by international legislation. In the USA, five species of this genus were listed as Endangered under the United States Endangered Species Act in 2018; P. subfusca, P. ornata, P. vittata, P. smithi and P. fasciata, all of which are found in Sri Lanka. It is unlawful for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the USA to import into and export from the USA any listed species, or its parts or products, posses, sell or deliver listed species taken in violation of the Endangered Species Act. A person would require a permit to import or export any specimen of Poecilotheria (USFWS, 2018). Several populations of Poecilotheria spp. are found in or near protected areas in India. The first invertebrate sanctuary in India has been proposed by the Zoo Outreach Organization and WILD for the protection of P. hanumavilasumica. The proposed Rameswaram Tiger-Spider Sanctuary would protect the largest population of the species in its 6 km2 range. Artificial Propagation/captive breeding A hobbyist describes the difficulties of breeding Poecilotheria, specifically P. smithi and P. subfusca in captivity in 2005 (Jacobi, 2005). However, there has been more recent evidence that there has been much success in breeding this genus in captivity (USFWS, 2018). Most of what is known on the biology and ecology of this species has been attributed to captive breeding. All Poecilotheria (except for P. ornata and potentially P. metallica) can be kept with their mother or reared together in social groups (Gabriel, 2012). There have been documented cases of hybridization within captive breeding activities that result in different colour variants of the parental stock (Gabriel, 2012). The following species are said to be bred in captivity: P. regalis (Gabriel, 2005a, Gabriel, 2011a), P. smithi (Gabriel et al., 2005b), P. metallica (Dye, 2012), P. formosa (Gabriel, 2011b), P. ornata (Gallon, 2012, Gabriel, 2005a), P. subfusca (Bustard, 1995), P. rufilata (Gabriel, 2012), P. fasciata (Gabriel, 2005a), P. miranda (Gabriel, 2011b) and P. tigrinawesseli (Gabriel, 2011b). Implementation challenges (including similar species) Unresolved taxonomy as well as similarity in appearance of many Poecilotheria species mean for implementation purposes the entire genus should be listed. Some species within this genus appear to be morphologically distinct such as P. metallica and could be easily identified by enforcement authorities. However, some species such as P. hanumavilasumica closely resembles other species and is recognised to have one of the smallest and most vulnerable ranges (S. Longhorn, in litt., 2019).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "832f19d9-1577-4d32-a014-3d0015cc62a4": {"__data__": {"id_": "832f19d9-1577-4d32-a014-3d0015cc62a4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cbc47c75462d489c90d566f786d4abebefb805f121310d641e8b966390f1ab63"}, "2": {"node_id": "f520e37e-7969-4f31-912c-6827954693ce", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d97e4663fb060e98b68892a010c6898994f724bd36b081fde6c5c229c3100462"}}, "hash": "15745a0bc600948a3dbfab6981f627f72f0cb36ab378b763be3474853cd40ca6", "text": "The ventral leg markings of the species are the primary identifiers of each species, leg-banding patterns appear to be relatively conserved with little intra-specific variation between IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 46 274 individuals of captive-bred stock as the majority of these individuals are derived from a small sample of wild populations (Morra, 2013).

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 47 Inclusion of Mindoro Peacock Swallowtail Achillides chikae hermeli in Appendix I Proponent: European Union and Philippines Summary: This proposal recommends the inclusion of Mindoro Peacock Swallowtail Achillides chikae hermeli in Appendix I, and the adoption of a new standard taxonomic reference for Papilionidae (swallowtail butterflies) in the Philippines. This Mindoro Peacock Swallowtail was discovered in 1992 on Mindoro Island in the Philippines and upon its discovery it was named as Papilio hermeli. A very similar butterfly the Luzon Peacock Butterfly was already known from Luzon Island, adjacent to Mindoro. The Luzon Peacock Butterfly currently designated Papilio chikae was included in Appendix I in 1987. It is one of three species in the genus Papilio currently listed in the Appendices. Some taxonomists consider these two populations to be subspecies of the same species. Some also consider these and other species of East Asian swallowtails to belong to a separate genus Achillides, which otherwise is considered a subgenus of Papilio. The Proponents recommend the adoption of Page and Treadaway (2004) as a standard taxonomic reference for Papilionidae in the Philippines, a source that recognises Achillides as a separate genus, and that considers the two populations to be subspecies of the same species (Achillides chikae chikae and Achillides chikae hermeli).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f5c2e14d-f583-4415-baf9-7fc5cd620dc0": {"__data__": {"id_": "f5c2e14d-f583-4415-baf9-7fc5cd620dc0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e61e777d8b80076ce9f143096587cbd57cd711c78f6f9baff5e5a79653bf78aa"}, "2": {"node_id": "ff1e4240-3e28-4886-849c-f091ce1c81e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "51db5c2784b79c3fc3284736d20517b388f3b2d6ca1b71efb51de1766c750e22"}}, "hash": "639c6b77eda6ff78a93d084518f54f92f36b3a9666cf012988916fcd201e2513", "text": "Having consulted the Animals Committee Nomenclature Specialist, the Proponents state that the adoption of Page and Treadaway (2004) would have the effect of changing the current listing of Papilio chikae in Appendix I to Achillides chikae chikae. They also propose including the Mindoro population, considered as Achillides chikae hermeli by Page and Treadaway (2004), in the Appendices on the basis that it closely resembles Papilio chikae. Although the lookalike criterion in Annex 2bA of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) allow for listing in Appendix II on that basis, the proponents seek to list this taxon in Appendix I, citing as justification Res. Conf. 12.11 (Rev. CoP17), which recommends that in the case of subspecies: b) where there are identification difficulties, the problem be approached by either including the entire species in Appendix I or Appendix II or by circumscribing the range of the subspecies warranting protection and listing the populations within this area on a country basis. Achillides chikae hermeli is found in two separate mountain masses (Mt. Halcon and Mt. Baco) on the island of Mindoro in the Philippines. Page and Treadaway (2004) described it as being observed from 1800-2400 m on Mt Halcon. Its habitat of montane forests has been decreasing and is fragmented in some parts. The taxon was considered to be rare but with a \u2018probably stable\u2019 population soon after it was described. It has not yet been assessed by IUCN. As a species, Achillides chikae (including Papilio chikae and A. c. hermeli) is said to be a very local butterfly with a tendency to concentrate in certain localities. All swallowtail butterflies are protected in the Philippines, with trade managed through permits of which none have been issued for this taxon, and therefore all trade is presumably illegal. Achillides are considered popular among collectors, naturalists and researchers, and P. chikae [A. c. chikae] is reported to be amongst the most beautiful and desirable. Both A. c. hermeli and Papilio chikae [A. c. chikae] have been found offered for sale online within the Philippines and non-range States. Instances of illegal trade have been noted with indications that specimens of P. chikae [A. c. chikae] have been traded under the name \u201cP. hermeli\u201d or A. c. hermeli.

It is recommended in the case of subspecies where there are identification difficulties that the problem be approached by either including the entire species in Appendix I or Appendix II or by circumscribing the range of the subspecies warranting protection and listing the populations within this area on a country basis. Given that A. c. hermeli is considered to meet the criteria in Annex 2b as a lookalike, listing both the subspecies in Appendix I, and thus resulting in the full species Achillides chikae would appear to be in line with the recommendations in Res. Conf. 12.11 (Rev. CoP17). Achillides chikae hermeli is endemic to the Philippines with a restricted distribution on Mindoro Island and decreasing habitat and remaining natural forest reported to be fragmented and largely confined to higher altitudes. There is little population information and it was considered rare although with a population that was \u2018probably stable\u2019 soon after it was described.

Despite being nationally protected in the Philippines, both A. c. hermeli and Papilio chikae [A. c. chikae] have been found offered for sale on the internet. A short survey of online trade in A. c. hermeli and Papilio chikae [A. c. chikae] was undertaken on 10th October 2018, with 18 offers of sale found from sellers within the Philippines, Europe, US, Canada, Taiwan PoC, Thailand and the Russian Federation. Sale of specimens of Papilio chikae offered as hermeli have been discussed on an online hobbyist website. A total of three specimens offered as hermeli have been observed for sale on eBay and prices were ranging between $50-$70 (eBay, 2019). In recent years, EU Member State Authorities have come across multiple cases where traders offered to import into the EU specimens of Papilio chikae [A. c. chikae] mislabelled as Papilio chikae hermeli [A. c. hermeli], apparently exploiting the inability of customs officers to distinguish the taxa during border controls, for example: - Two specimens of Papilio chikae chikae [A. c. chikae] falsely described as hermeli were confiscated by UK police in 2018 and are in the process of being formerly seized by UK Border Force. - Illegal trade in Papilio chikae [A. c. chikae] under the name of Papilio hermeli was also reported by the Swedish Management Authority. One Philippine trader reported that 300-500 individuals of \u201cPapilio chikae\u201d could be sourced annually. The magnitude of the illegal trade is unclear. The impact of international trade on Papilio chikae [A. c. chikae] and Achillides chikae hermeli is unknown. Additional Information Threats Achillides are considered popular among collectors, naturalists and researchers. Papilio chikae [A. c. chikae] (which A. c. hermeli closely resembles) was reported to be among the most beautiful and desirable members of Papilionidae. Due to its slow flight and attraction to decoys, it was considered to be easily captured. Specific threats to Achillides chikae hermeli have not been documented. However, threats to the Iglit-Baco Mountains Important Bird Area (IBA) were reported to include cattle ranching, upland farming and collection of firewood, resulting in rapid deforestation, both within and outside of Mt. Iglit-Baco National Park. Conservation, management and legislation National All swallowtail butterflies in the Philippines are protected under the Wildlife Resource Conservation and Protection Act of 2001, and any collection and trade must be managed through a permitting system. Republic Act 7586 (1992) prohibits the hunting, destruction, disturbance or possession of any plants or animals, or derived products, from protected areas without a permit from the Management Board; violations are subject to a fine of P5,000-500,000 (ca.

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 48 Inclusion of Riverside Swallowtail Parides burchellanus in Appendix I Proponent: Brazil Summary: The Riverside Swallowtail Parides burchellanus is endemic to Brazil. It is found along river margins and in riparian gallery forests within the Cerrado region, a relatively scarce habitat that is influenced heavily by anthropogenic factors. The species was assessed in 2018 as Endangered, considering the discovery of a subpopulation around the Serra da Canastra National Park, and is considered critically endangered in the Brazilian List of Threatened Species. The species occurs in three districts of eastern Brazil; Distrito Federal, Minas Gerais and Goi\u00e1s, and is known from no more than four distinct areas or subpopulations. These subpopulations are spatially restricted, and the population overall is severely fragmented and in decline. Individuals have a limited ability to disperse and move only a few hundred metres along rivers, there is no natural connection between the four known subpopulations. The overall population size is unknown, but known subpopulations are very small, with numbers reaching up to 50 individuals, but more commonly around 30 individuals. The species\u2019 area of occupancy is currently estimated to be 120 km\u00b2 based on known localities and is unlikely to extend beyond 500 km2. The Cerrado habitat, which P. burchellanus relies on exclusively, is under threat from ongoing habitat loss and degradation: Cerrado habitat is estimated to have lost more than half of its original vegetation for farming for crops, cattle-raising activities, energy generation and urbanisation.

Local extinctions have been observed, caused by habitat degradation. Specimens of P. burchellanus appear within international trade with specimens offered for sale online at high prices. Parides burchellanus is protected under Brazilian legislation and the capture of specimens is prohibited, therefore trade observed for this species is assumed to be illegal. Analysis: The total population is unknown for Parides burchellanus, although subpopulations are estimated to be very small and persist in only four localities that are spatially restricted, severely fragmented and in decline. Some localised extinctions in subpopulations have been observed. Overall population trend data are unavailable however some subpopulations are inferred to be declining due to habitat degradation. Low resilience to extrinsic factors such as habitat loss and flooding events have been observed for this species. There is evidence for international trade in pinned specimens of P. burchellanus, which is believed to be illegal. Although little is known of the population overall, it seems likely that the restricted distribution and fragmented range, very small subpopulations, threats to the habitat and vulnerability due to its specialised niche requirements mean that Parides burchellanus meets the criteria in Annex 1 of Res.

Range Brazil IUCN Global Category Endangered B2ab(iii) (2018) ver 3.1. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 48 281 Biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I A) Small wild population The species is categorised under Brazil\u2019s National Red List assessment as critically endangered (Andr\u00e9 et al., 2018). Occurrences are clustered into four disjunct areas that are so far apart that genetic exchange is not possible (Grice et al., 2018). Parides burchellanus occurs in spatially limited and fragmented colonies and known populations generally have up to 50 individuals, more commonly fewer than 30 (Andr\u00e9 et al., 2018). The current known subpopulations of the species include Planaltina (Distrito Federal), Planaltina de Goi\u00e1s (upper Maranh\u00e3o River), the region around Brumadinho, near Belo Horizonte (State of Minas Gerais) and the area around Serra da Canastra National Park (State of Minas Gerais), and are discussed in more detail below: Brumadinho (State of Minas Gerais) It is estimated that the local population size in Brumadinho is 10\u201340 mature individuals over an area of 1.5 km x 30 m. In 2002, a population discovered along the Catarina River in Brumadinho, Minas Gerais was described as \u201cvigorous\u201d and consisted of more than 50 adults (Mielke et al., 2004). In 2012 three resident populations were identified in Brumadinho (Beir\u00e3o et al., 2012). This population is particularly vulnerable due to habitat loss and degradation. Serra da Canastra National Park (State of Minas Gerais) In 2013, several populations were observed along the S\u00e3o Francisco and Araguari rivers in the State of Minas Gerais, within the municipalities of Campos Altos, Perdizes, Arax\u00e1, Ibi\u00e1, S\u00e3o Roque de Minas, Tapira\u00ed, Medeiros, Vergem Bonita and Tapira (Grice et al., 2018). In 2015, the species was recorded at a new locality in south- western Minas Gerais, in areas of the upper S\u00e3o Francisco and Araguari River systems, including the Parque National da Serra da Canastra and from the preliminary data collected the number of mature individuals was estimated to be 50 (Bed\u00ea et al., 2015). As there were no previous records of this species present at this locality, data to determine whether this population is in decline are lacking. Planaltina (Distrito Federal) In Planaltina it is estimated the local population size is 10\u201340 mature individuals over an area of 2.2 km x 30 m. This population is particularly vulnerable due to habitat loss and degradation, especially near the city of Bras\u00edlia. Planaltina de Goi\u00e1s (State of Goi\u00e1s) In Planaltina de Goi\u00e1s Parides burchellanus is found in the upper Maranh\u00e3o River (Andr\u00e9 et al., 2018). B) Restricted area of distribution This species exists along river margins and in riparian gallery forests in the Cerrado region in Brazil at altitudes between 800 m and 1,100 m. This species has a restricted distribution and its current area of occupancy is estimated to be around 120 km2 based on known localities, and unlikely to extend beyond 500 km2 in total. Individuals were found in only seven out of 36 localities within its potential area of occupancy. This species moves only a few hundred metres along the rivers being unable to cross large distances. There is no natural connection between the three known subpopulations. This species exhibits high levels of foodplant and habitat specificity and the only reported larval host plant Aristolochia chamissonis (found in shaded patches of undisturbed stream and riverbank habitats) is sparsely distributed (Bed\u00ea et al., 2015) and associated with fragile and vulnerable environments (Andr\u00e9 et al., 2018), which could explain P. burchellanus\u2019 limited distribution.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1d67b0a4-7849-4e9d-bddf-7b65603631d0": {"__data__": {"id_": "1d67b0a4-7849-4e9d-bddf-7b65603631d0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fb4b6e9b6287a3f7199babd0fb7b6e3f6e56dcf4ad309c8bce5e21a37e7e3e99"}, "2": {"node_id": "d78e9e3b-aeb0-4e75-8706-c45f4512a48e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9ff4364cc5d476222397d1a3c88d16d44898e7a2d86581eaaadfaeac5e51241c"}}, "hash": "f1bc92afcc388f5983d02f3eeb457e54ea52805bc5aec3b45a2024c2dd4a6f6d", "text": "There has been a reduction in its Extent of Occurrence (EOO) due to the local extinction of the populations formerly known from the North of S\u00e3o Paulo and Southwest Minas Gerais.

Extensive surveys have been conducted throughout the species\u2019 range and found that the species was absent from several sites that had apparently suitable habitats and presence of the host plant A. chamissonis (Beir\u00e3o et al., 2012). Of the total 63 surveyed sites, which were selected due to the availability of suitable habitat, P. burchellanus was only found to be present in seven sites (Beir\u00e3o et al., 2012).

Furthermore, it is estimated that only 6% of this land area is protected (Fran\u00e7oso et al., 2015). IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 48 282 There are historical records of this species in areas that have now been altered including; Sobradinho, An\u00e1polis, Carmo do Rio Claro, Matosinhos (Rio das Velhas), Uberaba (Farinha Podre) and Batarais and Bauru. However, due to flooding events, habitat alteration and loss, these populations are now locally extinct (Bed\u00ea et al., 2015). There have been no recent records in any of these locations (Andr\u00e9 et al., 2018). There is evidence that this species has experienced an historical rate of decline and has been extirpated from previously known localities within its range, partly due to the species\u2019 low resilience to extrinsic factors, such as flooding and deforestation (Bed\u00ea et al., 2015). Due to a lack of population data, it is unclear if this species is currently experiencing ongoing population decline (M. Bohm in litt., 2019). The National Red List assessment (2018) infers that the best studied population located in Brumadinho is declining due to the degradation of gallery forest (Andr\u00e9 et al., 2018). Trade criteria for inclusion in Appendix I The species is or may be affected by trade In Brazil, this species is listed as critically endangered and its commerce is forbidden. The Brazilian Administrative Authority (IBAMA) has no record of authorized exports in the last ten years. However, the offer for sale of pinned specimens (the only commodity known in international trade) has been observed outside Brazil, on international market sites. According to the figures provided in the Supporting Statement a total of 19 specimens were observed for sale in international markets in December 2018, with no mention as to whether they were wild-sourced. Advertisements were observed in Spain and Argentina and prices ranged from USD 455 to over USD 3,330 per specimen. This species can be seen advertised online for very large sums of money (between USD 900 and USD 2,800 per specimen) (N. M. Collins in litt., 2019). Considering the high prices that specimens of this species demand within international trade, indiscriminate collection is likely to occur unless safeguards are put in place (M. Bohm, in litt., 2019). Additional Information Threats Fragmentation and change of its natural habitat and deforestation of gallery forests, mainly as a result of agriculture, fire and urbanisation, represent the main threats. Pollution of streams is also a strong threat, as the occurrence of the species is associated with water courses. Parides burchellanus only occurs in the riparian forest, flying near the river and rarely along the forest edges, they have low dispersal rates and high habitat specificity, and some populations have also been observed to exhibit male-biased sex ratios (Beir\u00e3o et al., 2018). The ecology and life history of this species make it vulnerable to the removal of individuals from the population to supply international trade (M. Bohm, in litt., 2019). Conservation, management and legislation The capture of these specimens is subject to Brazilian legislation, which allows only research and conservation actions authorised by the environmental agencies (IBAMA). This species is not currently protected by international legislation. Several actions for conservation were developed from 2010 to 2015 under the National Action Plan for the conservation of Lepidoptera Threatened with Extinction (e.g. conservation of its habitat and water courses, as well as proposals for the creation of protected areas in Brumadinho, etc.). This species is present in three protected areas. Some localities that contain populations border the Parque Nacional da Serra da Canastra however the level of protection afforded by proximity to this national park is likely to be insufficient (Grice et al., 2018). Artificial propagation/captive breeding There are currently no ex-situ breeding programmes for Parides burchellanus. Belo Horizonte Zoo had a conservation programme in which it developed ex-situ reproduction techniques for Parides burchellanus, but the programme was discontinued in 2012. Reintroduction and population supplementation actions in the former areas of occurrence were considered difficult because the habitat is in an advanced stage of degradation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "71b95a6b-04aa-4a74-a906-87153b2d0e6c": {"__data__": {"id_": "71b95a6b-04aa-4a74-a906-87153b2d0e6c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fcfdbdb1e53994f9c73e6918db38c84b96597f832a7efe5b8d4f5ce2651b6fe1"}, "2": {"node_id": "56bac833-914e-4ef1-9368-c6358cd94bf6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9f32466598f3e2092dc03dda073eec949550492a3fc334cb8751bce5ec7fde89"}}, "hash": "4b141c5dae384631d1d7e8d3e827120dae717504f5e5f32e457f781756c76c06", "text": "Other comments If this proposal to list Parides burchellanus is accepted, regulation of other species may need to be considered in the future\u2014for example, Parides panthonus (also native to Brazil, as well as Guyana, French Guiana and Suriname) is known to be offered for sale internationally and looks similar to P. burchellanus (N.

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 49 Inclusion of Trumpet Trees Handroanthus spp., Tabebuia spp. and Roseodendron spp. in Appendix II with annotation #6 Proponent: Brazil Summary: Handroanthus, Tabebuia and Roseodendron are genera of Bignoniaceae distributed from southern USA to Argentina and Chile, including the Caribbean. There are currently 106 recognised species across the three genera (30 in Handroanthus, 73 in Tabebuia and 3 in Roseodendron). The three genera were previously recognised as belonging to a single genus (Tabebuia) but were split in 2007 based on genetic studies, and new species continue to be described. There is considerable confusion in the taxonomy and nomenclature of the three genera with differing names used in the literature and in reported trade. Species within these genera produce a very hard, heavy and durable wood that is used locally in the construction of houses and bridges, flooring, decking and handicrafts. Internationally it is one of the preferred timbers for decking. The wood is marketed with the same common name (ip\u00ea); distinguishing between species and between genera is reportedly difficult even at the microscopic level, and there are no identification guides covering all species. Handroanthus timbers are some of the most valuable in the market, with prices in Brazil reported to be as high as those achieved historically by Big-leaf Mahogany Swietenia macrophylla before commercial exploitation of the latter species was prohibited in the country.

Brazil reportedly exports ip\u00ea to 60 countries, the principal importers being the USA and European countries. Trade from Brazil accounted for 93% of ip\u00ea sawn wood and ca. 87% of ip\u00ea flooring imports by the USA from 2008-2017. All ip\u00ea timber production in Brazil derives from natural populations. Potentially high levels of illegal harvest have been reported in the country, and there are concerns over inappropriate management measures including overestimation of sustainable offtakes, although it is unclear what proportion of illegally harvested timber enters international trade. Handroanthus serratifolius Of ip\u00ea exports reported by Brazil from 2010-2016, 70% (ca. 180,000 m3) were of H. serratifolius. Of the exports of this species, 75% were reported as decking, 16% as sawn wood and the remainder as flooring, clapboards and \u201cother\u201d. The USA and European countries were the major importers. Although annual production of H. serratifolius in Brazil increased by 150% from 2012-2017, reaching 220,000 m3 in 2017, exports of this species decreased from 36,000 m3 in 2012 to 16,000 m3 in 2016. In the years for which both production and export figures are available for H. serratifolius in Brazil (2012-2016), export volumes were ~16% of production volumes. While this may indicate that domestic use exceeds international trade, a 2008 study reported a relatively low processing efficiency for ip\u00ea (42%) suggesting potentially high levels of wastage during processing of exported products. The average yield of this species is estimated at 2.4 m3/ha.

Handroanthus impetiginosus Like H. serratifolius, populations of H. impetiginosus in parts of Brazil have reportedly suffered significant declines through overexploitation, although reported exports of the species from Brazil were relatively low (1,665 m3 from 2010-2016). Exports of H. impetiginosus are also reported by IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 49 285 Venezuela (20,491 m\u00b3 from 2007-2017). The species was categorised globally as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List in 1998, although exploitation was considered to have contributed to population declines, particularly in Brazil. The species is currently categorised as near threatened in Brazil, threatened in Mexico and endangered in Peru. Other species Other species reported in international trade include H. capitatus (6,000 m3 sawn wood exported from Suriname from 2011-2015), H. heptaphyllus (5,000 m3 sawn wood exported from Guyana from 2011- 2015), Roseodendron donnell-smithii (183 m3 sawn wood and 510 roundwood pieces exported from Mexico from 2010-2012), and Tabebuia rosea (exports from Venezuela totalling 29,637 m3 from 2007- 2017 and seizures destined for international export totalling 66 m3 from 2013-2018). It is not clear whether international trade presents a threat to these species. Deforestation for land clearance is reportedly a threat to certain species in parts of their ranges, such as H. chrysanthus in Colombia and T. rosea in Mexico, while in other areas reforestation programs are underway. The proponents seek to include the genera Handroanthus, Tabebuia and Roseodendron in Appendix II with annotation #6 (logs, sawn wood, veneer sheets and plywood). Analysis: Handroanthus, Tabebuia and Roseodendron are genera of New World trees comprising over a hundred species, with new species still being described. The timbers of certain species are in high demand both domestically and internationally, and are reportedly some of the most valuable on the market. Woods of the three genera are marketed with the same common name (Ip\u00ea); distinguishing between the species and genera is reportedly difficult even at the microscopic level. The most highly traded species based on reported data are H. serratifolius and H. impetiginosus, which occur in a number of countries from Mexico to Argentina. While global data on trade are not available, Brazil appears to be the main exporter of ip\u00ea, the majority of which is of H. serratifolius with 15 other species also exported. There are also reports of illegal ip\u00ea harvest and trade taking place in the country. Overexploitation in some areas has reportedly resulted in significant population declines of H. serratifolius and H. impetiginosus which, like other species in these genera, appear to be particularly vulnerable to logging since they do not regenerate easily. On this basis, H. serratifolius and H. impetiginosus may meet the criteria for inclusion in Appendix II in Annex 2a of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17). The remaining species in all three genera would therefore meet the criteria for inclusion in Annex 2b, based on the reported identification difficulties as well as taxonomic and nomenclatural uncertainties. If this proposal is adopted, it is not clear whether the proposed annotation #6 (logs, sawn wood, veneer sheets and plywood) would cover the main commodities that first appear in trade and drive the demand. Decking and flooring accounted for more than three-quarters of Brazil\u2019s reported exports of H. serratifolius from 2010-2016, and Brazilian legislation currently prohibits the export of unfinished wood of native species (although large quantities of sawn wood are also reportedly imported into the USA from Brazil).

Taxonomy Originally, all species of Handroanthus, Tabebuia and Roseodendron were included in the genus Tabebuia. In 2007 it was proposed that Tabebuia be divided into three genera.

Range Handroanthus, Tabebuia and Roseodendron are distributed from southern USA to Argentina and Chile, including the Caribbean. IUCN Global Category (Note that certain species assessed on the IUCN Red List are considered synonyms according to the taxonomy referenced in the proposal (the Plant List), details below.) 17 species of Tabebuia/Handroanthus have been assessed on the IUCN Red List, as follows: Endangered: T. conferta (assessed 2017), T. elongata (assessed 1998) Vulnerable: T. anafensis (considered a synonym of T. myrtifolia in the Plant List; assessed 1998), T. arimaoensis (assessed 1998), T. bibracteolata (assessed 1998), T. dubia (assessed 1998), T. furfuracea (considered a synonym of T. bibracteolata in the Plant List; assessed 1998), T. hypoleuca (assessed 1998), T. jackiana (assessed 1998), T. lapacho (considered a synonym of H. lapacho in the Plant List; assessed 1998), T. oligolepis (considered a synonym of T. shaferi in the Plant List; assessed 1998), T. palustris (assessed 2008), T. polymorpha (assessed 1998), T. shaferi (assessed 1998), T. striata (assessed 1998) Near Threatened: T. platyantha (assessed 1998) Least Concern: T. impetiginosa (considered a synonym of H. impetiginosus in the Plant List; assessed 1998).

It is not possible to maintain timber production at current harvest levels on 30-yr cutting cycles, or even at substantially reduced logging intensities with the current log-and-leave reduced impact (RIL) model, and there appears to be no reason to believe that populations of ip\u00ea subjected to logging are any more resilient than those of mahogany (M. Schulze, in litt., 2019). A study by Richardson & Peres (2016) in Par\u00e1 found no evidence that the post-logging timber species composition and total value of forest stands recovers beyond the first cut, suggesting that the commercially most valuable timber species (including ip\u00ea) become predictably rare or economically extinct in old logging frontiers. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 49 287 Woods of the three genera are marketed with the same common name (ip\u00ea). Most of the Handroanthus species produce a very hard, heavy and durable wood which is used locally in the construction of houses and bridges, pavements, decks, exterior woods and handicrafts. Its dark and dense wood is highly valued for residential decks in the USA; it is described as the internationally preferred timber for decking (Brancalion et al., 2018).

There was a 500% increase from 1998 to 2004 in ip\u00ea timber exports from the Brazilian Amazon (Schulze et al., 2008). Ip\u00ea exports from Brazil are reported to have been almost 256,000m3 between 2010 and 2016, 70% of which were reportedly H. serratifolius (see table below). Most of the ip\u00ea timber harvested in Brazil is reported as H. impetiginosus and H. serratifolius (Schulze et al., 2008). Ip\u00ea wood is exported from Brazil to 60 countries; the main importers are the USA (28% of exported volume, not clear over what time period) and European countries. In Brazil all ip\u00ea wood comes from natural forests, since there are no plantations in the country. The export of unfinished timber of species native to Brazil (i.e. destined to be processed abroad) is prohibited according to Normative Instruction 15/2011 (IBAMA, 2011), amended by Normative Instruction 13/ 2018 (IBAMA, 2018). Between 2010 and 2016, 16 species of ip\u00ea were reportedly exported from Brazil (see Table 1).

(2018), ip\u00ea were by far the species with the strongest evidence of potential fraud in logging permits in Brazil. Only 61% of the 152 trees identified as Handroanthus spp. in logging permits were confirmed during field checking of logged forests. Ip\u00ea trees are quite easy to identify so misidentification can be attributed to fraud. In addition, the diameter of real ip\u00ea trees was frequently overestimated. Inventing trees, duplicating tree numbers, exceeding allowed harvest rates, and felling trees in forbidden zones were also observed, although less frequent. In all of the management areas investigated, there was evidence that the ip\u00ea timber volume reported on the permit could not have been produced from that area alone while following harvest regulations. The apparent substantial overestimation of timber volumes in logging licenses has the potential to significantly impact species like Ip\u00ea (Brancalion et al., 2018). Greenpeace-Brasil (2015), in collaboration with SEMA and Brazil\u2019s Public Prosecutor's Office, carried out a systematic review of all 1,325 extant management plans in Par\u00e1 between 2006 and 2013 to assess the extent to which timber laundering occurred. In total, 746 (56%) plans listed ip\u00ea (H. serratifolius) in their inventories and approximately 14% overestimated volumetric offtakes (3,000 m3 per concession or 60% above the species average of 2.4 m3/ha).

Brazil reported seizures of ip\u00e9 destined for international export totalling 350 m3 in 2016 and 475 m3 in 2018.

Brazil: Forest inventories conducted in the state of Par\u00e1, in the Brazilian Amazon, recorded densities of between 0.2 and 0.4 H. serratifolius trees/ha with DBH \u2265 50 cm. The average yield of this species is estimated at 2.4 m3/ha. The wood production of H. serratifolius in Brazil was 220,000 m3 in 2017, which was 150% higher than in 2012. As noted above, available data on international exports indicate that Brazil is the most significant exporter of ip\u00e9. Exports of H. serratifolius from Brazil from 2010 to 2016 totalled over 180,000 m3, which corresponds to 70% of total exports of ip\u00ea for that period (255,723 m3). Of these exports 75% were reported as decking, 16% sawn wood and the remainder flooring, clapboards or \u201cother\u201d. The main importers were the USA (29%), France (17%) and Belgium (10%). Production and export volumes of H. serraifolius from Brazil are summarised in Figure 3 below (production data not available prior to 2012; export data not available for 2017). The smallest volume was exported in 2010 (~10,000 m3) and the largest in 2012 (36,000 m3); export volumes then decreased up to 2016. Reported exports of H. serratifolius from Brazil were around 16% of total production over the period 2012-2016 (~135,000 m3 and 855,000 m3 respectively) and around 8% of reported production in the country in 2016 (~16,000 m3 and 194,000 m3 respectively). Schulze et al. (2008) cite a processing efficiency of 42% for ip\u00ea and indicate that only 36% of processed ip\u00ea wood meets export standards; the gap between production and exports is therefore at least partly accounted for by inefficient and poor quality processing, the latter potentially indicative of a domestic market for lower quality products. Figure 3: Production and export volumes of H. serraifolius from Brazil reported in the Supporting Statement from 2010-2017 (production data not available prior to 2012; export data not available for 2017). A 2008 study found that all populations of H. serratifolius in the forests of north-eastern Brazil showed drastic population declines, with no evidence of long-term population recovery. At best, only one individual of one of the two species H. serratifolius and H. impetiginosus in each 10 ha could reach adult size, and this could take a century or more. The authors suggest that cutting cycles applied for H. serratifolius in the western Brazilian Amazon may not be sustainable. Shade intolerant seedlings, size class distributions skewed towards large adults, and poor colonisation of logging gaps make populations of this species unlikely to rebound from logging (Schulze, 2003).

Additional Information Threats Over-exploitation is considered a threat, as well as habitat loss. Based on satellite imagery, the total area deforested in the Brazilian Amazon in 2004 was 2.8 million ha. The annual rate of deforestation between 2012 and 2013 was 5.9 million ha, an increase of 28% compared to 2011. Deforestation was driven mainly by the demand for agricultural land. In Colombia, the reduction of forest fragments caused by the expansion of areas for agricultural and livestock use has restricted H. chrysanthus to the drier transition zone of xerophytic scrub vegetation in the south of the country. In Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico, natural populations of T. rosea have decreased considerably due to anthropogenic factors, mainly deforestation for the construction of human settlements combined with obtaining wood, contributing to the reduction of their habitat. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 49 292 Conservation, management and legislation There are broad bans/restrictions on timber logging/export in several range States, examples include: - Brazil: the export of unfinished timber of native species (i.e. destined to be processed abroad) is prohibited according to Normative Instruction 15/2011 (IBAMA, 2011), amended by Normative Instruction 13/ 2018 (IBAMA, 2018). - Bolivia: export of unprocessed forestry products is subject to restrictions and highly regulated, mainly through forest certification (from 1996 onwards, last updated 2016; Forest Legality Initiative, 2016). - Ecuador: there is an export ban on roundwood, except in limited quantities for scientific and experimental purposes, and semi-finished forest product exports are allowed only when \u201cdomestic needs and the minimum levels of industrialization have been met\u201d (from 2005 onwards, last updated 2016; Forest Legality Initiative, 2016). - Peru: there is an export ban on logs and forest products \u201cin their natural state\u201d except when they originate from nurseries or forest plantations, and if they do not require processing for final consumption (from 1972 onwards, last updated 2016; Forest Legality Initiative, 2016). In Ecuador, in vitro cultures are being used to recover endangered species of Handroanthus. Populations of H. chrysanthus and H. billbergii have been recovered mainly by management actions, among them the declared ban on exploitation in 1978. In 2006, Venezuela decreed a ban on exploitation of T. spectabilis. Artificial propagation/captive breeding Various species in this genus are grown in nurseries for forest plantations, reforestation and urban planting throughout the Americas. In Panama, T. rosea was experimented with to reforest degraded areas and the yield was good in all sites. In Venezuela there are plantations of this species in the Barinas and Monagas States. In Jamaica T. rufescens and T. rosea are commonly cultivated. In Mexico there are 62,736 ha of plantations of ip\u00ea of several species, mostly T. rosea (48,748 ha) which is managed in commercial plantations, as well as being used to enrich secondary forests and degraded paddocks.

Implementation challenges (including similar species) Due to the great similarity between the woods of the different species and genera, they are marketed with the same common name (ip\u00ea). The quantitative characteristics of the wood anatomy can present variations between individuals of a species and even within the same individual, so distinguishing species is very difficult. A clear differentiation of the individual species is not possible on either the macroscopic or microscopic level (G. Koch, in litt., 2019). There are no identification guides for all species of the three genera. While the proposal outlines distinguishing characters between the three genera, a clear differentiation between the genera Handroanthus and Tabebuia is not considered possible, especially for non-experts. The species of the genus Roseodendron may be distinguishable from Handroanthus and Tabebuia on the microscopic level (with relevant reference samples and expertise). However, based on the very complex taxonomy of the three genera with many synonyms, a clear and assured differentiation may be difficult in practice (G. Koch, in litt., 2019).

Potential risk(s) of a listing Trade shifts to other non-listed species, as appears to have affected these genera following the listing of mahogany (Brancalion et al., 2018). Other comments It is not clear whether the proposed annotation #6 (logs, sawn wood, veneer sheets and plywood) would cover the main commodities that first appear in trade and drive the demand. The end use of much of the export (at least to the USA) is reported to be decking and flooring. The USA uses two HS codes for ip\u00ea imports: HS44.07 (wood sawn or chipped lengthwise, sliced or peeled, whether or not planed, sanded or end-jointed, of a thickness exceeding 6 mm) and HS44.09 (wood (including strips and friezes for parquet flooring, not assembled) continuously shaped (tongued, grooved, rebated, chamfered, V-jointed, beaded, moulded, rounded or the like) along any of its edges, ends or faces, whether or not planed, sanded or end-jointed). The definition of sawn wood IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 49 293 in Res. Conf. 10.13 (Rev. CoP15) Implementation of the Convention for timber species already refers to HS44.07, but no part or derivative defined in Res. Conf. 10.13 explicitly explicitly covers flooring or decking, or refers to HS44.09 (the HS code that seems most relevant). Proposal 53 seeks to amend the annotation for Pericopsis elata to read \u201cLogs, sawn wood, veneer sheets, plywood, and transformed wood\u201d, with transformed wood defined as HS code 44.09, and if that proposal is adopted the same annotation could be applied for the listing of these taxa. This may be considered to be expanding the scope of the proposal, but would be in line with the guidance on annotations in Res. Conf. 11.21 (Rev. CoP17) paragraph 6, which recommends that \u201ci) controls should concentrate on those commodities that first appear in international trade as exports from range States; these may range from crude to processed material; and ii) controls should include only those commodities that dominate the trade and the demand for the wild resource.\u201d Ensuring the most appropriate annotation is adopted would avoid the need to amend it through a further proposal at a subsequent CoP.

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 50 Inclusion of Mulanje Cedar Widdringtonia whytei in Appendix II Proponent: Malawi Summary: The Mulanje Cedar Widdringtonia whytei is a slow growing, coniferous tree in the cypress family, endemic to the Mount Mulanje Massif in south-eastern Malawi, which occurs over 650 km2. It can reach a height of 40 m and over 1 m in diameter, taking 80\u2013100 years fully to mature. Much of its habitat is found in the Mount Mulanje Forest Reserve. It historically grew at 1500\u20132200 m above sea level. There are around 70 ha of plantations on Zomba Mountain and another 80 ha in the large timber plantations of the Viphya Plateau, which may include a mix of W. whytei and Widdringtonia nodiflora. Widdringtonia whytei faces numerous threats, the most serious of which are changing fire regimes, fuelwood collection, illegal logging, invasive tree species and conifer aphids. Widdringtonia whytei was assessed as Critically Endangered in 2011 on the basis that threats were likely to cause a decline of more than 80% by 2030. In 2014, a Forest Department survey found 38,138 mature, living W. whytei (with a further 25,609 standing dead individuals) but by 2017 only seven mature W. whytei trees were found, all of which had been felled by 2018. There are no reproductively mature trees on the Mulanje Mountain.

While W. whytei has been commercially exploited for over a century, it is unclear whether international trade or national utilisation has driven the recent decline. The proposal is to list the species W. whytei in Appendix II without annotation. Analysis: There are no mature Widdringtonia whytei trees remaining in its natural habitat, the last remaining seven having been felled by 2018. The species can be considered to be commercially extinct in the wild and therefore meets the biological criteria for listing in Appendix I already. Seedlings planted since 2017 are unlikely to mature for tens of years and therefore any trade in this species from the wild is not likely in the near future. Appendix II listing is therefore unlikely to have any significant conservation impact. It is possible that trade in W. whytei from plantations may occur as plantation forestry has been attempted for over a century with limited success.

Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) Annex 2a) A) Trade regulation needed to prevent future inclusion in Appendix I Biology Widdringtonia whytei is a coniferous tree in the cypress family that can reach 40 m in height and over 1 m in diameter. The tree is wide-crowned and often branchless up to about 21 m. Its bark is spongy and thickens with age, splitting along longitudinal cracks. Widdringtonia whytei wood has copious amounts of aromatic resin whose resistance to fungal rot, decay and insects make its yellow-white timber highly valuable. Its basic density is 385\u2013 430 kg/m3. Widdringtonia whytei grows relatively slowly, particularly in comparison to the non-native conifer species with which it now competes on the mountain. It takes 80\u2013100 years fully to mature but will eventually become a dominant or co-dominant tree in its ecosystem if canopy out-competition, natural or human disturbances do not intervene. Population size Widdringtonia whytei is endemic to the Mount Mulanje massif in south-eastern Malawi, whose total area covers approximately 650 km2. Much of this area is gazetted as the Mount Mulanje Forest Reserve (MMFR) and known locally as chilumba mu mlengalenga, \u201cisland in the sky\u201d. Widdringtonia whytei historically grew across the upper reaches of the MMFR (1500\u20132200 m above sea level). The most recent ecological baseline survey, conducted in 2017, found that \u201cMulanje Cedar is considered to be practically extinct on Mulanje mountain. It is very likely that the small number of sizeable standing individuals that remain will be gone before the end of 2017.\u201d This survey found only seven mature individual Widdringtonia whytei trees, clustered together in a single inaccessible gully (for purposes of the survey, mature individuals were those capable of producing seed). Out of 34 20 m2 plots surveyed, 25 plots had fewer than 20 living individuals, most of which were young seedlings recently planted by a restoration project in the Forest Reserve. Eight of these plots had no living individuals. As of 2018, the seven reproductively mature standing individuals had been felled. Population trends The IUCN Red List assessment (assessed in 2011) stated that a population decline of over 80% was likely by 2030 and considers the species Critically Endangered. The actual decline has been even more drastic. In 2007, densities of between 41 and 131 stems/ha of trees above 5 cm diameter, and 78,159 m3 of standing live volume were reported. In 2014, a Forest Department survey found 38,138 mature, living cedar trees (and a further 25,609 standing dead trees). But by 2017, field surveys found only seven mature living trees. This decline was caused by lawlessness, resulting in illegal harvesting (T. Chanyenga and D. Nagoma, in litt., 2019). Trade Widdringtonia whytei timber is highly valued in Malawi, as its light-to-moderately-heavy yellow-brown wood is easy to work with and is decay- and insect-resistant. It is a highly desirable species for construction and boat building, and has been commercially harvested for over a century. The British colonial regime established Mount Mulanje Forest Reserve largely to manage its extraction. The Malawi Department of Forestry currently licenses only the utilisation of dead Widdringtonia whytei trees and is reviewed annually, averaging 20 pit-sawyers in 2007 (Bayliss et al., 2007). As recently as 2007, the government of Malawi issued harvesting licences for cedar to build 400 plank boats. The species is also preferred for furniture, roof shingles (weathering to a silver-grey), panelling, flooring and handicrafts such as walking sticks sold to tourists.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7fedb190-1207-4c85-996e-23b575582265": {"__data__": {"id_": "7fedb190-1207-4c85-996e-23b575582265", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "36d92b10818651a19bee8909fcb9c57bfc93ba46995070d0e5850bc1b544dc48"}, "2": {"node_id": "600c1426-a2ae-4cac-8633-1c9ff79c73c3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "236af02964a8ad5de47caae280a68c8efa5afda0dadfc241cb70c19cc68616cb"}}, "hash": "2543163ec0ffea1251030b3958dfba072683c5c2080c74143f14fa5222bfccc1", "text": "An oil called \u201cMulanje tar\u201d can be distilled and used as a preservative.

But these natural fires are usually caused by lightning during the rainy season and are less damaging than the now-frequent fires caused by humans for various reasons. Many are set during the hot dry season to renew grasses for local livestock grazing. Hunting flush fires and crop waste fires are also common and can spread out of control, particularly on the drier northeastern slopes of the mountain adjacent to communities. Loggers set fires to expose remaining pieces of cedar in already-cut areas. Such fires damage or kill the adult trees and, critically, also have a heavy impact on regenerating seedlings. Invasive tree species: Mexican Pine Pinus patula, originally planted by the colonial administration as a nurse crop for Widdringtonia whytei, turns out to grow much faster and shade it out. Pinus patula is also a pioneer species co-adapted with fire. It has taken over areas of the mountain to the exclusion of other species including Widdringtonia whytei. Conifer aphids: The Giant Cypress Aphid Cinara cuppresivora, originally from Europe and North America was first recorded in Malawi in 1986. This aphid attacked and killed many Widdringtonia whytei trees in the 1980s and 1990s, before a parasitic wasp was released as a biological control. It has not been eradicated and remains a factor in the high mortality levels. Other threats: Deposits of around 30 million t of bauxite have been found over about one third of the Mulanje plateau. While large-scale open cast mining has not yet occurred, the possibility remains and would completely destroy any cedar forest habitat in these areas. Most recently, rare earth minerals needed by computer and cell phone technologies have been found on the plateau. Conservation, management and legislation Native hardwood log exports have been banned since 2008. There is no legal export of Widdringtonia whytei. Widdringtonia whytei was listed as a Protected Species in a revision to the National Parks and Wildlife Protected Species Act which was revised and published in September 2017. Under this Act one could receive a jail sentence of up to 30 years if found to be illegally possessing W. whytei. Previous plantation or restoration attempts have been seriously hampered by a poor understanding of ecology, pathology and horticulture, although the tree has been successfully planted at a small scale elsewhere in Malawi as well as in botanic gardens. The \u201cSave our Species\u201d project planted 220,000 seedlings between 2003 and 2010, but almost all were lost to wildfire. Low seedling survival has been a consistent problem in the nursery as plants attain 5\u201310 cm, and survival dropped off again once they were out planted to the natural habitat. A similar pattern of poor survival has been found with planting the Cederberg Cedar Widdringtonia wallichii in the South Western Cape of South Africa (N. Allsopp, in litt., 2019). Currently an initiative funded by the Darwin Initiative and implemented by Botanic Gardens Conservation International, in partnership with the Mulanje Mountain Conservation Trust and the Forestry Research Institute of Malawi, is attempting a major Widdringtonia whytei replanting project within appropriate habitat of MMFR. Ten community nurseries were established around the base of the mountain and apparently traditional authorities were consulted and involved in project implementation. The project trained nursery supervisors and extension staff in horticultural protocols, refinement of which is ongoing. Trial plots were also set up across Malawi to \u201ctest growth limits and identify optimal growing conditions for Mulanje Cedar\u201d. The project has planted 325,000 seedlings and its goal is to plant another 250,000 on the mountain by 2019 while selling 250,000 seedlings commercially to remove pressure from the Mount Mulanje population. Artificial propagation/captive breeding Plantation forestry of Widdringtonia whytei has been attempted for over a century with limited success. The species\u2019 growth is far slower than exotic conifers like Cupressus lusitanica and Pinus patula. It also appears that in some cases Widdringtonia whytei and W. nodiflora have been mixed together in these plantations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1d5b61c8-093f-438b-8b62-2ae564223861": {"__data__": {"id_": "1d5b61c8-093f-438b-8b62-2ae564223861", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "03a531cd387feda34171b81a5097d3708500e61595c10710a0db924153d76101"}, "2": {"node_id": "10f3956e-9fb7-4af7-9bf3-20520587f10c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "383ce2f9a9e398834e6e0180bb2ae60228d0001b9517e5d905e8abe1d0bb10b2"}}, "hash": "911ec2a5d8d53109504c6be02f2a2e46da20aab39160a77a70b9ee8cc2567ce3", "text": "There are 66 ha of plantation on Zomba Mountain and another 76 ha in the large timber plantations of the Viphya Plateau.

In some regions it is considered invasive. The population size is not known, and although disease has impacted both wild and cultivated populations in a number of range States, the species\u2019 high regeneration and growth rate provides resilience to this threat. In Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan the species is widely cultivated, and has also successfully naturalised within some new areas, following afforestation programmes. Dalbergia sissoo is primarily harvested for its timber, which is used for a wide range of products including handicrafts and furniture.

Many experts acknowledge that, without the use of technology, it is difficult for non-experts readily to identify Dalbergia sissoo once made into finished products, and these appear to be the predominant form in which D. sissoo is traded. While technological methods to identify D. sissoo exist, they require expertise and/or equipment not currently available on a global scale.

CoP17) Annex 2a) A) Trade regulation needed to prevent future inclusion in Appendix I B) Regulation of trade required to ensure that harvest from the wild is not reducing population to level where survival might be threatened by continued harvest or other influences Dalbergia sissoo is primarily harvested for its timber, which is used to produce a wide range of products including handicraft items, boats, carts, carriages, gun handles, rail-sleepers, cabinets, furniture, decorative veneer, ornamental turnery, plywood, musical instruments, skis, carvings, tool handles, floorings, etc. Within India, D. sissoo is said to be the second most important cultivated timber tree. The species is native to nine range States and has also been introduced to many others. In some cases, it is considered to be an invasive species (CABI, 2019). While there is a lack of data regarding the status of natural populations (Dhayani, in litt., 2019), Dalbergia sissoo\u2019s natural range primarily occurs throughout the sub- Himalayan tract and outer Himalayan valley, ranging from Bangladesh to Afghanistan (Khan, 2000). It is also reported to be widespread in plantations within Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan (Hossain and Martin, 2012; Javaid et al., 2014). While their current extent is unclear, in 1979, Pakistan was said to have 100,000 ha of irrigated plantations (National Research Council, 1979). Within India the Extent of Occurrence (EOO) is at least 198,974 km2 considering only the sub-Himalayan tracts from where wild subpopulations of the species are reported. In parts of India, following afforestation programmes, this adaptable species has also become naturalised, further increasing its range. The density of wild populations in different parts of India is reported to be 8\u201338 mature individuals per ha, compared with 3\u201339 per ha for cultivated stocks and up to 1,600 per ha for pure and mono specific plantations. Though disease has caused population declines in some parts of India during the last few decades, based on a recent non-detriment finding (NDF) study submitted by the Botanical Survey of India, the species is not considered to be under threat (Dhyani in litt., 2019).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "17a685d5-0f9e-4b81-ade0-222b2f5b84ca": {"__data__": {"id_": "17a685d5-0f9e-4b81-ade0-222b2f5b84ca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a11fcdc93ccc12f5843fe4c9823e1ba7351f52e2c0076dc542135b765f3ae502"}, "2": {"node_id": "427f83cb-5233-457f-9e41-2f4f37262402", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5dae3c4d74c48d08d0adfce2169c036295b59ae6f67fa710b9ff2786267cf665"}}, "hash": "388a0366df5d47173f10bc0913c11e6dc27a9177e6a40578653137a27eee6a41", "text": "Harvest or trade primarily utilises cultivated trees, although wild exports have been reported (see below).

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 51 300 Table 1. Global trade in Dalbergia sissoo in 2017 reported by importing (Imp.) and exporting (Exp.) countries (according to the CITES Trade Database). kg Number of items (no unit specified) Trade Term Imp. Exp. Imp. Exp. carvings 5,753,236 - 6,897 - wood product 79,763 - 735,549 34,324 timber 33,152 - - - derivatives 7,958 - - - Nearly all exports were reported as pre-Convention (\u201cO\u201d) (86% carvings reported in kg) with some reports of artificially propagated (\u201cA\u201d) (14% of carvings reported in kg) and wild (\u201cW\u201d) (66% wood products reported in kg). All trade was for commercial purposes. Of the products reported as imported, the vast majority were from India, with Pakistan reporting the export of just over 34,000 wood products. The main importers were European countries (predominantly Germany but also others including France and Portugal) and the USA. Most of the trade has been reported as pre-Convention and therefore it is not possible to tell what proportion of trade is wild-sourced or from plantations. In the years 2017 and 2018, 2,206 import permits for 12,243 t of furniture made of Dalbergia sissoo have been issued by the German Management Authority (in litt., 2019). In comparison, only approx. 5.1 t of other small wood products (most of which have been chess boards/men) have been imported with 28 import permits over that period. Seizures of Dalbergia sissoo have been reported by the UK and the Netherlands because they were shipped without CITES permits. The UK seized four shipments from India and three from Pakistan, while the Netherlands seized one shipment from India and one from Suriname (EU-TWIX, 2019). Further Dalbergia seizures recorded to genus level may also include D. sissoo. Retention in Appendix II to improve control of other listed species A) Specimens in trade resemble those of species listed in Appendix II under Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) Annex 2 a or listed in Appendix I In 2017, the entire Dalbergia genus was listed in CITES Appendix II except for the species listed in Appendix I. It was argued at the time of the proposed listing that some species met the criteria in Annex 2a but that enforcement and customs officers who encountered specimens of Dalbergia products would be unlikely to be able to distinguish between the various species of Dalbergia reliably so that that the whole genus should be listed. It was also noted that many species of Dalbergia have the same wood anatomy, and the process of identification of different species is very difficult, due to the hardness of the wood which hampers the preparation of thin sections for microscopic analysis (McLure et al., 2015). The SS notes that Dalbergia sissoo is easy to identify in living condition, unlikely to be confused with other species. However, live specimens are not the main product in trade. \u201cTopical legumes: Resources for the future\" published in 1979, states that \"Although closely related to the rosewoods Dalbergia sissoo wood is light coloured and lacks the rosewoods' striking grain\u201d (National Research Council, 1979).

A range of scientific techniques to enable the identification of Dalbergia sissoo in trade are available (Hartvig et al., 2015; Espinoza in litt., 2019; Koch in litt., 2019; Vlam and Zuidema, in litt., 2019).

The level of expertise and experience required to perform microscopic inspection (Dormontt et al., 2015; Koch, in litt., 2019), means that, at present, this technique is not widely available to global enforcement efforts. In addition, others consider that visual techniques cannot always be used to identify wood within composite materials, or that have been stained/dyed a different colour. Technological methods include DART TOFMS (Direct Analysis in Real Time, Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry), which has proven ability to identify Dalbergia sissoo in trade (Espinoza, pers. comm., 2019). This system works by combusting a small sample of wood, which enables its chemical profile to be analysed. It is capable of identifying samples to species level, with 2,000 species (including 90% of those listed within CITES) catalogued within its database, including D. sissoo. The system is also accurate regardless of the age or part of the tree that is tested, and with the exception of very thin plywood (which is contaminated with glue), it is capable of identifying all forms of wooden products in trade. The cost of this system (USD 250,000 to install and, in the US, USD 250 to process each sample) may currently be a barrier to its implementation, and to date, uptake of the system by global enforcement agencies has been low (Espinoza, pers. comm., 2019). DNA barcoding has also been demonstrated as capable of identifying Dalbergia sissoo to species level (Hartvig et al., 2015). To be used practically however, this technique first requires the creation of reference data sets, or species-specific assays. DNA extracted from timber may also be of poor quality, which can hamper the process (Hartvig et al., 2015). At the present time, therefore, a considerable gap remains between the potential and realised application of such methodologies (Dormontt et al., 2015). While prior knowledge of the wood\u2019s origin is likely to help in the identification of Dalbergia sissoo, (Koch in litt., 2019), as it is not endemic to any one country, this may be of little assistance to global enforcement efforts. Additional Information Threats The main threats to both wild and cultivated populations of Dalbergia sissoo are fungal and bacterial diseases (wild and dieback being the diseases that have the largest impact) and insect infestations. Wilt disease has been reported from some plantations within India, where D. sissoo has been raised in unsuitable conditions. Plantations of D. sissoo have suffered from significant dieback in Bangladesh, where mortalities in excess of >50% have been reported (Winfield et al., 2016). The species\u2019 high regeneration and growth rate, however, reduces their impact upon the species as a whole. The frequency of mortality due to diseases is also lower in wild subpopulations than in cultivated plantations. Conservation, management and legislation The Government of India has banned the export for commercial purposes of all wild-taken specimens of species included in Appendices I, II and III. It has, however, taken a general reservation to Dalbergia spp. (except species in Appendix I) and permits the export of cultivated varieties of plant species included in Appendices I and II and of products from wild sourced D. sissoo and D. latifolia that are authorised for export by a CITES Comparable Certificate, except logs, timber, stumps, roots, bark, chips, powder, flakes, dust and charcoal.

As the range of D. sissoo overlaps with that of other Dalbergia species, (Winfield et al., 2016), it is conceivable that such opportunities may arise. Prior to the Dalbergia genus listing, traffickers were said to have taken advantage of gaps in the CITES listings for rosewood, for example, by mis-declaring D. retusa, as the then unlisted and similar-looking, D. bariensis (EIA, 2016). Potential benefit(s) of deletion for trade regulation It is likely that deleting Dalbergia sissoo from Appendix II would mitigate the negative impacts that this listing has reportedly had had on some areas of international trade, particularly the negative impacts on the trade in wooden handicrafts from India. Other comments Many species of Dalbergia are under a range of threats, including deforestation, forest conversion for agriculture/human development, and legal and illegal logging to supply domestic and international markets (Winfield et al., 2016). Trade in some species of Dalbergia considered to be \u201cprecious woods\u201d with high market values, has resulted in their over-exploitation (Jenkins et al., 2012).

There have been challenges in interpretation and implementation of this annotation. These include concerns that some of the commodities currently covered by the listing (including finished products such as musical instruments and furniture) are not those that first appear in international trade as exports from range States and therefore their inclusion under the annotation was inconsistent with the guidance on annotations provided in Res. Conf. 11.21 (Rev. CoP17). These issues have led to considerations on this matter by the Standing Committee and its Working Group on Annotations. Analysis: The proposed amendment to annotation #15 is the result of the extensive discussions and consensus reached by the Standing Committee Working Group on Annotations (see SC70 Com.17). The Standing Committee has supported the proposed amendment, which is intended to reduce the challenges with interpretation and implementation of the current annotation #15 experienced by Parties and ensure the annotation is in line with guidance on use of annotations in Res. Conf. 11.21 (Rev. CoP17). Given the extensive debate on these changes and the consensus reached by the Standing Committee, the proposed changes should address the issues raised by (the majority of) stakeholders. Finished pieces of furniture made from the species to which the annotation applies are unlikely to contain wood of those species weighing less than 500g, so if the proposal is accepted these would continue to be covered by the listing, regardless of whether they were being exported by a range State or a processing country. Summary of information and discussion Before CoP17 the following taxa in the Dalbergia genus were already included in Appendix I and II. Appendix I Dalbergia nigra Appendix II Dalbergia granadillo (Logs, sawn wood, veneer sheets and plywood) Dalbergia retusa (Logs, sawn wood, veneer sheets and plywood) Dalbergia stevensonii (Logs, sawn wood, veneer sheets and plywood) Dalbergia spp. (populations of Madagascar) (Logs, sawn wood and veneer sheets) At CoP17 (2016) a proposal to list all Dalbergia species (except for species already listed in Appendix I, namely D. nigra) with no annotation was submitted (CoP17 Prop. 55). A separate proposal (CoP17 Prop. 54) was submitted to list 13 species of the genus Dalbergia native to Mexico and Central America in Appendix II with annotation #6 (Logs, sawn wood, veneer sheets and plywood) (Dalbergia calderonii, D. calycina, D. congestiflora, IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 52 304 D. cubilquitzensis, D. glomerata, D. longepedunculata, D. luteola, D. melanocardium, D. modesta, D. palo- escrito, D. rhachiflexa, D. ruddae, D. tucurensis). A third proposal (CoP17 Prop. 56) was submitted to include three species of Guibourtia (Guibourtia demeusei, G. pellegriniana and G. tessmannii) in Appendix II with annotation #4: All parts and derivatives, except: a) seeds (including seedpods of Orchidaceae), spores and pollen (including pollinia).

There have been challenges in interpretation and implementation of this annotation. For example, there are concerns that some of the commodities currently covered by the annotation (including finished products such as musical instruments and furniture) are not those that first appear in international trade as exports from range States, and therefore that their inclusion under the annotation was inconsistent with the guidance on annotations provided in Res. Conf. 11.21 (Rev. CoP17) Use of annotations in Appendices I and II. These issues have led to considerations by the Standing Committee and its Working Group on Annotation. The Standing Committee considered various options for amending the annotation presented by the Working Group and the proposed revision is a result of the consensus reached (see SC70 Com.17). No definition for \u201cmusical instruments\u201d has been put forward for inclusion in Res. Conf. 10.13 (Rev. CoP15) Implementation of the Convention for timber species, but the Standing Committee has recommended the re-establishment of an annotation working group after CoP18, which would consider this, and other terms used in definitions. If the proposed amendments to #15 are accepted, this would result in finished pieces of furniture comprising the species subject to the annotation remaining covered by the listing unless they contain wood of those species weighing less than 500 g, which may be unlikely, whether being exported by a range State or a processing country. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 52 305 The Standing Committee Working Group on Annotations did note that \u201cthe inclusions in annotations of external considerations such as the status in trade of a specimen or shipment, or of thresholds defined by weight or volume that affect the application of an annotation to a part or derivative, require subjective evaluation and are likely to create uncertainty with regard to their interpretation and application\u201d (See SC70 Doc 67.1 for further information). IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 53 Amendment of the annotation to the listing of Pericopsis elata in Appendix II: expand the scope of the annotation (currently #5) to include plywood and transformed wood Proponents: C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and the European Union Summary: Pericopsis elata, commonly known as Afrormosia or African Teak, is a highly valued tropical timber native to Central and West Africa. Pericopsis elata was listed in Appendix II in 1992 with annotation #5 (amended in 2007), which restricts the listing to \u201clogs, sawn wood and veneer sheets\u201d. At the time the annotation was intended to cover the major products in trade. The European Union (EU), one of the main importers of timber of this species, has observed instances where traders from range States have been exporting sawn wood with minor, superficial transformation in order to circumvent CITES controls.

That proposal was accepted and the species is now listed with annotation #4. Other species are currently listed in Appendix II and III with annotation #5, including some species of Cedrela. A separate proposal has been submitted to list the Cedrela genus in Appendix II with no annotation (CoP18 Prop. 57). It does not appear that the present proposal (CoP18 Prop. 53) is intended to apply to all taxa listed with annotation #5. Therefore, amending the annotation for P. elata only would require a new annotation solely for P. elata. Analysis: International trade in Pericopsis elata appears to involve products not included in the current listing under annotation #5, based on the observation of shipments into the EU of superficially transformed sawn wood. The intention to include transformed wood (and plywood) to close the observed loophole seems an appropriate amendment and has been supported by the Standing Committee Working Group on Annotations. As other species are also listed with annotation #5, if the proposed amendment is accepted a new annotation would be required specifically to cover P. elata. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 53 307 The proposed amended annotation includes the term plywood, which is already defined in Res. Conf. 10.13 (Rev. CoP15) Implementation of the Convention for Timber Species. No other existing annotations include the term \u201ctransformed wood\u201d. The proposed footnote to the annotation provides a definition of \u201ctransformed wood\u201d (as HS44.09) in line with guidance in Res. Conf. 10.13 (Rev. CoP15). However, it may be more appropriate to include the proposed definition in Res. Conf. 10.13 (Rev. CoP15) rather than to have this as a footnote to the annotation. Thus, any changes to the definition could be amended through an amendment to the Resolution rather than through another proposal to amend the Appendices. Other Considerations: There is a proposal (CoP18 Prop. 49) to include the genera Handroanthus, Tabebuia and Roseodendron in Appendix II with annotation #6 to cover \u201clogs, sawn wood, veneer sheets and plywood\u201d, however transformed wood also appears to be one of products in trade and if the amended annotation for Pericopsis elata is accepted then the same annotation may also be appropriate for those genera. The trade term \u201ctransformed wood\u201d is not included in the Annex to the Guidelines for the preparation and submission of CITES annual reports (Notification No. 2017/006), which may need addressing.

IUCN Global Category Endangered A1cd ver. 2.3 (1998) - needs updating. Discussion Pericopsis elata, commonly known as Afromosia or African Rosewood, is a highly valued tropical timber species native to Central and West Africa. Pericopsis elata was included in Appendix II in 1992. It is currently listed with annotation #5 to restrict the listing to \u201clogs, sawn wood and veneer sheets\u201d. The EU, one of the main importers of timber of this species, has observed instances where traders from range States have been exporting sawn wood with minor, superficial transformation in order to circumvent CITES controls. The Standing Committee Annotations Working Group considered that the extent and scale of cases where the listing was circumvented warranted a change to the annotation to ensure that CITES controls cover those commodities that dominate the trade, and supports the amendment proposed by C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and the EU. Sawn wood currently dominates the reported trade in P. elata (see Table 1). It is unclear whether superficially transformed wood is being reported (if the assumption is that it is not covered by the annotation), and therefore it is not possible to determine the full extent of the trade.

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 54 Inclusion of African Padauk Pterocarpus tinctorius in Appendix II Proponent: Malawi Summary: Pterocarpus tinctorius is a tree species native to nine countries across Africa\u2019s belt of miombo woodland vegetation. It is a slow-growing tree, estimated to take up to 90 years to reach maturity. The species is in international trade, mainly for its timber which is used for furniture and flooring. It is commonly traded under the general name \u201cmukula\u201d or sometimes \u201cAfrican Padauk\u201d, names that are also applied to similar species, such as P. angolensis, P. soyauxii and P. castelsii. Domestic demand is also said to be high for timber, firewood and a variety of other uses. There is very little information about population size, structure and rates of decline for P. tinctorius, although it is thought to be locally common, but declining across its range, and some national populations are known to be decreasing (e.g. Zambia). Taking into account the risk of over- harvesting, P. tinctorius was assessed as Least Concern in 2017. The assessment recommended the species\u2019 harvest and trade be monitored to identify any major increase in its use, particularly as other Pterocarpus species in trade become rare or protected. The main international market is considered to be China, and to a lesser extent Viet Nam. Although Pterocarpus tinctorius is not officially recognised as a \u201chongmu\u201d species (other species of Pterocarpus are) or included on China\u2019s list of precious furniture woods, reports suggest that the species has seen an increase in exploitation due to a growth in consumption of \u201chongmu\u201d and other \u201crosewoods\u201d in China since 2010. As multiple species are commonly traded under the same names, it is difficult to determine specific trade levels of P. tinctorius. There is some confusion surrounding legislation in certain range States, so it is not clear how much of the trade is illegal, although a number of seizures have taken place. Examples of trade volumes include from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) where it was estimated in 2015 that almost 45,000 m3 of \u201cmukula\u201d was transported across the border annually to Zambia, and onwards to China. Trade data from Tanzania show that exports of P. tinctorius increased seven-fold between 2012 and 2014 from around 800 m3 to 5,600 m3. Pterocarpus erinaceus, listed in Appendix II in 2017, is a \u201chongmu\u201d species native to west and central Africa, including in countries that border range States of P. tinctorius. There is conflicting information regarding the ease of identification of this species and others in the genus. Some consider P. erinaceus wood to be distinguishable from other Pterocarpus species due to the light base colour of the heartwood, although others say that identification is only reliable at the genus level. The proposal is to list P. tinctorius in Appendix II without annotation, in order to include all readily recognisable parts and derivatives. Analysis: Pterocarpus tinctorius is harvested for timber and has a number of other local uses. There is evidence of a recent increase in export of timber from some range States, largely to meet demand in China for furniture-making. A proportion of this export appears to be unauthorised or illegal. The species is widespread and locally common, and although it is thought to be declining it was assessed by IUCN as Least Concern in 2017. It is a slow-growing, late-maturing species. The current level of harvest for timber is likely to be unsustainable, in that it almost certainly exceeds the rate at which harvestable-sized trees are being replenished in the population.

Summary of Available Information Text in non-italics is based on information in the Proposal and Supporting Statement (SS); text in italics is based on additional information and/or assessment of information in the SS Taxonomy Synonyms: Pterocarpus chrysothrix, Pterocarpus megalocarpus, Pterocarpus stolzii: There is ongoing debate regarding the taxonomy of Pterocarpus tinctorius, and the wider genus. Of the two species in the genus that are currently listed in the Appendices, only one has a CITES Standard Reference\u2014 Pterocarpus erinaceus (Mabberley, 1997), although other taxonomic references are provided (UNEP-WCMC, 2019). CoP18 Doc. 99 notes that the Plants Committee at its 24th meeting recommended that Mabberley (1997) be deleted from the list of Standard References, and thereafter that relevant decisions will be made on a case by case basis. For P. tinctorius it is unclear which Standard Reference will be used. In a wider taxonomic debate, the circumscription of Pterocarpus tinctorius varies considerably. In Flora Zambesiaca upholds P. chrysothrix, P. megalocarpus and P. stolzii as separate species, whereas the African Plants Database maintains them as synonyms of P. tinctorius (Conservatoire et Jardin botaniques de la Ville de Gen\u00e8ve and South African National Biodiversity Institute, 2019; Timberlake, 2012). Furthermore, a recent publication on the trees and shrubs of Mozambique considers P. chrysothrix and P. megalocarpus as separate species to P. tinctorius (Burrows et al., 2019). For the purpose of the analyses provided below, P. chrysothrix and P. stolzii have been considered as synonyms of P. tinctorius as per the IUCN Red List assessment (Barstow, 2018). Range Angola, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, and Rwanda (Winfield, Scott, & Grayson, 2016), Republic of Congo (Barstow, 2018), Tanzania and Zambia, IUCN Global Category Least Concern (Assessed 2017, criteria version 3.1) Biological and trade criteria for inclusion in Appendix II (Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) Annex 2a) A) Trade regulation needed to prevent future inclusion in Appendix I Habitat trends: Pterocarpus tinctorius is found across Africa\u2019s broad belt of miombo woodland, a 2.7 million km2 area of tropical seasonal forest and dry forests. Forest disturbance and loss are occurring throughout the miombo woodlands and associated ecosystems that form P. tinctorius\u2019s range. Agriculture and fuel wood collection play a role in the degradation of existing forest areas. While a number of protected areas do exist across the range, these are not always well-protected in practice and can be subject to encroachment and illegal logging. Population size: The total population of Pterocarpus tinctorius is not known, nor are quantitative data available on the total area of relevant habitat or average density of stems per hectare. The SS notes that the species was apparently locally common in areas including east and south Tanzania and north Malawi, at least before the rosewood demand increase; it is now in decline throughout Zambia and likely other countries as well. A recent study in Zambia estimated a stems per hectare figure of 0.274 for Pterocarpus tinctorius (Ng\u2019andwe et al., 2017), using this figure, it would require a forested area of less than 200 km2 for the population to be greater IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 54 312 than 5,000 individuals.

Population structure: Very little information is available. However, given that the largest specimens are disproportionately targeted for timber production, it can be expected that the recent increase in illegal and unsustainable harvesting will be leading to a skewing of the population structure towards immature specimens. In Zambia, the minimum cutting diameter of Pterocarpus tinctorius was reduced to 30 cm in 2015 in response to commercial pressures. Rosewoods as a group exhibit poor recruitment, even in protected areas where large numbers of mature trees exist. While some local loggers in Zambia claimed to observe large numbers of seedlings in areas where they worked, this may mean little in terms of survivorship.

Whereas other sources for P. angolensis state that maturity is reached at around 20 years (Winfield et al., 2016) Data on a similar species Pterocarpus angolensis suggests that this species is slow-growing and it takes a minimum of 85 years and up to 100 years to reach a harvestable size (Therrell, Stahle, Mukelabai, & Shugart, 2007). Recent research on a similar species (Pterocarpus angolensis) in the Miombo woodland in Zambia, shows that selective logging can hinder regeneration. Pterocarpus spp. are light-demanding and therefore activities such as slash and burn or felling for charcoal production can promote faster regrowth as more light penetrates through the canopy, whereas in areas of selective logging trees exhibited static stem diameters (Syampungani & Geldenhuys, 2015). Population trends: At a genus level, 90% of the Pterocarpus and Dalbergia populations, where studies exist, show declining or unstable population dynamics. According to the 2018 IUCN Red List assessment, the P. tinctorius population \u201cis considered to be in decline as a result of the harvesting of the species for its timber\u2026currently in high demand in local markets and it is predicted that in the future its international demand could increase as other Pterocarpus timber species become rare or protected.\u201d. A study of the mukula value chain in Zambia found that 84% of community cutters had entered the business since 2012. 68% of these cutters observed depletion of population stocks in the field and thought that they would not be able to continue harvesting this tree at the same rate in five years\u2019 time, 95% of respondents in the same study agreed with this assessment and anticipated the species \u201cgoing extinct\u201d. In Kiwengoma Forest, Tanzania, there was a high proportion of high value timber species (notably Pterocarpus tinctorius) in 1991, but in 2005 logging had reduced the number of high value and large timber trees (Ahrends et al., 2010). B) Regulation of trade required to ensure that harvest from the wild is not reducing population to level where survival might be threatened by continued harvest or other influences While Pterocarpus tinctorius has non-timber uses, its current unsustainable extraction in various range States is thought to be almost entirely linked to international trade. It has been reported that the main two threats to Pterocarpus tinctorius are selective logging for domestic use and harvest for export (Winfield et al., 2016). Prices of Pterocarpus tinctorius have increased from USD 2.40/plank (equivalent to USD 43.60/m3) in 1990, to USD 4.00/plank (equivalent to USD 72.00/m3) in 2000 (Winfield et al., 2016). National utilisation Pterocarpus tinctorius has various uses within range States. As well as timber use, these include, use of sap for fabric dyes and body colouring; medicinal treatments for respiratory congestion, anaemia, diarrhoea, snakebites, stomach aches, and eye pain; to prevent miscarriage, and to prevent wound infection; firewood, charcoal and honey production. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 54 313 Legal international trade It should be noted that much of the trade in this species is reported under the general trade name \u201cmukula\u201d, that includes other species within the genus such as Pterocarpus angolensis (Cerutti et al., 2018). It is difficult to separate out legal and illegal trade from the available data, given the patchy data, irregular enforcement and lack of clarity around national regulations in some countries. Official Chinese data show rapidly increasing imports of rosewood species from African nations\u2014up 700% since 2010.

However, over time the species has become recognised in its own right and direct shipments to China are more common. Chinese customs data show log imports from Zambia going from 35,000 m3 in 2015, to 65,000 m3 in just the first half of 2017; CIFOR research indicates that \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of these logs are Pterocarpus tinctorius (SS attributes this to FAOSTAT and Chinese Customs and Cerutti 2017, Fig. 14 and 15). However, the increase in shipments to China referred to are not guaranteed to be P. tinctorius, the Zambian and Chinese customs data presented by Cerutti et al., (2018) is for sawn wood and logs, which are not reported to species level using data from FAOSTAT. It is inferred that the majority of these shipments consist of \u201cmukula\u201d, but this is based on stakeholder opinions. This data are then extrapolated to suggest an annual estimation of production of mukula of 110,000 m3, which is the equivalent of between 450,000 and 800,000 logs. In 2017 the going price for mukula in Zhang Jiagang was between RMB17,000 and 22,000 per tonne (USD 2,500 and USD 3,200). Greenpeace estimates that as much as 15,000 t of mukula are sold each month from just the four biggest mukula markets. In Tanzania, one of the few countries where species-specific official data are available, export permits for Pterocarpus tinctorius increased almost seven times between 2012 and 2014 alone (830 to 5,600 m3), according to Tanzania Forest Service data. To clarify, it is not the number of permits that increased seven-fold between 2012 and 2014 in Tanzania, it was the volume of P. tinctorius that increased from 831 m3 to 5,578 m3 (Lukumbuzya & Sianga, 2017). Range State governments have struggled to improve governance over this resource. For example, Zambia has imposed and lifted moratoriums on harvest and/or export of mukula three times since 2014, and an export ban on all logs is currently in place, although the Minister and Director of Forests may still issue export permits for timber if \u201cdeemed necessary in the interest of the Republic\u201d. Malawi banned export of all roundwood in 2008 but has faced many legal battles to enforce the ban for Pterocarpus tinctorius which is apparently transported to China originating from neighbouring countries. Parts and derivatives in trade The products in international trade are primarily round and rough squared logs (HS code 44.03) and rough sawn timber (HS code 44.07). The majority of the trade is destined for China, although Viet Nam also imports significant volumes. In importing markets, the main usage is for decorative furniture consumed in China. There is no species-specific information available on re-exports of furniture or secondary processed products from China. Illegal trade Illegal mukula export trade is fundamentally a regional issue, in part because the most significant extraction appears to be occurring in the landlocked forests of south-eastern Congo (Katanga Plateau), Zambia and north- east Angola. Trucking routes are documented towards ports on both the Atlantic (Angola, Namibia, even South Africa) and Pacific (Tanzania, Mozambique), though the key routes change as range States have attempted to control trade in this and other precious wood species through log export bans. When Mozambique and Angola banned log exports in 2017, exports surged in Namibia.

Burundi: Almost all natural forest and woodland areas in Burundi where Pterocarpus tinctorius might be present have been set aside as protected areas where logging is not permitted. Illegal timber from DRC forests and, to a lesser extent, Tanzania\u2019s miombo woodlands, is known to be brought across the border and sold locally, but specific reports of mukula logging or trade are not currently available. Democratic Republic of the Congo: Lubumbashi, the provincial capital of Haut-Katanga, is the hub for trade in Pterocarpus tinctorius, with at least 10 Chinese-owned mukula trading companies. A field study by local civil society showed that the volume of trees cut down in five months of 2016 totalled almost 3,300 m3, approximately five times the number given by the Ministry of Environment, suggesting widespread corruption and illegality. In 2016 the new head of the Ministry\u2019s Nature Conservation and Sustainable Development division, addressing the surge in P. tinctorius smuggling, determined that logging activities \u201cfar exceeded\u201d the limits allowed by government issued permits for artisanal logging. In April 2017, officials in Haut-Katanga arrested 14 Chinese people with tourist visas \u201csuspected of illegally exporting red wood [mukula]\u201d. The acting governor stated that 17,000 t of mukula had been illegally exported to China through Zambia over four months, with Zambian officials seizing hundreds of vehicles. An ITTO-sponsored study of regional timber flows conducted surveys of cross- border timber movements at three of the main checkpoints in 2015 between DRC and Zambia. They found 90% of the wood moving across the border from DRC was mukula, 90% of it in debarked logs or cants; the primary crossing was Kasumbalesa. The study extrapolates that 49,804 m3 of timber were being traded annually through these three checkpoints, of which 44,824 m3 was mukula. All this timber was recorded as destined for China, via ports in Tanzania, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Botswana. The extrapolation of 49,804 m3 of annual cross border trade mukula between DRC and Zambia should be treated with some caution as it is based on nine days of data collection over a three month period (CIFOR, 2016). Malawi: Reports state that there has been \u201crecent large-scale expansion of mukula harvesting and trade into Zambia\u2019s neighbouring countries such as Malawi, Mozambique and the DRC.\u201d Increases in illegal harvest of mukula and two other species, as well as trafficking of mukula smuggled from Zambia, caused the government to ban exports of native hardwood logs in 2008. Mozambique: Mozambique is China\u2019s biggest supplier of African logs. Species-specific export data are not available for Pterocarpus tinctorius on either end of this trade flow. However, reports suggest a \u201crecent large- scale expansion of mukula harvesting and trade into Zambia\u2019s neighbouring countries such as Malawi, Mozambique and the DRC.\u201d Field investigations have found evidence of largescale illegal harvest and trafficking of Precious and Class 1 timber species from Mozambique into Tanzania. Chinese buyers often go directly to individuals in the countryside to avoid the costs of obtaining logging licences, obligations to replant etc. Trade data discrepancy analysis between Chinese import data and Mozambique export data shows significant export underreporting. Likewise, almost none of the logs and sawn wood reported as imports by Tanzania (in the order of tens of thousands m3 yearly) are reported by Mozambique, suggesting the bulk this trade is illegal. Nearly 90% of logs are exported to China, the majority consisting of only five species: Afzelia quanzensis (chanfuta), Millettia stuhlmannii (jambirre or panga-panga), Combretum imberbe, Swartzia madagascariensis, and Pterocarpus angolensis (umbila).

Chinese syndicates are reported to be financing harvest in Zambia, south-east Angola and DRC, exporting 250\u2013300 containers of logs monthly via Namibia. Other reports, meanwhile, estimated that national annual production of mukula in Zambia alone was 110,000 m3\u2014between 1,500 and 2,000 containers of logs, affecting a forest area between 90,000\u2013150,000 ha (assuming 7 stems/ha in high stocked forests and 3\u20134 in low-stocked). Most of this is technically illegal and transported with bribes corresponding to USD 16\u201327/log. Chinese customs data indicate a rapid increase in import of logs from Zambia, research indicates that the vast majority of those are mukula logs. Imports went from just over 35,000 m3 in 2015 to 65,000 m3 in the first half of 2017 alone. A large portion of this is falsely declared as sawn wood in export documents: in 2016, Zambia declared only 3000 m3 of log exports (approximate value USD 900,000) while China declared log imports of about 61,000 m3 (approximate value USD 87 million). Inclusion in Appendix II to improve control of other listed species A) Specimens in trade resemble those of species listed in Appendix II under Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) Annex 2 a or listed in Appendix I Pterocarpus erinaceus was listed in Appendix II following CoP17. There are no overlaps in range States between this species and P. tinctorius (native to West and Central Africa (UNEP-WCMC, 2019)). The structural features of P. erinaceus are largely identical with those of other Pterocarpus species and also with some of the genus Dalbergia; the wood, however, can be distinguished from those with a similar structure due to the light base colour of the heartwood with regular brown colour streaks (Richter et al., 2014). While undertaking a non- detriment finding for Pterocarpus tinctorius (Mukula), Belgium noted that identification is only reliable at genus level (PC24 Doc. 30.4). It was previously recommended that genus level regulation is needed as accurate/affordable species recognition systems are not yet available and if species level regulation was implemented, traders would simply relabel timber under a non-regulated species name (Winfield et al., 2016). Additional Information Threats The primary threat to Pterocarpus tinctorius is over-harvesting, including both legal and widespread illegal extraction, for the international trade. The threat represented by this trade is compounded by deforestation from forest conversion and aridification due to climate change and more severe fires. Conservation, management and legislation National legislation: See table below. Note that this table is focused on national laws and regulatory measures. However, in many of the range States, traditional chiefs have significant authority over harvest rights in their villages or territories. Their decisions may not always be in line with the national government\u2019s policies.

However, little or no African rosewood is traded to these countries. Chinese companies may choose to operate under Voluntary Guidelines called the Guide on Sustainable Overseas Forest Management and Utilization by Chinese Enterprises. Management measures are defined by each range State\u2019s forest legislation, which define aspects including minimum cutting diameters and areas off-limits from harvest activity such as parks and other protected areas, riparian corridors, steep slopes etc. In practice these measures are unevenly enforced and monitoring of timber harvesting is not routinely undertaken. Artificial propagation/captive breeding Pterocarpus tinctorius can be propagated by either seed or cuttings, and wild seedlings can also be collected for planting. However, there is little to no information available regarding artificial propagation for commercial purposes. Genetic exploration using tissue culture has not been done. At present, almost all harvest of this slow- growing species appears to be from wild sources. There has also been very little success with artificial propagation in similar species such as Pterocarpus angolensis. Reasons for these failures are listed as low germination rates, slow tree growth and high levels of competition for sunlight (Mojeremane & Lumbile, 2016). Implementation challenges (including similar species) There exists some confusion as to whether the common name used by traders in Zambia, mukula, refers specifically to Pterocarpus tinctorius or to a rosewood species complex. The same may be the case in other range States. These look-alike issues are a complexity of the rosewood trade in general and were the key factor in listing of the entire Dalbergia genus in Appendix II in 2016. Pterocarpus angolensis (common names: muka, kiaat, African teak) is a species of the miombio woodland savannas of Eastern and Southern Africa with similar morphological and timber characteristics to P. tinctorius. This species is a keystone of domestic timber markets. IUCN Red List has assessed P. angolensis as Near Threatened. Pterocarpus soyauxii (common names: Padauk d\u2019Afrique) is another highly sought-after timber with rosewood properties. It has been reported that Pterocarpus angolensis and P. tinctorius are regularly mixed and traded together as one species in areas where their ranges overlap in Zambia and Tanzania (Cunningham, 2016). Identification of timber species is known to be very difficult for genera such as Pterocarpus and Dalbergia. A lot of more technologically advanced methods such as DNA analysis, chemical analysis and isotope analysis are still in their infancy and are thought to be some years off being available at the local level for timber identification (Winfield et al., 2016).

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 55 Amendment of the annotation to the listing of Bitter Aloe Aloe ferox Proponent: South Africa Summary: Aloe ferox is a medicinal plant native to South Africa and Lesotho that has been included in CITES Appendix II since 1975 as part of the genus level listing of Aloe spp. The current annotation to the listing #4 includes the following: All parts and derivatives, except: a) seeds (including seedpods of Orchidaceae), spores and pollen (including pollinia). The exemption does not apply to seeds from Cactaceae species exported from Mexico, and to seeds from Beccariophoenix madagascariensis and Dypsis decaryi exported from Madagascar; b) seedling or tissue cultures obtained in vitro, in solid or liquid media, transported in sterile containers; c) cut flowers of artificially propagated plants; d) fruits, and parts and derivatives thereof, of naturalized or artificially propagated plants of the genus Vanilla (Orchidaceae) and of the family Cactaceae; e) stems, flowers, and parts and derivatives thereof, of naturalized or artificially propagated plants of the genera Opuntia subgenus Opuntia and Selenicereus (Cactaceae); and f) finished products of Euphorbia antisyphilitica packaged and ready for retail trade. The Proponents seek to amend the annotation so that part f) reads: finished products1 of Aloe ferox and Euphorbia antisyphilitica packaged and ready for retail trade. The proposed amendment provides a footnote defining \u201cfinished product\u201d as follows: 1This term, as used in the CITES Appendices refers to products, shipped singly or in bulk, requiring no further processing, packaged, labelled for final use or the retail trade in a state fit for being sold to or used by the general public. Almost all trade in wild Aloe ferox originates from South Africa. Bitter sap (\u201cbitters\u201d) is extracted from harvested leaves, crystalised and sometimes ground to powder then exported. Recently, further processing of secondary extracts has been taking place including the inner leaf jelly as a juice, gel or powder, and these products too have been increasingly going into international trade.

However, studies provided on concentrations of Aloe ferox extracts contained in finished products do not help to clarify the significance of export quantities reported as derivatives. Other species in the Appendices are also annotated with #4 but would not be affected by this amendment. Analysis: According to Res. Conf. 11.21 (Rev.

These derivatives, or finished products are commodities that first appear in international trade. If they are becoming dominant in the volumes of exports their exemption would not be in line with the guidance in Res. Conf. 11.21 (Rev. CoP17). However, this is not possible to ascertain without more detailed insight into the concentration of primary and secondary Aloe ferox extracts in the products exported. If the amendment to exclude finished products of Aloe ferox is adopted, it would not be necessary to include a footnote defining \u201cfinished products\u201d as this definition is the same as that provided in the Interpretation text of the Appendices and therefore does not require a footnote defining it specifically in this annotation. Aloe ferox would only be differentiated from other Aloe species on the basis of ingredient lists. Summary of Available Information Text in non-italics is based on information in the Proposal and Supporting Statement (SS); text in italics is based on additional information and/or assessment of information in the SS Range South Africa and Lesotho. IUCN Global Category Not assessed. A) Background Aloe ferox was listed in the Appendices in 1975 as part of the genus level listing for Aloe. Its distribution is within South Africa\u2019s Western and Eastern Cape Province, the south-east of Free State and in southern Lesotho. Its distribution is around 168,000 km2, occurring intermittently in dense stands across this range. Population numbers or trends are not available. The Red Data list of southern African plants considered it as least concern in South Africa and Lesotho. Current levels of offtake are considered to be sustainable; although localised damage and even extinctions have resulted from over-exploitation and destructive harvesting by untrained harvesters, particularly in the Eastern Cape Province. Longer-term impacts of high levels of harvesting on populations remains unknown. Harvesting is mainly of leaves from which the aloe bitters are extracted. Generally between 6-30 leaves can be harvested from each plant every 1.8 years depending on the plant\u2019s health. Harvested leaves are \u201ctapped\u201d to remove the bitter sap (\u201cbitters\u201d) which are further processed with this extract historically being the dominant product in trade. Recently secondary extracts have also been increasingly going into international trade including the inner leaf jelly as a juice, gel or powder. It is a key ingredient in laxatives; other end uses include health drinks, medicines and a range of healthcare and cosmetics products. In recent years there has been further extraction of secondary products from the leaves post removal of the bitters; aloe gel is derived from the white spongy mesophyll layer of the leaf. Both primary and secondary extract are further processed to make finished products. South Africa is the only range State exporting commercial levels of products. Lesotho\u2019s reported exports of wild harvested Aloe ferox have been minimal; 10 live plants imported to South Africa (according to the CITES Trade Database). Assessment against the guidance in Res. Conf. 11.21 (Rev. CoP17) Use of annotations in Appendices I and II This Resolution recommends the following guidance and principles for annotations: b) two main principles be followed as standard guidance when drafting annotations for plants: i) controls should concentrate on those commodities that first appear in international trade as exports from range States; these may range from crude to processed material; and ii) controls should include only those commodities that dominate the trade and the demand for the wild resource A rapid assessment was carried out of exports reported by South Africa (in the CITES Trade Database) in weight (the majority of reported products) to determine which commodities dominate the exports from range States. Figure 1 shows that extract has dominated the trade over the period between 2000 and 2016, however in the IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 55 320 years 2013-2015 exports of derivatives outweighed those of extract and powder. It is likely that if derivatives are finished products that a significant part of the quantity is of other ingredients and packaging. In addition to products reported in weight over this period, items with no unit (presumed individual items) exported from South Africa accounted for ca 720,000 derivatives and ca 61,000 items of extract.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6fba02e9-61ac-4c5b-bdba-376f91fb69a0": {"__data__": {"id_": "6fba02e9-61ac-4c5b-bdba-376f91fb69a0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8c6505d664dd23090aa871ed36867a580a50be2e7d340ab6186853c02a6fc19d"}, "2": {"node_id": "4bce8c9c-438c-4629-aa20-8c514636782e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "55f42e2394d6feb008dbc9af2b8af4802bee35ccfa4da328fca4705450544114"}}, "hash": "bbb1e395d77ae681d9911286df866c10cf43a44bfc6d9ff6a1f264012b1e0a79", "text": "Figure 1: Quantity of main commodities of Aloe ferox in trade reported as weight by South Africa (source: CITES Trade Database).

Ten companies in the country are involved in the creation, distribution and sale of ready packaged consumer goods containing. It remains unclear whether all exports reported as derivatives are indeed of finished products packaged and ready for retail trade. According to the SS, exports of derivatives may contain minimal amounts of Aloe ferox material and that much of the Aloe ferox material in these finished products is derived from the secondary extracts from the leaves of the Aloe ferox from which bitters have already been removed. The SS reasons that it is primary extracts that are driving the harvest of leaves and therefore the exemption of finished products (which are mainly derived from secondary extracts) would not have any impact on the total amount of Aloe ferox harvested, assuming that the amount of leaves harvested for bitters extract is enough fulfil the demand for secondary extract. A limited study included in the SS of finished products found for sale online in South Africa and internationally found that: - Primary extract o 15% of the items contained more than 80% of primary extract o only 6% contained less than 50% of primary extract. - Secondary extract: o most (66%) products had less than 50% of secondary extract o 13% contained more than 80% of secondary extract However, it is not possible to extrapolate the figures in this study to the exports of finished products from South Africa as there is no indication of whether the products in the study have been manufactured in South Africa or elsewhere. The vast majority of those finished products could contain anything below 50%. No study is known to have been made on the contents of exports of finished products from South Africa and the actual quantity of Aloe ferox product being exported in this form is unknown and nor the proportion of it that is likely to be secondary versus primary extract. Other species in the Appendices are also annotated with #4, but would not be affected by this amendment. Additional Information Potential benefit(s) of listing for trade regulation Significant quantities of Aloe ferox products are re-exported subsequently by non-range States. The Proponent argues that the exemption of finished products would significantly reduce the burden on Parties (both importing and exporting) from this trade by eliminating the need to inspect consignments of finished products which contain minimal amount. Germany has stated that their customs seized more than 3000 pieces of such products in 2018, in most cases cosmetics but also food supplements containing Aloe ferox. Seizures are primarily finished products for personal consumption, ordered by internet and shipped by post to the recipients (M. Stertz, in litt. 2019). References Stertz, M.

Switzerland, as the Depositary Government for the Convention, draws attention to the fact that the inclusion of the term \u201clive plants\u201d is redundant, inconsistent with other listings and potentially misleading. This is because, according to Article I of the Convention and Res. Conf. 11.21 (Rev. CoP17), live plants (and whole dead plants) are automatically covered by listings in the Appendices.

Cedrela odorata is the most widespread species and appears to be the most highly traded species internationally, although other species are also used for their valuable timber. Cedrela odorata has been listed in Appendix III by Colombia and Peru since 2001, by Guatemala since 2008, by Bolivia since 2010, and by Brazil since 2011. Two other species in the genus, C. fissilis and C. lilloi, have been listed in Appendix III by Bolivia and Brazil since 2010 and 2016 respectively. All listed populations are covered by annotation #5 (logs, sawn wood and veneer sheets). Cedrela odorata was assessed as globally Vulnerable with a decreasing population trend on the IUCN Red List in 2017, with the unsustainable harvest of timber cited as the main threat. Many populations appear to have been severely depleted by targeted over-exploitation, are categorised as nationally endangered or vulnerable, and are subject to laws and other measures to regulate harvest. Illegal trade has been reported. Extensive loss of habitat also threatens the species; deforestation data indicate that the range has decreased by 29% in the last 100 years, and is estimated to decline by 40% in the next 100 years. The wood of C. odorata is used extensively for furniture making and other purposes. According to the CITES Trade Database, large quantities of sawn wood have been exported by Peru, Bolivia and Brazil (noting that data reported to CITES primarily reflect exports from range States with Appendix III-listed populations), as well as non-range States where plantations have been established. The principal importers were the USA and Mexico (43% and 33% of total reported imports from 2007- 2016, respectively). Available data for the principal range State exporters indicate that domestic trade exceeds international trade (annual average of 72,000 m3 relative to 46,000 m3 for Bolivia, Brazil and Peru combined over the period 2004-2008). There was a substantial increase in exports and prices of C. odorata timber following the 2003 listing of Big-leaf Mahogany Swietenia macrophylla in Appendix II. Reported exports of C. odorata timber peaked at over 60,000 m3 in 2007 but subsequently declined to under 10,000 m3 in 2010. Exports then increased slightly with the listing of the Bolivian and Brazilian populations in 2010/2011, and remained relatively stable at around 14,000 m3 per year from 2014 to 2016. Cedrela odorata has been planted widely in parts of the region and introduced to many countries elsewhere. Although monospecific plantations have not generally been successful in the tropical Americas due to vulnerability to the Shoot Borer Hypsipyla grandella, in other regions monospecific plantations are well established. The vast majority of reported exports from plantations (\u201cartificially propagated\u201d) were from non-range States (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Ghana). Although exports from plantations exceeded exports from the wild in every year since 2013, there was an overall decline in exports from plantations from 2013 (over 12,000 m3) to 2016 (ca. 8,000 m3). Other species Both C. fissilis and C. lilloi are also widely distributed and categorised as globally threatened (Vulnerable and Endangered respectively), with certain national populations also categorised as threatened. Over-exploitation for timber has been reported to be a threat, in addition to habitat loss. While C. fissilis timber is considered inferior to that of C. odorata, timber of the two species is reportedly marketed interchangeably. In Ecuador, it was reported in 2018 that most wild populations of C. fissilis had been destroyed and the remaining large trees were being felled for export to Colombia. Total exports of C. fissilis reported in the CITES Trade Database primarily comprised 1,650 m3 wild-sourced sawn wood and 6,400 m2 source \u201cI\u201d veneer (the majority exported from IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 57 Brazil); no trade was reported from 2014 onwards.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e6b5b07-472a-4e34-8f6c-9801872e2e41": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e6b5b07-472a-4e34-8f6c-9801872e2e41", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "35e51e8b03ab42d495b548b2b9031ddaa22e56c6853704f4c29ba1bc665b3b8e"}, "2": {"node_id": "542a7708-f62a-47c4-9501-307189aa1c1c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f6bd52c1bab1b1ab1484af64f330e82292a4f1535d1e1beb92424bd261a292fa"}}, "hash": "618f4b2866fe2067bb8469e3fd1df2aeb3b6cb06a96db47ac63ea689f4b80106", "text": "57 Brazil); no trade was reported from 2014 onwards.

The principal exporters were Peru (21%), C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire (18%), Ghana (15%), Bolivia (15%) and China (10%). It is not clear if exports from non-range States are re-exports or originate from plantations in those countries. Although identification manuals have been developed to differentiate the woods of certain Cedrela species, several range States have reported identification difficulties and according to one expert it is not possible to distinguish between species in the genus based on either macroscopic or microscopic characters of the wood. Analysis: Cedrela is a genus of New World trees of which C. odorata is the most widespread species. Cedrela odorata has been intensively exploited for its timber, for both domestic and international trade. Based on available data, the principal exporters of C. odorata appear to be Bolivia, Brazil, Peru, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Ghana. Although the timber of certain other species is also reported to be valuable and can be marketed interchangeably with C. odorata, it is not clear whether there is significant international demand for other species. Some populations of C. odorata and several other species are known to have been substantially reduced by the combined effects of deforestation and targeted over-exploitation. Given the estimated historic and future declines for C. odorata, and significant historic impact of international trade, the species may meet the criteria for inclusion in Appendix II set out in Annex 2a of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17). Given the reported identification difficulties, the remaining species in the genus would appear to meet the criteria for inclusion in Annex 2b. Other Considerations: The proposal does not include an annotation. However, the scope could be restricted using an annotation that covers the main products in trade (all populations currently included in Appendix III are covered by annotation #5). Sawn wood has been the most common product in reported international trade.

Biological and trade criteria for inclusion in Appendix II (Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev.

In 2011 it was reported to be the second most valuable species in Latin America and the Caribbean after Big-leaf Mahogany Swietenia macrophylla (P\u00e9rez Contreras, 2011). Although estimates of the current total population of C. odorata are not available, populations of this species have been reduced by selective logging for at least 250 years, especially of the largest individuals, and are now in decline (Mark & Rivers, 2017). Cintron (1990) reported that although widespread, C. odorata was not common in moist tropical American forests and its numbers continued to be reduced by exploitation without successful regeneration. In Central America, although the greatest threat to natural forests is conversion of land to other uses, selective harvesting of timber was reported to particularly threaten native species including C. odorata (UNEP, 2003). Cavers et al. (2004) reported that genetic erosion of this species had already occurred throughout its natural distribution due to significant over-exploitation, and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b898721-e7ea-47fb-9b23-aee2401d264b": {"__data__": {"id_": "0b898721-e7ea-47fb-9b23-aee2401d264b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "52c06f4ce48e73094a8d566702898d384147e6214fdf3469be4057441eb2d2c2"}, "3": {"node_id": "91d8cfa3-ccbd-4fbd-8d70-9e53cc2f1e44", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ff5df17f913311565780bb214abdca7c652e4c8a0db5b54164e76098d0048260"}}, "hash": "736ce6079d8c30f299c1e08ceab2d13ba757eb24b2fe0094ccd8975081cbe0e6", "text": "trees of good form were rarely found except in isolated areas. Pennington & Muellner (2010) report that across the species\u2019 range it was difficult to find large trees (1m DBH or more) in natural forest, except in protected areas, because of the species\u2019 long history of logging. The species\u2019 habitat is highly fragmented by deforestation (Mark & Rivers, 2017). The total distribution range of C. odorata was reported to have decreased by 29% in the last 100 years (approximately three generations), and it was estimated that it will be reduced by a further 40% in the next 100 years (Mark, 2017). Available data on population sizes/trends for specific areas is summarised below: - Amazon: Reported to be scarce in sample units across the Amazon. - Argentina: Range reported to have declined in 2004 (Zapater et al., 2004). - Barbados: Formerly common and widespread, but had become rare by 1965 (Gooding et al., 1965). - Bolivia: In 2011 it was reported that no distribution/density studies had been conducted in Bolivia. - Brazil: In 2011 it was reported that no distribution/density studies had been conducted in Brazil. Nationally assessed as vulnerable. - Cayman Islands: Nationally assessed as critically endangered. - Colombia: Average density reported to be 0.39 individuals / ha in 2015. The selective extraction that this species had suffered for years was reported to have affected the presence of large trees and the availability of seed; the density of trees with DBH> 80 cm (proposed minimum cutting diameter) was reportedly zero or close to zero, suggesting a clear depletion of harvestable trees in natural forests nationwide. Nationally assessed as endangered. - Costa Rica: The species was reported in 1999 to be threatened due to heavy exploitation, and in 2006 was reported to be in a vulnerable condition due to timber extraction and a 57% reduction in its habitat, but a study by Rivera et al. (2010) concluded that the population in Costa Rica was increasing. The number of individuals of C. odorata was estimated at 12,110 in its natural distribution area in 2010, equivalent to a population density of 0.96 individuals / km. - Dominican Republic: Nationally assessed as critically endangered. - Ecuador: A 2013 study reported that small, fragmented populations of C. odorata made up mostly of young individuals were observed in areas where forest extraction had been more intensive in the IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 57 country, while in areas where there had been no extraction, a greater density of individuals and predominance of the major diameter classes was found. C. odorata has lost 34% of its habitat in the country and is assessed nationally as vulnerable. - El Salvador: Included in an official list of species threatened with extinction in the country in 1997 (Anon., 1997). - Guatemala: Numbers reported to have been greatly reduced by intensive logging by 1946 (Standley & Steyermark, 1946). Nationally assessed as vulnerable. - Mexico: A 2017 study estimated 1.40 \u00b1 0.93 million trees of C. odorata in the Pacific region, 4.52 \u00b1 1.75 million trees in the South-Southeast region and 9.01 \u00b1 2.85 million trees in the Gulf of Mexico, totalling ca. 14.98 million trees (the SS indicates that these figures do not differentiate between wild trees or plantations, but the study specifies natural forests). It was estimated that the population was stable. - Panama: Reported to be rare but previously common in certain areas, and most trees less than 50cm in diameter; large individuals likely to have been harvested (Condit & P\u00e9rez, 2002). - Peru: A 2011 study estimated the total population at 1.1 million trees with a commercial population between 261,159 and 300,743 trees and densities of up to 1.15 individuals / ha.

Cedrela fissilis The species is very widespread but the population is experiencing significant decline as a result of large scale forest clearance across its range (Barstow, 2018). The species is also exploited for its valuable and desirable timber; the timber is considered inferior to that of C. odorata (Pennington & Muellner, 2010; Barstow, 2018) but can be sold interchangeably (Barstow, 2018). Although the species has been reported to be widely protected and cultivated for its timber (Pennington & Muellner, 2010), logging has led to many subpopulations of the species becoming extinct (CNCFlora, 2012) and has caused a decline in genetic diversity (Nunes et al., 2007). It is estimated that across the species range there has been at least a 30% population decline over the last three generations (150\u2013300 years), and is predicted to decline at least 30% further over the coming century as a result of continued illegal logging and forest clearance (Barstow, 2018).

In Bolivia, export of unprocessed forestry products is subject to restrictions and highly regulated, mainly through forest certification (from 1996 onwards, last updated 2016; Forest Legality Initiative, 2016). In Peru, there is an export ban on logs and forest products \u201cin their natural state\u201d except when they originate from nurseries or forest plantations, and if they do not require processing for final consumption (from 1972 onwards, last updated 2016; Forest Legality Initiative, 2016). IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 57 Occurrence of C. odorata in protected areas: Tikal National Park in Guatemala (57,400 ha), Corcovado NP (54,568 ha) and La Amistad Biosphere Reserve (584,592 ha) in Costa Rica; elsewhere in South America it is present in many reserved areas throughout its range (Pennington & Muellner, 2010). Artificial Propagation Cedrela odorata plantations in tropical America have not been successful due mainly to attack by the Shoot Borer Hypsipyla grandella. However, planting at low densities in a matrix of other species appears to confer some protection (Pennington & Muellner, 2010). For this reason, it is sown mainly within agroforestry plantations in its natural distribution area. In areas without Shoot Borer (Africa, Asia and the Pacific) it establishes well in plantations and even has the potential to become an invasive weed, forming dense monospecific stands which can shade out less aggressive native species (Pennington & Muellner, 2010). Poor selection of plantation sites is also cited as a factor in the lack of success of plantations, by not meeting with the specific requirements of the species, such as having well-drained, deep and humid soils. As detailed above, around 25% of global exports reported over the period 2007-2016 were recorded as artificially propagated, the proportion of artificially propagated exports increased over this period from <1% in 2007 to 59% in 2016. In the period 2010\u20132018, Ecuador harvested a volume of standing timber of 3,911.94 m3, of which 86% came from cultivated forests (plantations) and the remaining 14% from relict tree cutting programs. In Mexico there has been an increase in commercial forest plantations. Mexico reported 37,176 ha of plantations with a yield of 160 m3/ha, with its commercial purpose being roundwood, while Colombia reported that it has registered 8,021 ha of plantations of this species (PC24 Doc. 22 (Rev. 1)). A 2011 report noted that plantations in Bolivia, Brazil and Peru were not yet of harvestable age (P\u00e9rez Contreras, 2011). It is not clear whether there is an ongoing reliance on wild seeds/saplings to establish or supplement plantations. Implementation challenges (including similar species) Taxonomic, genetic, physical, mechanical and anatomical knowledge to differentiate the woods of Cedrela species is limited, and the woods of different species may be marketed interchangeably. Several countries have expressed difficulties in differentiating between Cedrela species (Brazil, Ecuador, El Salvador and Peru). Guatemala, Jamaica and Peru reported that they have developed identification tools to differentiate Cedrela species; the only further details provided were that Peru has developed manuals for the dendrological and anatomical identification of the main commercial Cedrela species which will be published online in the near future. However, based on the CITESwoodID database (Richter et al., 2014 and subsequent updates), it is not reported to be possible to distinguish the individual species within the genus Cedrela using macroscopic or microscopic wood anatomical methods (G.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is the global authority on the status of the natural world and the measures needed to safeguard it. IUCN is a membership Union composed of both government and civil society organisations. It harnesses the experience, resources and reach of its more than 1,300 Member organisations and the input of more than 13,000 experts. The IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC), the largest of IUCN\u2019s six commissions, has over 8,000 species experts recruited through its network of over 150 groups (Specialist Groups, Task Forces and groups focusing solely on Red List assessments). Biodiversity loss is one of the world\u2019s most pressing crises, with many species\u2019 populations declining to critical levels. SSC is dedicated to halting this decline in biodiversity and to provide an unmatched source of information and advice to influence conservation outcomes, as well as contribute to international conventions and agreements dealing with biodiversity conservation. TRAFFIC is a non-governmental organisation working globally on trade in wild animals and plants in the context of both biodiversity conservation and sustainable development. TRAFFIC plays a unique and leading role as a global wildlife trade specialist, with a team of staff around the world carrying out research, investigations and analysis to compile the evidence needed to catalyse action by governments, businesses and individuals, in collaboration with a wide range of partners, to help ensure that wildlife trade is not a threat to the conservation of nature.

It provides public, private and non-governmental organisations with the knowledge and tools that enable human progress, economic development and nature conservation to take place together. Created in 1948, IUCN is now the world\u2018s largest and most diverse environmental network, harnessing the knowledge, resources and reach of more than 1,300 Member organisations and some 13,000 experts. It is a leading provider of conservation data, assessments and analysis. Its broad membership enables IUCN to fill the role of incubator and trusted repository of best practices, tools and international standards. IUCN provides a neutral space in which diverse stakeholders including governments, NGOs, scientists, businesses, local communities, indigenous peoples organisations and others can work together to forge and implement solutions to environmental challenges and achieve sustainable development. Working with many partners and supporters, IUCN implements a large and diverse portfolio of conservation projects worldwide. Combining the latest science with the traditional knowledge of local communities, these projects work to reverse habitat loss, restore ecosystems and improve people\u2018s well-being. www.iucn.org https://twitter.com/IUCN/ Measuring, understanding and adapting to nexus trade-offs in the Sekong, Sesan and Srepok Transboundary River Basins Jake Brunner, Jeremy Carew-Reid, Raphael Glemet, Matthew McCartney and Philip Riddell The designation of geographical entities in this report, and the presentation of the materials, do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of IUCN or US State Department or Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) or the Building River Dialogue and Governance programme (BRIDGE) concerning the legal status of any country, territory, or area, or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries.

The LMI is founded on the assumption that development challenges in the Lower Mekong require stronger regional cooperation.1 One of LMI\u2018s components is an Environment and Water Pillar. This component aims to advance sustainable economic development through regional dialogue and capacity-building. It promotes cross-cutting strategies to achieve water, energy, food and environmental security. The LMI nexus Futures Program (NFP) is a subset of the LMI. It was created by merging LMI\u2018s water, energy, food, and environment pillars. Its goals are: \uf0b7 the advancement of sustainable economic development; \uf0b7 strengthened regional integration; and \uf0b7 Resilience to the impacts of climate change. A consortium comprising IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature), IWMI (International Water Management Institute) and ICEM (International Centre for Environmental Management) was engaged to assist the NFP by preparing a nexus assessment of the Sekong, Sesan, and Srepok (3S) sub-basins in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. This report comprises a building block of the consortium\u2018s first deliverable which is: \u201cA nexus assessment produced in collaboration/partnership with key regional stakeholders to facilitate improved understanding within existing local, national, and/or regional dialogues, planning, and/or investments on the opportunities and risks from conjunctively managing water, food, energy, and the environment\u201d. The term \u2015nexus assessment\u2016 refers to an integrated assessment of current and future trends of water, energy, food, and environmental conditions to support integrated planning and development decision-making at the regional level. The assessment also provides recommendations to overcome data, technology, and capacity, institutional and financial barriers. This report includes five sections and three annexes. Section 1 summarizes the key challenges in the 3S. These include: \uf0b7 Rapid, unregulated land use change characterized by widespread deforestation. \uf0b7 Degradation of terrestrial and aquatic habitats, resulting in reduced biomass that provides crucial nutritional value and livelihoods for the rural poor. \uf0b7 Poverty and malnutrition, especially among ethnic minorities. \uf0b7 Domestic immigration leading to unsustainable land use pressure, especially in Vietnam. \uf0b7 Squandering of water on economically low-value uses, resulting in declining basin welfare. Global experience shows that the existing siloed approaches to water, food and energy will result in continued degradation of the natural environment and with the poorest communities paying the highest price. Hence the importance of the NFP dialogue, which seeks cross-sectoral and integrated solutions. To understand how a nexus approach can help avoid the problems of silo-based approaches to water, food, energy and environment, it is necessary to know what is planned for these sectors in each country. Section 2 therefore examines the policy and planning frameworks in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. It does this by consolidating the objectives in these frameworks into a set of generalized objectives for each country. Redundancies are removed by further consolidation into 18 unique objectives of which: \uf0b7 Seven are concerned with water resources 1https://www.lowermekong.org/ vi \uf0b7 Three are concerned with food \uf0b7 Three are concerned with energy \uf0b7 Five are concerned with the environment A nexus assessment applied to these objectives reveals a range of various threats that an initiative in one sector might pose to another. We call these \u2015red flags\u2016. Many of these threats could be addressed by appropriate implementation of a nexus approach within and among each country. These are identified in Section 3. Seven nexus solutions are identified of which two comprise of built and five are natural infrastructure. In addition, eight non- nexus solutions are identified as complementary measures that would add value to a nexus approach.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "69a3c425-3efe-494f-aba9-dbe83639cdf4": {"__data__": {"id_": "69a3c425-3efe-494f-aba9-dbe83639cdf4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Measuring, understanding and adapting to nexus trade-offs in the Sekong, Sesan and Srepok transboundary river basins", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dfc6c3b9146f89a75eeb3b5b5983568add6c52cf6b135bfdcd0fe124e96ef3ee"}, "2": {"node_id": "eeb1fad0-1ba9-4b06-a0ea-6d66846c1404", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5e17d61c4b538cc5dbde9cd3e30b27b4db85581d086083fc51c2c5c9a9b5d96b"}}, "hash": "16147173edb9c0e7904174eb2b9e07412887c3657f8f670a43539e24c03d6a4f", "text": "The major threats and nexus solutions were then consolidated into the typology shown in Table 1, which shows the potential of natural infrastructure to address the threats.

BACKGROUND 1.1 Sustainable development challenges in the 3S Globally, demands for water, energy, and food are increasing rapidly while available natural resources are increasingly degraded and in scarce supply. This challenge is particularly acute in developing countries experiencing rapid economic growth such as Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam (CLV). Within CLV, the Sesan, Srepok, and Sekong, or 3S river basins, are of special interest from a nexus perspective of water, energy, food and environmental trade-offs and solutions. This sparsely populated region, often referred to as the last frontier of development in CLV, is rich in natural resources, which governments are seeking to harness to drive national development. The process has gone furthest in Vietnam where large-scale state investment in agriculture, mining, hydropower, and transport in the Central Highlands started in the 1990s. In Cambodia, investments in roads, hydropower, and land development started in the 2000s and in Laos more recently. Globally, the pattern of investment and growth expanding into a less developed periphery is typical. What justifies a focus on the 3S for this nexus assessment is the pace and scale of change, and its globally-important biodiversity. Parts of the 3S have experienced dramatic changes, particularly in Vietnam through coffee and hydropower, and the 3S typify the challenges that confront natural resources management in fast-growing economies. Box 1.1 describes the human and environmental transformation of the Central Highlands over the last 40 years. There have been several nexus studies of the Lower Mekong as a whole. Pittock et al. (2016) propose a model showing how increased hydropower and irrigation could drive further river Box 1.1: Development of the Central Highlands The Central Highlands is dominated by basalt-derived soils, which are suitable for perennial crops such as coffee, rubber, tea, pepper, cashew nut, and mulberry. Today, it produces 75% of Vietnam\u2018s rubber and 80% of its coffee. Coffee exports from Dak Lak alone were worth $1.26 billion in 2018. The region is also rich in bauxite and gold. Before 1976, ethnic minorities made up 70% of the population. As more and more Kinh people\u2014the largest ethnicity in Vietnam\u2014arrived, the ethnic minority population declined to 44% in 1993 and 25% in 2004. Most of the immigration was state-organized as the government brought in labor to work new state- owned logging and industrial crop enterprises and to reduce population pressure on the densely- populated Red River Delta in the north. Rapid Kinh immigration resulted in the large-scale transfer of land to state-owned farms and conflicts with ethnic minorities who were pushed deeper into the forests. The area of coffee grew from 207,000 hectares in 1996 to 573,000 hectares in 2014 while the area under rubber grew five-fold over the same period (Figure 1.6). In 2018, the area of coffee in Dak Lak alone was 204,000 hectares. Unregulated logging and land conversion resulted in rapid deforestation. Nationwide, annual timber production fell from 600,000-700,000 m3 in the late 1980s and early 1990s to 200,000-300,000 m3 today. Forest cover fell from 67% in 1976 to 50% in 2012 and has continued to decline. The government has invested heavily in infrastructure in the Central Highlands. Hundreds of small (<5 MW) hydropower plants have been built, every commune now has electricity, and the region is now connected to the rest of the country through a dense road network.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9a94b254-ccc1-4bb9-b226-2033506453e9": {"__data__": {"id_": "9a94b254-ccc1-4bb9-b226-2033506453e9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Measuring, understanding and adapting to nexus trade-offs in the Sekong, Sesan and Srepok transboundary river basins", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "39c39010bf7394f7bdcfce153783faad461be8830f2bb233853dee5343add43b"}, "2": {"node_id": "3f553f0a-4b15-49eb-88a7-416588f34ea8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3063c774cbbb63fbb190659d8e080f3d7e32fcf368366a7f0d335161953884ed"}}, "hash": "bb7d1ca5cd0816590409629768a2986c259434e88fa9010b677ced976a65383f", "text": "Rapidly growing populations and agriculture (especially irrigated robusta coffee) production have hugely increased water demand, resulting in rapidly falling groundwater tables during the dry season, while forest clearing has reduced water retention and groundwater recharge. 2 modification through a feedback loop (Figure 1.1).

Such a feedback loop can have positive outcomes. More power can support increased industrialization, urbanization, and higher paying non-agricultural jobs (e.g., construction, garments) that allow food requirements to be met through a combination of increased productivity from land consolidation (as the rural population falls) and/or increased imports. However, this model entails risks. From Vietnam\u2018s perspective, sediment-trapping dams pose an existential threat to the Mekong Delta, source of 90% of the country\u2018s rice exports and 20% of its GDP. No amount of industrialization could offset the loss of the delta\u2018s economic importance. In 2018, the Communist Party of Vietnam designated the sustainability of the Mekong Delta a matter of national security. In 2014, to encourage greater regional cooperation over the Mekong, Vietnam ratified the UN Watercourses Convention. The loss of capture fisheries affects the landless who depend on fishing for their livelihoods and food security. This risk is high in the 3S because over half the Lower Mekong fish catch is from long- range migrant fish species that are particularly susceptible to dams, dikes, and other barriers. The impacts of dams on fisheries and food security therefore extend far beyond the 3S itself. Figure 1.1: Nexus feedback loop in the Lower Mekong adapted from Pittock et al. (2016) The 3S merge just upstream of their confluence with the Mekong and combined form the Mekong\u2018s single largest tributary basin (78,579 km2). All three rivers are transboundary. The Sekong originates in central Vietnam and flows into southeast Laos, and then into northeast Cambodia. The Sesan and Srepok originate in the Central Highlands before they too flow into northeast Cambodia (Figure 1.2). 3 While often referred to as a single unit, the three rivers basins are physically, socially, and economically diverse (Table 1.1). The Sekong is the least developed in terms of population, commercial agriculture, and hydropower. It has the highest proportion of ethnic minorities, the largest remaining area of forest, and the largest number of endemic fish species.

These sediments provide nutrients vital to fisheries in the Tonle Sap and rice production in the Mekong Delta.

Located just below the confluence of the Sesan and Srepok, the LS2 blocks fish migration up the entire length of these two rivers and is estimated to reduce total fish biomass in the Lower Mekong by almost 10% (Ziv et al., 2012). The 3S has a total population of just over four million, most of whom (82%) live in the Central Highlands (Figure 1.3).

Poverty is concentrated in ethnic minority groups. Often located on marginal lands, using traditional low productivity agriculture practices, and with limited access to roads, electricity, water supply and sanitation infrastructure, these are largely small-scale, subsistence farming communities that remain highly dependent on fisheries and forest products. Although conditions tend to be better than in many parts of Cambodia and Laos, the largest numbers of poor people live in the Central Highlands. Throughout the 3S, ethnic minorities remain exposed to economic and environmental vulnerabilities that undermine their livelihoods, health and general well-being. Life expectancy is low, and malnutrition remains a severe problem with rates well above national averages in all three countries. 5 Expansion of agriculture and commercial plantations has led to rapid forest loss, particularly since the late 2000s (Box 1.2) in response to increased Vietnamese investment in rubber plantations in Cambodia and Laos and, in Cambodia, the allocation of 67 Economic Land Concessions (ELCs) covering 620,300 hectares. About one-third of the 3S has some form of legal protection. But minimal government investment in protected area management coupled with large-scale forest clearing for plantations and other forms of economic concession and improved road access has resulted in some of the world\u2018s highest deforestation rates. As forest landscapes have become fragmented, populations of commercially valuable wildlife have been extirpated by poaching to feed the illegal wildlife trade. Box 1.2: Forest loss and protected areas in the 3S Between 2000 and 2017, the 3S lost 947,000 hectares of forest (14% of forest extent in 2000, one of the highest rates in the world). Of this, 83% was in forests with >50% canopy cover and 66% in forests with >80% canopy cover, indicating that mostly high-quality forest was lost. There has also been significant forest loss within protected areas, which cover 35% of the 3S (Figure 1.5). Between 2000 and 2017, protected areas lost 172,000 hectares of forest cover, equivalent to 7% of total protected area coverage and 18% of total 3S forest loss. Protected areas in the Srepok in Cambodia and Vietnam and the Sekong in Laos suffered the highest forest losses in absolute and relative terms. However, the rate of forest loss inside protected areas is about one-third of the rate of forest loss outside protected areas, indicating that they do provide a degree of protection. Figures 1.4-1.5: Hydropower dams, and protected areas and deforestation in the 3S 6 Artisanal and large-scale mining is important in the Laos and Vietnam portions of the 3S. In Cambodia, mining is still very limited but there are plans for large gold mines, including inside protected areas. Environmental concerns relate to the impacts of mining on water quality, disturbance of aquatic habitats, and the influx of hundreds of foreign workers. Sand and gravel extraction from river beds in the 3S is a growing concern in all three countries because of river bank collapse and increased turbidity. The Central Highlands is home to the world\u2018s third largest bauxite deposits (Figure 1.6). This is a potential game changer because the conversion of bauxite to alumina (the precursor to aluminum) requires large amounts of water and energy. There is only one bauxite mine in the 3S, in Vietnam. But if bauxite mining expands significantly it will require a major increase in hydropower that could have huge impacts on river flow and water quality. Similar environmental impacts could accompany the planned expansion of gold mining in Cambodia. Throughout the 3S, economic development in the form of concessions for hydropower, mines, and agribusiness (e.g., coffee, cassava, rubber, sugar cane) has reduced the quantity and quality of forests, rivers, and other natural resources. The impacts of different schemes often intersect, increasing their severity. For example, the resilience of communities affected by hydropower is often further undermined by the impacts of agribusiness and/or mining concessions on other resources. These cumulative impacts are hardly ever recognized and local people are rarely adequately compensated (Baird and Barney, 2017).

The dam has also affected the livelihoods of people living downstream in both Vietnam and Cambodia. In both countries, communities report that alteration of river flows has made farming and fishing along the river banks extremely dangerous. From 1999 to 2001 flash floods killed at least 39 people and valuable livestock and destroyed vegetable gardens and rice fields. It is estimated that up to 55,000 villagers from 16 ethnic minority groups in Cambodia's Ratanakiri and Stung Treng Provinces and many thousands more in the Central Highlands continue to suffer due to lost rice production, drowned livestock, lost fishing income, and damage to rice reserves, boats, fishing gear and houses because of rapid river level fluctuations resulting from dam operation. These people have received no compensation for the adverse livelihood impacts caused by the dam (IEBR and IRN, 2004). There is no institutionalized transboundary cooperation on the 3S. The mandate of the Mekong River Commission (MRC) only extends to the Mekong mainstream, not its tributaries such as the 3S. This has already resulted in major unplanned and unwanted transboundary impacts (Box 1.3). Conservation International\u2018s Freshwater Health Index study of the 3S gives the following scores: Ecosystem Vitality: 66%; Ecosystem Health: 80%; and Governance & Stakeholders: 43% (FHI, 2018). The low governance score was weighed down by particularly low scores for enforcement and compliance and information access. While there are many causes for concern, there are also grounds for optimism. The 3S has substantial solar and wind potential and dramatic price reductions in renewable energy generation give CLV the chance to achieve energy security at much lower social, environmental and financial cost (Figure 1.7). Hydropower will remain an essential part of any regional power scenario. But by integrating solar and wind, expanding regional power trade, and improving energy efficiency, fewer dams will be needed to meet a given level of energy demand. That would reduce river fragmentation and sediment trapping and therefore threats to fisheries, food security, and the Mekong Delta. Figure 1.7: Solar and wind power potential in CLV and 3S 8 Another positive signal are plans to establish river basin organizations in Vietnam (for the Sesan and Srepok) and in Laos (for the Sekong, which is also undergoing an IFC-financed hydropower cumulative impact assessment). Since 2012, the World Bank\u2018s Mekong Integrated Water Resources Management Project (M-IWRM) has fostered transboundary cooperation between Cambodia and Vietnam on the Srepok and Sesan. While embryonic, these initiatives reflect recognition of the need for coordinated river basin development, including hydropower. Official recognition of the benefits of improved planning is the Sustainable Hydropower Master Plan for Xe Kong (Sekong) Basin in Laos, which the Natural Heritage Institute (NHI) prepared on behalf of the Lao government (NHI, 2017). The purpose is to support implementation of the Policy on Sustainable Hydropower Development that was decreed by the Prime Minister in 2015. It provides standards or criteria for determining the sustainability of proposed hydropower projects. The master plan\u2018s major recommendation is to defer any decision on mainstream dams and pursue instead the options in the order in which they are presented, with the solar augmentation of existing reservoirs as the top priority. (Solar augmentation, which benefits from existing transmission lines, has been deployed in China and South Korea. And in November 2018 the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) announced plans for Thailand\u2018s first large-scale deployment of floating solar.2) If there comes a time when additional power from the Sekong is needed, the uppermost dams should be given a higher priority. The lowermost dams, notably the Sekong Downstream A, should not be developed under any circumstance because of the very large impacts relative to the power generated.3 There is also investment in wind power in the 3S: Impact Energy Asia, a Thai firm, is building a 600 MW wind farm, ASEAN\u2018s largest, in Attapeu Province.4 A nexus study of the 3S is particularly timely because it can help answer important policy questions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c1806a4-5add-487c-94b6-73a610282edc": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c1806a4-5add-487c-94b6-73a610282edc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Measuring, understanding and adapting to nexus trade-offs in the Sekong, Sesan and Srepok transboundary river basins", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "023a40ab20531d8ad23b90785d0927f9d4548f99cc91604c0eb6c87a666fe47c"}, "2": {"node_id": "47d817d5-a52f-4884-830b-ef0fcedcbe94", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "be04ce6ce579fb090836feb56c9d0f4213e7c5e672674493d09157693f5bee4e"}}, "hash": "33951434e4a6ba99c8428fd3f06957e0cbf57e6101fa6471fdc0d3d2d51d23be", "text": "For example: \uf0b7 Now that the Sesan and Srepok are cut off by the LS2 dam, how can the two river systems be developed in ways that optimize remaining water, food, energy, and environmental benefits and allow for greater connectivity if LS2 were modified to allow for fish passage? \uf0b7 Now that the Sekong is the last major tributary of the Mekong with no mainstream dams, how can energy planning ensure that its critical value in regional fisheries and food security be secured? \uf0b7 As climate change impacts and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7fbb0eab-2e19-4d3a-bc1b-b0c348c11c26": {"__data__": {"id_": "7fbb0eab-2e19-4d3a-bc1b-b0c348c11c26", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Measuring, understanding and adapting to nexus trade-offs in the Sekong, Sesan and Srepok transboundary river basins", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "69817f47fa586b0be70d8fd37a11a46f5510dac79e59ac16a492ee2defe930f1"}, "3": {"node_id": "7e6abcc5-8da6-4bd5-af96-51edd89a7c4a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3d4e3b4312b9edeb54631bb1bbb448da96ad320f6905eda232424e8e9e7805fc"}}, "hash": "4fb92ba81d84c6ad6f28efccf244ce239bdbb6d15080a162a6e218d23b943c0b", "text": "adaptation costs increase, what combination of hard and soft engineering offers the best value for money? The drought that struck the Central Highlands in 2016, the worst in 30 years, illustrates the need for a nexus approach. Hundreds of reservoirs ran out of water and over 165,000 hectares of coffee plantation were affected, of which 40,000 hectares were lost. Tens of thousands of households lost access to piped water. The total economic damage was almost $100 million. Was this the result of unbridled natural resource depletion that increased vulnerability to climate shocks? Or could it have simply been a consequence of lower than normal rainfall? One could argue that it demonstrates the need for more water storage, not less.

It aims to advance sustainable economic development through regional dialogue and capacity-building. It promotes cross-cutting strategies to achieve water, energy, food and environmental security. At the 8th LMI Ministerial Meeting in August 2015, the U.S. Secretary of State and the Foreign Ministers of Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam released a joint statement entitled \u2015Building a Sustainable Future for the Mekong\u2016.6 This statement commits signatories to seek avenues for collaboration in the capacity-building needed to drive sustainability in the Mekong region. The LMI Nexus Futures Program (NFP) is a subset of the LMI. It was created by merging LMI\u2018s water, energy, food, and environment pillars. Its goals are: \uf0b7 the advancement of sustainable economic development; \uf0b7 strengthened regional integration; and \uf0b7 resilience to the impacts of climate change in the Lower Mekong countries. These goals are to be achieved by strengthening regional discussions that advance integrated planning based on the inter-connections between water, energy, food and environment. The Siem Reap Declaration from the 3rd MRC Summit in April 2018 recognizes the need for a nexus approach.7 To map alternative approaches, the NFP will develop a science-based nexus assessment of the 3S to identify ways to maximize sustainable development outcomes. The term \u2015nexus assessment\u2016 refers to an assessment of the current and future trends of water, energy, food, and environmental conditions arranged to support integrated planning and development decision-making at the regional level as well as recommendations to overcome data, technology, capacity, institutional and/or financial barriers. The 3S nexus assessment has three objectives: 1.

FUTURE EXPECTATIONS The project\u2018s TOR require \u2015an assessment of the current and future trends of water, energy, food and environmental conditions.\u2016 CLV have objectives and plans for each sector, but not all are compatible, with some posing threats to others. By looking at competing sectors through a nexus lens it is possible to identify conflicts that could be resolved using various combinations of synergies, trade- offs or compromise. This section explores relevant policy and planning frameworks in CLV and the 3S to identify how the expectations of one sector that might be incompatible with those of another. Not all potential conflicts represent nexus opportunities. This section identifies those that do and explains why. Possible nexus approaches to these conflicts are suggested in Section 3. 2.1 Policy and planning framework Annex 3 presents details of the policy and planning frameworks as they pertain to water (W), energy (EN), food (F) and environment (EV).

Also, hydropower operating rules may limit the allocation of water to uses with lower opportunity costs.

In addition, river dikes severely curtail floodplain functions including fish reproductive cycles while reducing genetic diversity. Table 2.3: Red flags 15 3. NEXUS ASSESSMENT IN THE 3S Before understanding how a nexus approach can help solve water-related problems, stakeholders first need to understand the difference between a watershed and a \u2015problem-shed\u2016. For example, unsustainable land and water use may result from limited non-agricultural livelihood opportunities. Fix that, and the problems of unsustainable land and water use could disappear. The lack of off-farm livelihoods is a problem-shed issue whereas its result is a watershed issue. However, the lack of off-farm livelihoods may arise from inadequate or unreliable energy or raw material supplies, and this could be a watershed issue because of energy (hydropower) or agricultural inputs (agribusiness). Hence the value of a nexus approach that reveals non-traditional, alternative pathways through the interconnected maze of problems situated in both the watershed and the problemshed. For example, a large-scale agribusiness investment could stabilize watersheds, thereby restoring and sustaining stream flows for downstream users while establishing value chains that offer improved livelihoods and economic growth. Achieving the benefits of integrated planning is constrained by institutional and policy silos and vested interests. The nexus approach breaks down these sector walls by providing policy makers with options for: \uf0b7 Synergies, whereby one intervention achieves multiple objectives. \uf0b7 Trade-offs, whereby a sector objective is rendered sub-optimal in favor of another that is optimized. \uf0b7 Compromise, whereby a result that is less than perfect for one or more stakeholder is accepted by all for the sake of the common good. Trade-offs and compromise always have \u2015winners\u2016 and \u2015losers\u2016 and may therefore fall under the remit of national rather than sectoral policy. This is a key issue for a study such as this, which is intended to increase understanding. Mapping threats (Table 2.3) against the consolidated objectives (Table 2.2) identifies potential nexus solutions. This mapping leads to seven potential investment options (Table 3.2) that either singly or in combination can avoid or reduce threats (Table 3.1). THREATS 1.

Dams can be operated for multiple ends including water supply, hydropower, culture fisheries, capture fisheries, partial re- establishment of natural hydrographs, groundwater recharge, maintenance of navigation depths, and flood management. In the 3S, most dams have been designed and are operated for a single purpose: hydropower. New operating rules for existing dams, and the design of new dams should be predicated on multi-purpose use. Three examples illustrate how single-purpose dams can cause multi-sector problems. Two are from Vietnam and one from Zambia. All three are hydropower dams, which is important because all dams planned for the 3S are intended for hydropower and power generation operating rules almost always dominate other uses. 20 \uf0b7 Example 1, operating rules for hydropower dams in central Vietnam have led to: - greatly reduced environmental stream flows and changes in flow patterns; - inadequate flows stranding irrigation diversion infrastructure; - saline intrusion, which is compromising coastal irrigation schemes; and - excess salinity in coastal fish farms. While multi-use operation can maximize a dam\u2018s cross-sectoral value, it implies costs in terms of forgone power generation. A study by Meynell et al. (2014) of a cascade of seven hydropower dams on the upper Sesan in Vietnam shows that maintaining a near natural flow regime would reduce potential electricity production by 13%. The government issued rules for seven large dams on the Srepok in 2014 and for seven large dams on the Sesan in 2018 to ensure minimum environmental flows.10 However, dam operators have resisted implementation of these rules. \uf0b7 Example 2, cascades of hydropower dams in southern Vietnam increase the risk of severe coastal flooding. This is because of the risk that one dam is forced to open its flood gates thereby releasing excess water into the inundated area upstream of the next dam, which may itself be full, causing cities such as HCMC to suffer costly and potentially avoidable floods. These problems arise because the operators of hydropower dams prefer to keep them as close to full supply level as possible and do not coordinate operations between upstream and downstream dams. This was a major factor behind the 2011 flooding in Thailand. However, new technology means that this is no longer necessary as the third example illustrates. \uf0b7 Example 3: the Kafue Flats lie between Zambia\u2018s Itezi-Itezhi and Kafue Gorge dams and until the dams were built comprised a functioning, seasonal wetland covering 800 km2 of immense socio-economic and environmental significance.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a29fa659-edd9-4dac-9945-6d9ea368f83c": {"__data__": {"id_": "a29fa659-edd9-4dac-9945-6d9ea368f83c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Measuring, understanding and adapting to nexus trade-offs in the Sekong, Sesan and Srepok transboundary river basins", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "30ead3445a369547254b454a1e14430dbf5fb1b86d59991cece5d18c968c57b7"}, "2": {"node_id": "1a6bdab9-2406-403b-a8f7-57eeef1ea3d3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fb3e26ce213a9680c8fdb3c8b24e12b95d6a0084e0376e78005ded901e1d0482"}}, "hash": "1d3cec99d9ce49cc59412053794d9c5eab3165342a3400e85f78d9e10a4a9a6c", "text": "Yet prioritization of hydropower operating rules at Itezhi-Itezhi, the upstream dam, has effectively terminated the annual floods and hence the recession agriculture, livestock herds, wildlife and tourist enterprises that depend on them.

Box 1.4: Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam as a nexus investment The 6,300 MW Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) on the Blue Nile on the Ethiopia/Sudan border, which started construction in 2011 and is currently 60% built, is considered an example of basin-level, nexus investment with potential benefits for the three eastern Nile countries: Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan. For Ethiopia, which is financing the dam, GERD will generate power for itself and for export and provide bulk water for irrigation. For Sudan, the dam will prevent floods and canal sedimentation, while increasing navigation depths in the Blue Nile and avoiding the need to raise Sudan\u2018s own dams for power generation, which would be very costly because of the country\u2018s flat terrain. For Egypt, the evaporation loss from the high-altitude GERD would be much less than from Lake Nasser on the Egypt/Sudan border (Riddell and Thuo, 2014). These have been estimated to be as high as 15 km3/year, equal to 17% of the Nile\u2018s discharge when it enters the Mediterranean. Egypt is rapidly approaching severe water insecurity and a storage alternative such as GERD is a possible pathway toward a more water secure future. 3.1.2 Wetlands: 7 threats Wetlands, both constructed and natural, can address seven of the identified threats while having additional environmental benefits such as: 10In Vietnam, Prime Minister Decisions 1201/Q\u0110-TTg in July 2014 and 215/Q\u0110-TTg in February 2018 on protocols for inter-reservoir operations in the Srepok and Sesan river basins. 21 \uf0b7 reduced saline intrusion into coastal aquifers; \uf0b7 easier management of certain lowland soil types such as acid-sodic soils; \uf0b7 sustainable habitats; \uf0b7 local climate amelioration; and \uf0b7 range of alternative livelihood opportunities. We have seen how restoration of wetland functions in Zambia\u2018s Kafue Flats could be achieved simply by changing the operating rules of the upstream dam to the benefit of the food and environmental nexus. Nearby, to the north of the flats, are 10,000 hectares of irrigated sugar cane. Most of this is managed by international agribusinesses. However, in some places they are supplied by small cooperatives who give up their water use permits to the central estates in return for free, pumped irrigation services. A condition of this deal, however, is that each cooperative install and maintain small built wetlands between their plots and the watercourses to reduce agricultural run-off pollution. The Kafue Flats and sugar cooperatives show how wetlands have the potential for both purifying and increasing the supply of water, another nexus component. But wetlands also provide flood management benefits. This is because they act as natural sponges, soaking up and retaining water while it infiltrates into the ground. The attenuating effects of wetlands means that water that does not infiltrate into the ground is slowly released into streams, thereby reducing flood risk. Wetlands vegetation also reduces the speed of water as it flows over the landscape. Wetlands therefore provide immense water storage benefits while mitigating floods and reducing erosion. 3.1.3 Other natural infrastructure: 5 threats Table 3.3 shows five types of natural infrastructure of which four are specified and obvious. A fifth concerns two kinds of landscape-level intervention that may be less obvious. One type is best suited to public financing, the other for private sector investment. Both are man-made and both have multiple benefits. The first kind comprises land terracing that: \uf0b7 increases the intake opportunity time of run-off and hence replenishes groundwater and/or decreases flood risk; \uf0b7 prevents soil erosion; \uf0b7 could maintain root zone moisture content increasing crop yields; and \uf0b7 in combination with \u2015trash-lining\u2016 can reduce the need for chemical fertilizers. The second kind comprises large scale production of crops with soil binding characteristics and diverse value chains. Not only would carefully selected crops prevent soil erosion and hence downstream sedimentation they could also contribute to economic growth and socio-economic transformation in the form of expanded and diversified livelihoods. In some cases, there could be energy sector or climate change mitigation benefits.

As was shown in Figure 3.3, they represent potential solutions to three of the threats identified in this document. And although they are a small-scale option, if replicated they have great potential to increase local supplies of water by: \uf0b7 reducing the risks of water insecurity caused by other, larger scale investments; and \uf0b7 reducing the need for large, bulk water infrastructure. 22 3.1.5 Use of floodplains/restored floodplains: 3 threats Functionally, floodplains are similar to wetlands, except that they are not characterized by bodies of standing water and usually do not have the same soils. Floodplains are nature\u2018s way of dealing with floods and are among nature\u2018s most highly productive ecosystems, providing vital spawning and nursery habitat for a variety of aquatic species. Several benefits occur when floods can flow freely across them. The genetic diversity of aquatic species is maintained, which is important for capture fisheries; fertility levels are maintained in soils; groundwater is recharged; polluted water is purified; and the potentially devastating power of more concentrated floods is reduced. None of these benefits would occur if the floods were contained by flood dikes (Box 3.1). Flood dikes, urbanization, and dam construction are major threats to floodplains. There is an increasing body of evidence that conserving or restoring floodplain functions offers a \u2015no regret\u2016 pathway to a wide range of benefits (EEA, 2017), even to the extent that in some highly developed river basins the removal of large dams and restored floodplain functions have resulted in higher economic productivity of water. Studies carried out by IWMI in the late 1990s and by International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) in the early 2000s show that when economic efficiency of water use at the basin level increases, so too does access to water by the poor and environmental flows. While existing dams do not need to be removed (although that is happening in some countries), if new dams can be avoided through other solutions, then floodplain functions are less likely to be compromised. 3.1.6 Use of paddy fields: 2 threats Paddy fields can be very effective at reducing flooding. According to Sujono (2010), more than 40% of rainfall could be stored in paddy fields without compromising yields. This approach is already common in Thailand, where it is known as \u2015monkey cheeks\u2016 and is being considered in northern Malaysia. As a rule of thumb, wetland rice can tolerate three days of inundation with little effect on yield. Anything beyond that would be covered by compensation paid by the government to the affected farmers on the assumption that this would be cheaper than large flood control dams that may only be needed on average every four years. 3.1.7 Groundwater recharge infrastructure: 2 threats Seepage troughs are a form of groundwater recharge infrastructure based on the interruption of natural run-off. This section is more about large-scale built infrastructure intended to divert river flows into local aquifers either directly or via a network of canals spread out across the landscape. This is potentially of high value in the Central Highlands. Such infrastructure should be selected with care. This is because an aquifer\u2018s transmissivity and quality can be seriously and permanently compromised if the water used has the wrong kind of sediment or is polluted in some way. 3.2 Non-nexus solutions 3.2.1 New crops/farming systems Where water for irrigation is scarce relative to demand, as in the Central Highlands, demand itself could be reduced by shifting away from water intensive farming systems towards less water intensive alternatives. Ideally such a shift should be toward crops that improve farmers\u2018 livelihoods and increase opportunities for added value. That way, either the size and hence cost of bulk water infrastructure could be reduced or multi-purpose use could be increased. However, risk averse farmers may need government support, perhaps in the form of time-bound, smart and stepped production subsidies until their risk perceptions have been obviated. 3.2.2 Capacity building A nexus approach is institutionally challenging. Capacity building is needed to increase understanding of the advantages of a nexus approach to river basin planning and the utility of the resulting measures and interventions. Capacity building is needed both for the beneficiaries of a nexus solution and across the institutions involved. 23 3.2.3 Effective enforcement Inadequate and/or weakly enforced regulations undermine efforts to improve water resources management.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4c8c782a-c57c-4ac8-84e7-2b7475bd1116": {"__data__": {"id_": "4c8c782a-c57c-4ac8-84e7-2b7475bd1116", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Measuring, understanding and adapting to nexus trade-offs in the Sekong, Sesan and Srepok transboundary river basins", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5b5646df0ed0792d69a61ae1dc5e871304250ff209a5769d4b4384d1ad3a580b"}, "2": {"node_id": "f64e2849-f4d9-4b7e-a679-6edd17c55374", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6c061828528c9e803722deff1ed4210fbbc0851cdbb76b46f84e495496455735"}}, "hash": "02374dd1523654236379301d256567d2322de817e7abd0caa60aff09e5285c50", "text": "Continued illegal forest clearing or water pollution threaten the availability and productivity of water to downstream users.

TOWARD IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING Most stakeholders will be familiar with the IWRM approach and may wonder what the nexus has to offer. There are several differences that position the nexus as a more powerful tool. The most obvious is that as conventionally applied IWRM is only concerned with the allocation of water between competing uses. This usually means that important planning decisions are made by powerful but potentially competing water sector silos such as hydropower and irrigation. A nexus approach, on the other hand, looks beyond the watershed into the problem-shed. This stimulates the search for new pathways toward more productive futures for stakeholders with little or no voice in decision making (e.g., small-scale fisheries). New pathways could include policies encouraging off-farm livelihoods that reduce competition for irrigation water and/or the need for increased storage. Similarly, investments in industrial crops could increase off-farm livelihoods along value chains while reducing soil erosion and restoring hydrographs in degraded catchments. Because of the combination of shared costs and multiple benefit streams represented by a nexus approach, investments are likely to have higher economic rates of return per sector and benefits that are more widely distributed across sectors and landscapes while making a greater contribution to broader economic growth. This section provides a set of initial messages that would allow the optimal delivery of energy, food, water and environment in the 3S via trade-offs, compromise and synergies, and reflecting a landscape perspective. That said, it is recognized that: \uf0b7 a nexus approach cannot solve all the 3S management challenges; and \uf0b7 there are non-nexus solutions that might work equally well in some cases, especially when they address serious social and environmental problems. Nonetheless, by adopting a nexus approach: \uf0b7 many problems can be readily addressed through investments across sectors; and \uf0b7 governments can meet their development objectives in a more economically efficient fashion because of the multiple benefits that can accrue to multi-purpose investments. Based on this, the following nine messages are offered, six related to opportunities and three to risks. 4.1 Opportunity messages 1. Strategic planning is required for a nexus approach to realize its full potential. Expensive infrastructure should only be built if the need is justified. System-scale energy planning allows least-cost options to be determined objectively. A 2016 study by University of California- Berkeley\u2018s Energy & Resources Group (ERG) showed that Laos could save $2.6 billion by 2030 (net present value) by integrating solar, wind, and biomass into its energy mix and reducing reliance on large hydropower for a total additional capacity of 25,000 MW, compared to the government\u2018s planned build out (Avila et al., 2017). The savings would be greater if the study had factored in hydropower\u2018s environmental and social costs. Much-improved knowledge of fluvial geomorphology and modeling capacity allows the selection of dams that minimize downstream impacts for a given power output. Sediment modelling in the 3S shows that if dams were optimally located, designed, and operated, 75% of total energy potential could be harnessed with only a 20% reduction in downstream sediment delivery (Schmitt, 2016). Such an approach could also help ensure that the Sekong, the Mekong\u2018s last large free-flowing tributary, remains accessible to long-range fish migrations that form basis of the extraordinary fish productivity of the Lower Mekong. These benefits would be enhanced if a dam were designed or operated for multi-purpose use. The question is therefore not dams versus no dams, but which dams, where, and how should they be operated. In Vietnam, the prospects for coordinated planning will improve with the entry into force of the Planning Law in January 2019. This law will reduce by 90% the 19,500 statutory plans that the government has been required to produce every 5-year planning cycle. It is intended to reduce unnecessary environmental damage caused by single-sector, overlapping, and often 25 conflicting plans and to increase accountability. It took five years to negotiate because of resistance from ministries that benefit from the status quo. The Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) is drafting the implementation decree and would like to incorporate nexus thinking into the guidelines. 2.

Steps toward more power trade are underway. The World Bank has facilitated bilateral negotiations to increase Lao hydro exports to Vietnam with targets of 5,000 MW by 2020, 10,000 MW by 2025, and 15,000 MW by 2030, and a $100 million World Bank loan is connecting 15 dams in southern Laos to Vietnam. Negotiations have also started on exporting 1,000 MW from five Chinese built dams on the Nam Ou in northern Laos to north-west Vietnam. What is missing so far is Vietnamese leadership that links significantly increased power purchases to the selection of dams that minimize downstream impacts. Vietnam could make a similar offer to Cambodia. Vietnam has completed its hydropower build- out on the Srepok and Sesan, but dams with a total generating capacity of over 4,000 MW are planned on the Cambodia side. In exchange for investing in these dams, Cambodia would agree not to proceed with Mekong mainstream dams, notably Sambor (2,600 MW) and Stung Treng (900 MW). Vietnam could exploit its advanced manufacturing capacity to invest in solar energy in Cambodia where land is much cheaper and energy-hungry HCMC and surrounding industrial zones are within 100-200 km. A 49 MW solar plant under construction in Gia Lai Province, Vietnam is paying $25,000/hectare in compensation. By contrast, a 10,000-hectare economic land concession in Cambodia with no prior land claims and that can be leased for $5/hectare/year could conservatively generate 500 MW (more than LS2).11 The need to import large quantities of power would increase greatly if bauxite mining and processing expanded in Vietnam. The company operating the LS2 dam is carrying out a feasibility study of a 20 MW floating solar project on the 26,000-hectare reservoir. See Figure 4.1. 111 hectare can generate 1 MW; at this latitude, average MW corresponds to about 15% of peak, so 10,000 hectares x 1 MW x 15% = 1,500 MW average output; if we assume that only one-third of the ELC is covered, that results in 500 MW. 11VPA is a legally binding trade agreement between the EU and Vietnamese government under which Vietnam develops Timber Legality Assurance Systems to verify that its timber exports are legal, and EU agrees to accept only licensed imports from Vietnam. 26 Figure 4.1: LS2 reservoir (blue) (Source: Google Earth) Such win-win transboundary outcomes could be enhanced if timber, marine fisheries, and wildlife were included in a regional agreement since these are sectors where Laos and Cambodia need Vietnamese cooperation in order to enforce their own laws. The signing of the Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) on Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) between Vietnam and the EU in October 2018 should signal greater Vietnamese participation in combatting illegal transboundary timber flows (EIA, 2017). By expanding the transboundary natural resource management challenge, therefore, new opportunities for reciprocity and mutual benefit emerge.12 3. Nexus solutions can save significant sums of money. For example, investment in a hydro- meteorological network upstream of a cascade of hydropower dams could obviate the need for expensive flood defense works downstream. This is particularly relevant for the Sesan and Srepok where the marginal environmental impacts of upstream dams are lower now that the LS2 is built. M-IWRM is financing the installation of 13 monitoring stations on the Srepok and Sesan. The dramatic cost reduction in non-hydro renewables opens the door to the conjunctive use of intermittent solar/wind and hydropower, which would allow countries to meet their energy generation goals at less cost and quicker. The MRC\u2018s draft SHDS reached the same conclusion. In June 2018, U.S. company Convalt Energy announced plans to install 100 MW of floating solar on reservoirs of two Vietnamese built hydropower dams on the Xekaman, a tributary of the Sekong.13 If biofuels could be produced at landscape scales, subject to satisfactory social and environmental safeguards, there could be additional watershed benefits in terms of water quantity and quality.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7ecea4a4-4aab-4069-9ae4-dd4c54837950": {"__data__": {"id_": "7ecea4a4-4aab-4069-9ae4-dd4c54837950", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Measuring, understanding and adapting to nexus trade-offs in the Sekong, Sesan and Srepok transboundary river basins", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a3c038e5188434a4c54afc5e48fdce816bae2e23fc9024e0d8091b235a412c27"}, "2": {"node_id": "56e13e1a-2028-45ea-ad9f-0c6a506cef7f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "206e56ee18cfe469a117709822157f6ed31940ac0a087a4eec812162c2cc6c15"}}, "hash": "2d7dcc64243c5bece5d807af948391b0867da8e257ea660f1b39385520ff8aae", "text": "Meanwhile, recent dam collapses in Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar have highlighted the costs of large hydro, particularly considering the possibility of increasingly extreme rainfall events.

This is particularly relevant in the Sesan and Srepok where plans to build river dikes would displace flood risk downstream, as has happened in the Mekong Delta where high dikes upstream have caused urban flooding downstream. 5. Natural infrastructure can distribute its benefits more widely and locally than large-scale built infrastructure intended to solve the same problems. For example, strengthening capture fisheries management will provide livelihoods for a larger number of poor people than reservoir fisheries or aquaculture, which require more expensive gear and other inputs. 6. Nexus and non-nexus solutions complement each other. A non-nexus solution can decrease the costs and increase the benefits of a corresponding nexus solution. For example, reduced use of irrigation across 500,000 hectares of coffee in the Central Highlands will not only reduce dry season water stress and increase coffee quality, it will also conserve groundwater. The total volume of water that could be saved comes to about 1 billion m3, equal to three times the combined average dry season flow of the Srepok (61 m3/s) and Sesan (43 m3/s) on the Vietnam-Cambodia border. In order to secure coffee supplies, Nestl\u00e9 is training tens of thousands of coffee farmers in the Central Highlands on more efficient water use in an attempt to move coffee to a more sustainable footing (Vietnam is the world\u2018s second largest coffee exporter and global coffee consumption is growing 5% per year). Table 4.1 shows how non-nexus solutions could complement five of the seven nexus solutions.

Measuring inter-sectoral trade-offs assumes adequate understanding of key biophysical processes. Accurate information on projected power output from a dam or paddy production, for example, is typically available and uncontested. But other information may be unreliable and controversial. For example, published studies estimate that capture fisheries in the 3S 28 total about 10,000 tons/year (Table 1.1). But an estimate that links fish production to land cover type comes to at least 89,000 tons/year, almost 10 times more.15 Governments have argued that reservoir fisheries can compensate for lost river fisheries. But there is abundant evidence that actual reservoir production stabilizes at about one-third of initial production (which benefits from high nutrient levels in the freshly inundated zone). If these alternative estimates are correct, then assessments of the net loss of capture fisheries from dams in the 3S could be underestimated by a factor of 30. Because of uncertainties regarding capture fisheries, \u2015hard\u2016 data on energy and rice production are often seen as more convincing. As a result, when deliberating the cost-benefit of a dam, the burden of proof tends to lie with the fisheries specialists rather than the dam proponents. 2. Because the nexus tends to focus on capital asset creation, there is a risk that non-structural options will be ignored or deemed unacceptable to builders of political monuments. Regionally, there is a well-recognized focus on technical and infrastructure solutions (even if this includes natural infrastructure) whereas some of the critical challenges arise from governance and institutions (which are particularly complex in transboundary basins). 3.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d252a9c8-63fd-47e0-9680-e83492a6d9c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "d252a9c8-63fd-47e0-9680-e83492a6d9c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Measuring, understanding and adapting to nexus trade-offs in the Sekong, Sesan and Srepok transboundary river basins", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "15a5b56b36cae0d87b32d688569ecab62705cdb1e83a1643395509e95c03bc7a"}, "2": {"node_id": "c62d87f1-ea6d-4945-a1a2-9c5425d0b62e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c92f51fb391f88bdc8d7b80cbb87ae030aae5e8e1b880416ab51b03eda3f7cae"}}, "hash": "612525cd99d2870927d759a05f77256f520f792b7efe557f962779d64c0f99a5", "text": "3.

ADVANCING THE NEXUS AGENDA 5.1 Challenges Feedback from the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) identified several challenges in nexus implementation. These concern low levels of technical capacity within governments to imagine, let alone negotiate nexus solutions; legal frameworks that are inconsistent or run counter to nexus principles of cooperative river basin planning; inertia within the policy and planning systems; and opposition from ministries, particularly those responsible for energy and irrigation, that fear losing power. The nexus approach has been picked up faster in Africa than in Asia. One reason is that there appears to be more scope for institutional innovation in Africa. For example, because irrigation is typically the largest water using sector and where ministerial self-interest dominates, in several countries responsibility over irrigation is being transferred from the relevant line ministry to non-line ministries or even the president\u2018s office. Another reason why the nexus has made more headway in Africa is the presence of regional organizations such as the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) in Southern Africa and the Organisation pour la mise en valeur du fleuve S\u00e9n\u00e9gal (OMVS) in West Africa, which actively promote a nexus approach to planning and investment that optimizes regional projects for national and local benefits. No such organization exists in the Mekong region; neither the MRC nor ASEAN currently has the mandate or the technical capacity to lead nexus negotiations. 5.2 Road map In order to promote the findings and recommendations of the nexus assessment, the TAG (Annex 1) recommended three ways to integrate a nexus approach into development planning. Cambodia recommended assessing water use in Opok, a 150-hectare Khmer Rouge-era irrigation project in a sub-basin of the Sesan in Stung Treng Province where this is conflict between water for paddy, fisheries, and household use. Laos recommended a nexus assessment for the Sekong. Vietnam recommended reviewing the draft implementation decree for the new Planning Law to determine nexus compliance. Given the novelty of the nexus, there is a pressing need to provide training for government staff on the technical approach, opportunities, and risks. Given the political sensitivities, it is questionable if the traditional approach of a series of national workshops with government agencies to discuss nexus opportunities would work. An alternative, or complementary approach would be to introduce nexus thinking by working with think tanks that are increasingly part of the policy research and advocacy landscape in CLV. Several of these are politically well connected (and may even have links to political parties) and can serve as conduits to get new and potentially controversial ideas aired informally within government before proceeding to more formal discussions. 5.3 Four possible futures Policy makers can benefit from a \u2015horizon view\u2016 that examines a range of scenarios and provide a powerful way to raise awareness of the likely outcomes of different courses of action. Key to this type of scenario analysis is the selection of two key sector determinants, as these form the two axes of the scenarios. One axis concerns the extent to which investment decision making is acknowledged as a transboundary responsibility. The other axis concerns the extent to which investment planning is undertaken on a nexus or non-siloed basis. Figure 5.1 shows four scenarios based on these two axes. 31 Figure 5.1: Four possible futures in the 3S 5.3.1 Scenario 1: Increasing tension Development planning takes place in silos and is limited to national issues and priorities. Government budgets become stretched, leading to investments that are likely to be based on political interests rather than social, economic or environmental benefits. Some investments become a drain on the economy (\u2015white elephants\u2016) rather than contribute to economic growth. Transboundary disputes grow, and tensions rise. Flood management investments in upstream increase flood risk downstream. Ecosystem loss continues and basin productivity declines, leading to increased social unrest and poverty. 5.3.2 Scenario 2: Lost opportunities This scenario is probably the closest to reality in the 3S.

Higher economic returns would accrue to investments in the water, food, energy, environment sectors shared across both sectoral and national boundaries while the wider distribution of benefits would reduce competition over natural resources. This maximizes improvements in basin welfare while the risk of unforeseen circumstances would decline. The net result is increased regional prosperity and security. 32 REFERENCES Asian Development Bank (ADB) (2012). Greater Mekong Subregion. Atlas of the Environment. 2nd edition.

The TAG has met four times: in Hanoi in March 2017, in Vientiane in May 2017, and in Phnom Penh in July 2017 and November 2018, when the draft version of this report was discussed. In April 2017, the writing team met NHI in Vientiane to discuss its study of alternatives to mainstream dams on the Sekong. The nexus assessment benefited from cooperation with the Stimson Center, a DC-based security think tank. In mid-2017, the Stimson Center\u2018s Southeast Asia Program,16 University of California at Berkeley\u2018s Energy & Resources Group (ERG),17 and IUCN formed Mekong Basin Connect (MBC), an initiative to advocate nexus solutions across the Lower Mekong.18 MBC has focused on how the dramatic reduction in the prices of solar and wind, increased regional power trade, and lower than forecast energy consumption in Thailand was likely to reduce the future need for large-scale hydropower in Laos.

At the WLE Forum, the fisheries data that were used to assess impacts of the 3S were criticized by Dr. Ian Cowx, a Mekong fisheries specialist. He provided what he considered much more accurate data based on an analysis of land cover in the 3S (Section 4.4). He also questioned what he considered to be over-estimates of long-term reservoir fisheries productivity. Between March and September 2017, ICEM and IWMI produced reports on different 3S sectors: agriculture, hydropower, forestry, mining, human health, etc. In September 2017, following an assessment of the extent to which the initial findings and recommendations met the TOR requirements, Philip Riddell, a nexus consultant, was hired to draft this report. 42 ANNEX 2: 3S SECTOR SUMMARIES 1. AGRICULTURE Current situation In CLV, Agriculture is shifting from traditional smallholder subsistence farming to modern commercial farming. Countries are progressing at different rates, but all three governments promote agricultural intensification, with increased agrochemical use, irrigation and mechanization. In Vietnam, liberalization of land and trade laws in the 1990s have led to farmers choosing what to grow, increasing focus on commercial crops and unsustainable farming practices (D\u2018haeze et al., 2005). Attempts to \u2015regularize\u2016 upland farming and eradicate shifting cultivation has been a long- term policy objective in Laos. In the 3S, traditional systems of rainfed paddy farming, riverbank farming and, in the uplands, shifting cultivation, are juxtaposed with commercial plantations of rubber, cassava, sugarcane and robusta coffee (Takamatsu et al., 2014; USAID, 2016). Rice remains the dominant crop but in recent years, deforestation, expansion of agricultural and urban areas, and expansion of commercial plantations have been the major land use changes in the basins (Takamatsu et al., 2014). Between 1993 and 1997 cultivated area increased by 741 km2 with corresponding declines in forest (303 km2) and grass/shrubs (470 km2) (Takamatsu et al., 2014). The 2003 land use map (the most recent year for which complete and consistent data are available) indicates that agriculture covers on average 7.5% of the 3S with by far the greatest coverage in the Srepok (Table 1.1). The largest cultivated area is in Vietnam, where rapid immigration and population growth have driven effectively uncontrolled agricultural expansion and forest loss (Tran et al., 2012; Takamatsu et al., 2014). Over the past decade, the areas of irrigated rice, maize, cassava, and sugarcane have expanded rapidly in the Central Highlands. For example, in Gia Lai Province the area planted with cassava and maize grew by 13% and 10% per annum, respectively, between 2003 and 2013 (USAID, 2016). The area of coffee in Dak Lak Province has reached 2,600 km2, which is half of Vietnam\u2018s total coffee area (Amarasinghe, 2015). These trends are the result of growing market demand and higher prices for commercial crops. Nestle, for example, sources 30% of all its coffee globally from Vietnam. In the Cambodian portion of the 3S, commercial agricultural area expanded almost 4-fold from 10 km2 in 1995 to 36 km2 in 2007, predominantly in the middle Sesan and Srepok and to a lesser extent in the Sekong (Someth et al., 2013). Total cassava production increased from 40,000 tons in 2008 to close to 170,000 tons in 2010 (Royal Government of Cambodia, 2010). In southern Laos, between 1998 and 2011, there was a substantial increase in the proportion of households engaged in commercial agriculture, from 20% to 40% in Champasak; from 5% to 17% in Sekong, and from 3% to 10% in Attapeu Provinces (Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry 2014).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1d0471ab-7a2a-4c1f-b7f9-840e80f5c86c": {"__data__": {"id_": "1d0471ab-7a2a-4c1f-b7f9-840e80f5c86c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Measuring, understanding and adapting to nexus trade-offs in the Sekong, Sesan and Srepok transboundary river basins", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e5b0d169e6b7c8d875e65fd3a9518d5bb8c6e6f8744a589ec50bd8c4dcf1f565"}, "2": {"node_id": "c9c888f1-6a05-4690-a7ad-e36bbe44ad97", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "03bcc5fc3dc93460ac3eca5b633fc490d9fc7b3d9c14ed528b7e8453dbc484d8"}}, "hash": "f87a0f02b4b5c377a4c06a54b2ec2111f5cdaac4085157dc3ebc90d3fb6687f6", "text": "In Champasak Province, the area of dry season rice cultivation fell from 73.3 km2 to 27 km2 between 2004 and 2005, which has been explained as a move from rice to market crops such as soybeans, corn, long beans, and watermelons (Baird and Shoemaker, 2008).

Currently, the total area of dry season irrigation in the 3S is 610 km2 (i.e., 11% of the total cultivated area) (Table 1.2). Vietnam has by far the largest area under irrigation (70% in the Srepok), with an unknown but significant proportion being supplied from groundwater. In Cambodia, out of 82 schemes with a potential for 28 km2 of dry season irrigation, only eight are operational and there is only 5 km2 of dry season irrigation. All the schemes use water from small reservoirs filled during the wet season. In Laos, formal irrigation is supplied by pumps lifting water from the Sekong and its tributaries. In addition to dry season irrigation there are 360 traditional weirs that divert wet season river flows, but dry season water storage is negligible (ADB, 2010). As part of their national agricultural development strategies, all three countries plan to increase irrigated area in the 3S, to a total of 2,104 km2 by 2025 (Table 1.2). In recent years, increasingly large and unpredictable reductions in dry season river flow have been reported in the Vietnamese portions of the Sesan and Srepok, leading to competition between agricultural and urban sectors. This is widely attributed to hydropower dam operation, in conjunction with increased water abstractions, in large part for irrigation (ADB, 2010). In addition, while average groundwater levels are stable, dry season groundwater levels are falling, largely due to irrigation of coffee and other cash crops (Cheesman et al., 2007). Total future irrigation requirements in the Vietnamese portion of the Sesan are estimated to be 13% of the average annual dry season flow (674 million m3) and just 4% of the total groundwater reserve (2,071 million m3). Similarly, future irrigation requirements in the Vietnamese portion of the Srepok are estimated to be 21% of the average annual dry season flow (957 million m3) and 10% of the total groundwater reserve (2,071 million m3). Thus, at the sub-basin level, there is a significant water surplus in both the Sesan and the Srepok. If critical low flow problems and groundwater declines are already being reported, this implies that farmers are over applying irrigation water and better coordination and management is needed to resolve water supply issues. Research has shown that better irrigation scheduling, in conjunction with improved management of other inputs (e.g., fertilizers) can lead to considerable reductions (>60%) in irrigation application without comprising, and in fact potentially increasing, crop yields (Amarasinghe et al., 2015).

In the Central Highlands, fertilizer use increased in the 1990s because of government programs (Mueller and Zeller, 2002). Similarly, there was a large increase in fertilizer use in Cambodia in the early 1990s when the market was opened to the private sector (McKenney and Tola, 2002). In southern Laos, the proportion of farmers using chemical fertilizers increased from 40% in 1998-99 to 56% in 2010-11 (Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, 2014). There are no data specifically for the 3S but national level statistics, indicate that Vietnam has a much higher use of agrochemicals (293 kg/ha) than either Laos (9 kg/ha) or Cambodia (12 kg/ha) (Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, 2014).

HAGL works partly through subsidiaries and is estimated to have 266 km2 under rubber in southern Laos, while VRG owns more than 380 km2 of rubber across Laos, much of it in the south (Hirsch and Scurrah, 2015). Most of these concessions have come from land earmarked as fallow but which in fact have been forested or have been part of fallow cycles important to farmers for grazing livestock (Kenney-Lazar 2012). In some cases, concessions in Laos have overlapped with protected areas. For example, some 4.39 km2 of rubber plantation concessions in Champasak Province overlap with the Donghuasao National Protected Area (Sch\u00f6nweger et al., 2012). In Vietnam, most large land and forest enterprises in Vietnam\u2018s uplands are run by state enterprises (Hirsch and Scurrah, 2015). It should be noted that not all land \u2015grabbing\u2016 is done by large players at the expense of smallholders. In parts of the 3S in Vietnam and Cambodia, ethnic majority farmers have displaced minority shifting cultivators from their lands through a range of market-based and more forceful means (Hirsch and Scurrah, 2015). Future direction Agriculture has been a major driver of land use and social change in the 3S. Although not well documented, past efforts to increase agricultural production through both expansion and intensification have certainly resulted in long term costs to ecosystem services (e.g., deforestation, habitat loss, soil erosion, nutrient run off and water pollution), and most likely to human health (e.g., from pesticides and fertilizers). These impacts disproportionately affect poor rural communities. Currently, all three governments are promoting agricultural intensification and, notwithstanding options for increasing organic cultivation, it is likely that irrigation and agrochemical use will continue to increase. This could have major consequences for water supplies, soil health, human health and productivity and other ecosystem services. 2. FISHERIES Importance of 3S in regional fisheries and food security Throughout the lower Mekong, fisheries make a vital contribution to the livelihoods and well-being of many millions of people. The bulk of the catch is harvested by part-time subsistence fishers who are poor and generally use fishing as part of a diversified livelihood strategy (Baran and Myschwoda, 2009). According to FAO statistics (almost certainly underestimated) the freshwater inland fisheries of CLV varies annually but produce on average 588,000 tons/year, of which 67% is in Cambodia (primarily from the Tonle Sap) and just 6% is in Laos (Figure 2.1). In Laos, the fisheries value is equivalent to 7% of the country\u2018s GDP and in Cambodia, although also including marine fisheries, accounts for nearly 12% of GDP (i.e., a greater proportion than rice production). 19There is an indirect link with hydropower. For the Xekaman 1 hydropower project on the Sekong there is an expectation that rubber plantations will absorb labour resettled from the reservoir area (Khouangvichit et al., 2014). 45 Figure 2.1: Estimated inland freshwater fish catch in CLV (2000-2015) (http://www.fao.org/fishery/statistics/global-capture-production/en) Although fishing is the primary livelihood activity of only a relatively small number of people in the 3S, for large numbers of smallholder/subsistence farmers, fishing is a vital secondary activity. For many tens of thousands of people in the 3S, capture fisheries (i.e., fish and other aquatic organisms) remain a vital contribution to their food security (including nutrition) and household income (Box 2.1). Because of higher living standards and the greater agricultural commercialization, the 3S population in Vietnam is not as dependent on capture fisheries as it is in Cambodia and Laos (Baran et al., 2014). Despite its importance, data on the capture fisheries yields in each basin are sparse, contradictory, and in many cases, underestimated.

Official Vietnamese government statistics indicate that between 1995 and 2014, capture fisheries increased steadily in Kon Tum and Gia Lai and were fairly constant in Dak Lak Provinces, with a total of 3,886 tons (General Statistics", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "96ecb6b9-cf29-43ba-947b-4ff848a18f98": {"__data__": {"id_": "96ecb6b9-cf29-43ba-947b-4ff848a18f98", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Measuring, understanding and adapting to nexus trade-offs in the Sekong, Sesan and Srepok transboundary river basins", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "47a4822813b9686ff60555ce01a0b05f4f9fe004969b66f9df9ca3812bf6d744"}, "3": {"node_id": "174626e3-497e-4497-8593-8773e0505c17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cf32470c110d0b21852cc8c608ae20d2c2542c9e0e12bf7693295fbdec244410"}}, "hash": "abe3d27a6599c2f03382a8812c427eaceadb7135a2355e5bacfed4e1db068a97", "text": "Office of Vietnam, 2017).

In the Sekong, local livelihoods depend on capture fisheries more so than in other river basins in Laos, with even villages far from the mainstem of the Sekong reporting harvesting fish for food (Baird and Shoemaker, 2008). Rural families commonly harvest fish and other aquatic animals such as crabs, shrimps, snails, frogs, insects and plants from nearby fields, canals, ponds, rivers, streams and lakes. Although daily harvests are modest and largely go unrecorded in government statistics, the cumulative total is large, and the fishery is critically important for peoples\u2018 wellbeing, providing them with their primary source of protein and micro- nutrients essential for health (Meusch et al., 2003). 46 Sekong Sesan Srepok C Dependent population 11,025-15,330 30,000-50,000 40,350-67,250 Per capita fish catch (kg) 99.9 12.2 16.9 Total fish catch (tons) 1,100-1,530 370-845 682-1,136 L Dependent population 30,124 - - Per capita fish catch (kg) 23 - - Total fish catch (tons) 692 - - V Total fish catch (tons) 100 2,844 Table 2.1: Estimated average annual fish catch in the CLV portions of the 3S Although the direct contribution of the 3S to capture fisheries is a relatively small proportion of the total produced in CLV, this greatly understates the importance of these rivers to the total fisheries of the Lower Mekong. Many of the fish in the 3S are migratory (65, 54 and 82 species in the Sekong, Sesan and Srepok respectively (Ziv et al, 2012)), travelling long distances to reach spawning and nursery grounds (SWECO-Groner, 2006). These fish are not only important for fisheries within the 3S but also for the entire Lower Mekong.20 Disruption of regional fish migration by dams on the 3S will likely reduce the fisheries productivity of the Tonle Sap and the Lower Mekong floodplains. By blocking migration up the Sesan and Srepok, the LS2 dam alone may cause a decrease in fish biomass by 9.3% (i.e., 58,829 tons/yr) across the whole of the Lower Mekong. Similarly, three planned dams on the Sekong (Sekong 3D, Sekong 3 Up and Sekong 4) could cause declines of 3.3%, 0.9% and 0.8% respectively (i.e., a total of 25,300 tons/yr) (Ziv et al., 2012). Trends in capture fisheries Although there are no statistically significant trends in terms of total production, per capita capture fisheries are declining across the Lower Mekong, largely as a result of population growth and increased fishing pressure. There is also evidence that the size of fish caught is declining, another indicator of fisheries under pressure (MRC, 2017). Throughout the 3S, even in the remotest areas, there is growing use of modern fishing gear (i.e., nylon gillnets and factory-made metal hooks)21, which makes it easier for more people to catch more fish. In recent years, the mesh size of gillnets has decreased and there is increasing use of mosquito nets. Some fishers use diving masks and spear guns to collect 20-30 kg of fish in one night, which many villagers believe is harmful to fish stocks. Electric shock fishing is an increasing problem and is very destructive to fish stocks (Baird and Shoemaker, 2008). Role of aquaculture Across the Lower Mekong, aquaculture is expanding rapidly and has the potential to offset total losses in capture fisheries (MRC, 2011).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "174626e3-497e-4497-8593-8773e0505c17": {"__data__": {"id_": "174626e3-497e-4497-8593-8773e0505c17", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Measuring, understanding and adapting to nexus trade-offs in the Sekong, Sesan and Srepok transboundary river basins", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "47a4822813b9686ff60555ce01a0b05f4f9fe004969b66f9df9ca3812bf6d744"}, "2": {"node_id": "96ecb6b9-cf29-43ba-947b-4ff848a18f98", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "abe3d27a6599c2f03382a8812c427eaceadb7135a2355e5bacfed4e1db068a97"}}, "hash": "cf32470c110d0b21852cc8c608ae20d2c2542c9e0e12bf7693295fbdec244410", "text": "All three governments are promoting aquaculture, particularly small-scale culture-based pond fisheries as a contribution to rural development and, in the case of Laos, to food security in the south of the country.

There are few recent data on extent or yields. In southern Laos, it is estimated that less than 10% of households participate in aquaculture, compared to more than 80% that participate in capture fisheries. However, between 1998-99 and 2010-11, the area for aquaculture in southern Laos increased from 900 to 2,700 hectares (Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, 2014). Government statistics indicate that in the three provinces in the Vietnamese portion of the 3S, aquaculture production has risen steadily since 1995, with a total of 19,324 tons produced in 2014 (0.8% of national freshwater aquaculture production) of which 75% was from Dak Lak Province (General Statistics Office of Vietnam, 2017). Increased fish production is often promoted as an important secondary benefit of reservoirs created for hydropower or irrigation. Dam proponents often propose reservoir fisheries to compensate for the disruption to livelihoods caused by a dam. However, compensation for loss in yield from river fisheries is often difficult to achieve through reservoir fisheries. Hydropower reservoirs are typically characterized by deep, standing or slow flowing water that is not ideal habitat for the fish that evolved in the relatively shallow free-flowing conditions of the 3S. Typically, there are significant changes in fish species diversity, composition, and biomass in tropical river systems, with general declines a few years after impoundment (Jackson and Marmulla, 2001). There are no data on reservoir fisheries in the 3S. Although outside the 3S, small reservoirs (0.5 to 6.5 km2) in the highlands of Vietnam have reported yields in the range 126 to 588 kg/ha/yr (Hortle, 2009). With a yield of 133 kg/ha/yr in 2007, the much larger Nam Ngum 1 hydropower reservoir in Laos, completed in 1971, is an example of sustained healthy self-sustaining stocks of native fish, decades after the impoundment, despite the disappearance of long-distance migratory fish. Fisheries experts generally recommend enhancement of native fish species in reservoirs in preference to stocking because they are likely to be more sustainable. However, careful management of both reservoirs and upstream catchments is needed to maximize and sustain production, as well as to ensure that the benefits of reservoir fisheries accrue to those that lost the riverine fisheries and not, as is often the case, outsiders (Box 5.2). Average reservoir yields of 200 kg/ha/yr (with yields inversely proportional to reservoir area) have been estimated for Lower Mekong reservoirs (Hortle and Bamrungrach, 2015). In the 3S, the surface area of many existing and possible future reservoirs is unknown. However, data from various sources indicate that for 23 of the maximum 42 hydropower schemes that will exist in the 3S, reservoir surface areas vary from 1.8 km2 to 723 km2, with a total of 3,033 km2. Applying the relationship presented in Hortle and Bamrungrach (2015)22 to these reservoirs provides an area- weighted average possible yield of 131 kg/ha/yr (i.e., somewhat less than that estimated for the 22The relationship developed is: y = 466.4A-0.23 where: y = yield (kg/ha/yr) and A = reservoir surface area at full supply level (km2) (Hortle and Bamrungrach, 2015). - 500,000 1,000,000 1,500,000 2,000,000 2,500,000 3,000,000 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 Freshwater aquaculture production (tonnes) Vietnam Lao PDR Cambodia 48 entire Lower Mekong).

HUMAN HEALTH Current status Many factors influence the health and well-being of people, including availability of food, diet, water quality, sanitation, socio-economic status and cultural practices, literacy, and lifestyle. These factors have changed significantly during the economic transitions that have shaped CLV in recent decades, resulting in considerable improvements to health and increased life-expectancy in all three countries. However, these broad regional improvements are not experienced equally; health inequities remain a significant problem. Remote border and forested areas, such as the 3S, are socio-economically worse off and present unique challenges to public health initiatives. Consequently, they tend not to have improved as much as other areas.

Malnutrition Like all other poverty indicators, the vulnerable and children are most affected by malnutrition. Since nutrition is essential for a child\u2018s intellectual and physical development many nutrition indicators focus on children under 5. Malnutrition is a major problem in all three countries and is particularly prevalent in rural communities and among the poor. Ethnic minorities located in remote upland areas are disproportionately affected and there are high levels of malnutrition throughout the 3S, including in Vietnam (Table 3.1). Most households have acceptable levels of food consumption, but nourishment is undermined by lack of diversity and poor quality in terms of both nutritional content and food safety (Bouapao et al., 2016). Micronutrient deficiencies, especially iron, vitamin A and iodine are a major concern. Cultural practices that impose restrictions on what infants consume and lack of education of mothers have also been found to be significant variables in explaining malnutrition in ethnic minorities (Annim and Imai, 2014). Underweight Stunting Wasting C Mondulkiri, Ratanakiri, Stung Treng 23.8% 48.6% - L Attapeu, Sekong, Saravane 30.0% 44.3% 11.0% V Kon Tum, Dak Lak, Gia Lia 26.1% 37.75 9.1% Table 3.1: Nutritional status of children <5 in the 3S (Haslet et al., 2013; Bouapao et al., 2016) Water pollution Data are sparse, but it seems that water pollution in the 3S is not yet a serious problem. Nevertheless, concerns for human health remain. Results from all monitoring stations in the 3S in all three countries indicate that over time total suspended solids (TSS) and total nitrogen and phosphorous loads, are increasing in both dry and wet seasons. TSS levels are particularly high, exceeding quality standards for water used for domestic purposes in some places. Increasing agrochemical use and mining present the greatest threat to water quality and thus to human health in the 3S. Agrochemicals can pose significant (acute and chronic) risks to human health (Wimalawansa and Wimalawansa, 2014). Agrochemical use is far greater in Vietnam than in Cambodia and Laos, but because Vietnam forms the headwaters, high application rates there potentially pose a risk downstream, particularly in Cambodia where there is widespread use of untreated river water for domestic and potable supplies. Given the likelihood of agricultural expansion and much greater rates of application in both Laos and Cambodia, and possibly even in Vietnam as soil fertility declines, the risk of agrochemical pollution is likely to increase. Pollution from mining is also likely to increase. In Laos, local communities have complained of toxic pollution from gold mines in tributaries of the Sekong (Radio Free Asia, 2013). Discharge of 49 red mud in bauxite mining, waste water containing toxic compounds and heavy metal salts, or toxic chemicals (e.g., mercury to purify gold or cyanide in bauxite production) all represent serious threats to human health. If, as is likely, mining in the 3S increases, this threat will intensify. Continued forest loss puts additional pressure on water quality as it increases soil erosion, unnatural turbidity levels, and organic matter in river water. The lack of centralized wastewater treatment system in large cities in the Central Highlands coupled with steady population growth potentially creates local water pollution issues. General well-being In all three countries, the 3S fares badly in most social and health indicators. Harsh natural conditions, unpredictable weather and poor infrastructure are among the factors that limit access to markets and social services, undermining livelihoods and constraining opportunities to escape poverty. This is also true in the Central Highlands, but social conditions there tend to be better than in many parts of Cambodia and Laos (ADB, 2012). Many ethnic minority groups live in the 3S. For these communities, traditional livelihoods are largely dependent on shifting cultivation supplemented with fisheries and forest products. Generally, these communities lack secure title to their land and other resources, are poorly educated, and have limited livelihood alternatives. They tend not to be represented in decision making. This is particularly true for women and youth and comes to the fore when communities are relocated for dams, mines or plantation concessions (Box 3.1). Such communities now rely on a dwindling resource base.

Although the links between electricity generation and economic growth are complex, regression analyses present a simple and seemingly compelling national-level narrative for policy-makers: increasing electricity generation increases GDP and increasing GDP reduces poverty. Against this background \u2013 and in the context of high oil prices, an emphasis on renewables, the availability of private financing, and improved transmission \u2013 hydropower has been perceived as increasingly attractive and its development has accelerated. A significant proportion of installed hydropower capacity in Laos (30%) and Vietnam (17%) is installed in the 3S (Table 4.1). 50 Box 3.1: Resettlement from large dam construction Dams require the resettlement of people living and/or farming in the area that will be inundated by the reservoir. Displacement is recognized as one of the most detrimental social impacts caused by dams. In the 3S, about 60,000 people, mostly ethnic minorities, have been, or will be, displaced by large dams. About 5,000 villagers are being relocated from the reservoir site of the LS2 dam in Cambodia (Mongabay, 2017) and about 8,500 people were moved by the Yali Falls dam in Vietnam. Their livelihoods often do not survive relocation (Scudder, 2005). They may lose not only their land but also access to resources that they once depended on. This forces a greater reliance on cash incomes and breadwinners often have to seek wage labor. In general, relocated people experience disproportionately higher levels of landlessness, unemployment, indebtedness and hunger. Funds for resettlement and rehabilitation are almost always inadequate.

In Vietnam, more than 98% of rural households have access to electricity. This compares to less than 30% of rural households in Cambodia (KfW, 2014) and 88% in Laos (Ministry of Energy and Mines, 2015). Laos and Cambodia have ambitious rural electrification programs. Laos aims to supply electricity to at least 90% of households in the country by 2020 (Ministry of Planning and Investment, 2016) and Cambodia anticipates 100% electrification of villages by 2020 (Constable 2015). Laos has commissioned more than 3,500 MW of hydropower over the past 20 years and added 600 MW in 2015 (World Energy Council, 2016). The rapid development of hydropower in has been driven not by domestic needs but by the government\u2018s plan to promote national development through the sale of electricity to neighboring countries. Laos is seeking to increase exports of electricity to Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and possibly Myanmar. According to government targets, installed hydropower will reach 5,500 MW by 2020 with a further 20,000 MW planned. There are 54 hydropower projects under construction, all of which should be complete by 2020 (Laos News Agency, 2017). Cambodia has struggled to meet basic electricity needs in recent years and this is seen as a significant drag on development. Furthermore, the need to import about 25% of its electricity (primarily from Thailand and Vietnam) contributes to concerns over energy insecurity (Weatherby and Eyler, 2017). As a result, Cambodia wants to more than double electricity generation between 2014 and 2018 and is rapidly developing hydropower (IRN, 2014). Despite concerns over the impacts on fisheries, the government aims to reduce electricity imports to zero by 2024 and increase hydropower production to 3,000 MW (about 50% of anticipated total demand) by 2027 (Ministry of Mines and Energy, 2016). About one-third of Vietnam\u2018s installed hydropower is in the Central Highlands. The government plans to increase total hydropower capacity to 21,000 MW by 2020 with about 2,000 MW in the Central Highlands (World Energy Council, 2016).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1810b266-f1d6-4c8c-ac59-5b5f377ce16f": {"__data__": {"id_": "1810b266-f1d6-4c8c-ac59-5b5f377ce16f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Measuring, understanding and adapting to nexus trade-offs in the Sekong, Sesan and Srepok transboundary river basins", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cd30858857e9f77892f5e5ac078c31ba8b471cabe3aa4e1b03284a364296e2de"}, "2": {"node_id": "a9e5c6a3-627a-4da6-90e1-2db508695c28", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9cc10be239aacec464b33366bfe1a70691d580ce47cbc0932d503caf90a5fbc0"}}, "hash": "2c5bc0ef5511f73c223c6877b627442d0dc2c5804621d78d36020ac1a70cfd1e", "text": "However, there is growing public awareness of the negative environmental and social impacts of hydropower, which led to the cancellation of more than 400 mostly small hydropower projects in 2012 and 2013 (Tuan, undated).

There are seven hydropower projects undergoing feasibility assessments in the Lao portion of the Sekong. Given the closure of the Sesan and Srepok by the LS2, any one of these seven dams will compromise the last major free flowing tributary of the Mekong with potentially significant implications for fish migration and sediment (Thomas, pers. comm. 2017). Evolving energy sector The energy sector in Southeast Asia is evolving rapidly. ASEAN has set a target of securing 23% of its energy from renewables by 2025 (34th ASEAN Ministers on Energy Meeting, Nay Pyi Taw, Myanmar, September 2016). Although hydropower is classified as renewable, there is a recognition that non-hydropower renewables (primarily solar, wind and bioenergy) can also make a significant contribution to this target (IRENA and ACE, 2016). Globally, record low prices for utility scale photovoltaics and wind turbines in 2016 (i.e., as low as $0.03/kWh23), as well as more and more examples of how renewables can be integrated into existing grids while maintaining or even improving reliability of supply are increasing both the economic and technical viability of these energy sources. Most estimates indicate that the global price of solar and wind will continue to fall in coming years because of economies of scale and the rise of alternative funding frameworks (Weatherby and Eyler, 2017). Although the very low prices of non-hydropower renewables are yet to reach the Mekong, CLV could benefit from these global trends. Each country has different resource endowments and different levels and growth rates of 23By comparison, hydropower costs are very site specific but typically $0.02-$0.19/kWh (IRENA, 2012). For 10 planned hydropower schemes in the Laos portion of the Sekong, average energy costs were estimated to be between $0.025 and $0.053/kWh in 2004 (Maunsell and Lahmeyer International, 2004). However, the cost to the consumer depends very much on the price fixed in negotiations between the government and the developers in the power purchase agreement. In Laos in 2014, the average electricity tariff was $0.086/kWh (Ministry of Energy and Mines, 2015).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a4d4dc7a-bbdf-4238-a2d1-c3617831f27c": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4d4dc7a-bbdf-4238-a2d1-c3617831f27c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Measuring, understanding and adapting to nexus trade-offs in the Sekong, Sesan and Srepok transboundary river basins", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "269e7daa3b164cf7c31f38810289c0945881f58be265b313c3a01d227f6cdde7"}, "2": {"node_id": "83eebc0f-e40d-40c0-a426-c01606d69cdc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e0464d7d23b5852584d6794c3d2771c5a75b0b7419358178d61190b6f00717bd"}}, "hash": "613a5f292749e591c3f528654460cb3fd2de644de239fbac6079d932e7279309", "text": "In Cambodia, electricity prices are among ASEAN\u2019s highest: in 2012 households paid $0.25-$0.80/kWh (Weatherby and Eyler, 2017).
