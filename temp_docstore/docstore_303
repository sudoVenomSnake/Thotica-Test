 registration is a fundamental function and responsibility of the State. Society benefits from the availability of high-quality statistics on life events; the civil registry is a precious and potent public good. It is the best source of vital statistics including births, deaths and causes of death and reflects the development status of a country and its capacity to ensure universal protection of all citizens. The information derived from a well-functioning civil registration system can be used to identify vulnerable groups, inform the development of policies and monitor their implementation and progress. As pointed out by WHO, \u201cCivil registration is something that all developed countries have and that developing countries need\u201d. Therefore, civil registration needs to be placed at the heart of the post-2015 development agenda as an imperative for overcoming critical development challenges. Sources: 1.

But much remains to be done. A number of MDG targets could be missed by 2015.

This chapter outlines the issues that will be of greatest importance in the years after 2015. remains, as the development community advances discussions toward shaping the post-2015 agenda. Persistent poverty The Asia-Pacific achievement in poverty reduction is a matter of pride. As shown in Table II-11 between 1990 and 2011, the incidence of extreme poverty (below $1.25 a day) dropped from 52 to 18 per cent. Nevertheless, that still leaves unacceptable levels of poverty, particularly in some middle income countries. Almost two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor ($1.25 PPP) live in this region. Even China, which between 1990 and 2009 reduced the proportion of people living on less than $1.25 per day from 60.2 to 11.8 per cent of the population, still has over 156 million people living in poverty.1 Indeed, reflecting the large populations of countries such as India, China, Pakistan and Indonesia, there are more poor people in middle-income countries than in low- income countries. There are also large numbers of people living just above the extreme poverty line \u2013 in \u2018near poverty\u2019, who cannot manage a decent existence. If $2 a day is used as a benchmark, the number of poor people doubles from 743 million to 1.64 billion. Therefore, about 900 million people living between $1.25 and $2 a day remain vulnerable, a number that has increased since 1990. At present, about 40.4 per cent of the population in the region subsists on less than $2 a day. In the coming years, inclusive economic growth, which enables productive and decent job creation and CHAPTER II: Unfinished agenda and emerging issues 26 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 social inclusion to ensure equal access to economic opportunity, will continue to play an important role in reducing income poverty. Growth also helps governments with additional revenues to finance other equally important social objectives. Rising income inequality Economic growth in Asia and the Pacific has helped increase the incomes of the poor, but it has boosted those of the rich even more. During the 2000s, while most Asia-Pacific economies enjoyed rapid economic growth, the benefits were being distributed unevenly. The consequence has been a widening gap between rich and poor. One study suggests that, between the 1990s and the latest available year, the population- weighted mean Gini coefficient for the entire region rose from 33.5 to 37.5.2 The same study shows that only 16 out of 30 countries that over the long run enjoyed positive mean annual growth also achieved lower income inequality. From the early 1990s to the mid- to late 2000s, income gaps widened in 14 of the 30 economies with comparable data: the Gini coefficient worsened in China, for example, from 32.4 to 42.5; in India, from 30.8 to 33.4; and in Indonesia, from 29.2 to 34.0.3 As a result, the rates of reduction in poverty in these countries have not been commensurate with their fast growth rates. In many countries this rise in inequality can be linked at least in part to the slow growth in agriculture, which continues to employ some of the region\u2019s poorest people and pays lower wages than industry or services. Agriculture still accounts for 51 per cent of total employment in South Asia and 40 per cent in East Asia.4 Since 1990, GDP growth in East Asia has averaged over 8 per cent per year, but agriculture has grown more slowly. As a result, a significant proportion of the population has neither contributed to, nor has benefited from, increased growth. Moreover, the share of agriculture in GDP declined much more rapidly than might be expected as part of a normal development trajectory. In East Asia, between 1970 and 2011 agriculture\u2019s share of GDP fell from 34.6 to 11 per cent. In South Asia, over the same period, it fell from 41.5 to 18 per cent.5", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a7c66063-cea2-4570-a1fa-56f93c832d28": {"__data__": {"id_": "a7c66063-cea2-4570-a1fa-56f93c832d28", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2012/2013", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "829eb8ea0613fcae5c2968dfb6128d83619ef101671f0649fe3922d63eb60c2d"}, "3": {"node_id": "eaf863e7-d768-4727-aaad-6db1ea84214d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "31aea33f03b7b93b519a0456b0a8a98539e057165c47e7390e61126ceaa8a250"}}, "hash": "d30abee99c72c988e0e157fdb770dc1928576832ecc40a915f25e932c6253f69", "text": "Agriculture\u2019s much higher employment share than its share in GDP indicates its low productivity. Agriculture, being the refuge or the employer of last resort, on average, has been less productive, leading to greater levels of underemployment in agriculture which used to be referred to in classical literature as \u2018disguised unemployment\u2019. Income inequalities across the region are evident between urban and rural areas, between women and men, and between different social, ethnic and minority groups, as well as among vulnerable groups, such as people with disabilities. However, because of unavailable data it is not possible to fully assess such inequalities or compare them between countries. Non-income inequality Inequality is also evident in many other components of development \u2013 in education, health, food consumption, and housing and in access to safe drinking water \u2013 where multiple forms of deprivation tend to overlap and reinforce each other. Thus, poorer people are more likely to live in places that have limited or low-quality health services.6 And workers with low incomes are less able to protect their health or develop their skills, which in turn reduces their productivity and their earning potential. These systematic, two-way social and economic interactions can reinforce cumulative disadvantage over generations.7 One way of illustrating this is to discount levels of development achievement by a factor proportional to Table II-1 \u2013 Extreme and near poverty in Asia and the Pacific, levels and incidence Note: Vulnerable population refers to those living above $1.25 a day but below $2 a day.

Using data for 26 Asia-Pacific countries, each dimension\u2019s average value can be discounted according to the country\u2019s level of inequality in education and life expectancy. This indicates that the discount is particularly high in emerging economies, such as China, India, and Indonesia, where this inequality- adjusted social development index shows a potential loss of over 20 per cent (Figure II-1). Not enough decent and productive jobs One reason why the region continues to experience significant levels of poverty and rising inequality is that economic growth is not generating sufficient decent and productive employment. Over the period 2000- 2011, growth in GDP was not accompanied by a commensurate expansion in formal employment. Over the period 2000-2007, average annual GDP growth in the Asia-Pacific region was 8.5 per cent while formal employment growth was only 1.6 per cent. Similarly, in the period 2009-2011, while average annual GDP growth was 7.6 per cent, formal employment grew only by 1.0 per cent (Figure II-2). Growth across countries in the region has not generated productive employment. This is due partly to technological change and labour substitution but also to the nature and pattern of growth. The problems tend to be greatest in countries that rely on extracting natural resources or the export of primary commodities \u2013 where growth is less likely to produce commensurate increases in employment. More can be done to channel resources, especially those from extractive industries, towards employment generation. Countries can also tailor macroeconomic policies to generate domestic demand, catalyse investment and increase employment. Thus far, however, most countries have been neglecting the rural farm and non-farm sectors, which account for a major share of the incomes of the poor and the \u2018near poor\u2019. All this is happening at a time when, as populations increase, the labour force in many parts of the region is expanding. As a result, since 2002 the formal employment-population ratio in South and East Asia, for example, has dropped significantly. This does not, however, mean that people are likely to be unemployed. Without adequate systems of social protection to fall back on, people have to take whatever work they can find or generate, no matter how unproductive or poorly compensated.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eaf863e7-d768-4727-aaad-6db1ea84214d": {"__data__": {"id_": "eaf863e7-d768-4727-aaad-6db1ea84214d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2012/2013", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "829eb8ea0613fcae5c2968dfb6128d83619ef101671f0649fe3922d63eb60c2d"}, "2": {"node_id": "a7c66063-cea2-4570-a1fa-56f93c832d28", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d30abee99c72c988e0e157fdb770dc1928576832ecc40a915f25e932c6253f69"}}, "hash": "31aea33f03b7b93b519a0456b0a8a98539e057165c47e7390e61126ceaa8a250", "text": "Generally, a significant number of people work in the informal sector as self-employed workers, as own-account workers or as contributing family workers, and more than half are women.

But the proportion is significantly higher, close to 80 per cent, in South Asia where 486 million workers are in vulnerable employment.9 Even in East Asia, which has had rapid economic growth, the proportion is around 50 per cent. Nor has there been much improvement in recent years. The proportion in vulnerable employment has been falling only slowly. Indeed, as a consequence of population increase, in some parts of the region the absolute numbers in vulnerable employment have risen \u2013 as in South Asia, South-East Asia and the Pacific over the period 2000 to 2011.10 Those in vulnerable employment make up most of what are considered as the \u2018working poor\u2019, and their numbers are increasing. About 1.1 billion workers, or 60 per cent of the Asia-Pacific region\u2019s workers, are in vulnerable employment. The region accounts for almost 73 per cent of the world\u2019s working poor \u2013 422 million workers living with their families on less than $1.25 per day.11 Bangladesh, for example, has an unemployment rate of only 5 per cent, but more than half of those working are below the $1.25 poverty line, and the proportion increases to 80 per cent when using the $2 a day poverty line (Table II-2). Armenia on the other hand, which has stronger systems of social protection, has a 29 per cent unemployment rate, but among those who are employed less than 1 per cent are below the $1.25 poverty line, though the proportion increases to 9 per cent on the basis of a $2 poverty line. Vulnerable employment is more likely to affect women. This is partly because many women work in agriculture. In Asia and the Pacific as a whole, 44 per cent of women work in agriculture compared to 36 per cent of men.12 A high proportion of women in agriculture are unpaid family workers, and women are more likely than men to be employed at a low- productivity, subsistence level. But women also tend to be in vulnerable employment even outside agriculture. In Bangladesh, India and Nepal, for example, around 90 per cent of female workers in non-agricultural employment are in informal work. Unemployment or underemployment is also a concern for youth. Currently, the average rate of youth unemployment in Asia and the Pacific is around 11 per cent, more than double the rate for the total working-age population.

Lacking economic and social opportunities, many are forced into high-risk and vulnerable forms of employment. Continuing hunger and food insecurity Another major problem for the region is food insecurity. The minimum per capita dietary energy requirement used by the FAO to assess undernourishment is 1,800 calories per day. On this basis, there has been some progress. Between 1990-92 and 2012, the proportion of the Asia-Pacific population estimated to be undernourished fell from 24 to 14 per cent. Nevertheless, this still leaves 542 million people undernourished. Asia and the Pacific accounts for more than 60 per cent of the world\u2019s hungry people (Figure II-3).13 The situation is worst in South Asia where the proportion of people undernourished is 18 per cent, followed by the Pacific (12 per cent), East Asia (12 per cent), South-East Asia (11 per cent) and Central Asia (7 per cent) (Figure II-4). A particular concern is the level of undernutrition among women. This is a significant public health problem. As well as damaging women\u2019s health, this reduces their labour productivity and affects the nutrition and health of their children. Undernourishment is high in a number of other countries, including Timor-Leste, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, Tajikistan, Lao PDR, Georgia, and Mongolia (Figure II-5). Another important measure of undernutrition is the proportion of children who are underweight for their age. On this indicator too, the problems are most severe in South and South-West Asia where on average 34 per cent of children are underweight \u2013 with the highest figures in India, at 44 per cent in 2006, and Bangladesh, at 36.4 per cent in 2011. Even in South-East Asia, which has made the greatest progress, as many as five out of 11 countries have more than one-fifth of their children undernourished. This puts children\u2019s lives at risk. In Asia and the Pacific, around 3 million children die each year before reaching the age of five, and around half these deaths are from causes related to malnutrition, poor hygiene and lack of access to safe water and adequate sanitation. For nutrition, there are also various composite indicators. The \u2018global hunger index\u2019 from the International Food Policy Research Institute, for example, is based on a simple average of three indicators: the percentage of the population undernourished; the Figure II-3 \u2013 Global undernourishment across regions, 2010-2012 (millions) Source: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2012.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68d68c5a-7abb-45d0-b2bf-499fca387886": {"__data__": {"id_": "68d68c5a-7abb-45d0-b2bf-499fca387886", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2012/2013", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "88ee825e3cd6c50a6e82ad475f1c862513c127d976b1fc6ad6b16b0521b33f18"}, "2": {"node_id": "f9eb2a45-41b9-4433-ad71-c0e073c54951", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c09567d5d81ba2e676e0facc5e363119fa5c95d93e5475bb8c9143059ec8cc09"}}, "hash": "731c12905c679da6a05c44546f5f09faa7013e045c917cc456fdee3fcf040ba6", "text": "Developed Countries 16 Western Asia and North Africa 25 Latin America and the Caribbean 49 Sub-Saharan Africa 234 Asia and the Pacific 543 Equivalent to 62% of the world\u2019s hungry Total = 868 million CHAPTER II: Unfinished agenda and emerging issues 31 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 Figure II-4 \u2212 Levels of undernourishment in subregions of Asia and the Pacific, % of population, 2012 Notes: Proportion of the population estimated to be at risk of caloric inadequacy.

On this basis, Afghanistan again has the worst score, over 40 per cent, as a consequence of high levels on all three indicators, with Tajikistan second at 26 per cent, with a high score primarily on undernourishment. Another composite index is the Economist Intelligence Unit\u2019s \u2018global food security index\u2019. Across a set of 105 countries, this combines measures of food affordability, availability, quality and safety. Any country which scores below 50 is potentially food insecure (Figure II- 6). On this basis, in 2012 the least food-secure country in Asia and the Pacific was Cambodia with an index of 30.0, followed by Tajikistan (32.3), Bangladesh (34.6) and Nepal (35.2). New Zealand was the most food secure, with an index of 82.7, followed by Australia (81.1) and Japan (80.7). Figures for Afghanistan were not available. Good nutrition depends not just on the quantity of food consumed but also its quality, and in particular the extent to which it provides essential micronutrients, notably vitamin A, iron, and iodine. Deficiencies in these micronutrients can impair the mental and physical development of children, while also reducing the productivity of adults. Many countries have medium to extreme levels of vitamin and mineral deficiency,14 with serious social and economic consequences, causing India, for example, to lose an estimated 2.5 per cent of its GDP. For the poor, food constitutes a large proportion of their budgets so their capacity to consume sufficient nutritious food will be sensitive to prices. Over recent years, food prices have been volatile and at times have risen steeply, so people often have to eat less or lower- quality food. In fact, following the food crisis that hit Asia and the Pacific in the mid-2000s, prices have remained quite high. Food security is also affected by climate change. This is likely to hit the Asia-Pacific region hard and have a significant impact on food production. The region will need to work towards maintaining steady food supplies and stable prices. Among other things, this will involve accelerating investments in agricultural R&D and rural infrastructure especially roads and irrigation. Asia and the Pacific can also help safeguard domestic food availability by setting up regional food reserves and establishing regional agreements on freer trade in foodgrains and other food.

In South Asia, on the other hand, women continue to live for fewer years than the world average.18 A major reason for low life expectancy of women in South Asia is maternal mortality, where around 217 mothers died for every 100,000 live births in 2010 due to inequities in the provision of health services with regard to antenatal care, and deliveries attended by skilled health personnel, as well as high levels of unintended pregnancies. Maternal mortality is the leading cause of death among adolescent girls between the ages of 15 and 19 in the region.19 There has been steady progress in narrowing the gender gap in education. The region overall has achieved gender parity on primary and secondary levels, but there are significant differences between subregions. East Asia and the Pacific are ahead of South Asia at all levels, and noticeably at the tertiary level. In East Asia, girls outnumber boys at this level, with a ratio of female to male enrolment of 108.8; in South Asia, on the other hand, the ratio is only 72.2. A continuing problem in many countries is gender- based violence. This includes physical and sexual violence from intimate partners and others, and can be a reflection of social norms and the relative powerlessness of women in the home. Although there is a lack of international comparable statistics, several surveys point to the pervasiveness of this problem. In surveys conducted between 1995 and 2006, the proportion of women who reported experiencing physical violence at least once in their lifetime was more than 10 per cent in China and the Philippines, above 20 per cent in India and Cambodia, and nearly 50 per cent in Australia.20 Women\u2019s economic status Women in Asia and the Pacific are less likely than men to own assets. This is evident in the ownership of land. Around two-thirds of women\u2019s employment in South Asia is in agriculture and in East Asia the proportion is around 40 per cent \u2013 yet women head only 7 per cent of farms, compared with 20 per cent in most other global regions.21 A more general lack of progress in gender empowerment is evident from indicators on women\u2019s participation in non-agricultural wage employment: between 1990 and 2009, across the region this increased only marginally, from 28 to 31 per cent. In most Asia-Pacific countries, women are more likely than men to be informal workers \u2013 a consequence of their limited skills, restricted mobility and gender norms. In addition, women have the load of unpaid domestic work to which they devote large amounts of time and energy. Women\u2019s voice Gender equality will also require more equal political participation. The MDGs did not specify a goal or a target in this respect. However, one indicator captures the percentage of parliamentarians who are women. On this basis progress remains slow. Compared to other regions Asia and the Pacific has the world\u2019s second-lowest percentage of women parliamentarians. Even Asian countries with high levels of development have low proportions of women in their national legislatures, as in Japan (11 per cent in the lower house) and the Republic of Korea (16 per cent). The Pacific subregion, despite achieving gender parity in education, has four of the world\u2019s six countries with no women legislators. Limited achievements in health Health is the MDG sector where the Asia-Pacific region has performed least well. Not only is it off track on maternal mortality and universal access to reproductive health, it is also likely to miss the child health goals. The region has, however, performed better on communicable diseases: the spread of tuberculosis has been checked and efforts to control HIV are also bearing fruit. Why have some countries achieved better health outcomes than others? The 2011-12 Asia-Pacific MDG report concluded that economic growth played a part, but that other factors were more important. One is overall health expenditure: countries with higher per CHAPTER II: Unfinished agenda and emerging issues 34 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 capita health expenditures have generally done better in reducing maternal, infant and child mortality. And those with higher public health expenditure, and greater numbers of health personnel, tend to be more successful at reducing the proportion of underweight children.

The rise of non-communicable diseases As well as having to address the burden of communicable diseases, countries across the region are facing rising levels of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) \u2013 an area neglected in the MDG Framework. NCDs include cardiovascular disease, cancer, and chronic respiratory disease and diabetes, all of which are becoming increasingly prevalent \u2013 a consequence of, among other things, ageing populations, unhealthy diets, exposure to harmful factors such as tobacco and air pollution, and sedentary lifestyles, which are often associated with urbanization. WHO projects that by 2020 the Asia-Pacific region will record the world\u2019s greatest number of NCD deaths.22 The International Diabetes Federation has estimated that over 200 million people in Asia already have diabetes \u2013 a number projected to exceed 300 million by 2030.23 NCDs have become a particularly serious threat in the Pacific. The Cook Islands, FSM, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Samoa and Tonga, for example, have obesity rates over 40 per cent; and Cook Islands, Fiji, FSM, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, and Samoa have diabetes prevalence rates of above 20 per cent.24 The increasing burden of NCDs not only causes greater human suffering but also has serious economic consequences \u2013 with large projected losses in GDP (Table II-3).25 Since NCDs are often chronic and lead to disability they can have serious financial implications. In India, for example, the risk of catastrophic spending for a household is 160 per cent higher for hospitalization due to cancer, as compared with hospitalization due to a communicable disease.26 The poor in several countries in Asia are particularly vulnerable to some risk factors: men in the poorest quintile are, for example, more likely to smoke. Low-quality education The Asia-Pacific region has performed well in providing access to basic education. By 2011, net primary enrolment had reached 95 per cent and by 2015 the region should meet the target of universal primary enrolment. Nevertheless, as many as 18 million children of primary school age are out of school. The region has three of the world\u2019s top five largest out-of- school populations. These are Pakistan (5.4 million in 2011), India (1.7 million in 2010) and the Philippines (1.5 million in 2009).27 The children with less access to education often live in war-torn zones or remote communities, belong to ethnic minorities or have disabilities. Even for children who are attending school there are still major concerns about the quality of their education. Across the region, standards vary considerably. This was demonstrated, for example, in the 2011 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study which surveyed 52 school systems across the world.

CHAPTER II: Unfinished agenda and emerging issues 36 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 Heightened vulnerability and economic insecurity The post-2015 framework for Asia and the Pacific will thus need to address many long-standing and persistent problems, but overlaid on these are a number of other trends. These too have deep historical roots. These include rapid demographic transformation, and threats to the natural environment, to which are now added the increasing impacts of disasters and climate change. One common thread through many of these issues is heightened vulnerability. Across the region, households are facing higher levels of risk. Many of these are related to events in the household itself such as death, disability or loss of employment of the breadwinner; or catastrophic expenditures resulting from illness of a family member. Moreover, with ageing populations, there are now more elderly people whose lifetime savings are no longer adequate to cope with the rising costs of living and health care. In addition to household-related risks, there are increasing exposures to more general risks from outside. People, goods, capital and information are moving around the world faster than ever, allowing events and crises to propagate swiftly across economies, markets and societies. Events that happen in any one country can have rapid repercussions on neighbouring countries, regions, and the world over. The Asia-Pacific region has in recent years been subjected, for example, to the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 and since 2008 to the global financial crises. Food price rises have also affected countries across the region, especially net food importing countries. The region also experienced the fast spread of SARS in 2003 and is exposed continuously to emerging and re-emerging public health threats. Poverty in the region is also increasingly related to environmental factors and resource constraints. A further source of heightened vulnerability is climate change \u2013 with many countries facing more-frequent droughts, floods, cyclones and typhoons. While everyone is affected by these risks, the poor are the least able to cope. Households face increasing risks may also be less able to rely on traditional forms of social protection \u2013 from the extended family or the community. This is partly the result of changing values and mores, but also of factors such as migration, which erode traditional community bonds. As costs of living rise, household members find it harder to extend mutual support beyond the immediate family. Meanwhile, formal systems of social protection remain weak \u2212 more than 60 per cent of the population of the Asia-Pacific region remain without coverage. Only 30 per cent of persons above the retirement age in Asia and the Pacific receive a pension on average, while only 10 per cent of the unemployed receive any benefits.31 Rapid demographic change The global population is expected to grow to over 9 billion by 2050.

CHAPTER II: Unfinished agenda and emerging issues 37 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 South and South-West Asia is the most youthful subregion. In East and North-East Asia and the Pacific, the proportion is about 16 per cent. This \u2018bulge\u2019 population group could provide a demographic dividend and help boost economic growth, but it could also lead to rising youth unemployment. Youth unemployment is emerging as a key concern, not just in LDCs, but in middle- and high-income economies. In Hong Kong, China; the Philippines; New Zealand; and Taiwan Province of China33, one in around six young people is unemployed. In Indonesia, the ratio is one in five. This is also an issue in the Pacific Island States: youths make up nearly 60 per cent of the unemployed population in Samoa and 50 per cent in Vanuatu. In the Marshall Islands, economically active youths are nearly three times more likely to be unemployed than their adult counterparts.34 At the other end of the scale, with increasing ageing amongst Asia-Pacific households, coupled with higher life expectancy, elderly people are seeing their lifetime savings dwindle so that they find it difficult to cope with the rising costs of living and health care. Unplanned urbanization Asia and the Pacific is experiencing rapid growth in its cities. Since 1990, the region\u2019s urban population has increased by more than 754 million \u2013 and the proportion of people living in urban areas is likely to grow \u2013 from 42 per cent in 2010, to 53 per cent by 2030, and to 63 per cent by 2050 when the urban population could be 3.3 billion.35 Prior to the 1990s, more than 60 per cent of population growth in urban areas was the result of internal migration. This proportion is likely to have increased further. Over the period 1990-2015, the number of Asian cities with 1 million or more people is likely to increase from 118 to 272, while the number of mega-cities, with more than 10 million people is expected to increase from 12 to 16. Seven of the world\u2019s most populous cities are in Asia: Tokyo, Delhi, Mumbai, Shanghai, Kolkata, Dhaka and Karachi.36 The unplanned and rapid urbanization is mostly due to urban-biased development driven by globalization, which is linking cities, in particular those in coastal areas, to the metropolitan centres. Increasingly, industrial activities are concentrated in areas from which it is easier to ship products for export. Urban bias is also manifested in the decline in investment in agriculture and rural activities and the consequent lack of opportunities in rural areas. Pressure on the environment Economic growth, driven by industry and manufacturing, has largely relied on the extraction of natural resources, particularly for energy. Indeed, compared with other global regions, growth in Asia and the Pacific is becoming more resource intensive. In 2008, compared with the world as a whole, the region used almost three times as much in terms of resources to produce one unit of GDP.37 As many as 1.7 billion people in Asia and the Pacific rely on solid fuels. Moreover, the demand for energy will continue to grow. While global demand is projected to increase by 1.5 per cent annually, between 2005 and 2030, growth rates in Asia and the Pacific are likely to be much higher, at 2.4 per cent per year.38 In the Pacific, more than 70 per cent of the population still lack access to on-grid electricity. Between 1990 and 2008, total CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion in transportation rose by 161 per cent in Asia, compared with the world average of 44 per cent.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "37ea716a-0f45-4f94-a614-c2093f1b02a7": {"__data__": {"id_": "37ea716a-0f45-4f94-a614-c2093f1b02a7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2012/2013", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3315296d17da57d0c0d7ebf96eeaa41bd30269713cee90728befeb98e9dba051"}, "2": {"node_id": "1e1e9f73-e8cd-44c9-a776-a2d83bedfb8d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "92756d1c6edda3a40787a71e94fc9b938dd275a81d48e65bb3749ab4d07bc609"}}, "hash": "0bc66aa67c45b139b0a29f1cd7b1da4f9ae104b4c7ecb95d290f9bae33f03489", "text": "Current and predicted consumption and production patterns are increasingly unsustainable and are taking a severe toll on the environment, posing a real threat to the planet \u2013 with heightened levels of air and water pollution.

They are often directly exposed to this pollution: they live in precarious housing, in environmentally degraded areas, and are unable to protect themselves against the health and socio-economic consequences. Countries in Asia and the Pacific are becoming increasingly concerned about environmental limits. Many vital ecosystem goods and services continue to decline, due to poor natural resource management decisions and increased per capita consumption alongside deprivations amongst the poor. However, this is an issue that also has to be addressed at regional and global levels, or the problems may simply be shifted from one country to another. For example, China has improved forest cover through stringent regulations, but is now importing more wood, suggesting greater pressure on forests elsewhere. Water supply issues are also becoming more complex. These have to be addressed through water sharing at different levels \u2013 sub-nationally within countries, or intra-regionally between river systems such as the Ganga-Brahmaputra or the Mekong. CHAPTER II: Unfinished agenda and emerging issues 38 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 Exposure to disasters The Asia-Pacific region faces increasing disaster risks. For example, between 1970 and 2010, the average number of people exposed to yearly flooding in Asia and the Pacific increased from 30 million to 64 million, and the population living in cyclone-prone areas grew from 72 million to 121 million.40 Over the same period, 75 per cent of global disaster deaths were in Asia and the Pacific. Risk exposure of vulnerable groups needs to be reduced. Moreover, disasters often lead to development reversals. Therefore, to sustain positive human development outcomes, investments in disaster risk reduction will be necessary. There are also huge economic costs (Figure II-8). In 2011 alone, more than 80 per cent of global losses due to disasters were in the Asia-Pacific region \u2013 $294 billion \u2013 as a result of the Japan earthquake and tsunami and the South-East Asia floods. The subregions that suffered most in 2011 were East and North-East Asia which had 77 per cent of the overall economic losses, followed by South-East Asia (14 per cent), and the Pacific (6.7 per cent). In Thailand, the 2011 floods were estimated to have cost $45 billion, and recovery and reconstruction cost $25 billion,41 while in the last quarter of 2011 Thailand\u2019s GDP was 9 per cent lower than in the previous year.42 The overall scale of the risk has been assessed in the World Risk Report 2012.43 The report considers a wide range of factors. It looks at exposure to natural hazards, and susceptibility in relation to infrastructure, nutrition, housing and economic conditions. It also considers coping capacity and early-warning systems, and medical services \u2013 as well as adaptation capacity in relation to future natural events and climate change. On this basis, of the 15 countries at greatest risk, nine are in Asia and the Pacific.

Tasks for the coming decades This chapter has highlighted the shortfalls that are likely to remain in the region even after the 2015 MDG finishing line has been passed. It has also pointed to emerging issues that are assuming ever greater prominence in Asia and the Pacific. How can these best be addressed? The next chapter considers the Asia-Pacific experience with the MDGs and what this implies for a successor framework. CHAPTER III: The MDG experience 41 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 T he MDGs have become the overarching political framework for international development \u2013 firmly establishing that the core of the global development agenda is human well-being.1 They had their genesis in the 1990s \u2013 a decade that saw the rise of \u2018human development\u2019 and a new consensus around the aim of eliminating poverty and building human capabilities.2 This was also a decade punctuated by a series of landmark United Nations conferences on a wide range of subjects \u2013 including children, education, food security, women, sustainable development and population.3 This process culminated in September 2000 when the General Assembly of the United Nations unanimously adopted the Millennium Declaration. Building on the commitments made at earlier conferences, the Declaration identified a series of key development targets. In 2001, the MDGs were officially specified in the form of an annex in the follow-up report of the first Millennium Summit. This established eight goals and 18 time-bound targets along with 48 indicators to monitor results. The MDGs were to prove remarkably effective at galvanizing widespread international support across the entire spectrum of stakeholders. Like the UNDP human development index, the MDGs caught the popular imagination, with", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "df514e7b-cbe3-4f4b-aee2-f82f479e6d71": {"__data__": {"id_": "df514e7b-cbe3-4f4b-aee2-f82f479e6d71", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2012/2013", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "53de07ddd2287bcc11f6fad6852d53331a7235176b1831e80c65acdc3f8d0834"}}, "hash": "53de07ddd2287bcc11f6fad6852d53331a7235176b1831e80c65acdc3f8d0834", "text": "their engaging simplicity, quantitative targets, comprehensible objectives, and laudable intentions with which no one could disagree.4 CHAPTER III The MDG experience The MDGs have helped rally political support for global efforts to reduce poverty and achieve human development. Now the 2015 MDG finishing line is close, and the global community is asking \u2018what next?\u2019 Drawing from more than a decade of MDG experience, this chapter offers perspectives from Asia and the Pacific to guide the design of a successor development framework. Working within limitations Inevitably, the MDGs had their limitations: in order to build the broadest consensus possible, they did not respond to all the development issues and omitted some important agreements made in international conferences. They also focused on the symptoms of poverty rather than on the root causes5 and there were few prescriptions on how the goals would be achieved. Some of these were addressed much later. For example, the MDG Acceleration Framework (MAF), which was developed in 2010, offers a systematic way for countries to identify bottlenecks that constrain progress in lagging MDGs and to prioritize solutions. The political process involved in the formulation of the MDGs has not been considered inclusive and participatory. Since their introduction, the MDGs have been perceived as the expression of a top-down, North- centred approach to development managed mainly by the UN Secretariat and the big multilateral players, rather than a genuine reflection of the aspiration of developing countries. This initially raised doubts about the extent to which governments would take national ownership of the goals. However, anchored as they are on the principles of the Millennium Declaration, the MDGs are the expression of a succession of intergovernmental processes and UN Summits held in the 1990s on various development issues. Moreover, the Millennium Declaration was adopted by 189 Member CHAPTER III: The MDG experience 42 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 Nations and countries in Asia and the Pacific have, by and large, internalised, customised and adapted them to suit national development requirements. The genesis of the MDGs did not see a high level of involvement from civil society organizations, NGOs or other stakeholders. The final listing of the MDGs, and in several cases their articulation, was perceived to be not informed by public debate.6 Notwithstanding this criticism, the MDGs were ultimately the expression of inter-governmental \u2013 and therefore consultative, though not inclusive \u2013 processes. There were also some concerns about the targets. These were taken verbatim from the Declaration, and the selection was mainly based on the availability of \u2018agreed indicators\u2019 and \u2018robust data\u2019.7 Targets and outcomes were specified in many different ways, and could be difficult to monitor: some were set out in proportional terms, others in terms of completion and others as statements of intent (Box III-1). These critiques, and the ways in which countries have responded in aligning the MDGs with national priorities, can offer important insights, and some would argue that given these weaknesses of the framework, and the likelihood that some goals and targets will be missed, the MDGs should be allowed to expire. A more constructive approach, however, is to reconsider the strengths and weaknesses of the framework so as to fine-tune the goals and deploy their full potential. Global and country goals The original intention was that the goals should be collective targets for the world as a whole. They were, after all, derived from global data \u2013 by extrapolating global trends in the previous quarter century and assuming that in the subsequent 25 years the same trends would continue. On this interpretation, they did not have to be reached by every country \u2013 except for the 100 per cent completion rate for primary school education, and access to reproductive health, which could only be met globally if they were achieved by every country. The UN Millennium Project took the alternative view that every country should adopt every goal and target. It pointed out that achieving a goal at the global level could be misleading. The world as a whole might achieve the global target on a particular indicator, even if many individual countries, especially the least developed, made unsatisfactory progress. To some extent, the same is true at the regional level: the achievement in Asia and the Pacific is driven by China and India, the two most populous countries in the region. Applying the same goals to every country sets quite ambitious objectives for the LDCs \u2013 though they should in principle be able to achieve these given sufficient international support. At the same time, uniform country-level goals can motivate politicians through international rivalry.

The LDCs may not really commit to what they see as distant objectives set externally \u2013 while the more developed countries might consider a universal target to present too limited a challenge. Box III-1 \u2212 Different types of MDG targets MDG targets are specified in three main ways: 1. Proportional terms \u2013 For example, reducing the proportion of people who live in poverty or hunger by one-half; reducing child mortality rates by two-thirds; reducing maternal mortality rates by three-quarters; or reducing the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation facilities by one-half. Targets requiring a proportionate reduction imply that progress is linear, while it is not. As progress towards targets set out in proportional terms very much depends on the starting position of reporting countries; targets may be too high for some and too low for others. 2. Completion \u2013 Those set in terms of completion include: universal primary education; gender equality in school education; productive employment with decent work for all; and universal access to reproductive health. The problem with targets set out in terms of completion is that it is difficult to differentiate between countries that have achieved little from those that have made substantial progress. 3. Statements of intent \u2013 Examples of objectives set as general statements of intent include reducing loss in bio-diversity or improving the lives of slum-dwellers. These mean different things to different countries and are exceedingly difficult to monitor. CHAPTER III: The MDG experience 43 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 The alternative is that all countries could be inspired by global targets to strive for accelerated human development, but they might do this best by reshaping the goals and the targets according to their own circumstances. From this point of view, the relationship between the global and the local should be seen less in terms of adoption and more in terms of adaptation.9 The MDGs and human rights The Millennium Development Goals Report 2010 characterizes many MDGs as human needs and basic rights. But the MDG framework does not explicitly articulate the \u2018rights-based\u2019 approach to development. It stresses accountability but does not associate this with human rights.10 The Millennium Declaration nevertheless evokes the human rights normative framework, and this and the human development framework can be seen as complementary and mutually reinforcing.11 There are indeed differences in emphasis between the MDGs and the human rights approach.12 The human rights framework sees people as \u2018rights-holders\u2019 who can demand the realization of their rights, pointing to the duties and obligations of States defined in international law. The MDGs instead refer to people as \u2018stakeholders\u2019; and they consider states and various agencies to be the \u2018owners\u2019 of socio-economic objectives. There are also differences in scope. The human rights approach implies identifying the structural, political and social root causes of multi-dimensional poverty.13 This has advocacy value and can encourage participation and motivate social and political change, but it may not achieve commensurate operational influence. The MDGs, on the other hand can be seen as less ambitious \u2013 promoting \u2018quick-win\u2019 solutions that merely alleviate the symptoms of poverty. A strict rights-based approach would, for example, reject the target of halving poverty on the grounds that this would effectively discriminate against those who remained poor. Means and ends Since there was no international agreement on the means required to achieve the goals, the MDGs did not specify strategies. Nor did the MDG narrative say much about how the goals were to be achieved \u2013 about the kind of development model that would drive the results. To a large extent this was deliberate. The MDGs aimed to build the broadest possible consensus around a common and uncontroversial agenda in which the ultimate end of development was poverty reduction. In some countries, this vacuum was taken up by one- size-fits-all policy prescriptions that promoted wide- ranging deregulation and liberalization. In others, space remained to follow development models inspired by successful countries such as the \u2018Asian tigers\u2019 usually based on developmental plans. By and large, these plans had two main components: growth policies and social policies \u2013 both of which involved state intervention.14 Starting from very low bases, many of the region\u2019s economies achieved very rapid growth with deep structural changes \u2013 assembling a critical mass of internal and external resources and using these to promote human development.

As the analysis in Chapter I of this report indicates, it is impossible to prove conclusively that the MDGs, on their own, stimulated progress. In any case, it may be too soon to judge. Barely 10 years have passed since the adoption of the Goals. It took some time for the MDGs to be popularised, accepted, and finally adapted by countries. Only in 2005/6 was there a concerted push to integrate the MDGs into national planning frameworks; for all intents and purposes the operationalization of the MDGs is a very young enterprise. Moreover, enormous changes and challenges have unfolded in the international environment since the MDGs\u2019 inception so it may be difficult to assess the parameters against which the MDG framework and the goals should be assessed. How the MDGs have shaped policies One criterion for success would be the extent to which the MDGs have shaped national policies. By this measure they have clearly had an impact. In the Asia- Pacific region there are examples of how the MDGs have helped set local priorities, shape national budgets, and ring-fence social expenditure during times of austerity. A UNDP study found, for example, that the MDGs were influencing the national processes and the institutional frameworks in nine Asia-Pacific countries \u2013 which had developed supporting programmes and policies (Box III-2). It is also impressive that many countries in the region have adapted or added to the goals to meet their specific needs. Afghanistan, for example, has identified an additional goal on security and Lao PDR has added a goal on unexploded ordnances (UXOs). Armenia, Cambodia, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have modified CHAPTER III: The MDG experience 44 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 MDG 2 on education to include eight or nine years\u2019 schooling for all children. Other governments have also modified the goals to cover gender issues more effectively. The MDGs do not address violence against women but some countries use indicators such as the prevalence of domestic violence and trafficking of women and girls. Viet Nam, for example, has added \u2018Reduce vulnerability of women to domestic violence\u2019 under MDG 3, as well as a complementary target and indicators for land ownership and housing titles by women.15 Lao PDR has emphasized women\u2019s participation in the informal sector in building small businesses and in trading. Bangladesh, Viet Nam and Thailand have set new targets and indicators for promoting women in local government bodies. The Philippines, Thailand and other countries have monitored the proportions of women judges, ministers, governors, police, and other traditionally male-dominated roles. In the area of maternal health, Viet Nam has formulated a complementary target for MDG 5. Similarly, Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Mongolia, and the Philippines have set separate goals and targets on access to reproductive health services. Bangladesh and Malaysia use coverage of emergency obstetric care as a complementary indicator.

It has also added a Goal 9, on demining, unexploded ordnance and victim assistance \u2013 and added a target on violence against women. \u2022 Indonesia \u2013 Its Equitable Development Programme provides guidance for the implementation of the MDGs. Amongst other things, it also requires the allocation of funds at national and sub- national levels aimed at supporting MDG-related programmes.16 \u2022 Mongolia \u2013 The country has added a goal on good governance and fighting corruption, and for MDG 6 has added other infectious diseases. \u2022 Viet Nam \u2013 Viet Nam has used the MDGs as the basis for its own Viet Nam Development Goals (Box III-3). Thailand\u2019s case demonstrates the capacity of the MDGs of furthering the ambitions in an upper middle- income country, which in the early 2000s had already achieved many of the Goals. Based on this achievement Thailand developed an \u2018MDG-plus\u2019 model aimed at transforming the MDGs into a \u2018floor instead of a ceiling\u2019 for human development (Box III-4).17 Malaysia is equally committed to building on the MDGs. The institutional tool identified for the realization of its \u2018MDG Plus\u2019 model is the Tenth Malaysian Plan (2011-2015), which envisages an allocation of 30 per cent of the five-year development expenditures to the social sector. The MDG-Plus goal on infectious disease, for example, aims for the total eradication of malaria by 2020.18 Box III-3 \u2212 The Viet Nam Development Goals What have come to be known as the Viet Nam Development Goals (VDGs), finalized in 2002, emerged from the preparation of the country\u2019s Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy. The strategy focused on combining fast growth with poverty reduction \u2013 considered in itself a driver of growth \u2013 and hunger eradication. It also emphasized social equality, with special reference to the uneven distribution of wealth by region and social group. Some of the VDGs linked directly to the MDGs, although targets and indicators were adjusted to the national priorities \u2013 for example for Goal 1 raising the bar, or for Goal 2 focussing on the quality of education instead of access. Others did not link directly to the MDGs, but were the expression of traditionally relevant development issues. They were also equally aimed at contributing to poverty reduction and human well-being. One assessment concluded that the MDGs acted as a motivator in four ways: 1. The goals and their accompanying targets and indicators provided a useful format for structuring goals and targets in all the sectors covered by the VDGs. 2. The substantial international literature and analysis in the MDGs allowed the analytical work on goal- setting to be more rooted in international comparisons and experience. 3. The process of identifying and setting goals and linking them to international commitments generated a considerable amount of debate, and highlighted some of the linkages between the goals and important cross-cutting themes. 4. The neutrality of the MDGs which were not the product of any one agency made them a powerful instrument for mobilising international donors and NGOs and, by extension, their partners in the government agencies and civil society groups.

CHAPTER III: The MDG experience 46 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 MDG acceleration frameworks In addition, 15 countries across the region are implementing \u2018MDG Acceleration Frameworks\u2019 (MAFs). This methodology helps countries identify underlying bottlenecks and sharpen strategies for stepping up progress on off-track targets. Tajikistan, for example, identified lack of access to energy as a barrier to achievement of the goals on poverty, child and maternal health, and education, and applied the MAF to unlock bottlenecks to the achievement of lagging targets.

For example, ASEAN has an MDG roadmap, while SAARC has developed its own SAARC Development Goals growing out of the MDGs (Box III-5). The Pacific too has embraced the MDGs \u2013 and widened the scope of Goal 1 to address the specific nature of poverty in that subregion. In addition, the MDGs have served as a focus for parliamentarians (Box III-6) and youth (Box III-7). Engaging civil society While civil society organizations were not directly involved in the formulation of the MDGs, the goals have subsequently opened a huge space for them. In Bangladesh, India and the Philippines, for example, grassroots organizations, think tanks and NGOs have used the goals to further push their respective agendas, whether on gender equality, health, education, human rights, or other issues. Such organizations have often served a valuable function in showing how the MDG achievement within countries has been very uneven \u2013 much lower in poor regions and for disadvantaged or excluded groups such as ethnic minorities. In the Philippines, Social Watch produced \u2018The Other MDG Report 2010\u2019. This assessed the country\u2019s situation against the picture proposed by the \u2018Philippines Fourth Progress Report on Millennium Development Goals\u2019.19 Another important political process in the Philippines stimulated by the MDGs is the Alternative Budget Initiative.20 Moreover, Galing Pook, a Philippines NGO, has been supporting a successful national competition, recognizing local governments that demonstrate positive innovative approaches towards achieving the MDGs.21 In a number of other countries, as in India and Bangladesh, civil society organizations have also produced shadow MDG reports.22 Box III-4 \u2212 Thailand\u2019s MDG-Plus model An important example of adjusting MDG targets is Thailand\u2019s MDG-Plus model which sets more ambitious objectives. The aim was to transform the MDGs into a \u2018floor instead of a ceiling for human development\u2019. Raising the country\u2019s ambitions stimulated partnerships at the national and international levels. Income poverty, for example, is to be reduced to 4 per cent of the population and the goal of universal education has been extended from primary to secondary education. More specific targets have been set for women \u2013 such as doubling the proportion of women in the national parliament, in administrative organizations and in civil service executive positions by 2006. There are also specific targets for the more marginalized regions \u2212 reducing by half the under-five mortality rate in highland areas, in selected northern provinces and in the three southernmost provinces. The MDG-Plus model also improved data availability; and helped mobilize institutions, non-governmental actors, civil society, media, and international partners. Although many MDG-Plus targets have proven very demanding, they still remain high on the government agenda. Sources: 1.

A survey of 104 representatives from civil society organizations in 27 developing countries, found that most respondents thought the MDGs were a \u2018good thing\u2019 and agreed that human development had become a higher priority because of the MDGs. A majority also concluded that the MDGs were useful tools for non-governmental organizations in terms of lobbying, monitoring, fundraising and project design.23 Monitoring of progress and revealing data gaps One of the greatest legacies of the MDGs will be the improved quality, collection and dissemination of development data, especially social data.24 The MDGs provided a relatively simple monitoring framework and in the Asia-Pacific region almost all countries prepare national MDG reports. Nevertheless, as mentioned in Chapter 1, there are still many data gaps. Subregional consultations for this report have emphasized the importance of strengthening statistical systems and identified the need for support from development partners. For monitoring purposes, any future framework would need to eliminate indicators for which the variable is not appropriate or the quality of data is poor, and add indicators that pick up elements of inequality and discrimination.25 Overall, however, it should maintain the virtue of simplicity and take into consideration national statistical capacities. CHAPTER III: The MDG experience 48 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 Box III-6 \u2013 The Manila Declaration Box III-7 \u2013 A North-East Asian Youth Vision In November 2012 on the occasion of the high-level regional parliamentarian and CSO forum on MDGs acceleration and the post-2015 development agenda, held in Manila, 26 members of parliament and 32 civil society leaders from 13 countries from South-East, East, North-East Asia and the Pacific adopted the Manila Declaration by Parliamentarians and Civil Society on the MDG Acceleration and the Post 2015 Development Agenda. The main objectives identified by the parties of the Declaration were: 1 To accelerate efforts to deal with the uneven achievements of the MDGs. 2. To better focus on the role played by parliaments and CSOs for accelerating progress towards the MDGs and securing the centrality of poverty and marginalization issues in the new development agenda. 3. To draw lessons from the MDGs experience and other international agendas on issues such as gender equality, seen as fundamental not only for the equality pillar but also for the pillars on human rights, democratic governance and sustainability. From 7-9 January 2013 the North-East Asian Youth Conference: \u2018The World We Want\u2019 was held at Korea University in Seoul, Republic of Korea, organized by the UNDP Seoul Policy Centre, the UN Global Compact Korea Network, UNESCAP\u2019s Sub-Regional Office for East and North-East Asia and Korea University. The objective was to forge a consensus on the Youth vision for a better future. Youth from China, Japan, Republic of Korea and Mongolia participated in the conference. The youth found that the MDGs were still relevant, especially as a means of keeping governments accountable and also as guiding framework for national development. However, they stressed that the goals must evolve to reflect the key challenges faced today. According to the youth the key issues presently shaping the world are: \u2022 Youth Unemployment: there is a dire need to provide young people with productive and decent employment that allows for social mobility. \u2022 Lack of Quality Education: access to not only education, but to quality education is an imperative for a future development agenda. \u2022 Social and Economic Inequalities: inequalities in all forms should be tackled through social policy. Also, exclusion in the form of discrimination, including gender-based, should be tackled in all its forms. \u2022 Sustainable and Inclusive Development: better coordination is needed across and within countries to address the issue of climate change and pursue a more inclusive and sustainable development path. The youth from these four countries called upon the UN, Governments, NGOs, INGOs, and the private sector to: \u2022 Work towards building a future that is peaceful and prosperous by ensuring good governance, increased civil society participation, respecting human rights and diversity, and promoting greater cooperation between different social groups. \u2022 Sustain human development as an imperative through forms of social protection, employment generation, protecting the environment, building resilience to natural disasters, provision of high quality education, improved forms of governance and accountability.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b2b96762-47b6-4727-be3e-1b684713df73": {"__data__": {"id_": "b2b96762-47b6-4727-be3e-1b684713df73", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2012/2013", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6aebdff951ed53d161f5a21842449e5e826e6e8d73697105ccda8fb2a2b0fee9"}, "2": {"node_id": "57ef5b1e-2e49-4d1f-99b4-526efe3fa53a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "581a271bbc3f6ce3627e3cd91e41c4d9c64d94db641aa744d66ee7f30639217b"}}, "hash": "ee69631fc177c5653c6f77af8227cf99ea3b43f01cc63ecd01eea6d9b537aad7", "text": "\u2022 Promote a more inclusive form of economic growth by investing more in developing rural areas, and ensuring smooth technology transfer and better terms of trade for developing countries.

This simplicity must be balanced with the accelerating complexity of an interlinked world. Decades of MDG experience have contributed to a wide body of knowledge at the country and regional levels \u2013 whether by governments, civil society or international organizations. The need for integrated policies The existing MDGs were articulated goal by goal. Each addressed one aspect of poverty, and had its own cluster of experts, institutions and donors. This had the advantage of clarity but it encouraged a fragmented approach to public policy and planning. A post-2015 development framework should recognize that the goals are multidimensional, multi-sectoral and interdependent \u2013 allowing for coordinated action on several fronts to achieve sustainable human development. The reality is that progress towards any one goal is dependent on progress towards others; they are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. There are, for example, strong links between education \u2013 particularly of women \u2013 and better health outcomes. Better educated women are likely to marry later and have greater access to health and ante-natal care, and skilled attendance during delivery. Likewise, healthier and better nourished workers will be more productive and better able to escape poverty. The need for more ambitious gender goals While many Asia-Pacific countries have made tremendous progress in fostering gender equality in education, by and large, the MDGs have not delivered on gender. The region as a whole, still allows some of the worse forms of gender discrimination, including sex-selective abortions and infanticide. Many countries offer little legal protection against gender- based violence.26 Widespread discrimination restricts women\u2019s access to economic opportunities and political participation. The MDG focus on gender is largely limited to Goal 3 \u2013 eliminating gender disparities in education \u2013 and Goal 5 on improving maternal health; it includes (a) reducing maternal mortality and (b) achieving universal access to reproductive health. The MDGs failed to embed and articulate more explicitly some of the most important achievements of the \u2018Fourth United Nations Development Decade\u2019, and particularly the critical gains made in Beijing,27 Cairo28 and other UN conferences.29 One of the most contentious omissions is the overall Cairo goal on universal access to sexual and reproductive health, which was later added as target b of Goal 5, but without any benchmarks \u2013 which has reduced government accountability. Also, the broad range of women\u2019s human rights, and key issues such as violence, labour, reproductive rights, socio-cultural factors and women\u2019s unpaid labour30 were not included. Moreover, critics of the MDGs argue that they do not build on the human rights normative framework of the Millennium Declaration, which includes the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Nevertheless, the MDGs have widened the space for debate for women\u2019s and civil society movements. Indeed, the limitations of the MDGs have stimulated the women\u2019s movement to engage with the MDGs. Civil society organizations the world over have been using the MDGs to continue advancing women\u2019s broader social justice agenda. Progress on gender equality cannot be based exclusively on gender-related goals. Rather, gender priorities need to be incorporated into each goal. To some extent, this has already been happening: gender- related targets and indicators have been included in national MDG frameworks. Viet Nam, for example, has a complementary target and indicators for land ownership and housing title by women. Bangladesh, Viet Nam and Thailand have set a new target and indicators for promoting women in local government bodies. The Philippines, Thailand and other countries have indicators for monitoring the proportion of women judges, ministers, governors, police, and other traditionally male-dominated roles. Lao PDR has put emphasis on women\u2019s participation in the informal sector in building small businesses and trading.31 In the area of maternal health, Viet Nam has formulated a complementary target for MDG 5. Similarly, Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Mongolia, and the Philippines have set separate goals and targets on access to reproductive health services. Bangladesh and Malaysia use coverage of emergency obstetric care as a complementary indicator.32 Some countries have also used indicators such as the prevalence of domestic violence and the trafficking of women and girls. The MDG\u2019s successor framework will need to be grounded in international treaties and previous CHAPTER III: The MDG experience 50 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 inter-governmental commitments.33 The United Nations Secretary-General\u2019s report on the Road Map towards the implementation of the United Nations Millennium Declaration recognizes that the MDGs do not supersede the Cairo and Beijing commitments which remain valid.34 The need to address emerging environmental issues were largely addressed in Goal 7 which helped countries track a number of important issues related to overall", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "92682f16-0aaf-49c9-8cbb-73ebf19b1e15": {"__data__": {"id_": "92682f16-0aaf-49c9-8cbb-73ebf19b1e15", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2012/2013", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "09757b63d5aedb9859e4c5103885a0d72b9e042391b72db29b9ef231c8fca120"}, "3": {"node_id": "19a1f851-994e-41f9-bca5-1b30388242fe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f36ec60bfbc4de92f44cacb9f2080155831f3932c902c754c6f2e46542464792"}}, "hash": "e59e008d5248f90eadb6b0a643922ac64f00e56f575eeafeaf28d352727821fe", "text": "environmental health. These included CO2 emissions, consumption of ozone-depleting substances, forest cover, protected areas, and access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities. In this case, there has been significant adaptation. Countries in the region responded with new targets and indicators according to national priorities and needs \u2013 though in some cases this led to lower levels of ambition. The targets that have been most subject to adaptation have been those on water and sanitation (Nepal), and forest cover (Bhutan, Cambodia, Timor- Leste, Myanmar, and Pakistan). Some governments have adapted the goals on protected areas by monitoring the proportion of fishing lots released to local fishers as well as the number of community-based fisheries and the number of fish sanctuaries (Cambodia), the extent of biodiversity in wetlands (Nepal), the acreage of protected wet-zone forests (Sri Lanka), and the number of endangered species (Viet Nam). The MDG environmental targets are, to some extent, considered in isolation, and do not, for example, address the environment-poverty nexus. Nevertheless, individual countries have done so by introducing new targets and indicators (Box III-8). In their national MDG reports Cambodia and the Philippines, for example, have assessed the impact of natural hazards on poverty; while Cambodia and Viet Nam have reported on the links between access to land, food security, income generation and gender equality. Nor do the MDG 7 targets reflect vulnerability and exposure to disasters. For Asia and the Pacific this is a major omission. People in this region are four times more likely to be affected by natural disasters than those living in Africa, and 25 times more likely than those in Europe or North America.35 As a result, in their MDG reports, some countries in Asia and the Pacific are reporting on the impacts of natural hazards on other development outcomes. While one of the MDG 7 indicators is on CO2 emissions in total, per capita and per $1 GDP levels, the MDGs did not put a major emphasis on climate change. For Asia and the Pacific this is a major issue \u2013 with so many people living in exposed coastal regions, on river banks, in uplands and remote locations.36 Many of the megacities in Asia and the Pacific are in low-elevation coastal zones including Dhaka, Karachi, Manila, Mumbai, Shanghai and Jakarta. Mountain dwellers, islanders, delta communities, and urban slum dwellers are particularly vulnerable. The need for renewed partnerships for development cooperation MDG 8 was conceived as the cornerstone of the MDGs. It envisaged a global partnership for development anchored in official development assistance (ODA), free and fair, non-discriminatory trade, a reduction of external debt, and enhanced access to essential medicines and technology. The overall objective was to build conducive conditions of international governance, generate adequate resources, and create the opportunities, capacities and skills for countries to deliver on the first seven MDGs. However, Goal 8 had several limitations: it was weakly formulated, hard to track and was only partially monitored \u2013 and did not address structural constraints to development transformation. Unlike the other MDGs, MDG 8 was not defined or anchored in quantitative targets and accountability mechanisms. For example, it advocated for an \u2018open, rule-based, predictable, non-discriminatory trading and financial system\u2019 but offered no clear guidance as to what this entailed in terms of targets and indicators, let alone implementation. In the Asia-Pacific region, the goal fell short of expectations. ODA in Asia and the Pacific remained below target and was skewed towards Afghanistan and Bangladesh; other LDCs received modest flows. The promise of greater global institutional coherence on aid, trade, finance, employment and environmental issues was barely realized. A new partnership for development will need to take into account the new environment for ODA. Core development aid has been falling while the international aid architecture is changing; emerging economies like China and India have entered the international cooperation arena. On the other hand, dependence on foreign aid is also lower; for many countries ODA as a percentage of total revenues is falling even faster than aid itself.37 As globalization deepens, a new framework will therefore need to reassess institutions of regional and global cooperation and governance to manage global public goods and respond to global development challenges.

Concomitantly, the Open Working Group, mandated by Member States to work on a set of Sustainable Development Goals, has commenced reviewing options for discussion at the General Assembly next year. Initial strokes on the post-2015 agenda are, therefore, already on the canvas. Building on its wealth of knowledge and unique experience on the MDGs, countries in Asia and the Pacific have engaged with the goals and targets and learned some of the most effective ways of achieving them. The next chapter will suggest how this experience can contribute to the design of a new framework. Box III-8 \u2013 Building on Goal 7 for environmental monitoring Across Asia and the Pacific, many countries have adapted Goal 7 and widened the scope of environmental monitoring. Thirty-one countries in Asia and the Pacific report on the proportion of land area covered by forest. But in addition Bangladesh, Indonesia, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka, and Thailand have indicators related to the acreage of mangrove and planted forest, Cambodia on the number of rangers in protected forest areas, and China and Viet Nam on investment in the environment. China has monitored the discharge of major pollutants; Timor-Leste has assessed the balance between the use of environmental resources for economic growth with conservation of resources. Pakistan has focused on the proportion of land area for conservation of wildlife, the number of vehicles that use natural gas, the level of sulphur content in diesel, as well as on improvement of energy efficiency. Mongolia, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, and Viet Nam have monitored the use of land for environmentally friendly technologies and implementing strategies for sustainable development. Sri Lanka has been reporting on clean waste management practices, Thailand on the use of renewable energy, and Viet Nam on the level of air and water pollution. Nine countries have reported on the use of fossil fuels while 21 have measured the proportion of the population using solid fuels. Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea and Sri Lanka are reporting on the use of less polluting sources of energy, such as natural gas and biomass. Thailand has developed renewable energy indicators. Malaysia, Thailand and Viet Nam are measuring the quality of water in rivers. Thirty-three Asia-Pacific countries report on access to water. In addition, Timor-Leste, Malaysia and Nepal assess the relationship between the number of deaths from water-borne and air-borne infections to water quality. Pakistan and the Philippines are measuring the percentage of water that is contaminated. Pakistan, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka measure the volume of solid waste that is generated. Cambodia, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, and Viet Nam have tailored the target on the allocation of land titles, while Bangladesh, Cambodia, Fiji, Indonesia, Myanmar, Pakistan, the Philippines and Sri Lanka have reported on the proportion of households with access to secure tenure. Sri Lanka monitors the levels of infant mortality and illiteracy in slum areas. CHAPTER III: The MDG experience 52 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 1 UNDP, 2010b. 2 Fukuda-Parr, 2012; Fukuda-Par and Hulme, 2011. 3 Hulme, 2007. 4 Nayyar, 2012. 5 Poverty is rooted on socio-economic inequalities and on the structural outcomes arising from specific patterns of growth production and distribution. 6 A case in point was the shift from the Copenhagen commitment to eradicate income poverty by 2015 to the target of halving poverty by that date (Saith, 2006). There was also enormous dissatisfaction with the initial exclusion from the Declaration and the Goals of reproductive health issues and with the extremely narrow articulation of the Goal 3 on gender. The International Conference on Population and Development, held in Cairo in 1994, and the Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing in 1995, \u201cwere assumed by many to have changed forever the terms of discussion of sustainable development\u201d. In those meetings, indeed, \u201ca large majority of nations agreed that without the most basic rights for women within the family and society \u2013 most of all the rights to decide, jointly or alone if necessary, on the number of children they were prepared to bear, or that their health could sustain \u2013 meaningful and rapid strides in public health, education, the protection of environment and economic development would lag at best and be impossible at worst\u201d (Barbara Crossette, 2005:71). Moreover, \u201cWhen the MDGs emerged from the UN Secretariat, women\u2019s groups were dismayed that gender equality as an issue in its own right was relegated to one quite limited Goal, and that the issue of reproductive health was not explicitly among the Goals\u201d (Carol Burton, 2012:25).

CHAPTER IV: Designing a new framework 53 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 A s the MDG target year of 2015 approaches, there has been considerable debate over what comes next. This debate is supported by the emphasis on sustainability as reflected in the Rio+20 outcome document, which is the basis for the discussion around the Sustainable Development Goals. The question is: should there be a new development framework similar to the MDGs and if so what form should it take? To gather perspectives from Asia and the Pacific on these issues, in 2012/13 the ESCAP/ADB/UNDP regional partnership on the MDGs held a series of subregional consultations (Box IV-1) among identified development experts and practitioners from the region.1 Those attending the workshops gave their expert views on what should be the main priorities for a new framework.

The My World responses from the Pacific, however, put greater emphasis on environmental issues compared to responses from Asia which prioritize education, healthcare and better job opportunities. It should be emphasized that these surveys present the views of individuals rather than those of governments. And the respondents cannot be considered representative since they were not selected based on random sampling. Nevertheless the opinions given in the capacity of respondents as experts and practitioners, as well as citizens participating in shaping the next global development agenda, do suggest significant priority areas for the region. Country group perspectives The subregional consultations concluded that the post- 2015 development agenda should drive transformative change \u2013 serving as an advocacy tool, a guide for national and global policies, and an instrument for policy coherence. The consultations also reflected the need to build on the region\u2019s experience of adapting goals, targets and indicators to national circumstances. There was broad consensus on the need to pursue economic prosperity, social equity and environmental responsibility for people-centred development. This CHAPTER IV: Designing a new framework 54 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 Box IV-1 \u2013 Subregional consultations on the way forward for the MDGs In preparation for this report there was a series of expert group meetings in 2012/13. These were held in Central Asia, South Asia, South-East Asia and the Pacific \u2013 supplemented with one meeting specifically for the LDCs and another for the LLDCs. These consultations, which were informed by think pieces from eminent experts, brought together stakeholders from government, civil society and United Nations agencies. During the subregional consultations, the MDG Partnership also conducted a survey \u2013 using a questionnaire to collect data from 169 respondents or participants. The survey was not based on a representative sample, but it does give some indication of the views of development practitioners across the region. Respondents were asked, for example, what should follow the MDGs. More than half favoured a new development framework, while around one-third wanted to retain the MDGs in a modified form. Far fewer wanted simply to keep the MDGs and extend the deadline. Participants were also asked how long the next process should be. Almost all preferred a time horizon of 10 to 15 years. The vast majority of respondents also agreed that the new framework should cover such issues as security, governance and effective institutions. But there was less agreement on how this should be done. Most people thought that these issues should be articulated in the framework as basic preconditions, while others thought there should also be specific associated targets and indicators. There has also been some debate in the region about the poverty goal. For the MDGs the target was poverty reduction \u2013 halving the proportion of the population in extreme poverty. A more ambitious goal would be poverty eradication. Around two-thirds of respondents said the aim should be to reduce poverty, but one-third believed the aim should be eradication. As for the level of income that would constitute extreme poverty, while many suggested keeping the existing rate of $1.25 per day, a majority thought the international poverty line should be raised to $2.00 per day. At the subregional consultations, there was a clear majority for the principle of global goals: around two- thirds thought the new development framework should be applicable to all countries; the rest preferred more customization by setting different goals at global and regional levels. However, the majority of participants also believed that the new development framework needs to have a special focus on LDCs, with additional goals or provisions.

CHAPTER IV: Designing a new framework 55 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 would mean a far greater emphasis on the quality of growth and its inclusiveness. It would also mean incorporating elements of social protection, including targeted social assistance for the poor. Overall, it would be important to support people-oriented governance at the local, regional and global levels. As illustrated in Table IV-2, low-income countries still emphasize basic services. These are even more relevant for the more disadvantaged groups across countries, while greater efficiencies in resource use and lifestyle changes are being increasingly recognized for the better off. Middle-income group \u2013 These countries prioritized eradicating pockets of poverty and reducing rural-urban disparities in access to services and opportunities. At the same time they wanted to address urban poverty and the growth of slums. They were also looking to create decent jobs, by improving the quality of education and linking this with labour market programmes. These countries appreciated the value of \u2018green growth\u2019 but said that this would require technology transfers from high-income countries. Low-income group \u2212 These countries argued that the post-2015 development framework should be based on the MDGs, but that it should have more \u2018teeth\u2019. The aim should be to increase access to high-quality basic services, decent jobs, shelter, water and sanitation, and to make rural infrastructure more resilient to climate change. They also put a strong focus on eradicating extreme poverty and on strengthening social protection to make the poor less vulnerable and to build resilience against crises. At the same time, they agreed on the need to make growth less resource intensive, in particular by applying new technologies and knowledge. Countries with special needs \u2212 Landlocked countries and small island states stressed the urgency of addressing climate change and ensuring the environmental aspect of sustainability in development. They also emphasized the importance of regional cooperation and regional agreements \u2013 arguing for greater acceptance of the quasi- binding character of existing agreements, especially on environmental protection. These countries were also concerned about the impact of climate change on their economies and the need to create more sustainable forms of employment. Guiding principles for a successor framework A successor framework should complete the unfinished agenda and aspirations of the MDGs but also tackle emerging issues not conceived of in the original framework. This report draws from the Asia-Pacific perspectives and suggests the following core principles: 1. Based on the three pillars of sustainable development One consistent theme in the consultations was that the new framework should bring together the three broad pillars of sustainable development \u2013 economic, social and environmental. At the same time, sustainability of development gains needs to be rooted in the human element, which means that the three pillars be considered in relation to people\u2019s lives, especially the poor. In particular, environmental considerations such as those expressed by the planetary boundaries, as well as economic considerations such as GDP growth, need to reflect what these mean for sustaining human development. For example, ensuring sustainable agriculture for food security, combating climate change in ways that prevent the erosion of people\u2019s habitats, and managing urbanization in ways that are sensitive to the living conditions of the disadvantaged. These pillars are mutually supporting as Table IV-3 illustrates. Sustained economic growth generates the resources for social investment, while social development builds the necessary human capabilities that will underpin economic growth.3 Improved living conditions for all Access to safe drinking water Access to electricity Efficiency improvement in use of water for agriculture Energy efficiency improvement in production and transportation Reduction of freshwater use in daily life (including reuse of grey water) Higher share of renewable energy use in daily life with lower energy use per head Illustrative Development Goals <<<< Low-income group \u2013 middle- to higher-income group >>>> Access to basic services Increase efficiency Lifestyle changes Table IV-2 \u2212 Priorities that differ according to income group CHAPTER IV: Designing a new framework 56 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 At the same time, environmental sustainability respects planetary boundaries within which economic growth and social prosperity have to occur, and ensures that development gains are not threatened. Nevertheless, in some cases there may be trade-offs to be considered, and difficult decisions depending on national priorities. A people-centred approach will also mean a greater emphasis on equity, social justice and human rights. Development is unsustainable if societies are not based on equality and justice, and if human rights are persistently violated. This was also one of the outcomes of the Rio+20 meeting, which", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5166607f-a9e3-4299-9051-affd7d867832": {"__data__": {"id_": "5166607f-a9e3-4299-9051-affd7d867832", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2012/2013", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "504c9eb10f9fdfe9bd81a50a4895dc61b1ab6c4b958c86a3c2256470786d260a"}}, "hash": "504c9eb10f9fdfe9bd81a50a4895dc61b1ab6c4b958c86a3c2256470786d260a", "text": "emphasized the integration between social, environmental and economic concerns \u2013 based on social justice, fairness and equity. 2. Underpinned by inclusive growth Countries addressing the three pillars of sustainable development will need to aim for sustained inclusive growth. Sustained economic growth is essential: it provides increased incomes that enable households to lift themselves out of poverty, and gain more access to education and health opportunities. It also provides governments with the resources to expand critical basic services, invest in social and economic infrastructure, and finance social protection. But sustained growth will only maximize social outcomes if it is inclusive. Growth is inclusive when all members of society contribute to and benefit from it \u2013 people have access to economic opportunities and the poorest and vulnerable are protected through social safety nets. It therefore needs to take place in the areas where the poor live and generate employment in the sectors in which they work \u2013 agriculture, services and manufacturing. It must also connect with the poor by using their factors of production and enable them to afford essential goods and services and minimize their vulnerability to shocks. Governments in Asia and the Pacific already recognize the value of \u2018inclusive growth\u2019 \u2013 though they may use different terminology (Box IV-2). China, for example, has focused on creating a \u2018harmonious society\u2019. Thailand has aimed for \u2018growth with equity\u2019, and Viet Nam has focused on \u2018quick and sustainable development\u2019. Also along these lines, Japan has proposed a conceptual framework for the post-2015 development agenda called \u2018Pact for Global Wellbeing\u2019 based on human security, prioritizing growth that is green, inclusive, shared and knowledge based. The post-2015 framework need not specify development strategies, but it could nevertheless provide some general principles, which can guide countries towards a more sustainable and inclusive growth path for human development. Key elements could include economic policies that broaden Economic pillar provides Social pillar provides Environment pillar provides Sustained economic growth Employment Aggregate demand Investments in human capacities Expands limits to growth Inclusive growth Secure, productive and decent jobs Fiscal space for social and rural infrastructure Social protection Access to basic services for all, social capital Better accountability and functioning institutions Balanced social-ecological systems Better food, water and air quality Better consumption among the poor Healthier societies Sustainable production Food, energy and water security Smaller ecological footprint of industries Sustainable consumption Changed attitudes Better environmental responsibility Responsibly managed natural resources and ecosystems Biodiversity Improved habitats Economic pillar Social pillar Environmental pillar Table IV-3 \u2013 Three mutually supporting pillars of sustainable development CHAPTER IV: Designing a new framework 57 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 opportunities for gainful employment and minimize economic fluctuations and insecurity. This will mean investing in skills through formal and informal education and providing services that meet the needs of the poor and the \u2018near poor\u2019, and pursuing consistently counter-cyclical policies. At the same time, the model must incorporate environmental concerns and account for climate change. The Asia-Pacific region has to protect its environmental assets, especially its critical ecosystems, but its people will also have to be more resilient to disasters. The region also needs to make progress towards more sustainable patterns of consumption and production \u2013 making more efficient use of natural resources and pursuing development within planetary boundaries. 3. Customized to national development needs One major issue is whether a new framework should set goals globally or establish a new set of goals at regional or country levels. The consensus in the region seemed to be that the new framework could build upon the experience on MDGs adaptation and customization that has already taken place. The new framework could specify overall shared global goals and targets while individual regions or countries could identify the most appropriate indicators to meet those goals. For example, if the goal is education for all then Afghanistan could identify literacy as one of the country goals, whereas Kazakhstan \u2013 where literacy is nearly 100 per cent \u2013 could focus on improving the quality of secondary education. The indicators could also focus on specific groups who are disadvantaged or vulnerable. The overall aim should be to retain the simplicity of clear goals while addressing specific risks and vulnerabilities. ADB\u2019s ZEN idea is one possible approach for framing the post-2015 development agenda.5 It provides a conceptual basis for eliminating the severest deprivations, supporting local customization happening on the ground in the region, and providing space for mutual accountability on global public goods such as natural resources. A targeting option, which might leverage the \u2018power of rivalry\u2019, is to include composite indices, such as the UNDP \u2018sustainable human development index\u2019.

The index could also incorporate planetary boundaries. This kind of index would enable the framework to combine indicators of both quantity and quality. Box IV-2 \u2212 Looking beyond economic growth The overarching objective need not be economic growth as \u2013 as already demonstrated in Bhutan and Thailand. \u2022 Bhutan \u2013 The country has incorporated, and to a large extent successfully implemented, the concept of \u2018happiness\u2019 as part of its development planning architecture. Gross National Happiness (GNH), a concept developed in the early 1970s by Bhutan\u2019s then King, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, attempts to balance economic and material advancement with spiritual and psychological contentment, striving towards balanced and sustainable development. The four pillars of GNH are: (i) sustainable and equitable economic growth and development, (ii) preservation and sustainable use of environment, (iii) preservation and promotion of cultural heritage, and (iv) good governance. GNH, as an operational concept, has gained some traction over the years and has become an important \u2018brand\u2019 of sustainable economic and social development, and was passed as a UN resolution, 65/309, \u2018Happiness: towards a holistic approach to development in 2011\u2019.4 \u2022 Thailand \u2013 In the aftermath of the Asian Financial Crisis, Thailand turned to the teachings of its King, His Majesty Bhumibol Adulyadej, and adopted a social and economic development approach based on \u2018sufficiency\u2019 principles that encourage and operationalize values such as cooperation, simplicity, self-reliance, and moderation. By underpinning development with such values the objective is to pursue sustainable and inclusive forms of development, thereby avoiding the pitfalls associated with globalization. These are just a couple of examples that illustrate how sustainability can be pursued in a modern economic set-up. What is worth noting is that the primary objective is not just economic growth; instead such approaches tend to promote more inclusive and broad-based forms of economic and social growth. CHAPTER IV: Designing a new framework 58 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 4. Embedded equity Development gains should not systematically bypass sections of the population, or widen or solidify disparities. The region must address social and economic development gaps \u2013 income and non-income \u2013 between rural and urban areas, between men and women and also between ethnic and minority groups. Policy makers will need to consider the various local, regional, and global transmission channels through which inequities are perpetuated and reinforced. This important principle should run through all goal areas. This principle can be operationalized by ensuring that indicators under the eventually-selected goals track not just aggregate or average progress but also progress at the lower end such as the bottom quartile. 5. Backed by identified sources of finance At a time of growing ambitions for a new development agenda, there is considerable pressure on financial resources. ODA will remain relevant and needed. However, with the likelihood of declining ODA, governments in Asia and the Pacific will need to mobilize more domestic fiscal revenue and seek additional funding from innovative sources. Some of this can come from philanthropy and private capital \u2013 from major pension funds, mutual funds, sovereign wealth funds, private corporations, development banks, and other investors from middle-income countries. At present much of this takes the form of small interventions, often of high quality but not integrated with national development efforts. Instead, they should be linked better with national programmes. More importantly, there has to be better regional and international cooperation to stop leakages of funds through transfer pricing and the use of tax havens. At the same time, governments will need to use public expenditure more effectively \u2013 targeting in particular health and education. Most participants at the four subregional consultations held that governments should set targets for their public expenditure allocation to the social sector. 6. Founded on partnerships While the goals are global, achieving them will require the combined efforts of national and international institutions. The primary responsibility rests at the country level, but in a globalized world each country also has to deal with many cross-border factors and spillovers. These international issues can be tackled only partially through national action. They require international solutions \u2013 through regional and global partnerships in which countries accept common goals but distinct responsibilities. This would mean a comprehensive assessment of global, regional and national institutions that manage public goods and influence cross-border impacts \u2013 reviewing institutional arrangements, and coordinating regulations so as to close loopholes. A number of these issues are currently addressed in Goal 8. Respondents at the regional consultations considered what should be included under an equivalent goal in a future framework.

An important element of this is development cooperation. This can come from traditional donors and the emerging southern countries that are becoming more active in regional cooperation structures. Indeed, aid itself is probably the least important instrument of south-south cooperation.6 Such support is of particular importance to the LDCs. But they would not be the only beneficiaries, since accelerated development in the LDCs would increase markets for regional goods and boost the region\u2019s overall competitiveness. In addition, regional cooperation should also embrace social concerns, including better surveillance and control of communicable diseases, as well as improved intra-regional flows of workers, and the exchange of ideas and technical knowledge. On the natural resources and environment side, major gains can be obtained through better sharing of water, marine and other scarce natural resources, controlling haze and dust storms, and preventing illegal logging and the trade in endangered species. Differentiated responsibility in accordance with respective capabilities as recognized in the Rio principles should also include reassessing patterns of consumption. The poor, who mostly live in developing countries, need to consume more to improve their living standards while the global middle classes and rich would need to make more efficient choices and change their patterns of consumption towards lower- carbon pathways.7 It should be clear who has responsibility for achieving specific aspects of the goals \u2013 at global, regional and national levels. At the global level the basis for a new approach could be the Global Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation. This was a key output from the High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness, held in Busan, Republic of Korea, at the end of 2011. The CHAPTER IV: Designing a new framework 59 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 Partnership, co-led by UNDP and the OECD/DAC, will include the developed and developing countries, the UN system, civil society organizations and the private sector. The Forum also adopted a new set of indicators to monitor progress towards commitments made in Busan. 7. Monitored with robust national statistical systems One of the greatest legacies of the MDGs will be the improved quality, collection and dissemination of social data.8 The MDGs have provided a relatively simple measurable framework, and have encouraged countries to produce national MDG reports to monitor and evaluate their performance. They are now in a stronger position to collect data, measure progress and design evidence-based policies and programmes. Even without stringent reporting requirements or sanctions, the MDG framework has promoted greater accountability, both between states and their citizens, and across countries. Nevertheless, there are still major data gaps. Many countries have weak statistical systems and a new framework is likely to put them under greater pressure. To address this issue, the new framework should itself incorporate measures of statistics delivery \u2013 setting targets for the development of new data sets \u2013 which requires more investment and greater capacities in statistical system. One major initiative in the region addresses strengthening civil registration and vital statistics; this is widely supported by development partners in the region. The effort could take advantage of advances in internet and mobile technology for new and interactive forms of data collection \u2013 which could significantly reduce transaction costs and increase efficiency. Goal areas for the next framework The post-2015 goals should set a transformative agenda for Asia and the Pacific. Based on the above core principles this report proposes the following goal areas: 1. Zero income poverty \u2013 Building on Asia-Pacific\u2019s remarkable achievements in poverty reduction, this goal area reflects the region\u2019s ambition to \u2018leave poverty behind\u2019 by, for the first time, setting a more ambitious goal of eradicating extreme poverty. This report advocates reducing to zero the number of people living in extreme poverty (on less than $1.25 per day) and reducing the number of people living on less than $2 per day to a negligible level. 2. Zero hunger and malnutrition \u2013 In support of universal food security this goal area involves ensuring more equal access, availability and utilization of food. It will require promoting accelerated investments in agricultural R&D, rural infrastructure, especially roads and irrigation, and improving market links for farmers. It would also mean dealing with the effects of climate change on agriculture and investing in essential mitigation and adaptation. Monitoring should include basic indicators of access to food, levels of child nutrition and hidden hunger as measured by consumption of micro-nutrients, with particular focus on the poorest. 3. Gender equality \u2013 Gender will have to be assessed more comprehensively with more indicators on empowerment and violence against women.

Decent jobs for everyone of working age \u2013 This goal area aims to ensure productive employment, including a focus on remunerative and decent work for youth. This will require policies that incentivize growth that is inclusive and employment rich, in both the formal and informal sectors. It also includes the promotion of an enabling environment for micro- and small enterprises to operate and grow. 5. Health for all \u2013 Priority should go to maternal, newborn and child health, universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reducing the prevalence of communicable diseases. Addressing challenges that persist will need to be combined with measures to address the rising levels of non-communicable diseases. This will involve strengthening health systems, health financing, investing in universal health coverage, family planning and emergency obstetric care, improving access to quality services through improved rural and urban infrastructure and addressing the social and environmental determinants of health. There is also a need to consider challenges beyond national borders to mitigate risks from emerging CHAPTER IV: Designing a new framework 60 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 and re-emerging diseases and their effects on highly mobile populations. 6. Improved living conditions with a focus on the poor \u2013 Promoting universal access to energy services, safe water and an emphasis on improved sanitation constitute this goal area without which everyday living conditions, health, and livelihood opportunities can be seriously compromised. This should cover rural as well as urban and urbanizing areas. Therefore, a new goal should include more ambitious targets of universal access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation and new targets for universal access to modern energy sources and for a growing share of renewables. 7. Quality education for all \u2013 This goal area concerns the right of all people to have access to quality education. It covers universal access to primary and secondary education as well as to technical and vocational education and training. Equally important are adult literacy and opportunities for life-long learning. Job-ready skills should be supported so that educated individuals can find remunerative work and do not waste their skills during a long search for gainful employment. Monitoring should ensure progress among the bottom half and disadvantaged groups. 8. Liveable cities \u2013 This goal area addresses the living conditions of urban populations, especially the poor and those with insecure tenure. It also addresses challenges that face the rich and the poor together - mobility, congestion, pollution and waste. It covers access to decent shelter, security of tenure, and access to affordable, safe and energy-efficient mass transport, as well as essential social infrastructure and services, including roads, electricity, telecommunications and waste management (Box IV-3). Under the new goal, cities should also offer services for transient populations. Given the high exposure of urban populations living in low elevation coastal zones, cities should also be prepared in advance for natural disasters through plans, advocacy and budgets. 9. Environmental responsibility and management of natural resources \u2013 This goal area responds to a clear recognition among countries that the pursuit of growth should not squander natural resources, eventually undermining the environment and growth itself. This means changing how goods and energy are produced, protecting critical ecosystems of national, regional and global significance while reducing resource intensity and over-exploitation of natural capital. At the same time, development Box IV-3 \u2212 Redefining development goals for the urban poor Developing countries and their partners need to re-examine tools and processes for establishing development goals and targets related to urban poverty and sustainable urban development. They also need more accurate monitoring in such areas as: \u2022 Habitat quality \u2013 Durable housing of a permanent nature that protects against heat and cold, and environmental shocks such as extreme climate conditions; \u2022 Habitat density \u2013 Sufficient living space available per person; and \u2022 Access to basic infrastructure: - Easy access to safe water in sufficient amounts at an affordable price. - Access to adequate sanitation in the form of a private or public toilet shared by a reasonable number of people. - Sustainable waste management systems for both organic and non-organic solid waste and wastewater. - Drainage and flood control systems which prioritize low-elevation coastal zones or vulnerable areas sensitive to surface run off. - Affordable electricity and other energy services, including the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "93fb5cfa-decc-462b-ad4a-c24b0cd19133": {"__data__": {"id_": "93fb5cfa-decc-462b-ad4a-c24b0cd19133", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2012/2013", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cc1741d2c7d4573177a27455de1fa44e7e736add5a660029120b42f80301c96d"}, "3": {"node_id": "58f7d09b-f910-428e-aad2-b9783d6e9549", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "492283e1af2735e6460b34fbebe11762b48328eccf2a35a9e63f9ce38b86a323"}}, "hash": "70e3b1b5e64b49642ec2286c650923770147d2db28b1d54f04f1466ea2b91c02", "text": "use of renewable energy sources and access to improved cooking stoves. - Security of tenure for both male- and female-headed households. - Safe, affordable and convenient transport and mobility options for women and girls to help prevent and address gender-based violence in cities.

This goal area should take further the existing targets like forest cover and protected areas, and cover issues of pollution and efficiency in resource use. 10. Disaster risk reduction \u2013 Our efforts for \u2018leaving poverty behind\u2019 should be irreversible. The region has witnessed natural disasters that have wiped out long-term development efforts. Considering the effectiveness of disaster risk reduction, any new development agenda should help mainstream disaster risk reduction in national budgets and development programmes. 11. Accountable and responsive governments \u2013 The call for more accountable, transparent and effective governments has emerged strongly from consultations in Asia and the Pacific. As a goal area, this should be monitored with specific targets and indicators \u2013 as is already happening in some countries of Asia. It covers accountable, transparent and corruption-free public institutions, across all levels from the national to the local. It aims for more capable and efficient management of public resources and delivery of public services. Moreover, governments need to harness capacities to ensure peace and security. Without trust in public institutions of governance, the compact between people and states is under threat. 12. Strong development partnerships \u2013 This goal area covers cross-border actions to complement national efforts for sustainable development in an increasingly interlinked world. Resources of development partnerships help translate the post- 2015 agenda from vision to action. Partnerships cover global and regional cooperation, including with the private sector, to drive and support development outcomes, and global and regional governance institutions to manage global public goods and public \u2018bads\u2019, particularly in the areas of international finance, health, trade, technology transfer, environment, and climate change. Access to traditional ODA should be supplemented by innovative finance. Framework scenarios The goal areas can be drawn into a coherent framework with an architecture based on the level of ambition that eventually gains consensus. The numerous discussions, not just on the principles and content of a post-2015 development agenda, but also on its architecture are gaining traction following the release of the report of the High Level Panel of Eminent Persons in May 2013, and as the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals intensifies its discussions. A number of options are being explored and assessed on the basis of their practicability, political viability, and level of ambition. In the Asia-Pacific region, there is enormous support for a relatively ambitious successor framework. The scenarios range from the least ambitious one of continuing with the current MDG framework with some adjustments, to the far more aspirational one that can motivate countries to end poverty, aim for shared prosperity, and safeguard planetary resources for current and future generations. The basic option of maintaining the MDGs with an extended deadline is still a possibility at the global level, but this is not ambitious enough for Asia and the Pacific. Some of the goals have already been met and much has changed since the MDGs were introduced. Several countries have customized the MDGs to suit local conditions through additional goals, targets and indicators. The region, along with the rest of the world, has also been changing at an unprecedented pace and with this come more complex development challenges as well as expectations, that the MDGs were not designed to address. While the unfinished MDG agenda cannot be dropped, these new challenges call for new solutions and a more ambitious framework. Keeping the guiding principles and goal areas that respond to the region\u2019s development challenges in mind, three optional scenarios, with increasing levels of ambition, are illustrated below (Table IV-2). It will be up to member States to determine the eventual scope of a forward-looking agenda. 1.

For example, Thailand has added specific targets for marginalized regions like highland areas, selected Northern provinces and the three southernmost provinces. 2. Integrated Sustainable Development Model: MDG++ 2.1 Adopt a set of 10 to 12 goals that include food security, decent remunerative jobs, social services, including access to energy for improved conditions of daily life, liveable cities, accountable government and the effective institutions that are fundamental to sustaining development. - Make clean, efficient and responsive government a Goal area to be monitored using targets and indicators on transparency and accountability, and anti-corruption, as well as peace and security. This will allow explicit monitoring of progress in governance rather than limiting it to being recognized as an enabling prerequisite (e.g., Mongolia included a new goal on good governance and anti-corruption). In fragile and conflict affected situations, where it cannot be made a prerequisite, progress towards it can be monitored. - Facilitate customization of goals, targets and indicators, like the MDG+ model; including a possible dashboard of targets and indicators representing globally accepted minimum standards supplemented by country-specific ones. 2.2 As in the MDG+ model, the goal on partnerships for development would recognize that national actions need to be complemented with international cooperation to address structural barriers and to ensure that targets and indicators are monitored regionally and globally. Include a specific target addressing the need to ensure security and sustainability of global financial systems to shield countries from the risk of global financial and economic crises. 2.3 Design the targets and indicators to include an integrated sustainable development \u201cDNA\u201d9 to reflect the economic, social and environmental dimensions of each goal with established results chains \u2013 thus monitoring targets with indicators that have a longer-term perspective. For example: - Economic sustainability: For goals on eliminating poverty and ongoing material prosperity, this will mean monitoring not just GDP growth per se, but the quality of growth, ensuring that it is employment rich so the demand side is also robust. It will also mean monitoring education quality so that human resources are strengthened and monitoring social protection to counter risks/shocks that can reverse development gains \u2013 while ensuring fiscal sustainability in the context of demographic change. - Social sustainability: Equity and social justice considerations imply equitable distribution of benefits and responsibilities to ensure that real or perceived injustice and inequality do not foment social unrest. Historical disadvantage may need targeted policies and monitoring on indicators, for instance, of education, health, energy access, incomes and jobs. - Environmental sustainability: Responsible use of natural capital with indicators to track sustainable use of nature\u2019s resources, like CHAPTER IV: Designing a new framework 63 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 fresh water, agriculture/food security, and management of pollution, biodiversity, land use, forest cover, waste and emissions/CC. 2.4 Consider making the goals universal with the principle of shared agendas and differentiated responsibility. As well as being applicable across countries by levels of development This principle could be also applicable within countries. 3.

In addition, the goal on partnership for development would include targets on the establishment and reform of global governance institutions, reflecting the changing economic realities, especially of Asia-Pacific emerging economies, to manage global public goods, including international finance/financial markets, health (early-warning systems, access to medicines and vaccines, standard operating principles for managing risks of contagion, etc.), climate change, trade, technology.

Increased energy efficiency Social sustainability: Targets that foster attitudinal and behaviour change: - Curriculum and legal changes for equity e.g. on asset ownership by women, gender-based violence - Democratic governance, accountability and transparency Environmental sustainability: Targets to respect planetary boundaries: - Maximize economic growth subject to environmental sustainability (e.g.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "839a01f3-80fe-46ae-98e4-04aa541c00d9": {"__data__": {"id_": "839a01f3-80fe-46ae-98e4-04aa541c00d9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2012/2013", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6cc513182b1d6a927ca6e363baa804300c00a8c99584a627811ce2301a1c1386"}, "2": {"node_id": "6abcfaa2-8ffc-4d2f-be2b-6df52720eab7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1b142104cd8d847a884042b7049c4dd5c1b52599a39ca93958039b9c5b5a2294"}}, "hash": "48d31705b89c852b311d560275fbf005e588a774e28debad90894425ceda80ff", "text": "green modes of production, ensure food security while promoting more sustainable agriculture, promote smarter/climate resilient cities that address the need of a growing population) Global cooperation for people-centred development: -

Compliance and timeframe The challenge of ensuring compliance remains, considering that most global environment agreements are not effectively implemented; global institutions may not be effective in the presence of competing interest groups and short-term horizons. Hence, apart from national/local action, global public goods could be supported by monitoring cross-country compliance on a \u201cpeer review\u201d-type basis as well as on the basis of periodic (e.g., biennial) reporting. A specific timeframe, say of 10-15 years, within which governments can work their policies, plans and strategies. This provides scope to assess results against metrics for success. While the final push to 2015 can establish a base-line, a time horizon can allow policy adjustments and actions to realize medium- to long- term results. Seizing the future The MDGs have demonstrated the value of rallying global support around common objectives. This experience can now serve as the basis for an even more vigorous effort in the decades ahead. Asia and the Pacific has been in the vanguard of global economic and social development. Now it has the opportunity to ensure that future development is not just rapid but more sustainable and fully inclusive. The time has now arrived to reach out and seize the future \u2013 and ensure that the region achieves rapid and equitable progress and serves the interests of its most vulnerable people.

Appendix 71 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 APPENDIX Technical Note 1: MDG process classification Data sources The data underlying the MDG progress classification tables are from the Global Millennium Development Goals Indicators Database (http://unstats.un.org/ unsd/mdg/), except for the poverty- and education- related indicators under Goal 1, 2 and 3. This database is updated annually, resulting in revisions of specific data points in some cases. The database was updated on 1 July 2013 and accessed on 27 July 2013. The poverty indicators under Goal 1 were obtained from the poverty and inequality database from the World Bank accessed on 30 July 2013. UNESCO Institute of Statistics provided data for the education-related indicators under Goals 2 and 3 on 15 May 2013. Thus prospects for progress presented in the Asia-Pacific MDGs report 2012/13 are not always comparable with those in previous reports in this series. Reference populations published by the United Nations Population Division (World Population Prospects: the 2012 Revision) and the GDP from the World Economic Outlook Database April 2013 Edition from IMF are used for estimating the size of the affected population as well as regional totals and averages. Determining the progress in achieving a MDG target A country, region or subregion is assigned one of the following four categories of MDG progress towards the targets: Early achiever: Already achieved the 2015 target On track: Expected to meet the target by 2015 Off track-Slow: Expected to meet the target, but after 2015 Off track-No progress/regressing: Stagnating or slipping backwards Two different procedures are used to determine the categories, depending on whether or not an indicator has an explicit target value for 2015. For indicators without such a target value, such as HIV prevalence, TB prevalence, TB death rate, forest cover, protected area and CO2 emissions per GDP, only three of the four categories are used: indicators trending in the \u2018right\u2019 direction since 1990 are categorized as Early achievers; indicators showing no change at all over the period are categorized as On track; and finally indicators trending in the \u2018wrong\u2019 direction are categorized as Off track-No progress/regressing. For indicators with an explicit target value, such as $1.25 a day poverty, mortality rates, school enrolment and the gender parity indices, all four categories are used. To determine the category, the year t* \u2013 by which a country is expected to reach its MDG target if the trend since 1990 continued \u2013 is estimated (see below). Denote tLst as the year with the latest available value. If t* is below tLst, the country is categorized as an Early achiever. If t* lies between tLst + 1 and 2015, it is categorized as On track. If t* is above 2015, the country is categorized as Off track-Slow. Naturally, no t* can be estimated if a country has a zero trend or trend in the \u2018wrong\u2019 direction, i.e. away from the target value. In these cases, the country is categorized as Off track-No progress/regressing. To estimate t*, the trend since 1990 is estimated first based on at least two data points, which are at least three years apart. In case an indicator is a proportion or a probability, the original value, Yt is converted into yt, which is between 0 and 1, by dividing Yt by the appropriate scale. For example, for $1.25 poverty rate, Yt is divided by 100; for infant mortality, the indicator is divided by 1,000. A logit transformation is then made on yt so that the indicator is on the scale of real numbers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "99294422-850f-40eb-be91-b20bcc9f62c9": {"__data__": {"id_": "99294422-850f-40eb-be91-b20bcc9f62c9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2012/2013", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "16a4dc2af836d766874df98d32d5300c0f46c665ebfe14ce67d1c750cda90f4e"}, "2": {"node_id": "9c154c2c-f774-4246-8161-0e3fbeeb63f8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "220fad3427ea8c639788a396dae7182a3d204d8c6b1ac28ef11bf05f5220755a"}}, "hash": "889683d9e915ad7a4d20f4c8c7aa033643163568613c50dd1a8b8cc4fffa606f", "text": "For indicators that are odds ratios, such as gender parity, a log transformation is used.

If the signs of the two estimated rates differ, the trend estimate excluding the observation for the first year is used. In addition, for indicators such as TB prevalence, TB death rate and CO2 emissions per GDP, where enough data (more than five observations) are available to detect a reversal of trend, a binomial equation was estimated using the Ordinary Least Square method: (3) When r2, the coefficient of t2, is statistically significant (at 0.02 level) and there are more than three data points to the right of the turning point, estimated at -r1/(2 * r2), the binomial model is used in place of the linear model. If r2 <0, the indicator increased in value first and then decreased. This means that the target has already been achieved. If r2 >0, there is regression on the indicator. When the linear model is used, the sign of r1 is used to judge if the country has already achieved the target (r1<0), is on track (r1=0), or is regressing (r1 >0). There are instances of large changes in the value of an indicator, the magnitude of which makes it difficult for the trend to sustain in future years (or extrapolate the trend backwards to as early as 1990). Since a logit transformation for most of the indicators is applied, a restriction to the slope is considered in these cases (to be between -0.2 and 0.2). It is possible to simulate that a slope of 0.2 or larger or -0.2 or smaller can give very drastic results when moving through the 25 years (1990-2015) with the logit transformations. This restriction does not affect the on/off track decision: a country with this rapid change will be early achiever or on track if in the right sign already and regressing if in the wrong sign. Setting the target value When an indicator requires a target value, a value for the indicator for the year 1990 is required to calculate it. When the 1990 value is not available, with the exception of the North and Central Asian countries, the first value is used in place of the 1990 value. For the North and Central Asian countries, if the trend estimate excludes the first available value, the second value is then used in place of the 1990 value. Using cut-off values The cut-off values depend on the kind of target of the indicator. Some of the MDG targets require an indicator value to increase or decrease by a certain proportion of their 1990 values. The only indicator of this kind that has a cut-off point is $1.25 a day poverty, because 2 per cent used to be the lowest level reported on this indicator. Many other indicators require an absolute level as a target, such as the primary school enrolment. These targets cannot be achieved by the model due to the transformation used. In this case the indicator is treated as achieved if the country has reached this cut-off value. In the case of primary school enrolment, for example, this cut-off value is set at 95 per cent instead of 100. The transformation and cut- off values for indicators are presented in Table 1. Calculating regional and country group aggregates and the affected population Regional and country group aggregates The aggregates are estimated by using a weighted average of the actual country values, or imputed country values wherever data are missing for the year required. The reference populations were obtained from World Population Prospects: the 2012 Revision (United Nations, 2011) and World Economic Outlook Database April 2013 Edition. The same models for estimating trends are used to impute missing values for the year for a country (please see the previous section on how to calculate the trend). The aggregate values for a specific indicator are calculated through the following process: Appendix 73 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 \u2022 Estimate the indicator values for the countries (see the previous section, estimating the trend) that do not have data in a year. \u2022 Using the reference populations, a weighted average of the country values is calculated to obtain the aggregate value for the region or country group. \u2022 If the country was classified as regressing in an indicator, the latest available value will be used as estimate for following years, assuming that the country will maintain at least that level of the indicator and will not get worse. Affected population The calculation of the affected population is based on the aggregate value of the indicator for the region and the total reference population for the region.

Appendix 74 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 Finally, there are some indicators without reference populations, such as forest cover, protected areas, for which it is therefore impossible to calculate the affected populations.

The AARR was introduced by UNICEF in its reports \u201cThe state of the world\u2019s children\u201d to monitor and evaluate the global trend in underweight prevalence among children under five and child mortality. The AARR measures the rate of change of a given indicator from baseline to the current year. When estimates of the indicators are available for multiple years, regression analysis method can be used to calculate the AARR. The approach is appealing because it takes into account the fact that it becomes more challenging to achieve the same magnitude of progress towards a particular target at higher levels of achievement. In other words, the approach allows for non-linear acceleration. Data sources The data used for the analysis of acceleration in progress towards achieving MDGs in Asia and the Pacific are from the Global Millennium Development Goals Indicators Database (http://unstats.un.org/unsd/ mdg/). The analyses presented in the current report are based on data updated on 1 July 2013 and accessed on 27 July 2013. For all the indicators under Goal 2 and 3, UNESCO Institute for Statistics provided the data on 15 May 2013. For the poverty indicators under Goal 1, data were obtained from the poverty and inequality database from the World Bank on 30 July 2013. Calculation of the AARR If the level of the indicator in a baseline year t0 is Y0 and assuming an exponential function, any data point can be expressed as: Yti = Y0(1-r)(ti-t0) where the r is the average annual rate of reduction (AARR). If some algebra is applied to the previous expression, it is possible to obtain the following: ln(Yti)= ln(Y0)+(ti-t0)ln(1-r)= ln(Y0)+tiln(1-r)-t0ln(1-r) =\u00dfti+C0 where \u00df= ln(1-r) and C0= ln(Y0) -t0ln(1-r) From \u00df= ln(1-r) it is possible to obtain r=AARR= 1-exp(\u00df) Decision The AARR is calculated for the two periods of time, pre-MDGs and post-MDGs. Then these two rates are compared allowing for a 5 per cent margin for statistical error. This 5 per cent was chosen following the paper by Degol Hailu and Raquel Tsukada (2011). In the case of an indicator for which the higher the level the better, for example, primary enrolment: if (1.05*AARR_pre-MDGs<=AARR_ post-MDGs) the country is considered as having accelerated the rate of progress for that indicator, if (0.95*AARR_pre-MDGs >=AARR_ post-MDGs) the country is considered as having slowed down the rate of progress for that indicator, if (0.95*AARR_pre-MDGs <AARR_ post-MDGs & 1.05*AARR_pre-MDGs >AARR_ post-MDGs) the country is considered as having maintain the rate of progress for that indicator. All these decisions can be adjusted in the case of an indicator for which the lower the level the better. References Fukuda-Parr, S. and J. Greenstein (2010).

The Asia-Pacific region has achieved remarkable progress on the MDGs, particularly on reducing income poverty; however, it still has a significant \u2018unfinished agenda\u2019. People in the region continue to face major deprivation, along with many new and unaddressed development challenges. As the finishing line for the MDGs approaches, this report articulates Asia-Pacific aspirations for a post-2015 development framework. It calls for concerted and accelerated action on 11 measurable goal areas. Countries will need to bring together the three pillars of sustainable development \u2013 economic prosperity, social equity and environmental sensitivity \u2013 and replace short-term horizons with longer-term sustained benefits. Likewise, they will need to address issues of social justice, human rights and equity. Building on the MDGs, a post-2015 global agenda that is applicable to all will need to take into account huge variations in country circumstances. Learning from the MDG experience of the Asia-Pacific region, the new development framework should allow for customization of targets and indicators, along with flexibility for additional national goals. It should make clear who is responsible for achieving the goals and for ensuring the means of implementation of the new development agenda, at global, regional and national levels.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "895e8187-e56d-4c3c-9480-ee98e2250457": {"__data__": {"id_": "895e8187-e56d-4c3c-9480-ee98e2250457", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2012/2013", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2f769fc4ba668641d99f20a9e39e64f43815706f273859831b6f1ddbcf09d844"}, "2": {"node_id": "088ffd0e-9091-4aa0-b980-960805e43468", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "edc8415b0f4f3749199b47d13d25a01d520d83168a3123164151a4decfa7393d"}}, "hash": "ffc9137f9a4d125daf11904c035a49f6040862e13ae56f33f8cd2ac3b995fad0", "text": "The report has been produced by ESCAP, ADB and UNDP.

It also examines the feedback effects that such warming and the resulting climate change can have on growth and human development, especially in the developing countries of the Asia-Pacific region. It discusses, inter alia: (i) the evidence of a nonlinear relationship between income growth and emissions, especially CO2 emissions; (ii) the relative contributions of different kinds of activities to GHG emissions; (iii) the inter-country differences in the relationship between development, GHG emissions and global warming; and (iv) the constraints to adaptation to climate change faced by poorer countries and socially disadvantaged groups. This provides the basis for identifying the national and global strategies needed to address global warming and its consequences, with special reference to Asia-Pacific.

Introduction By all indications global warming and climate change are among the least tractable challenges confronting mankind today. While there is considerable agreement that the science does point to global warming induced by human activity and to adverse climate shifts following from this, not enough is being done as of now to stall and reverse this tendency. Unfortunately this occurs when for a majority of the world\u2019s population, even threshold levels of human development are yet to be realised. Since, under \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d scenarios, the growth required to generate the wherewithal for advancing human development is likely to exacerbate global warming, efforts at mitigation (defined as action to reduce radiative forcing1) and adaptation (defined as action aimed at increasing tolerance to global warming and its climate change effects) are imperative.

And, finally, which mitigation and adaptation policies would not place the burden of adjustment on the poor? 2. Global warming Typically, the \u201cGreenhouse Effect\u201d results from the fact that GHGs form a blanket in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Shorter wavelength solar radiation penetrates through this blanket and heats the Earth\u2019s surface. A part of this absorbed heat is radiated back in the form of longer 1 The Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2007a) defines \u201cradiative forcing\u201d as \u201ca measure of the influence a factor has in altering the balance of incoming and outgoing energy in the Earth-atmosphere system and is an index of the importance of the factor as a potential climate change mechanism.\u201d 2 The most important of these are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, nitrous oxide and sulfur dioxide, ozone, chlorofluorocarbons and water vapour. Water vapour, which is contributed only in small measure by human activity, is the world\u2019s most prevalent greenhouse gas and is estimated to account for around 95 per cent by volume of these gases. Of the others, carbon dioxide is the most prevalent, amounting to an estimated 76 per cent of the GHGs other than water vapour in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. However, the significance of a gas is determined not just by its prevalence, but by the strength of its greenhouse effect. While estimates vary, water vapour is seen as responsible for anywhere between 36 and 66 per cent of the green house effect, and together with clouds for between 66 and 85 per cent. CO2 contributes between 9 and 26 per cent and ozone and other minor GHGs for around 7 and 8 per cent respectively. See Gavin (2005). 2 wavelength infrared rays, some of which are absorbed by these gases. This traps heat under the GHG blanket and warms the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. If the presence of greenhouse gasses is such as to keep the temperature of the Earth\u2019s surface roughly constant, there is no problem. But if excess green house gas emission and accumulation lead to an increase in temperatures over time, the effects on climate would be significant and potentially adverse from a human development point of view. Excess emission of GHGs, especially of CO2, has indeed resulted in such a tendency. In the \u201cnatural\u201d world, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is regulated by the carbon cycle. Elements of the living world, such as plants, algae, bacteria and animals, directly (through photosynthesis, which uses light energy to convert carbon dioxide into organic matter, for example), or indirectly (through consumption, for example), extract carbon from the non-living world and return it to the atmosphere and water (as CO2), through processes such as burning and decay. This, however, tends to be a closed carbon cycle in which the emission of CO2 and its absorption are likely to be closely matched, resulting in a degree of stability in GHG concentration in the atmosphere. \u201cExcess\u201d emission is largely the result of anthropogenic activity, or the contribution of various forms of human activity to GHG emission that cannot be absorbed and results in an increase in GHG concentration. As a result of the contribution made by human activity at the margin, the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere has increased. According to one estimate, the \u201clevels of several important greenhouse gases have increased by 40 per cent since large scale industrialization began around 150 years ago\u201d.3 The GHG concentration in 2005 was 425 ppmv (parts per million by volume) in terms of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) and the current rate of increase is 2-3 ppmv per year. According to the IPCC (2007c), the CO2, methane and nitrous oxide concentrations in the atmosphere have increased from 280 ppm, 715 ppb (parts per billion) and 270 ppb respectively in 1750 to 379 ppm, 1774 ppb and 319 ppb respectively by 2005. The IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios projects an increase of global GHG emissions by 25 to 90 per cent (CO2-eq) between 2000 and 2030.4 The difficulty is that once concentrations increase they are a legacy that has lasting effects, particularly in the case of CO2, on surface temperatures and climate over time.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9d14f21b-1d22-492d-9213-e2b40ebe0aa8": {"__data__": {"id_": "9d14f21b-1d22-492d-9213-e2b40ebe0aa8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/01", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6a6efe3f11eb947b870eb86358b8570c7a0eedfc509af57c0a2f04a7b57efcdb"}, "2": {"node_id": "1fcc2efb-0af9-4256-8129-c8c8a9014665", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3a30767fd4fb83e498d4f806cb9cf8d599742f720cfeb5e7173fa14e7899fc0e"}}, "hash": "9e9c5c018718ef53e668ab727421ec7958f3b9c0b6dc4c387f727ec7cee492c4", "text": "The available scientific evidence as reported in the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change is that average global surface temperatures rose by 0.74 \u00b0C over the hundred year period ending 2005.5 What is more pertinent is the evidence", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d1ed588-6029-4732-b509-b5e564c15931": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d1ed588-6029-4732-b509-b5e564c15931", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/01", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d874ab206f87a1ffa1a994bdf883c56b69fb88b567f2ac69fea301d74e40f567"}, "3": {"node_id": "1924f3be-7a43-4fbf-b8f3-40097d9143f6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2af1636db797afbcd1ca8324bfc3f95be7a35b08ec597b151ef447c812c3b60f"}}, "hash": "2ad5beede32cc12877a7e9742442bcd11d9d59d76b6f5579e5c2a873e3ec6a57", "text": "that the pace of global warming has been accelerating and the incidence of warmer temperatures over time is rising.

Global warming and climate change The extent of warming is uneven across the globe making its effects and their intensity uncertain. The oceans and tropical coastal regions are expected to see the least warming, the high latitudes particularly around the poles the most, with the mid-latitudes falling in between. Yet, the geophysical consequences of this warming are expected to be near omnipresent and manifold. To start with, it could result in a rise in average sea levels, threatening low-lying islands and coastal regions with submersion. Satellite data suggest that since 1993, the sea level has been rising at a rate of around 3 mm per year, which is seen as significantly higher than the average during the previous half century. According to the IPCC\u2019s Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES), there is one scenario (A1B) in which the global sea level could rise by 0.22 to 0.44 metres above 1990 levels by the mid-2090s.8 Secondly, it could result in the melting of polar icecaps, the retreat of mountain glaciers and loss of snow cover in lower altitude mountain peaks, leading to changes in river flows, flooding and other disruptive consequences. Third, the rise in temperature could lead to an increase in the frequency and intensity of unpredictable extreme weather events such as heat waves, tropical storms, cyclones, hurricanes and extreme rainfall events. Fourth, patterns of precipitation are expected to change substantially, with substantial temporal and spatial variations in these changes. And, finally, the severity of droughts and intensity of floods are likely to increase. These changes in climate in turn directly and indirectly affect the development prospects of poorer countries, including in the Asia-Pacific region. The most obvious direct effect is increased exposure to natural calamities due to extreme weather events and their fallout such as floods. There is already evidence of increased extreme weather events, though the science directly linking these to global warming is underdeveloped. Consider the Asia-Pacific experience during 2010 for example. Pakistan experienced its worst flooding in its history after exceptional monsoon rains, which left more than 1,500 dead and displaced more than 20 million. Temperature at Mohenjo-Daro in Pakistan touched 53.5 Celsius, which was a national record and the highest temperature in Asia since at least 1942. Other highs included 52 degrees Celsius in Jeddah and 50.4 in Doha.9 The heat wave also triggered forest fires and drought that led to crop failures. Floods and landslides killed more than 1,400 people in Gansu province in China. Heavy rains in Australia made it the third wettest year on record, with the country also experiencing devastating floods in early 2011. And large parts of Australia and Indonesia suffered heavy rains from May 2010, linked to a La Ni\u00f1a event that cools the Pacific Ocean.10 There have in recent times been a significant number of natural disasters worldwide. In 2009, hydrological disasters were the most common (53.7 per cent of total reported), followed by meteorological disasters (25.4 per cent).

The Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disaster (CRED) estimated that in 335 natural disasters reported worldwide in 2009, 10,655 persons were killed, 119 million others affected and economic damages valued at $41.3 billion caused (Figure 1).12 Asia reported the largest number of disasters (40.3 per cent), and accounted for 89.1 per cent of the victims and 38.5 per cent of total reported damages. These and other events do seem to be signals that the climatic effects of global warming are already with us. Though it is extremely difficult to establish direct linkages, scientists are not ruling out a link between some of these events and the increase in GHGs. The direct damage and consequences that such extreme events have for livelihoods and human development indicators are well known. Not surprisingly, the global ambition, even if as yet not the commitment, is to stabilise GHGs at around 450-550 ppm CO2e, so as to limit global warming to around 2\u00b0C. To the extent that natural shocks of the kind noted above are related to climate change, their adverse implications for the effort to advance human development should be obvious. They are likely to result in the loss of livelihood opportunities, exacerbate nutritional deprivation 11 Vos et al. 2010. 12 Vos et al. 2010. 5 and disrupt capability-building activities like schooling for children. Further, crop losses resulting from such climatic events can result in food price increases that are an additional damaging consequence. Thus, in what is seen as partly the result of idiosyncratic weather and natural disasters, wheat prices in Asia-Pacific rose by close to 50 per cent between July and September 2010, the price of corn by 25 per cent and the price of soybeans by 12 per cent.13 But the impact of unusual and extreme weather events is not just immediate and short-term. They can have long-term consequences through the shock-induced distress sale of land and other assets held by the poor and vulnerable, for example. These would undermine the long- term ability of the poor to cope with and benefit from processes of development. 4. Climate change vulnerability in Asia-Pacific The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2001) traces the vulnerability of a system to (i) the nature and extent of exposure to climate variation to which a system is exposed; (ii) its sensitivity, or \u201cthe degree to which a system is affected, either adversely or beneficially, by climate variability or change\u201d; and (iii) its adaptive capacity. Based on a combination of indicators related to each of these, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) (2009) have identified Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Nepal as the countries most vulnerable to climate change in Asia and the Pacific, while those seen as significantly vulnerable\u2014because of low scores for two out of the above three features\u2014include Bhutan, China, Indonesia, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Uzbekistan, and Viet Nam. Thus vulnerability is widespread, even though the poorest of countries are seen as capable of adapting to significant extents if the requisite policies are adopted and investments made. The sensistivity and adaptive capacity of the Asia-Pacific region is influenced by three features. First, the region accounts for 68 per cent of the developing world\u2019s population and 64 per cent of its undernourished population.14 This makes it extremely sensitive to adverse climatic changes as well as substantially reduces its coping capacity. Secondly, the region is home to countries that are already extremely disaster prone. Over the more than three decades during 1975-2006, Asia accounted for about 89 per cent of people affected by disasters worldwide, 57 per cent of total fatalities, and 44 per cent of total economic damage.15 Finally, the region is already prone to extreme weather events, with the coastal areas periodically experiencing tropical cyclones and associated high winds, storm surges, and extreme rainfall events, and the influence of the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation subjecting the region to considerable volatility. While this is true of coastal regions in all developing countries, the problem is particularly acute, involving periodic drought and rising sea levels, in island economies such as those in the southwest Pacific.16 Climate change could significantly alter the dynamic underlying these events and may increase their frequency and intensity.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b5c94ba-6611-4891-a9ac-12936d3ff1d5": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b5c94ba-6611-4891-a9ac-12936d3ff1d5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/01", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "da323a4b7cc8854a91497301408b894dbac9d56c759e7bc954c6fd75db50debb"}, "2": {"node_id": "06b604ae-2dc1-4e5c-a5b5-9f9d47037e38", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2ee11aa78517a5a6849a9e7047e13b68b0197effd7f8df944baff495a85abd36"}}, "hash": "a0cf26dc3a42bfb670e76c020c62615253a35c7aee7050ee14e7fd96f4f9ab42", "text": "It is to be expected that low-lying countries, especially small islands, will face the highest exposure to rising sea levels.

The LDCs are normally (though not always) among the poorest in the region and the world and tend to be more economically vulnerable. This vulnerability stems, inter alia, from the following: poor infrastructure facilities, in particular transport, which come in the way of an integration of the economy; a high degree of risk-exposure when faced with natural calamities; a lack of diversification of the economic structure; inadequate education and health facilities; and low savings rates, which make the task of economic and social transformation extremely difficult in the absence of substantial inflows of foreign assistance. Thus, for eight of the Asia-Pacific LDCs for which data are available from the World Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators (2011), the savings rate in 2006 was below 15 per cent in four, of which two had negative savings rates. In addition to this, many of these countries are characterised by major geographical handicaps inasmuch as they are either small, remote, landlocked countries, or remote island economies. Infrastructural inadequacies are particularly important from the point of view of the small island developing states, which are especially vulnerable to environmental shocks. Seven of the 13 LDCs in the Asia-Pacific region are SIDs (Kiribati, Maldives, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu). These are among the smallest and most remote countries on earth, together accounting for a land area of less than 60,000 square kilometres scattered across the world\u2019s largest ocean.17 Not surprisingly, all seven of the island LDCs in the Asia Pacific are very prone to external shocks such as those experienced during the global food, energy and economic crises in recent years. Simultaneously, all seven countries share a high degree of vulnerability to environmental disasters, that occur at regular intervals in the region, and whose numbers are expected to rise as a result of climate change. Adverse effects of the climate change-related sea-level rise are projected particularly for the Maldives, Tuvalu, and Kiribati, where a significant portion of the land mass is made up of low-lying atolls that do not reach more than a few meters above current sea level.18 As former President Mohamed Nasheed (2009) of the Republic of Maldives noted, \u201cFor the Maldives, climate change is no vague or distant irritation but a clear and present danger to our survival. But the Maldives is no special case; simply the canary in the world's coal mine\u201d. The extent of environmental vulnerability that characterizes these countries is highlighted by the Environmental Vulnerability Index developed by the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC), a regional organization in the Pacific. Based on several indicators, Kiribati, Maldives, Samoa and Tuvalu are rated as highly vulnerable to environmental shocks. The situation is less acute in Solomon Islands and Vanuatu; however, both countries are still rated as vulnerable.19 Vulnerability to natural disasters also threatens the tourism industry, an important form of economic activity in some of these countries. Even by 2000, international tourism receipts as a percentage of GDP amounted to 51.4 per cent in the Maldives, 22.9 per cent in Vanuatu and 17.7 per cent in Samoa. Data for 2005 shows a slight increase for Samoa but a decrease for Maldives, resulting from the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004.

Global warming and economic growth Climate change is also likely to severely affect individual sectors that are crucial from a human development point of view, particularly a sector like agriculture, the performance of which is critically dependent on soil and moisture conditions.21 The combined and often conflicting effects of three consequences of GHG emissions are involved here: rising temperature, increased CO2 concentrations and changes in rainfall patterns.

Thus in tropical regions, to which much of the Asia-Pacific belongs, even a 2\u02daC rise in temperature could result in a significant decline in yields. In higher latitudes, crop yields are expected to increase initially when temperature increases are moderate, and then to fall. Finally, significantly higher temperatures are expected to result in substantial declines in cereal production around the world, particularly if the carbon fertilization effect22 is small, as argued by some. Modelling studies discussed in recent IPCC reports indicate that moderate to medium increases in mean temperature (1\u20133\u00baC), along with associated CO2 increases and rainfall changes, are expected to benefit crop yields in temperate regions. However, in low-latitude regions, moderate temperature increases (1\u20132\u00baC) are likely to have negative yield impacts for major cereals. Warming of more than 3\u00baC would have negative impacts in all regions.23 The effect tends to be greater on winter crops in tropical climates. However, these effects may not materialize in full or at all because of the potentially offsetting effects of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.24 Studies that attempt to simulate the effects of different combinations of temperature rise and increased CO2 point to the probability of a small increase in rice yields, while the effect on wheat is unclear, varying from negative to positive. 20 UNESCAP 2009. 21 For a detailed review see Jayaraman 2011. 22 Since plants absorb carbon dioxide from the air in their growth process, scientists have suggested that as CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere rise, plant growth will increase. But while this consequence has been demonstrated under laboratory conditions, open air, field experiments reportedly point to smaller gains. See Cline (2007). 23 Easterling et al. 2007. 24 Carbon fertilization refers to the fact that higher concentrations of carbon dioxide promote plant growth by facilitating the production of carbohydrates and reducing water loss due to respiration. This effect is stronger in the case of the so-called \u201cC3 crops\u201d such as rice, wheat and legumes, as compared with the \u201cC4 crops\u201d, such as maize, millets, sorghum and sugarcane. Earlier estimates of the effect of carbon fertilization were based on laboratory experiments. But subsequent studies based on so-called Free-Air Concentration Enrichment (FACE) experiments conducted on field crops in open air under agronomic conditions suggest that the effect of carbon fertilization is almost 50 per cent lower than indicated by laboratory studies for C3 crops and almost nil for C4 crops. 8 Similarly in the available science the effect of predicted variations in rainfall is uncertain. But it is to be expected that in primarily rain-fed agriculture, farmers dependent on rainfall for irrigation and farms inadequately provided with drainage and flood control protection are bound to be adversely affected by increased uncertainties in rainfall. Agriculture is also likely to be affected from the cost side. Temperature increases are expected to adversely impact the response of crop output to nitrogenous fertilizers, necessitating larger application to sustain production. Further temperature and rainfall pattern changes may affect the type and intensity of vulnerability to pest attack, necessitating costly adaptation. A detailed modelling exercise by ADB and IFPRI (2009) concluded that while climate change will cause yield declines for the most important crops in developing countries as a group, South Asia will be particularly hard hit. Even as far as irrigated crops are concerned, while climate change will have varying effects across regions, irrigated yields for all crops in South Asia will experience large declines. William Cline's study (2007) predicted that under the IPCC's scenario A2, by the 2080s, global agricultural productivity would decline by about 3 per cent if the carbon fertilization effect was operative and by about 16 per cent if it was not. These losses are expected to be disproportionately concentrated in developing countries, which would suffer losses of 9 per cent and 21 per cent respectively with and without the carbon fertilization effect, as compared with an 8 per cent gain and 6 per cent loss in industrial countries. Estimates by country and region suggest that South Asia and Africa would be the two regions most harmed by climate change. In Southeast Asia, in the absence of adaptation, the damages of climate change to agriculture would also be severe, ranking from 15.1 per cent for Viet Nam to 26.2 per cent for Thailand if the carbon fertilization effect did not materialize.25 The potential adverse impact of climate change on agriculture is of particular significance to the Asia-Pacific region where more than 60 per cent of the total population and their dependents (numbering 2.2 billion people) are dependent on agriculture.

ADB and IFPRI (2009) estimated that rice production could drop by as much as 14-20 per cent over the next four decades. This is expected to push up prices across the region and increase the number of malnourished. 6. Fisheries and forestry Sectors allied to agriculture are also likely to be affected adversely by warming. An area of activity that is likely to be significantly affected is marine and inland fishery. The ambient temperature influences the body temperatures of aquatic species. Hence an increase in surface temperatures, that would affect the temperatures of the oceans, seas, rivers and inland water bodies, would in all likelihood raise body temperatures of a range of aquatic species. This is expected to significantly affect metabolism and, hence, the reproductive seasonality, efficacy and therefore production of fish. There could also be changes in the resistance and susceptibility to diseases and toxins as well. Climate change-induced temperature changes 25 Zhai and Zhuang 2009. 9 can also impact on the spatial distribution of fish resources and therefore on fishing and aquaculture activities.26 But besides air and water temperatures, a number of other climate variables are known to influence fisheries: precipitation, salinity, ocean circulation, river flow, sea and lake levels, ice cover and glacial melt, and storm frequency and intensity. The potential effects of these variables are diverse. To start with, they affect, as noted above, the abundance and distribution of exploited species and assemblages, and therefore the level of production. In addition, increases in the frequency and severity of extreme events adversely affect fishing operations and infrastructure. Further, given their location, fishing communities may be more sensitive to climate changes that affect people\u2019s livelihoods and food security, and to impacts on aspects unrelated to economic activities, such as diseases or damage due to disasters. Besides the Americas, the largest fisheries in terms of total capture production and employment are in Asia. Among the world\u2019s major fishing nations are China, Japan, Indonesia, India and Thailand. Among Least Developed Countries, the only one that features among the top 33 fishing nations is Bangladesh, with significant inland and marine fishing activity. Thus, Asia is likely to be significantly affected, with possible adverse implications for the livelihoods of poor fishing communities.27 However, the evidence on the nature of the changes that would occur is still uncertain. Both negative and positive impacts are predicted, depending on region and nature of fishery activity (marine or inland fisheries or aquaculture). But expectations are that in the foreseeable future biological changes induced by climate shifts would lead to physiological stresses and adverse life cycle impacts. As a result, there could be increased vulnerability in terms of less stable livelihoods, besides safety risks arising from harsher weather conditions and the need to fish further away from landing sites. Three issues are seen as influencing the vulnerability of the Asia-Pacific to changes in fisheries due to climate change. The first is the high fisheries dependence of the region. Besides being an important source of livelihood, fish accounts for a significant share of export revenues in Southeast and South Asia. The second is that it is an important source of dietary protein amounting to as much as 40 per cent of the animal protein consumed in the region.28 A concomitant of such dependence is over exploitation. Whether it is lakes such as Chilika in India or Southeast Asian coral reefs, current appropriation levels are many multiples of the sustainable catch. Any reduction in the resource can have grave consequences. And climate change can in many ways affect the resource. Third, Asian fisheries depend, for example, on many rivers that originate in the mountains, including the Indus, the Brahmaputra, the Ganga and the Mekong originating in the Himalayas. While climate change impacts are uncertain, it could lead to earlier peaking of seasonal flows or even reductions in flows, because of reduced snowfall and the melting of glaciers. This could severely impact river-dependent fishing populations. 26 FAO 2008. 27 Allison et al. 2009. 28 Allison et al. 2009. 10 7. Forests and climate change The role of forests in the climate change process is complex, since their presence offers an important means to mitigation of CO2 emissions, especially in tropical countries, whereas their removal releases CO2 into the atmosphere. Trees absorb CO2 to convert them into organic matter such as leaves and roots, releasing carbon when they die and decay or are burnt. Since, in the process, they absorb more carbon then they release, forests serve as natural carbon sinks.

The amount of CO2 sequestered in forests is estimated at nearly half of all the carbon in terrestrial plants. Tropical deforestation can also deplete the moderate levels of soil carbon. Thus, the cost is lowest and carbon benefit largest, when tropical deforestation is reduced and reversed.29 Anthropogenic deforestation results from a range of activities, such as: shifting (slash and burn) cultivation; small-scale and large-scale permanent cultivation in agriculture; clearing of forests for mining and industrial expansion; wood extraction, through logging and fuel wood harvesting and activities such as road building. Although commercial wood extraction is focused on a relatively few tree species in tropical forests, it most often results in substantial waste. While only around 10 per cent of the wood volume may be harvested, many non-target trees are killed or damaged.30 Further, commercial logging involves laying roads for removing the timber, which in turn provides access for agricultural expansion and other developmental (forest-clearing) activities. Finally, government policies encouraging resettlement from urban centres into forested areas also have adverse effects. According to the IPCC, land use changes, primarily deforestation, were responsible for the release about 5.8 Gt CO2 (gigatons or billion metric tons of CO2) annually, or about 17 per cent of all annual anthropogenic GHG emissions in the 1990s.31 Hence if forest cover can be sustained and deforestation reversed, the world can relatively cheaply mitigate the problem of GHG emissions. On the surface, the record in Asia-Pacific is positive. Between 1990 and 2010, net forest cover in Asia increased by 0.7 million hectares. But this average conceals significant differences. There has been large-scale afforestation in countries like China, and significant programmes of afforestation in India and Viet Nam. On the other hand, over the same period Southeast Asia lost 3.32 million hectares of forested area.32 In some countries (such as Thailand) there has been a decline in primary forest despite the existence of formal logging bans. Across the Asia-Pacific, rates of deforestation were the highest in Southeast Asia, where forest cover decreased by 0.41 per cent per annum between 2000 and 2010, compared to a 0.36 per cent annual decrease in Oceania and annual increases of 0.28 per cent in South Asia and 1.16 per cent in East Asia. On average, the loss of tropical forests is greater than deforestation in boreal and temperate forests. This makes the Southeast Asia case significant. Southeast Asia (especially the Indochinese Peninsula, Indonesia and the Philippines), accounts for approximately a third of the tropical forest area in the world. Indonesia alone 29 Gorte and Sheikh 2010. 30 Gorte and Sheikh 2010. 31 Barker et al. 2007. 32 FAO 2010. 11 accounts for around 9 per cent of the world\u2019s tropical forest area and for nearly 13 per cent of global tropical deforestation.33 Natural forests are also known to contain more biomass (250 tC/hectare) than plantations (50 tC/hectare) or agroforestry systems (90-120 tC/hectare).34 The net result is that the Asia- Pacific region, with its high deforestation and spatially widely different afforestation rates has been found to be the major source of forest-related emissions, with levels higher than in Sub- Saharan Africa or Latin America. Conservation of natural forests is crucial for climate change mitigation strategies in this region. Deforestation in Southeast Asia is largely driven by small-scale, shifting or permanent agricultural activity. In fact, except for Malaysia and Indonesia, commercial logging is less important as a cause of deforestation. But deforestation in Indonesia and Malaysia due to commercial logging is important overall, since they have extensive forests and are characterised by high deforestation rates. Even here, however, large-scale commercial agriculture is emerging as the predominant cause of deforestation, particularly as a result of oil palm cultivation as a major commercial crop, with extensive areas being cleared for oil palm plantations.35 The other plantation crop responsible for deforestation is rubber, especially in Thailand and Malaysia. Given these developments there is considerable agreement that, in recent decades, tropical deforestation has been responsible for the largest share of CO2 released to the atmosphere as a result of land use changes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "807f429c-0cf2-41e0-a5aa-3f9a05b7912f": {"__data__": {"id_": "807f429c-0cf2-41e0-a5aa-3f9a05b7912f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/01", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ed4b187547842965d316ee34a7a695ac251f25834fcac11b3b417574442b7d3e"}, "2": {"node_id": "d52c4646-d8fd-4fbd-b66d-25b56162d86f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fa5299b20d499f13011843e226427721ed7cd29dafa302e62acd839a21c76447"}}, "hash": "c902f2c172688dbf144188ad316350fa2cbb8fcfb926882256c3e6892209292c", "text": "According to one estimate, at current rates of deforestation, the clearing of tropical forests could release an additional 87 to 130 GtC of CO2 to the atmosphere by 2100.36 Thus, the task of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) must be an important area of focus for mitigation efforts, especially in developing countries of the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "81eda80e-dd09-4ce4-9cfd-7df8295b4933": {"__data__": {"id_": "81eda80e-dd09-4ce4-9cfd-7df8295b4933", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/01", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d5936018e14f4c2304c23e68857a9948e914f20eca0f0846012d75555bc44e72"}}, "hash": "d5936018e14f4c2304c23e68857a9948e914f20eca0f0846012d75555bc44e72", "text": "Asia-Pacific region. Livelihoods of poor tribal populations are also likely to be affected by the impact of climate change on forests.37 They are dependent on forest vegetation, which may not adapt to climate change. As much as 70 per cent of forest vegetation can be adversely affected. Since not all species are likely to be uniformly affected, there is likely to be a significant change in the composition of forest cover in different regions. There is also likely to be a spread of species from other regions as climate changes. The stress resulting from the transition is likely to result in loss of forest cover and biodiversity. 8. Emissions and growth For these and other reasons, efforts to mitigate emissions and adapt to global warming and climate change are imperative. It is inevitable that developing countries too will need to move to low-carbon pathways of development. If technological change to accommodate that shift without affecting growth adversely would take time, then the difficulties of realising a range of requirements set by the challenge of eradicating poverty and advancing human 33 Gorte and Sheikh 2010. 34 FAO 2010. 35 Gorte and Sheikh 2010. 36 Houghton 2005. 37 Nilsson 2008. 12 development will be all the greater when the climate change challenge is addressed adequately. This is because reducing emissions is expected to impact adversely on growth, with likely attendant effects on human development indicators. It must be noted that, while contributions by developing countries to the GHG emission reduction initiative is imperative, any one Asian country\u2019s emissions reduction will have little impact on global warming (with the possible exception of China). Thus, the case for mitigation efforts by developing countries, including in Asia, is predicated on the presence of a global agreement and global action to reduce GHG emissions to realise stabilisation targets. The principal sources of GHG emissions are: (i) CO2 emissions due to the burning of fossil fuels, that accounted for around 56.6 per cent of anthropogenic GHG emissions in 2004; (ii) CO2 emissions due to deforestation and decay of biomass (17.3 per cent) and other factors (2.8 per cent); (iii) methane (CH4) emissions due to the digestive process in ruminant animals such as cows, buffalo and sheep, agricultural activities such as paddy farming and land use changes (14.3 per cent); (iv) nitrous oxide (N2O) from activities such as the use of chemical fertilizers in agriculture (7.9 per cent); and (v) F(luoro) gases released by refrigeration and fire suppression systems (1.1 per cent).38 Figure 2: Contribution of human activity to GHG emissions 2004 Source: Barker et al. 2007. It should be clear from this that human activity directly and indirectly contributes substantially to GHG emissions. The contribution of various human activities to aggregate GHG emissions in 2004 and individual GHG gases in 1990 and 2004 are given in Figures 2 and 3. The similarity in emission on average between Asia and the rest of the world emerges from Figure 4, though there are significant inter-country variations within regions. 38 Barker et al. 2007. 13 Figure 3: Contribution of selected economic activities to emissions of different gases 1990 and 2004 Source: Barker et al. 2007. Figure 4: GHG emissions by sector in 2000 (excluding land use change) CO2, CH4, N2O, PFCs, HFCs, SF6 Source: World Resources Institute 2011. There are two well-known features of the processes of GHG emission and associated warming that these figures illustrate. The first is that activities that are at the centre of modern economic growth such as energy supply and consumption, industrial production, transportation and construction contribute an overwhelming share of total emissions. In addition, other outcomes of modern economic growth, such as deforestation, also contribute significantly to emissions. The second feature is that at the margin (comparing 1990 and 2004 as in Figure 3) certain activities, especially energy production and supply, transportation and forestry, are overwhelmingly large contributors to GHG, especially CO2, emissions. These features of the dominant emissions and their sources suggest that as countries transit from lower middle to upper middle and higher income levels, especially through a development trajectory involving diversification in favour of manufacturing, emission intensities are likely to rise sharply, at least till some threshold income level. Two (partly related) factors are primarily responsible for the increase in carbon intensity when GDP rises: energy demand and the expansion of transportation. Consider, for example, two of the fast growing economies in the world: China and India. According to estimates by the IEA, global energy demand is likely to increase by 50 per cent by 2030 and these two countries would account for around 45 per cent of that", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c4b98f10-c362-422f-8e29-691c943e5164": {"__data__": {"id_": "c4b98f10-c362-422f-8e29-691c943e5164", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/01", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e6fea509606daf211752c4623887da81578be0a15e00291034a48956a35292ad"}}, "hash": "e6fea509606daf211752c4623887da81578be0a15e00291034a48956a35292ad", "text": "increase.39 39 IEA 2007. 14 In the case of transportation, though considerable fuel economies are expected as well as an increase in the use of hybrid and electric cars, these effects would be more than neutralised by the increase in demand for cars. According to one estimate, the number of cars worldwide will increase by 2.3 billion between 2005 and 2050, and the number of cars in emerging and developing countries will increase by 1.9 billion.40 Investment in road infrastructure is expected to facilitate this trend. To these effects we need to add the increase in emissions on account of energy transmission and distribution systems and air transportation.41 Finally, all this occurs also in the most populous countries of the world with at least one of them (China) characterised by improved well-being even among the lower income deciles of the population.42 The critical issue is the shortfall in access to energy and transport in many countries in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2004 60 per cent of the 1.6 billion people worldwide with inadequate access to energy lived in this region.43 This makes expansion of energy supply an inevitable aspect of the development trajectory here. For a host of reasons varying from costs to the availability of and access to technological options countries in the region that seek to deal with the supply-demand imbalance are increasingly relying on fossil fuels, with an important role for coal. This is particularly true of countries like China, India and Indonesia with large coal reserves.44 The share of the Asia-Pacific region in the world\u2019s coal consumption, which amounted to about 40 per cent in 1999, rose by 81 per cent by 2006. China and India alone accounted for 45 per cent of the world\u2019s consumption by the latter date.45 This is only expected to increase further.46 As for transport, in 2006 Asia accounted for 19 per cent of the total worldwide transport- related emissions. This is projected to rise to 31 per cent by 2030.47 An important reason for past and projected increases in transport-related emissions is the rapid pace of urbanization in the region. The urban population in the region is expected to increase by 44 million every year over the next 20 years, to add another 1.1 billion people. While Asia already has 10 of the world\u2019s 25 largest cities, they are expected to expand even further.48 One consequence of that urbanization is that emerging Asian countries are estimated to have added 35 million vehicles (excluding 2- and 3-wheeled vehicles) to their fleets between 2006 and 2009, with China alone accounting for around 80 per cent of that increase (Figure 5). Vehicle sales in China are expected to continue to increase to reach aggregate North American levels in the not too distant future. 40 Chamon et al. 2009. 41 Helm 2008. 42 According to the Human Development Reports for 2004 and 2009 (UNDP 2004; UNDP 2009), GDP per capita in current US dollars increased from $989 to $3205.5 in China between 2002 and 2007. On the other hand the share of the poorest 10 per cent in income or consumption rose from 1.8 per cent to 2.4 per cent. As opposed to this the corresponding figures for India were $487 to $1176.9 and 3.9 per cent and 3.6 per cent, 43 UNDP 2007, based on IEA 2006. 44 ADB 2009a. 45 ADB 2009a. 46 Garnaut et al. 2008. 47 ADB n.d. 48 ADB 2010. 15 Figure 5: Vehicles sales by region (million) Source: The Economist 2010.

As of 2007, combustion of fuels in the transport sector accounted for 13 per cent of gross worldwide emissions and 23 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions. According to the ADB (2010), of the 6 billion tons of transport-sector related CO2 emissions, 1 billion tons are estimated to be from Asia. Emissions in the region are expected to double by 2030, if changes in transportation patterns occur, and China and India are expected to account for 56 per cent of this increase.\u201d Chinese transport-related CO2 emissions are expected to increase fourfold from 19 per cent of total emissions in 2005 to 27 per cent in 2030, and GHG emissions from India from 8 per cent to 13 per cent of the total.

However, given the legacy of carbon accumulation in the environment, current income levels in many developing countries, and the available technological options, it is unlikely that mitigation would be able to reduce carbon emissions to levels where it could stall warming and climate changes adequately. Thus, adaptation efforts and policies would have an extremely important role to play. 9. The emissions-growth relationship Given the sources of emissions discussed above, analysts have focused on two aspects of the relationship between growth and emissions. One is the nature of the relationship between aggregate and per capita GDP growth, the rate of GHG emission and the concentration of GHG gases. The other is the role of specific technological options and choices in individual sectors in increasing the extent of GHG emission. There are three issues involved in examining the relation between growth and emissions. The first is the relationship between levels of per capita income and the level of per capita emission. The second is the relationship between the increment in per capita GDP and the increment in per capita emissions at different levels of per capita income. And the third is the distribution of population across countries with different levels of per capita income that determines the current volume and the rate of change of aggregate global GHG emission. The evidence does seem to suggest that as average per capita incomes increase, carbon emissions tend to rise monotonically. Studies attempting to examine the relation of GDP to carbon emissions normally use purchasing power parity estimates of GDP rather than GDP valued at market exchange rates. Based on such data, one set of econometric studies52 have found that while there is a monotonic relationship between GDP per capita and per capita emissions measured in terms of CO2 equivalence, the marginal propensity to emit (or the ratio between the increment in emissions and the increment in GDP) tends to fall as income rises within the sample set of countries studied. Overall, the evidence seems to be that global carbon dioxide intensity has been falling over the last three decades or so,53 though there are some who argue that this trend has been stalled or reversed in recent years.54 The point, in any case, is that the reduction in intensities has not meant a fall in CO2 emissions, but merely reflects the fact that emissions growth has not kept pace with GDP growth. This comes through from Table 1, which shows that as we go up the income scale in terms of country groupings, the rise in per capita income is accompanied by a rather sharp increase in per capita emissions. 51 Nuclear power, which was under a cloud after the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl incidents, had seen a revival in recent years on account of technological developments and climate change implications. However, the effects of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan have forced some rethinking with regard to nuclear energy the world over. 52 For example, Heil and Selden 2001. 53 King 2008. 54 Raupach et al. 2007. 17 Table 1: Per capita CO2 emissions by income category of countries Income Category GDP per capita (current US$) GDP per capita, PPP (constant 2005 international $) CO2 emissions (metric tons per capita) High income 37708.05 33890.66 12.49 Upper middle income 7159.52 10893.97 5.26 Middle income 2958.67 5324.65 3.31 Lower middle income 1848.27 3849.60 2.79 Low income 432.47 980.53 0.28 World 8433.89 9535.27 4.63 Source: World Bank 2011. What is striking about these figures is the huge discrepancy in per capita incomes and emissions between the High-income countries and the Middle-income countries and the significant difference between the Upper-middle and Lower-middle income countries both in terms of per capita income (however measured) and in terms of per capita emissions.

Sticking with groups of countries based on the income range we find that the relationship between emission intensities and GDP per capita is non-linear (Table 2). Emissions intensity rises sharply as we move up the ladder from low to lower middle income country groups, but then falls significantly in the upper middle and high income groups.

This does point to the advantages that could accrue if policy is used to accelerate the decline in the marginal propensity to emit, relative to the available historical trend. In 2004, the average CO2 intensity of the more carbon efficient industrialised countries with a diverse combination of electricity production technologies (Germany, Italy, Japan, Switzerland and UK) stood at 321.7 tCO2/Million International Dollars. Global GDP for that year was estimated by the World Bank at Int. $52,673 billion. If all countries had achieved the intensity of these countries, 2004 CO2 emissions would have amounted to 16,946 MtCO2 or 57 per cent of the actual 29,734 million tonnes of CO2.55 The problem of course is that emissions do not depend only on technology, but also on the composition of consumption and production at different levels of income. While at the margin GDP increases may be associated with diversification away from high emission 55 King 2008. 18 intensity sectors, those sectors are still absolutely large even in the developed countries. That is why per capita emissions and share in aggregate emissions of the developed countries are large even though their emissions intensities are lower at the margin. There are two implications emerging from here. The first is that technology acquisition and transfer can help current day developing countries accelerate the rate of decline of emission intensities relative to GDP. But, inasmuch as their levels of development would influence the pattern of consumption and production as income increases, their per capita and aggregate emissions are bound to increase significantly. While some advantages can be garnered from transferring technology developed in the richer countries to the poorer countries through international cooperation, this is as of now unlikely to neutralise the basic tendency towards emission increases due to anthropogenic factors. 10. Decomposition of emission by source If we examine the relative contributions at the margin of OECD (developed) and non-OECD (developing and transition) countries, it emerges that the non-OECD countries, which were responsible for roughly one-third of global emissions, energy, and output in the early 1970s, had increased their shares to just over half of global energy use and emissions, and 45 per cent of global output by 2005. There were signs of acceleration of this trend as well. Between 2000 and 2005, non-OECD emissions had risen almost six times as fast as OECD emissions, accounting for 85 per cent of the growth in emissions.56 The factors underlying these differences come through when we try and analyse the source of emissions in rich and poor countries. Ignoring differences in population and focusing on the role of energy consumption and supply in releasing CO2, through what has been termed the \u201cKaya identity\u201d57, it is possible to decompose the contribution to emissions growth into those due to changes in GDP, energy intensity (of GDP), and carbon intensity (of energy). The identity is as follows: \u2206CO2 =\u2206GDP * \u2206(Energy/GDP) * \u2206(CO2/Energy). Using such a relationship to measure the contributions of these elements to CO2 emissions we find that the influence of all three on emissions had increased significantly in the non-OECD countries as a group.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7550a43e-12d5-4744-a9ed-4bd43d0c9d0a": {"__data__": {"id_": "7550a43e-12d5-4744-a9ed-4bd43d0c9d0a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/01", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4359ba2d4c1d3949f3aca30c76f661e75a2412521c2ec8173e378d79fe4d7bdc"}, "2": {"node_id": "79725438-74d6-42e4-b63f-511c7d116642", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "232c49837a0b72771db787f335ee56f6332c008f3ef3a0aad38e90ef0eca3c3c"}}, "hash": "7ae93fd5aed45ddc52a1be9029c62862de7f41c44c043b86ba66d28b5133f3ea", "text": "On the other hand, the OECD countries have shown a slowdown in growth, and a marginal reduction in energy intensity and carbon intensity during 2000\u201305 when compared with the previous decade.58 What is significant from the point of view of the mitigation effort is the evidence of a significant reduction among developing countries as a group in the rate of decline of the energy intensity of economic activity and the carbon intensity of energy use.

This changed after 2000, with a turn to more energy- intensive and carbon-intensive growth in the developing and transition world. As a result, energy use has grown at three-quarters the rate of GDP, and carbon emissions about a fifth faster than energy use.59 56 Garnaut et al. 2008. 57 Kaya and Yokobori 1997. 58 Garnaut et al. 2008. 59 Garnaut et al. 2008. 19 Overall, while energy intensity (the energy/GDP ratio) has fallen in both developed and developing countries, in the former the decline has been smooth and continuous, while in the latter it fell slowly over the 1970s and 1980s, plunged in the 1990s, and then stabilised at around 70 per cent of its 1971 level. The elasticity of energy use with respect to GDP in non- OECD countries, which was nearly one in the 1970s and 1980s, stood at only 0.25 in the 1990s, but had risen to 0.74 during 2000\u20135.60 These variations could be because of the geographical distribution of growth. If rapid growth is occurring in those non-OECD countries where income levels are such that increases in income lead to a significant increase in energy intensity, then average energy intensity is likely to rise. On the other hand, if growth occurs mainly in countries whose income is beyond the threshold point after which increases in income are accompanied by a decline in energy intensity, average intensity is likely to be stable or fall. In this connection, what is remarkable is the influence of one country, China, on the trend in energy intensity in non-OECD countries. Energy intensities are remarkably constant for developing countries once China is excluded. China started out with an extremely high energy intensity, which declined through the 1980s and 1990s, when it chose to move away from subsidizing energy consumption by keeping prices low, and then stabilized at the turn of the century.61 More recently China\u2019s energy intensity has been rising rapidly. This is undoubtedly related to the pattern of China\u2019s recent development, especially over the last two decades. An aspect of this development is the dominance of manufactured production in the increment to GDP over this period. The industrial sector including power generation and heat production and supply and construction accounts for 84 per cent of China\u2019s CO2 emission.62 India, which recorded lower but significant growth in the 1990s and GDP growth rates significantly closer to that of China during the 2000s,63 has relied far more on services to deliver additions to GDP, with attendant benefits in terms of a much lower energy intensity. One reason for the unusual trajectory of energy intensity in China is the nature of its recent growth trajectory. As is well known, one aspect of China\u2019s trajectory of growth is the significant role of production of manufactures for export, resulting from the logic of a process of globalisation in which capital and technology are far more mobile than labour. This encourages a shift in global production to sites with cheaper reserves of labour of various kinds. In recent years China has emerged as one such favoured site. As a result, China accounts for emissions that are not just induced by its own consumption levels and patterns, but also by part of the increase in the consumption of manufactures elsewhere in the world. That is, China\u2019s emissions would have been far less and that of the rest of the world more, if at the same rate of global growth, all countries had produced domestically a substantial and equal share of the manufactured goods they consumed. This is a matter that we discuss further later in this paper. 11. Trends in carbon intensity The trend in carbon intensity (emissions/energy) is more consistent across time in both sets (OECD and non-OECD) of countries. In the developed world, it declined till the mid-1990s 60 Garnaut et al. 2008. 61 Sheehan and Sun 2007, cited in Garnaut et al. 2008. 62 UNDP China 2010. 63 World Bank 2011. 20 and then stabilised at around 85 per cent of its 1971 level. In the developing world, it was stable through most of the period and has more recently been rising.64 Carbon intensity has on average remained stable despite rising oil prices in recent years because of the increasing reliance on coal, which is more carbon-intensive than oil and gas. In the 1980s and 1990s, a reduction in the share of oil in total energy demand was made up for by a corresponding increase in gas.

Between 2000 and 2005, coal use increased in developing countries on average by 9.5 per cent per year, and by 11.7 per cent in China.65 In 2005, 61 per cent of the world\u2019s coal was consumed in developing countries, up from 51 per cent just 5 years earlier.66 In 2005, coal provided 63 per cent of China\u2019s energy, 39 per cent of India\u2019s energy, and only 17 per cent of the rest of the world\u2019s energy.67 Thus, the acceleration of emissions this decade appear to have been caused by three factors: the rapid acceleration of growth in parts of the developing world; the end of a period of rapid decline in energy intensity in China; and an end to the decarbonization of energy supply in both the developed and (especially) the developing world. To this we must add the much-noted fact that two of the fast growing countries, China and India, have huge populations. Thus even moderate increases in per capita emissions in these countries would result in significant increases in aggregate emissions. It is true that it is not population size alone but the pattern of consumption and of populations in individual countries that determines differentials in emission rates and intensities.68 But the exclusion of population variations and focus on GDP, emission intensities and carbon intensities in the decomposition discussed above does conceal some features of recent trends. In fact, looking at the world as a whole, population is by no means a driver when it comes to emissions. High income countries in 2007 accounted for 45 per cent of total emissions even though they were home to less than 17 per cent of the world\u2019s population (Table 2). What mattered far more is that they accounted for 59 per cent of the world\u2019s income. Lower-middle income countries on the other hand had 56 per cent of the world\u2019s population, but accounted for only 33.9 per cent of CO2 emissions, even though they were less emission efficient, because they contributed only 23 per cent of global incomes. 64 Garnaut et al. 2008. 65 Garnaut et al. 2008. 66 Garnaut et al. 2008. 67 IEA 2007. 68 Satterthwaite 2009. 21 Table 3: Emissions indicators for top 10 CO2 emitting countries Countries CO2 emissions (kg per 2005 PPP $ of GDP) Share in CO2 emissions (kt) CO2 emissions (metric tons per capita) Share in GDP (current US$) Share in GDP, PPP (constant 2005 international $) Share in Population, total CO2 emissions (kt) China 0.95 21.32 4.96 6.26 10.94 19.91 6,533,018.26 United States 0.44 19.03 19.34 25.18 20.86 4.56 5,832,193.98 India 0.53 5.26 1.43 2.21 4.80 16.99 1,611,042.48 Russian Federation 0.78 5.01 10.81 2.33 3.15 2.15 1,536,099.02 Japan 0.31 4.09 9.81 7.84 6.41 1.93 1,253,516.69 Germany 0.29 2.57 9.57 5.96 4.35 1.24 787,291.01 Canada 0.47 1.82 16.89 2.55 1.88 0.50 556,884.03 United Kingdom 0.26 1.76 8.84 5.01 3.29 0.92 539,175.92 Korea, Rep. 0.41 1.64 10.38 1.88 1.92 0.73 502,909.65 Iran, Islamic Rep. 0.67 1.62 6.98 0.51 1.16 1.07 495,581.65 Source: World Bank 2011.

While China\u2019s high contribution was because it accounted for a fifth of the world\u2019s population, the United States with less than a twentieth of the world\u2019s population emerged a leader in emissions because of its high share in GDP and its high per capita income and emission rate. However, when we compare China with India (which too accounts for as much as 17 per cent of the world\u2019s population), the assessment changes substantially (Table 3). China\u2019s high per capita income and manufactures-dependent growth results in a much higher emission intensity (0.95 kg per 2005 PPP $) that is almost double that of India\u2019s (0.53 kg). This makes its CO2 emission almost 5 metric tonnes per person as compared with India\u2019s low 1.43. So even though India has a population close to China\u2019s, its share in emissions is just 5.26 per cent as compared with China\u2019s 21.32 per cent.

The implication is that if India does catch up in terms of per capita GDP with China by pursuing a similar development trajectory, the implications for global atmospheric CO2 levels can indeed be grave. Since the 1990s, GDP increments in India are based more on services than on manufacturing, unlike in China where manufacturing growth has been extremely important. This does rein in emissions to some degree. But given the already high share of services in India\u2019s GDP, it is to be expected that if India sustains its current high rates of GDP, the role of the commodity producing sectors in general and manufacturing in particular would increase substantially. 22 12. Emission trajectories in Asia-Pacific To summarise the point being made, underlying global levels and incremental rates of emission are vastly diverse country contributions due to a combination in each case of accumulated historical emissions, current emissions and potential future emissions. Such divergences characterise countries in the Asia-Pacific region as well, given their varied characteristics, development trajectories and levels and rates of growth. To start with, in terms of CO2 emission per $ of 2005 PPP GDP, Mongolia and China, with 1.33 and 0.95 kg respectively, are clearly outliers in a group of 34 Asia-Pacific countries, developed and developing, for which the relevant data are available from the World Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators database. These two countries are followed by a set of seven countries (Maldives, Malaysia, Thailand, India, Viet Nam, Australia and Indonesia), which recorded emissions per unit of PPP GDP of between 0.5 and 0.6 kg. Tonga, Brunei Darussalam, Republic of Korea, Pakistan and Fiji are close together in the 0.4 to 0.42 kg range, Japan and New Zealand are at 0.3 and 0.31, and the rest consisting of developed countries and regions like Singapore and Hong Kong (SAR), China, and Less Developed Countries like Bangladesh and Bhutan fall below the 0.3 kg range.

It must be noted, however, when the emissions intensity is measured relative to constant price 2000 GDP computed in dollars at market exchange rates, the differences shrink rapidly, excepting for Mongolia. Thus, as indicated in Table 4, China with 2.66 kg per dollar of GDP is closer to India and Viet Nam at 2.08 and 2.12 respectively. Thus, there is no clear linear and monotonic relationship between level of development or per capita income and emissions intensity relative to GDP, so that differences in per capita income are associated with very wide variations in per capita CO2 emissions across countries. Countries like Brunei Darussalam, Australia, Singapore and the Republic of Korea have emissions in the range of 10 to 20 metric tonnes per capita. Japan, New Zealand, Malaysia and Hong Kong (SAR), China, are in the 5 to 10 metric tonnes range. China, Thailand and Mongolia are in the 4-5 metric tonnes range and India and Viet Nam fall as low as in the 1- 1.5 metric tonnes per capita category. However, once we allow for the huge differentials in population, China and India jump to the top of the aggregate emissions league table, only to be followed by Japan, Republic of Korea, Indonesia and Australia. But here too there are important differences. As indicated in Table 5, China with 36 per cent of the population in 39 Asia-Pacific countries, accounts for 55.4 per cent of CO2 emissions, whereas India with 31 per cent of the population contributes only 13.7 per cent. On the other hand, Japan with 3.5 per cent of the regional population contributes 10.6 per cent of annual CO2 emissions. As noted earlier, there is one major difficulty in apportioning responsibility for emissions based on these estimates. The estimates relate only to emissions resulting from production activities within a country\u2019s territory, and not to the emissions implicit in the level and pattern of consumption of the population of a country. With many developing countries becoming the production hubs for servicing the consumption needs of developed country populations, this could convey a wrong impression of the responsibility of the populations of individual countries for global emissions at the margin. As Dieter Helm (2008) argues: \u201cA country (for example, the UK) could have a relatively low production of greenhouse gases, but at the same time have a high consumption level. It could produce low carbon- intensive goods (such as services, rather than manufacturing), but import and consume high carbon-intensive goods (steel, aluminium, glass, and chemicals). In the UK\u2019s case, the shift of high carbon-intensive production to China, India, and other developing countries has had this effect. Furthermore, it could achieve a given Kyoto target by moving energy-intensive industries offshore\u2014without making any noticeable difference to climate change. 25 Some numbers indicate the scale of these effects. On the UN FCCC basis, the UK\u2019s record is impressive, having already surpassed the Kyoto target of a 12.5 per cent reduction by 2008\u2013 12. Just adding back in aviation and overseas activities of UK residents puts a dent in this performance\u2014emissions have fallen only 11.9 per cent. Even this adjustment puts the UK\u2019s meeting of the Kyoto target in jeopardy. But taking all greenhouse gases embedded in imports and subtracting greenhouse gases embedded in exports, Helm et al. (2007) provide a crude estimate that emissions between 1990 and 2003 have increased by 19 per cent.\u201d This should make clear that taking account of emissions associated with a population\u2019s consumption rather than production is critical, especially because human development advance requires enhancing a range of consumptions of populations in developing countries. 13. Development and the carbon space The close relationship between growth and development, on the one hand, and emissions, on the other has two implications.

(2010) set the allowable budget at that level. Then taking account of the 93Gt of carbon that has already been released between 2000 and 2009, they examine the implications of restricting emissions to the balance amount over the rest of the fist half of this century, assuming that nations with less than a fair share of the budget are allowed extra emissions and those with a less than fair share will have to ensure cuts. They find that \u201cthe extent of over-occupation of carbon space by the developed nations is such that they will have only negative entitlements to carbon space in absolute and relative terms until 2050 and beyond\u201d. 69 Kanitkar et al. 2010. 70 Meinshausen et al. 2009. 26 14. The fall-out of climate specific externalities However, to focus exclusively on these differences across countries, when deciding on climate change action, would be to ignore the specificities of climate-related \u201cexternalities\u201d that were highlighted by the Stern Review (2007), among other reports. In keeping with the basic notion of externalities, those who contribute to climate change do not solely or proportionately suffer its consequences, and are not necessarily called upon to undertake and bear the costs of mitigation or forced to finance the costs of adaptation incurred by non- emitters who are adversely affected. With no economic incentives provided by markets to undertake such mitigation, it is unlikely that it would be implemented in adequate measure, if at all, unless governments intervene. What is more, those who contribute to deleterious climate change cannot be excluded from enjoying the benefits that the current climate affords. The problem is that the climate change consequences of global warming are global, affecting countries, even when treated as homogenous entities, that contribute marginally to GHG emissions and have limited responsibility for the atmospheric concentration of GHGs resulting from human activity. In fact, examples of the likely effects of global warming on small island economies, for example, suggest that vulnerability and impact often tend to be higher in the case of countries that are not important GHG emitters. On the other hand, as and when countries that are far behind in the global per capita income league table experience significant acceleration in the growth of their per capita income in the near future, the available bundle of technologies would imply that their contribution to emissions would rise dramatically. The fact that countries like the Republic of Korea, in the not too distant past, and countries like China and India, currently, have experienced or are experiencing such acceleration, explains the growing concern about the possibility of unsustainable changes in climatic conditions. A second important problem associated with global warming resulting from anthropogenic GHG emissions is that the current level of GHG accretion is partly a historical legacy, since once they are in the atmosphere, green house gases remain in place for several, and in some cases hundreds of, years. This implies that even in countries that are responsible for occupying a large part of the available carbon space, current generations may not accept responsibility for a part of the problem and may even absolve past generations of the responsibility of having made climate-deleterious consumption or investment choices, since they did not have prior knowledge of the consequences. While differentials in average per capita incomes and standards of living do provide a strong case for substantially differential distribution of mitigation burdens, the task of persuading current generations to do so is likely to be made difficult for these reasons. Finally, the third problem is that a combination of historically more extreme inequality in the distribution of income and the fallout of the international demonstration effect has meant that a small elite in less developed companies can afford to and does imitate the lifestyle of the global rich, resulting in high, even if not similar, levels of GHG emissions. This weakens any argument that treats the rich, middle and the working classes in the developing countries as a homogenous group when allocating the burden of mitigation and adaptation. 27 15.

In fact, Ravallion et al. (2000) state the conclusion rather strongly as follows: \u201cIn keeping with past work, we find a nonlinear (concave) relationship across countries between carbon emissions and average incomes. Consistently with the cross-country relationship, we have argued that inequality within countries should also matter to emission levels, and this is confirmed by our tests. Our results suggest that a static trade off exists between reducing carbon emissions and promoting lower inequality both between and within countries. We also confirm past results suggesting that a trade off also exists between carbon emissions and economic growth. In the short term, poverty reduction through either redistribution or growth will tend to increase the carbon emissions that promote global warming.\u201d71 In sum, according to this view, efforts to reduce poverty and advance human development are at least in the foreseeable future going to be adverse in their impact from the climate change perspective. The inadequacies with regard to cross-country evidence on inequality need not detain us here. What we need to assess the robustness of this econometrically estimated relationship is an examination of the factors that might account for the observed relationship between income per capita across countries and the marginal emission rate. Technology provides the reason why the marginal propensity to emit declines with higher income. Richer countries have not only developed better technologies (such as fuel-efficient engines), but also have larger shares of population that have the incomes to purchase products that are more carbon efficient even if more expensive. However, once we come to the relationship between intra-country income differences and their effects on the marginal propensity to emit, the non-availability of the technology does not offer an explanation for the differences between rich and poor. It can only be the ability of different sections to consume the appropriate technologies if they were to choose to. If through appropriate policies (such as investment in mass, fuel-efficient public transportation, for example) the government can make these technologies available to the poor as well, there is no reason why a redistribution that reduces poverty and advances human development should necessarily lead to increased emissions per unit increment in GDP. In fact, inasmuch as the presence of a large mass of poor and, therefore, cheaply available workers encourages consumption of a range of labour services by the rich that might otherwise be undertaken assisted by energy intensive equipment, a reduction in inequality due to a rise in the wages of the poor, may increase the marginal propensity to emit of the well to do. That is, it could be the presence of the poor that is rendering the rich carbon-efficient at the margin. 71 To moderate the impact of this heavy-handed conclusion econometrically arrived at, they go on to say: \u201cHowever, we also find evidence of flattening out in the relationship between emissions and average incomes at middle-to-high income levels, and some signs of a reversal in the curvature at high average incomes. Thus it can be argued that the trade off between reducing inequality between countries and controlling carbon emissions will improve with growth, and eventually vanish, roughly when all countries reach the level of present-day middle income countries.\u201d Ravallion et al. (2000). 28 In fact, James Boyce (1994) offers powerful arguments as to why the presence of environmental inequality could lead to intensified environmental degradation. To quote: \u201cFirst, the extent of an environmentally degrading activity depends on the balance of power between the winners, who derive net benefits from the activity, and the losers, who bear net costs. When the winners are powerful relative to the losers, more environmental degradation occurs than in the reverse situation. This reflects the operation of what I term a power- weighted social decision rule. Second, greater inequalities of power and wealth lead to more environmental degradation for three reasons: (a) The excess environmental degradation driven by powerful winners is not offset by the environmental degradation prevented by powerful losers; (b) inequality raises the valuation of benefits reaped by rich and powerful winners relative to costs imposed on poor and less powerful losers; and (c) inequality raises the rate of time preference applied to environmental resources by both the poor and the rich by increasing their poverty and political insecurity, respectively.\u201d The fact that internal inequality is important also affects the positions taken by governments with respect to climate", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "76b1244d-1ada-4ee9-9537-d9aa95ba2081": {"__data__": {"id_": "76b1244d-1ada-4ee9-9537-d9aa95ba2081", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/01", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a169bad9cba24ff0b2f1137f2f4eed30474144c63e8e29c67f27fe6cdd0622df"}}, "hash": "a169bad9cba24ff0b2f1137f2f4eed30474144c63e8e29c67f27fe6cdd0622df", "text": "change action at the national and international level. Governments in rich countries, for example, wanting to appease their poor who contribute much less to climate change than their rich, seek to engage in international negotiations arguing that it is the rapidly growing developing countries that are now contributing and not just adding marginally to the problem. On the other hand, based on the distribution of carbon space and the level of per capita emissions, governments in poorer countries can quite reasonably argue that the responsibility for stalling GHG concentration levels needed to protect their own poor lies largely with the developed countries. The significance of these issues needs to assessed taking into account the reality that the fall- out of climate change is global, and that governments in countries with affected populations cannot be the ones, or at least solely the ones, that devise and impose policies that result in mitigation. One corollary of this is the obvious conclusion that climate change mitigation policy requires global collaboration among governments and peoples, in countries both developed and developing. The other is that countries that are likely to be severely affected cannot wait for the mitigation tangle to be resolved, but have to think of ways that they can adapt to climate change to protect and advance the human development of their populations. There are a number of conclusions that can be derived from all this evidence. Since there appears to be no choice with respect to reducing GHG emissions, all countries must look to what they can contribute to the effort, allowing for the legacy in terms of carbon space occupation. Given that legacy and the current level of per capita emissions, there is no question that the developed countries have a major responsibility here. They would need to halt the increase as well as significantly reduce the level of per capita emissions they contribute. To look to aggregate emissions and try and apportion responsibility in a climate change blame game to highly populated countries and income (per capita) poor countries like India and China would not help. The latter have to be allowed to raise their per capita income levels. But these countries need to look at their emissions relative to their GDPs and their marginal emission intensities to ensure that they do not contribute as much to GHG concentrations as their \u201cpredecessors\u201d did, when they try and raise their per capita income levels. And since the climate change problem is unlikely to be altogether resolved even if mitigation efforts advance, all countries must work together to strengthen the adaptive capabilities of poorer populations in the poorer countries. 29 All that having been said, it is important to recognise the complexity of the task at hand. As Helm (2008) puts it: \u201cClimate change is so intractable because the basic conditions for agreement\u2014and for compliance and enforcement\u2014are largely absent. To name but a few of the problems: the allocation of responsibility for the existing stock of carbon in the atmosphere (which developing countries point out was put there by the industrialized countries) is complex; carbon emissions per head are low in those countries most rapidly increasing their emissions; some countries (and, particularly, some countries\u2019 political elites) may actually benefit from climate change, and generally the effects vary greatly between countries; there are powerful\u2014multidimensional\u2014free-rider incentives; the measurement of emissions (including, to list just a few, rain-forest depletion, soil erosion, methane from permafrost melting, aviation and shipping, agriculture, and ocean and other sink depletion) is at best weak; and there are, at present, no serious enforcement mechanisms. It is hard to think of an international problem which lends itself less to a coherent, credible, and sufficiently robust and comprehensive general agreement.\u201d 16. Mitigation and adaptation As noted above, given the level of certainty associated with the science of climate change and its associated effects, immediate efforts, within a ten-to-twenty year time frame, at mitigation aimed at substantially reducing emissions are a must. Much of this must be focused on the developed countries that need to cut emissions and go beyond commitments under the Kyoto protocol. But developing countries, especially middle-income countries and those registering high rates of growth have a responsibility too. Furthermore, there are significant \u201cexternal\u201d benefits in the human development areas associated with mitigation efforts. For example, reducing the use of coal can directly deliver significant health benefits. Needless to say, integrating these measures with policies aimed at furthering economic development in general and human development in particular would yield better results.

In fact, in their case, the effects are not even transient but involve most often the long-term loss of wellbeing.72 And from a human development perspective it is this inability of the poor to withstand shocks and suffer long- term or permanent damage that is of greater relevance and needs to be addressed by policy. This makes policy to adapt to the effects of climate change quite crucial. On the mitigation front, from a cost effective point of view, measures such as stalling deforestation and expanding forest cover would be a prime objective. But in the final analysis, focusing on reducing the carbon intensity of energy production and consumption and substituting fuel efficient, especially public for private, transport is inevitable if there is to be any real impact. However, given technological capabilities and investment capacities, developing countries would need assistance from the developed for progress with regard to mitigation. While incentivising developed country assistance through market-mediated measures like the clean development mechanism and carbon credits may help, the level of assistance would have to be far higher than what the market would deliver. 72 UNDP 2007. 30 Table 6 provides the IPCC\u2019s summary view on the kind of measures to be taken in developing countries with respect to mitigation.

However, even if some success is achieved on the mitigation front, the achievement is unlikely to be adequate to prevent at least some significant changes in climate variables. Thus adaptation is also an important requirement. As has been noted73, vulnerability to climate change depends upon three factors: exposure of individual sectors of a country to the physical effects of climate change; the degree of intrinsic sensitivity of the natural resource system or the dependence of the national economy upon social and economic returns from that sector; and the degree to which to which adaptive capacity enables these potential impacts to be offset. Building adaptive capacity in critical sectors subject to high exposure and sensitivity, would define the coping capacities of countries and their populations. It needs to be noted that protection from the effects of climate change shocks alone would not exhaust adaptation requirements. They must help preserve long-term capabilities as well. Thus, left to themselves, weather adaptation by the rural poor, may result in low-risk, low- productivity choices in agriculture.74 Hence, adaptation measures must seek to enhance the ability of the poor to improve their productivity while helping them deal with the increased climate risks. 73 See, for example, Allison et al. 2009. 74 Jayaraman 2011. 31 Adaptation is particularly important in developing countries because, as Jayaraman (2011) puts it, \u201cthe temporal scale in which global warming effects will significantly manifest themselves is rapidly closing in on the temporal scale required for action to eradicate or at least sharply reduce these development deficits. For instance, the time-scale over which the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) were to be achieved are comparable to the time- scales over which discernible effects from at least a 1\u00baC rise in global temperature will manifest themselves. Given the delays in the achievement of the MDG it is clear that the problem is being exacerbated and that the two time-scales are approaching each other more closely.\u201d75 It is clear that, reducing the vulnerability of the world\u2019s poor to the potential fall-out of climate change, requires huge investments in infrastructure. Unfortunately, here too the burden falls more heavily on the less developed countries, since assessments indicate that retrofitting existing infrastructure to make them climate-proof is not too heavy a burden for the developed world.

Information is also crucial to the adaptation effort, since it must necessarily be based on assessments of the probable climate impact in various regions. Generating the detailed meteorological data for this purpose would require heaving investment in meteorological systems with advanced scientific capabilities. A wide range of social protection mechanisms together with poverty reduction programs would also be crucial for the vulnerable to deal with climate shocks. In many developing countries such social insurance mechanisms are still in a primitive state. Finally, disaster risk management institutions are a crucial ingredient of successful climate change adaptation. 17. Policy directions for the Asia-Pacific: Mitigation From our discussion above it should be clear that there are many opportunities for cost- effective emission reduction in the Asia-Pacific. The contribution of the region as a whole must (as elsewhere) concentrate on three areas: carbon emissions from fossil fuel use, emissions related to transportation and emissions resulting from deforestation and forest degradation. In addition, given the fact that the region has substantial areas under cropland, managing that land could help sequester carbon in soils. Also being a major rice and livestock producer, the region could contribute to a reduction of methane emissions. Central to the mitigation strategy would be an effort to improve the efficiency of energy use and reduce energy intensities, as well as a process of shifting away from coal and oil (particularly the former) as fuels, by enhancing the share of cleaner energy sources such as natural gas and renewables such as solar energy. Earlier nuclear energy was a preferred option, but given the review of safety considerations and the rethink on nuclear energy in the wake of the 2011 earthquake in Japan and the resulting accident at the Fukushima nuclear power facility, the task of mitigation in this area has been only rendered more difficult. 75 Jayaraman 2011. 32 These changes would have to be engineered from both the supply and demand sides. Supply options include efficiency improvements in power generation, fuel switching from coal to natural gas, and the use of renewable energy including biomass, solar, wind, hydro and geothermal resources. On the demand side, since the principal sources of GHG emissions are industry, the transport sector, and residential and commercial building activity, initiatives are bound to be varied and manifold. The Asian Development Bank (2009b: 134) lists the following: \u201cResidential and commercial building sector: Use of more efficient lighting and electrical appliances, energy efficiency standards and rating programs, improved insulation, and behavioural change. Industry sector: Use of more efficient boilers, motors, and furnaces, improved management practices such as energy auditing and benchmarking, heat and power recovery, fuel switching, and material recycling and substitution, particularly in energy-intensive sectors, such as iron and steel, cement, paper and pulp, and chemicals. Transport sector: Switching to cleaner fuels, use of fuel-efficient vehicles, use of hybrid/electric options in road transport, better traffic management, modal shifts from road transport to rail and public transport systems, promotion of non-motorized transport, and land use and transport planning.\u201d In addition to changes in the primary energy consumption pattern and fuel switching in electricity generation, mitigation options could also include CO2 reduction through Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) technologies. Geological storage of CO2 in oil wells and coal beds and injection of CO2 into deep saline aquifers are possible technological options in the future. Forestry is another area where the Asia-Pacific can make a significant contribution to mitigation, given the large share of forested land area in the region. For example, forests cover about 47 per cent of Southeast Asia\u2019s total land area.76 There are multiple options to reduce GHG emissions or to increase carbon storage in this sector. As noted in Nabuurs et al. (2007), forestry mitigation options include: maintaining or increasing the forest area through reduced deforestation and degradation (REDD) and through afforestation and reforestation; maintaining or increasing carbon density (tons of carbon per hectare) through forest management, forest conservation, longer forest rotations, and fire management; and increasing off-site carbon stocks in wood products and enhancing fuel substitution using forest-derived biomass. Most countries have now recognised that through these means emissions can be reduced significantly at relatively low cost and a greater amount of carbon could be stored in the forests, with other environmental benefits. Finally, agriculture, given its importance, is an obvious target for mitigation policies given its large (even If declining) share in GDP. Options for mitigation of GHG emissions in the agriculture sector include: (i) reducing fertilizer-related emissions; (ii) reducing CH4 emissions from rice paddies; (iii) reducing emissions from land use change; (iv) sequestering", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "74f0e7dd-3983-4e2e-8f90-9f4f62549c50": {"__data__": {"id_": "74f0e7dd-3983-4e2e-8f90-9f4f62549c50", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/01", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f6bac144d773a0594449f9054ce1b0e8a0c1dc23eb7f044ed7491e4749ed336d"}}, "hash": "f6bac144d773a0594449f9054ce1b0e8a0c1dc23eb7f044ed7491e4749ed336d", "text": "carbon in agro-ecosystems; and (v) producing fossil fuel substitutes. According to estimates 76 ADB 2009b. 33 made by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (2006), the economic potential for reducing net emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and soil carbon from cropland in South and Southeast Asia at zero cost would be 2.1 MtCO2-eq in 2010 and 2.3 MtCO2-eq in 2020. In the Asia-Pacific, South, Southeast and East Asian countries are important producers of rice. As a result they can contribute to a reduction of CH4 emissions while ensuring food security. Proper management of continuously flooded rice fields, involving a combination of water management and management of organic and mineral fertilizer inputs, is estimated to reduce emissions of CH4 by between 7 and 63 per cent (with organic amendment) and by 9\u2013 80 per cent (with no organic amendment).77 Put together, measures such as these, which focus on the specific, even though diverse features, of the Asia-Pacific region, can ensure that the region can contribute substantially to the effort to mitigate the problem GHG emissions lading to global warming and climate change. 18. Adaptation: A regional perspective Irrespective of the distance countries travel in the mitigation effort delineated above, it is inevitable that carbon emissions would remain high enough to ensure some degree of warming with likely significant effects on climate in the foreseeable future. Thus, some of the transitions that we are speaking of, which seem to have begun, could extend far enough to affect populations in developing countries adversely. These effects could be significant also because they pose challenges that are unlikely to have been historically experienced. Thus strengthening coping capabilities and helping populations adapt to climate change is crucial. Adaptation, as has been noted, is essentially about reducing vulnerability and increasing resilience. It needs to be noted, however, that the tendency to avoid risk because of their pre-existing vulnerability conditions the poor to livelihood patterns that offer low returns, thus making them less capable of coping and adaptation. Vulnerability to climate variability can lead a section of the poorest into poverty traps, including sale of assets such as livestock and land, loss of human development opportunities, and so on. While a range of adaptation decisions would be required and likely to be made by private individuals and households or rural or urban communities, they are unlikely to go far enough and may even increase vulnerability. Public policy and intervention is crucial. Given the dependence of populations of the region on agriculture for livelihoods and food security, it is to be expected that adaptation efforts in this sector would be crucial. Given its dependence on moisture, managing the effects of extreme weather events like droughts and excessive rainfall leading to flooding would be the focus. Central to that effort would be better irrigation, improved water management practices such as harvesting of groundwater and rainwater and protection of water catchments as well as superior drainage and flood control facilities, along with more R&D focused on adaptive cultivation practices. An essential requirement would be investment in infrastructure, including investment by governments, because adequate private investment is unlikely in these areas given the absence of or insufficiency of short-term returns. 77 ADB 2009b. 34 Agricultural practices would also need to change as an adaptive process would include adjustments of the crop cycle to allow for early or delayed planting and harvesting depending on crop and region. Farmers may also have to move out of certain crops or diversify to accommodate new ones to match changed climate patterns. Efforts are need to conserve water resources and ensure water availability. Changed weather could also introduce new pests requiring appropriate responses. All of this requires not just access to information, but more investment in relevant agricultural research as well as extension services that can wean farmers into adopting new farming methods. With sea levels rising and the likelihood of extreme weather events increasing, populations living in coastal areas and sections dependent on the sea such as fishing communities need to be given special attention. A priority is of course the strengthening of coastal defences and protecting coral reefs and coastal vegetations so as to sustain biodiversity. These too require substantial investments in coastal infrastructure as well as infrastructure suited to disaster management, including systems geared to relocating affected populations in time. In addition since there are likely to be stress factors that could change the natural resources available in the coastal areas and in the sea, information on practices that could help preserve biodiversity as well as adapt to changes in the availability of resources such as fish species and vegetation is crucial.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "503f5ebd-0a87-4e2e-865e-3f9ace463d90": {"__data__": {"id_": "503f5ebd-0a87-4e2e-865e-3f9ace463d90", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/01", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e4e9365be24846445b5e9ea4b08b6b0aa8154ab108633184e624526d65607225"}}, "hash": "e4e9365be24846445b5e9ea4b08b6b0aa8154ab108633184e624526d65607225", "text": "Finally, there would be collateral changes in areas like health that would affect all areas including urban habitations and large cities. This would call for investments and information sharing in areas that may not, in the first instance, appear to be related to climate change. In the area of health, for example, the likelihood of new infections and diseases as well as likely increase in medical emergencies due to extreme events, would necessitate improved disease monitoring systems, early warning regarding the likelihood of unfamiliar infections, and infrastructure that permits quick responses to pandemics and other emergencies. Thus, central to the adaptation effort is substantially increased investment in physical and social infrastructure, the creation of systems for information collection, collation, analysis and dissemination, and an emphasis on strengthening and diversifying a range of extension services offered by the state. 19. Integrating mitigation and adaptation into the development effort Despite the large investments and expenditures necessitated by the challenge posed by climate change, it is by no means an additional \u201cburden\u201d on developing countries. Rather much of the technological improvements made and the infrastructure created could serve a host of development objectives. Investments in irrigation and flood control would help raise productivity, strengthened coastal infrastructure would favour development in those regions, better systems to communicate information and knowledge can be leveraged to serve a range of objectives and improved health facilities would advance human development and strengthen human capital. Moreover, to extract maximum returns from systems aimed at facilitating flexibility and quick adaptation, governments would be required to enhance capabilities through investments in education, for example. Thus, what is needed is to mainstream mitigation and adaptation efforts into national development strategies to facilitate their realisation as well as the realisation of a range of related developmental benefits. 35 But this transformation of national development strategies to respond to the challenge posed by global warming would fall short unless accompanied by a substantial degree of international cooperation. One reason for this is the fact that even though warming could result from national errors of omission and commission, the fall out is global, and in all probability would be experienced more by those less responsible for the outcome. Many of the countries that would be extremely adversely affected by climate change such as the Least Developed Countries and Small Island Economies of the Asia-Pacific, are least responsible for GHG emissions and are inadequately endowed with the resources needed to adapt to climate change. International support for adaptation efforts in such countries is needed not merely on humanitarian considerations but on grounds of justice. On 20 May 2001, the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries held in Brussels adopted the Programme of Action for the LDCs for the Decade 2001-2010, which was subsequently endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 55/279 of 12 July 2001. The thrust of the Programme was to accelerate realization of the Millennium Development Goals in these countries, with an overarching objective of ensuring \u201csubstantial progress toward halving the proportion of people living in extreme poverty and suffering from hunger by 2015 and promot(ing) the sustainable development of the LDCs\".78 For these countries, which need substantial investments in infrastructure to cope and adapt, while domesic efforts are important, aid from abroad can be crucial. \u201cThe BPoA emphasised the importance of Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) and set the following three goals in this regard: 1. Donor countries providing more than 0.20 percent of their GNP as ODA to LDCs were to continue to do so and to increase their efforts (MDG 8, T-13); 2. Other donor countries which have met the 0.15 percent target were required to reach 0.20 percent expeditiously; and 3. All other donor countries which had committed themselves to the 0.15 percent target were expected to reaffirm their commitment and undertake either to achieve the target within the next five years or to make their best efforts to accelerate their endeavours to reach the target. There has been some progress on these fronts as far as the 22 member countries of the OECD\u2019s Development Assistance Committee are concerned\u201d.79 Even in 1996-97 four members (Denmark, Netherlands, Norway and Sweden) were providing aid to LDCs that exceeded 0.2 per cent of their Gross National Income (GNI). By 2007, neither the number of countries in, nor the composition of, the group providing aid in excess of 0.2 per cent of GNI had changed. However, the first of the aid targets had been realised, since all of them continued to provide more than 0.2 per cent of their GNI, with three of them in fact increasing the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ad439c76-3e06-4fe3-94bb-ad94e7b6ab17": {"__data__": {"id_": "ad439c76-3e06-4fe3-94bb-ad94e7b6ab17", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/01", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "97a9debc320a270e928614d8b7ff3494bf19bf312c9c45b14885b46e88dc0f59"}, "3": {"node_id": "fed9e21e-660c-4ffa-ad88-e2e6fcd90328", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b8ff5fc26708cb42cbe3268d00a696b2bd1d47f67e605378a4e166bc96b088cb"}}, "hash": "91ff692bc94af1850c4f64cdebf704ff1debfe89552a5b74bcb4153344b09fd6", "text": "ratio of aid to LDCs relative to GNI.

It was the third of the targets that has remained unrealised, since as compared to 4 out of 22 countries that were providing at least 0.15 per cent of GNI as aid to LDCs in 1996-97, that number stood at a poor 5 out of 22 in 2009.80 78 UN Regional Commissions 2010. 79 UNESCAP 2009. 80 OECD 2009. 36 From a climate change point of view, aid is important because of the importance in building infrastructure in these countries to reduce their vulnerability to the shocks and the long-term impacts of whatever climate change occurs. For the eight countries for which data are available, other than for Myanmar which does not receive significant aid and Maldives which is characterised by a higher level of GDP, the ratio of aid to central government expenditures tends to be high (Table 7).

Note: na: not availaible. This does imply that the pattern of government expenditure could be influenced by donor priorities, reducing \u201caid effectiveness\u201d. To recall, the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (2005) emphasised five principles: ownership of development policies; alignment of donor support to countries\u2019 national development strategies; harmonization of donors\u2019 actions; managing resources and decision-making to ensure results; and making donors and partners mutually accountable for results. These principles could be undermined when donor role is large and overwhelming relative to a country\u2019s own resource mobilisation capabilities. As the OECD\u2019s report (2009: 71) notes: \u201cMany of the problems in aid were perceived as being due in large part to donors \u2013 and not developing countries \u2013 deciding where and how aid should be used. The reasons why donors have often insisted on such a dominant role are not hard to understand: some of the least-developed countries have lacked the political or administrative institutions to support aid projects, or have suffered from such high levels of corruption that donor countries have not felt confident about channelling funding through official channels. At home, donor governments may only have been able to sustain support for their aid programmes with voters and supporters by pointing to concrete achievements in developing countries, such as a new school or hospital. More diffuse achievements \u2013 such as building a development \u201cpartnership\u201d \u2013 have been a harder \u201csell\u201d.\u201d The result has been that aid tends to be diverted to areas where the results are more immediate and more tangible in terms of their impact on objectives like poverty alleviation. The casualty here has been the allocation of aid for economic infrastructure projects, which could be extremely important from a climate change point of view, as we shall see below. If 37 we take total ODA provided by the OECD\u2019s DAC members, even during 1986-87 this sector accounted only for a fifth of total aid disbursed.81 Twenty years later, by 2006-07, that figure had fallen to just 12 per cent.82 This obviously reduces the contribution of aid to strengthening long term development prospects. Further, it means inadequate implementation of the following goals and targets incorporated in the Brussels Programme of Action (BPoA) that are crucial to adaptation.

In fact, developing countries are owed the climate assistance as a matter of treaty obligations under UNFCCC and not as assistance under ODA. Besides these factors, there is one overarching reason why cooperation is central to the mitigation and adaptation effort. Since climate change is partly the result of a legacy of emissions and there are binding limits on the carbon space available for exploitation before permissible levels of GHG concentration are exceeded, cooperation is need to ensure that that space is not quickly and unequally exhausted, leading to an inability to ensure the safety of future generations across the globe. 81 OECD 2009. 82 UNESCAP 2009. 38 References ADB (Asian Development Bank).

The region is also a large emitter of greenhouse gases (GHGs), and unless urgent action is taken to curb emissions, this trend will exacerbate in the future. It is widely acknowledged that a significant increase in public and private financial resources from national and international sources will be required to meet these adaptation and mitigation challenges. While existing literature on \u2018climate change finance\u2019 1 calls for attention to the local aspects of climate change, so far the voices of experiences from the local level have been less audible in the international and national climate change discourse. The local dimension of climate finance is important not only because of the intrinsically local nature of climate change vulnerability, but also because of the critical role of local practitioners in achieving effective results on the ground. A localised response can draw from local knowledge and include the participation of those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Based on a regional consultation in Bangkok in late 2012, a framework was agreed on for shaping effective responses to climate change at the local level. The four pillars, which also guide the discussion in this report, can be summarized as follows: I. An enabling institutional environment for climate change finance: The auton- omy and authority that sub-national governments have to respond to climate change will, to a large extent, be determined by a country\u2019s approaches to political, admin- istrative and fiscal decentralisation. An understanding of the latter is particularly critical in ensuring that finance to address climate change is aligned to the established expenditure responsibilities of sub-national governments. 1 See Essential Bibliography in Annex I, particularly \u201cLocal Governance and Climate Finance: A Discussion Note\u201d; the CPEIR-related documentation; relevant UN-led initiatives and related studies such as UNDP-UNEP Poverty Environment Initiative (PEI), and UNCDF Local Climate Adaptive Living Facility (LoCAL) Anil Gulati/India Water Portal FINANCING LOCAL RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE 4 II. Improved delivery of climate finance: Local governments will have greater scope to respond to specific local vulnerabilities where they have the necessary financial means and discretion to use those resources. Typically, the responsibilities of sub-national governments will be greater than their ability to raise taxes and as such they will be reliant on transfers from central governments (intergovernmental transfers). Climate change will potentially change the size of transfers required, as well as their distribution. Further, the structure of transfers can impact the discretion over which local governments have to address climate change. While providing transfers specifically targeted for climate change projects may be a useful short-term strategy, mainstreaming climate change concerns into ongoing expenditures in relevant areas (i.e. rural development programs, water and sanitation, and agriculture) may bring greater long-term benefits. III. More effective and equitable planning and budgeting for climate initiatives: Responses to climate change at the local level will involve different stakeholders: local government, line departments, and CSOs. Similarly, there is a role for national institutions to provide policy guidance. Given multiple stakeholders, institutional coordination will be particularly critical in ensuring coherent planning and effective budgeting. Central minis- tries can support effective and equitable planning and budgeting for climate initiatives by establishing clear processes and procedures for the incorporation of climate change con- siderations in those processes. Ensuring the participation of communities in the planning process can make them more responsive to the needs of those communities, and is a core aspect of political decentralisation. Transparent and comprehensive budgets will also con- tribute significantly to maximising results. IV. Monitoring and evaluating the local impact of climate finance: Monitoring and evalu- ation frameworks that assess the impact climate change interventions at the local level can serve as a basis to judge the effectiveness and efficiency of climate related expenditures. They can also be used to assess the impact of climate finance on the most climate vulnerable groups. Importantly, the establishment of a good monitoring and evaluation framework and FINANCING LOCAL RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE 5 creating a process where the information is shared with the public can be an effective", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "444608af-ff1c-4c9a-b9ef-577ea922939e": {"__data__": {"id_": "444608af-ff1c-4c9a-b9ef-577ea922939e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-local-responses-climate-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Local Responses to Climate Change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-local-responses-climate-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e2cc0343e565ace971fca11c124d668009fa0980ca417bca55b6fade64932a36"}, "3": {"node_id": "4f6bbcbe-f0fa-4b6a-b452-b48647418a5c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-local-responses-climate-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2d2222d7066c28e8d51188069bb09bec4ad76bb0e24d1be8578034545b5c0d7e"}}, "hash": "8f08102905fe0ddf3d0d3ef84fb16892bda35ba9215230df8947f17a2e5d8a1f", "text": "way of holding local stakeholders to account in the use of public resources and the results that they have contributed to. Given the overlap between development and climate change adapta- tion, it may be possible for these stakeholders to build on existing development indicators as one way to support monitoring the effectiveness of certain adaptation interventions. There is also value in monitoring the institutional capacity of local governments to respond to climate change. Taken together, these four pillars are intended as an overarching framework that can be used to inform a suitable approach to ensure that finance is channelled and used effectively to address climate change at the local level.

An increase in public and private financial resources from national and international sources will be required to meet these adaptation and mitigation challenges. The upcoming Green Climate Fund (GCF) and other international sources of funds already available 3 are expected to mobilize \u201cadequate, predictable and sustainable\u201d 4 financing, therefore increasing and re-balancing the overall flow of climate finance 5 to developing countries. At the same time, previous Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Reviews (CPEIR) undertaken in the region have illustrated that responses to climate change are largely funded from domestic resources. A thorough analysis of the quantity and quality of domestic resources 6, as well as the domestic climate finance architecture will be required to align additional international finance to existing country needs and systems. The CPEIRs provided further substance and quantitative evidence to initial findings already identified by the \u201cLocal Governance and Climate Change\u201d 7 report and other relevant initiatives 8 on the issue. Particularly, they raised the importance of the local 2 Lohani, B., (2012) Bank, November 2012, http://www.adb.org/news/op-ed/asia-pacifics-vulnerability-climate-change 3 Global Environment Facility, Adaptation Fund, Climate Investment Funds (amongst many others). 4 UNFCCC (2007): Bali Action Plan 5 See definition of climate finance in the box, and relevant bibliography (UNEP 2010, ODI 2010). 6 CPEIRs have been undertaken in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Nepal, Samoa, and Thailand, and are currently being carried out in Indonesia, Timor Leste and Viet Nam.

In countries where CPEIRs were undertaken (as well as other countries in the region 10), it was evident that relevant climate change policies have been developed and often comple- mented by institutional coordination mechanisms. At the same time, however, this has not translated into costing of such policies, and the actual expenditures on climate activities are driven by sector specific policies, rather than overarching climate change policies; this is also the case at the local level. All CPEIRs also identified decentralisa- tion and local governance processes as critical to ensure that climate change expenditures respond to location specific contexts and reach the poor and vulnerable. However, so far the role of local governments, civil society organizations (CSOs) and other relevant stakeholders at the local level still remain largely marginalised from national discussions. The objective of this report is to better under- stand the significance of local governance and decentralisation in the delivery of climate finance, and to strengthen its coherence, responsiveness, and effectiveness.

The report presents a regional picture, supported by specific exam- ples from several countries across the region, of the most relevant trends, challenges and opportunities in relation to financing local- ised responses to climate change. It will refer to the relevant literature mentioned above, and build on country information 11 collected across the region, through the country dialogues initiated in Cambodia and Paki- stan 12, and the outcomes of the regional workshop that took place in Bangkok in October 2012 13. This workshop resulted in a commonly agreed regional framework (four pillars) for action in relation to the effective delivery of climate change finance at the local level and a set of draft country action plans to reach the objectives mentioned above. 11 See Annex III: Summary of Country Evidence 12 See Annex IV: Summary of Country Dialogues 13 See Annex II: Summary of the Regional Workshop. Stakeholders at the local level: Local level actors: local administra- tions, line agencies at the local level, local CSOs, and local private sector players (i.e. local SMEs) National and international level actors (whenever operating at the local level): central administration, line ministries, national/international CSO, donors and development partners, and private sector players that oper- ate in relation to climate change at the local level. FINANCING LOCAL RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE 10 CLIMATE FINANCE AT THE LOCAL LEvEL FINANCING LOCAL RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE 11 2.1 Situating the Discourse on Climate Change at the Sub-national Level A few basic preliminary definitions are deemed necessary to frame the discussion on the importance of the local dimension of climate change. 2 Setting the stage: basic definitions of climate change Mitigation and Adaptation CC Mitigation (CCM): refers to any strategy or action taken to remove Green House Gas (GHG) emissions released into the atmosphere, or to reduce their amount. CCM activities include renewable energy projects, energy efficiency and fuel switch, forestry and land use, sustainable urban transport and sequestration projects, and technical assistance, capacity building and policy support in relation to reducing GHG emissions. CC Adaptation (CCA): refers to the ability of a system to adjust to climate change in order to reduce its vulnerability, and enhance the resilience to observed and anticipated impacts of climate change. CCA activities are aimed to reduce vulnerability in several areas of development work such as water, agriculture, infrastructure, health, etc., including capacity building and climate policy direct budgetary support in relation to addressing climate change vulnerability. Vulnerability to CC is a function of 3 variables: Exposure (status of human and socio-economic assets of the system, and climatic variability and hazards in the system); Sensitivity (degree to which the system will be affected by CC); and Adaptive Capacity, or Resilience (potential of a system to adjust to climate change and its impacts).

It therefore follows that responses to climate change, particularly climate change adaptation, may also need to be location specific. 14 A localised response will involve local knowledge and should ideally include the participa- tion of people who are most vulnerable to the impact of climate change.

In South-East Asia, 75% of the region\u2019s Greenhouse Gas Emissions arose from the Land Use Change and Forestry sec- tor. 16 Within this sector, there have been numerous efforts to strengthen local governance to broaden participation in decision-making and management of forests by local peoples; facilitate fair and equitable sharing of the benefits from forests and to respect customary and traditional rights of indigenous and local communities. 17 For example, the UN-REDD + program in Viet Nam is seeking to build upon existing decentralisation frameworks to pro- mote mitigation in the forestry sector. 18 14 UNDP and UNEP (2011) 15 Action Aid Bangladesh (2012) 16 ADB (2009) 17 UNFF (2004) UNFF (2004) http://www.un.org/esa/forests/pdf/cli/finalinterlakenreport.pdf 18 Climate and Development Knowledge Network (2012) http://cdkn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Vietnam- InsideStory_6pp_final_low-res-copy1.pdf FINANCING LOCAL RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE 13 Notwithstanding the value of localised responses to climate change, they cannot happen independently of national level frameworks, nor can they be implemented in an isolated manner. For example, the management of water resources is an area where communities are interdependent: a hydropower investment in an upstream locality to promote mitiga- tion could potentially affect the resilience to climate change of down-stream communities. Likewise, as will be discussed in subsequent sections, the ability of local actors to respond to climate change will depend largely on the extent to which existing national policies allow them to act at their own discretion. Cambodia Community Based Adaptation Project (CCBAP) The purpose of the CCBAP (2010\u20132012) is to: 1. Reduce climate change vulnerability in the agricultural sector (water scarcity) and 2. Increase the adaptive capacity of targeted communities to manage the additional risks of climate change (by mainstreaming climate change in commune development planning and by documenting good climate change adaptation practices). By using a Vulnerability Reduction Assessment (VRA), the CCBAP ensures that its for- mulation entails a truly participatory process. The project is designed to address gaps highlighted in the Cambodian National Adaptation Programme of Action 2006, which focused on improving community capacity and enhancing community-based initiatives to cope with climate hazards. As a result, (i) resilience has been built in 150 vulnerable communities in \ufb02ood/drought prone areas in the Tonle Sap, southern and northeast regions of Cambodia; (ii) 60% of targeted communes mainstream climatic information and VRA into commune development plans; and (iii) good practices shared (to in\ufb02uence changes of policy and programme development). The project is being implemented by using GEF Small Grants Programme (SGP) through SIDA and AusAID funding (US$ 2,850,000 million).

The challenge is to clarify the appropriate assignment of roles and responsibilities between institutional actors, both vertically (i.e. central, regional or district government bodies) and horizontally, (i.e. different actors across each of those levels), and how those responsibilities should be supported with adequate resources. In this regard, it is necessary to better understand a country\u2019s approach to decentralisation. 2.2 Pillars of Climate Change Finance at the Local Level a. Enabling Institutional Environment for Climate Change Finance The autonomy and authority that sub-national governments have to respond to climate change will, to a large extent, be determined by a country\u2019s policies on decentralisation. Decen- tralisation is a process through which authority and responsibilities are transferred from the central government to sub-national levels. It is highly context-specific and dynamic, and the diversity in Asia-Pacific ranges from countries where sub-national governments have a signifi- cant amount of independence, to those that are tightly controlled by the central authorities 19. The three fundamental dimensions of decentralisation are: political decentralisation, admin- istrative decentralisation and fiscal decentralisation. Political decentralisation is a process whereby citizens and their elected representatives have more control in the formulation and implementation of policies.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8fec1caa-0583-46bd-817b-9c9385d50d5a": {"__data__": {"id_": "8fec1caa-0583-46bd-817b-9c9385d50d5a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-local-responses-climate-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Local Responses to Climate Change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-local-responses-climate-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c8b3eb76339c64451a8ea6cd5d361722da1b7bd8ebc9bcaafd136475cde1482d"}, "2": {"node_id": "d79a043f-e735-43ac-89d0-f80b4cc47002", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-local-responses-climate-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bc0ddb25f051b688bb4e65ae44abeb442fd2eb34d35b508ca88e54af74b7a31a"}}, "hash": "4907d7840ada12942ec004c08a8346fb3b62766bcee7e8ea45feb2db4ab77dcb", "text": "This, like other ele- ments of decentralisation, requires legal reforms and constitutional provisions, and is closely associated with the institutional set-up of the decentralised and local governance system. 19 FAO, GTZ (now GIZ), Swiss Development Cooperation, UNDP, and the World Bank, The Online Sourcebook on Decentrali- sation and Local Development, explains the basic dimensions of how decentralisation takes place, http://www.ciesin. org/decentralization/SB_entry.html FINANCING LOCAL RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE 15 Where there is a strong political decentralisation, even if the resource base is weak, there is more discretion for both elected body, and administrative body to plan and decide on expenditures that reflect the demands of the local population.

This can help to articulate their priorities through, for example, people\u2019s participation in district develop- ment committees meetings. Recent approaches to participatory budgeting to influence decisions on local climate-related investments have been explored by community-based adaptation initiatives (such as the example from Cambodia). In principle, political decen- tralisation and this type of participatory planning can help to ensure that climate change finance is used to better reflect and respond to the demands of the local population. Administrative decentralisation takes place when there is a redistribution of authority, responsibility and financial resources for the provision of services among the different tiers of government. The degree to which this happens varies. Firstly, deconcentration, which can be manifested through strong field administration under the supervision of central government ministries, is a weaker form of decentralisation, as the decision-making author- ity remains at the central level. A more significant level of decentralisation occurs through delegation, where central governments transfer responsibility for decision-making and the administration of public functions to organisations that are not fully controlled by the central government, but are still accountable to it. Finally, the most evolved form of decentralisa- tion happens where the authority for decision-making, finance, and resource mobilisation is transferred to the sub-national level through devolution. Given the different pace at which decentralisation is taking place in Asia, the situation in countries is often one where there is a combination of different levels of administrative decentralisation 20. Cambodia provides an interesting example (though by no means unique) 20 See World Bank (2005) East Asia Decentralises \u2013 Making local government work. FINANCING LOCAL RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE 16 of mixed levels of administrative decentralisation: while line departments of central ministries are effectively deconcentrated (closely supervised by central ministries), the communes have delegated functions (they still are held accountable and need to get approval of their expen- ditures from the national level). At the same time there are several project-based initiatives which function quite independently from the central administration, in a devolved fashion 21. Fiscal decentralisation is another core component of decentralisation: if entities at the local level are expected to carry out their decentralised functions effectively, they will require the financial means to do so. It therefore has a considerable impact on the effectiveness and impact of political and administrative decentralisation. 22 Fiscal decentralisation refers to the division of spending responsibilities and sources of rev- enue between levels of government (i.e. national, regional, local). To ensure that finance is used most effectively and channelled to where it is needed, it is necessary to understand how expenditures are assigned to different levels of government and to align the response to climate change accordingly. At the same time, addressing climate change is not a new functional responsibility or expenditure assignment for local stakeholders 23. In fact, one of the main findings of the CPEIRs is that in all the countries that have been studied, central and local governments are already spending resources to adapt to climate change through a range of existing functional responsibilities. For example, spending on rural development programs for agri- culture, water and sanitation and disaster risk management inter alia, promotes resilience to climate change and are addressing some of the worst effects of climate change. However, although, climate change will not necessarily change expenditure responsibilities, it may have implications for the size of investment required at different levels of government. 21 See Cambodia CPEIR (2012) and the country case study for detailed figures in particular on fiscal decentralisation. 22 Davey K, (2003) 23 UNDP, UNCDF, UNEP (2010) FINANCING LOCAL RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE 17 Climate change related responsibilities accentuate the gap between the revenues that local governments are able to raise, and their spending responsibilities. Even with additional funds through intergovernmental transfers, local governments may not have sufficient discretion over their use, to address the specific challenges brought on by climate change. Given that these challenges will not be uniform across the country, as certain regions might, for example, be more vulnerable to drought, while others may be more susceptible to flood- ing, budget holders will also need to take into account these specificities in the process of distributing resources to different levels of government. COUNTRY CASE STUDY: Pakistan Amendment XVIII The 18th Constitutional Amendment in Pakistan was passed by the National Assembly in April 2010. This has many implications for the government of Pakistan at both Federal and Provincial levels. Firstly, 47 subjects (functions) and 18 federal ministries including functions that are directly or indirectly related to climate change response have been devolved to the Provincial level.

Through the amendment stipulates the establishment of local governments in all four provinces, with an increase in their administrative, fiscal and political autonomy, it provides little clarity on which specific functions will be delegated, or how they should be politically constituted. Further, while some measures are assumed to increase the provinces\u2019 ability to retain control of their revenue, most taxes will continue to be redistributed through the federal centre. With regard to climate change, there is no particular insti- tution at the Provincial level which has been assigned with this specific mandate. At the same time, many of the sectoral ministries that are present at the Provincial level are already addressing various manifestations of climate change. The inter-provincial transfer of resources is managed through the National Finance Commission Award. In 2009, the NFC increased the transfers from the federal government to the provinces by about 10%. However, as this took place before the adoption of the 18th Amendment, the provision does not take into account the additional responsibilities that the provinces are now meant to fulfil. Seidle, L., and Khan, Z., Federalism and Eighteenth Amendment: Challenges and Opportunities for Transition Management in Pakistan, December 2012; FINANCING LOCAL RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE 18 b. Improved delivery of climate finance Financing responses to climate change should be aligned with existing expenditure respon- sibilities, where possible. Typically, the responsibilities of local governments will be greater than their ability to raise taxes and as such they will be reliant on transfers from central or regional governments (intergovernmental transfers). In addition, they might also receive international public finance. This could be both from dedicated climate finance funds, like the Climate Investment Funds, as well as development finance that has possible co-benefits from a climate change perspective. This section focuses on intergovernmental transfers. The structure of intergovernmental transfers can affect the way in which these resources are used. Central and regional governments (and donors) use the structure of transfers to influence the level of discretion that local governments have over the use of the resources available. Broadly speaking these transfers can be broken down into two groups: General-purpose grants General-purpose grants are provided to supplement local government budgets and can be used at the full discretion of the recipient (these grants are also called untargeted or uncondi- tional grants). They are intended to promote local autonomy over the use of funds and also improve equity between regions/localities. 24 At the same time, they are important instru- ments to strengthen political decentralisation, and bottom-up participatory planning. Under this type of transfer, there is no requirement that the money would be used to finance actions relevant to climate change. They usually empower the beneficiary constituency, providing a certain degree of discretionary power to the local government to plan and use the financial resources to better meet its objectives. Where there is certain level of political and administrative decentralisation, the local government will often conduct consultative 24 See Shah A. (2006) A Practitioner\u2019s Guide to Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfers in World Bank (2007a) FINANCING LOCAL RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE 19 and participatory planning processes 25. Such processes are more likely to establish initiatives that are responsive to the needs of the communities. Due to the heightened involvement of those communities in the planning process, it is also likely that they will be more inclined to hold their local government accountable to an efficient and transparent use of the resources to deliver on the stated objectives 26. This type of transfer also confers greater responsibility to local government in terms of plan- ning and budgeting. Necessary skills must be put in place to enable local governments to fulfil their responsibilities to plan, manage and monitor the use of the funds. As the experi- ence of the Commune / Sankgat Fund (CSF) has demonstrated in Cambodia (see Cambodian case study example on page 22), developing capacities in the area of financial planning, budgeting, and screening and prioritisation of projects is a long-term process, and not specific to climate change. There are other legitimate concerns that need to be taken into account. For instance, in a situation when decentralisation is not yet at a mature stage, or when decisions are made to decentralise functions without adequate support, the con- cerned actors at local level may be unprepared to absorb such an increase of responsibility and funding in a short period of time 27. It can also lead to increased chances of corruption, unless adequate mechanisms are put in place to curb", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "594c05d7-bcb5-4489-b5fa-c6f6b8e85dd6": {"__data__": {"id_": "594c05d7-bcb5-4489-b5fa-c6f6b8e85dd6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-local-responses-climate-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Local Responses to Climate Change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-local-responses-climate-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "681dac6c8d488e2dff8d63f1f14f00e261e6ceb93b075c35304e4108199f8094"}}, "hash": "681dac6c8d488e2dff8d63f1f14f00e261e6ceb93b075c35304e4108199f8094", "text": "the possibilities of resource leakages. On the other hand, it can be argued that the only way to strengthen the local systems to take on these additional responsibilities is through practice. Specific-purpose grants Specific-purpose grants (also called conditional grants or targeted grants) are targeted to sup- port expenditures in a particular sector, program or activity. The level of discretion provided to governments with specific-purpose grants is highly variable. 25 See for example the Nepal Local Self Governance Act, 1999. 26 See more examples of participatory processes throughout Asia Pacific in UNDP (2011d) 27 See Pakistan\u2019s case study above. FINANCING LOCAL RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE 20 Often central governments will target grants for specific sectors as a means to try and stimu- late expenditure in a sector favoured by the national policies, although the manner in which it spent within the sector is left at the discretion of the concerned sector. Working through the existing arrangements for assigning sectoral expenditure responsibilities to different lev- els of government, this type of transfer is a possible approach that could be used to increase expenditures in vulnerable sectors at the local level. However, this may be more appropriate for transfers from the centre to district or provincial governments, rather than to the lowest tiers of local government. At the lowest level, budgets are not always divided or managed along sectoral lines, and line departments are often not present. Specific-purpose transfers can be much more prescriptive in terms of what activities can be financed with the resources provided. Often transfers to local governments will be for specific projects and fall under \u2018development budgets\u2019. Although \u2018development budgets\u2019 are seemingly used to fund capital investment, in many countries, funding of projects is often Bigstock FINANCING LOCAL RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE 21 used as a means for central governments to have greater visibility over how resources are being used (irrespective of whether it is capital investment being funded). One way central governments are therefore trying to have more direct influence over the resources available for climate change is by making money available for specific climate change projects that are approved centrally or regionally. This can be done through budget- ary allocations, as is the case in Viet Nam, where climate change budget support is allocated to specific projects at all levels of government. 28 Alternatively, certain countries have created dedicated funding mechanisms that provide grants to climate change related projects. The People\u2019s Survival Fund in the Philippines is an example of where this has been done. 29 Local stakeholders and NGOs can make specific requests for projects related to climate change that are financed through the centrally-managed fund. \u2018Specific-purpose grants\u2019 can also be broken down into \u2018input-based\u2019 and \u2018output-based\u2019 transfers. The transfers discussed above are input-based transfers: they specify the areas where expenditure must take place, but not what needs to be achieved with those resources. On the other hand, \u2018output based transfers\u2019 are conditional upon the achievement of certain outputs and are used as a means to hold sub-national government to account. \u2018Output- based\u2019 transfers have been considered in the context of REDD+ programs, where payments are contingent on results. 30 Implications for financing local responses to climate change Providing transfers specifically targeted for climate change projects may be a useful short- term strategy to address immediate needs (for example, aftermaths of a flood), and they may contribute to stimulating additional local expenditures on climate related actions. 28 Miller M. (2012) 29 See for example Congress of the Philippines, Republic Act No. 10174, Manila 30 See for example Ministry of Finance, Green Paper: Economic and Fiscal Policy Strategies for Climate Change Mitigation in Indonesia, Ministry of Finance and Australia Indonesia Partnership, Jakarta. FINANCING LOCAL RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE 22 In practice, the cross-cutting nature of climate change means that local governments will use resources from both general purpose transfers and specific purpose transfers that have implications for climate change. In the medium to long-term, governments should be aiming to mainstream climate change considerations into on-going expenditures (and by exten- sion, in planning and monitoring systems as well). As such, the challenge will be to ensure that general purpose transfers and sector-based transfers are utilized in such a way that factor in climate considerations. Transfers should also consider the specific need that they are addressing. For example, for local climate change adaptation, maintaining a high degree of autonomy on how those resources are used is important, and as such increasing \u2018general purpose grants\u2019 may be more appropriate.

Effective and equitable local planning and budgeting for climate initiatives As discussed in the previous sections, the autonomy and authority local governments have to decide upon their budgets will depend upon existing decentralisation policies in place, as well as on the structure of financial transfers they receive. Where local governments have the financial means and discretion to use those resources, their ability to respond effectively will increase. In this regard, responses at the local level will involve different stakeholders \u2013 local govern- ment, line departments, and CSOs; similarly, there is a role for national institutions to provide policy guidance. Given multiple stakeholders, institutional coordination will be particularly critical in ensuring coherent planning and effective budgeting. FINANCING LOCAL RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE 23 31 See Cambodia CPEIR (2012). 32 The figures include both on-budget and off-budget funding. 33 See Cambodia CPEIR (2012). COUNTRY CASE STUDY: Cambodia climate finance landscape Cambodia is one of the world\u2019s most vulnerable countries to climate change. 31 The CPEIR exercise carried out in 2012 analyzed how Cambodia\u2019s response to cli- mate change is currently being financed. Insights from the report have implications for thinking through how Cambodia might provide an effective local response to climate change. Climate-relevant expenditures grew from 14% in 2009 to nearly 17% in 2011 32, for a total of US$ 769m. Of these, central and sector-based budget allocations still represent the vast majority (approximately 70%) of total government expenditures. The institutions with the largest expenditure are the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (with 27% of total climate expenditure), the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology (13%) and the Ministry of Health (10%). Only 20% of the national budget is allocated to the sub- national level: 15% to the line departments of central ministries; 3% directly to the commune; and the remain- ing 2% through project-based resources 33. The allocations are made through the line minis- tries down to provincial level. At this level, the line departments have a relatively large amount of funds compared to the communes, who have limited resources. However, though in limited amount, the latter have more autonomy and discretion on how they use the funds, as the elected Commune Council facilitate a participatory process of decision-making vis-a-vis the allocation of the Commune Sangkat Fund. Though the communes have no legal mandate to address issues related to natural resources (due to limited delegation), the funds are known to have been used for rural roads (65%), irrigation (17%) and rural water (6%), all of which are relevant to climate change adaptation. The Organic Law (2008) also presents opportunities to combine the efforts of the provinces and the com- munes, as the law stipulates that district and provincial councils are expected to adopt a unified administration that must work very closely with the communes to coordination public administration and public services within their territories. Sources: Cambodia CPEIR, 2012; Plummer J., Tritt G., Voice and Decision-Making: a Study of Local Governance Process in Cambodia, World Bank, Asia Foundation, 2012 FINANCING LOCAL RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE 24 Establishing clearly demarcated roles and responsibilities to respond to climate change at the center (ministries of environment, sector ministries, finance and planning ministries, central ministries that oversee local government); and considering the key points of inter- action between these ministries and respective agencies at different levels of government is important to avoid duplication of efforts. Furthermore, how government interacts with civil society and local population will also affect the extent to which budgets are responsive to local preferences and priorities. Support to existing coordination mechanisms (such as existing Climate Change working groups, steering committees on disaster risk management etc.) can facilitate such multi-stakeholder interaction. However, there must be clarity on the different roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder, as well as the expectations of the various committees to avoid duplication of efforts.

This is a challenge given that climate change is not a specific function, but rather cuts across functional areas. In Bhutan, local governments are tagging expenditures that are related to climate change adaptation, with support from UNCDF. 34 The Nepal Climate 34 UNCDF (2012a) FINANCING LOCAL RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE 25 Change Budget Code is another example where expenditures are being tracked based on their climate relevance. Alternatively, budget documentation can be used to highlight certain priority areas of expenditure and key new spending initiatives that are relevant to climate change. Keeping communities informed about activities and related expenditures can lead to a more accountable use of public resources, an issue that is closely tied to the monitoring and evalu- ation process. COUNTRY CASE STUDY: Localised Planning and Budgeting for Climate Change in Nepal Nepal is a post-con\ufb02ict Least Developed Country (LDC) and highly vulnerable to climate change (2 million people highly vulnerable and over 10 million under increasing risk) 36. As of March 2010 (Bird, 2011), a total of USD 650 million has been made available in Nepal from a number of cli- mate-related initiatives, namely the National Adaptation Plan of Action (NAPA) and the Strategic Programme for Climate Resilience (SPCR). Significant progress has been made in Nepal to establish a coherent institutional archi- tecture and a clear repartition of roles at different levels of government. To support the local implementation of the NAPA, the government of Nepal has recently devel- oped a national framework for the development of Local Adaptation Plans of Action (LAPAs). The LAPA framework attempts to make adaptation planning a bottom-up, inclusive, responsive and \ufb02exible process that identifies the most climate vulnerable people and allows them to make informed decisions on priority adaptation actions. Key benefits expected from alignment of the NAPA and LAPAs are: improved integration between planned and autonomous adaptation; targeting of resources to the most vulnerable; and bridging the gaps between vulnerability assessments and planning and implemen- tation processes. The LAPA is intended to be practical so that national and top-down assessments of climatic risks are integrated with bottom-up planning of adaptation needs, options and priorities in a way that encourages people\u2019s participation, enabling better recognition of the highly differentiated nature of adaptive capacity within the local level itself.

Monitoring and Evaluation of the local impact of climate finance 35 Establishing or strengthening a monitoring and evaluation framework, in the context of cli- mate change related activities, has a number of purposes. These frameworks can serve as a basis to judge the effectiveness and efficiency of climate related expenditures. They can also be used to assess the impact of climate finance on the most climate vulnerable groups. The development of monitoring and evaluation frameworks for climate change is complex. Developing suitable metrics for measuring adaptation is particularly challenging given its broad scope: metrics will vary depending on the sector being monitored. Given the overlap between development and climate change adaptation, it may be possible for local govern- ments to build on existing development indicators as one way to support the monitoring of the effectiveness of certain adaptation interventions: Within international development contexts, it is reasonable to propose that successful adaptation secures inclusive development in the face of climate change that might oth- erwise undermine it. In other words, success in adaptation keeps development \u201con-track\u201d. The implication of this conclusion is that standard development indicators may have a role to play in assessing the success of adaptation (Brooks et al. 2010). In addition, the ability to demonstrate the impacts of interventions in a transparent and accountable manner will be a useful tool for governments to mobilize additional interna- tional funds. For example, the UN-REDD+ programme in Viet Nam\u2019s proposed structures for independent verification of forest inventories have been agreed as a key requirement for financial transfers as part of the global UNFCCC understanding on measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) of emissions reductions. 35 See United Nations Statistics Division (2013), Country Profile: Nepal, http://data.un.org/CountryProfile.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bb652851-0879-4bd5-9d86-37a0bc7838a3": {"__data__": {"id_": "bb652851-0879-4bd5-9d86-37a0bc7838a3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-local-responses-climate-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Local Responses to Climate Change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-local-responses-climate-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5eebec5df5e406d766725f64a13de694fc9c5a647ae8e0990200ad89362f74ac"}, "2": {"node_id": "3f6e4a52-6048-4896-98bb-9fa8afbeea86", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-local-responses-climate-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a594ab77e7ce48ccf89dd79e5833386ccad1cc78f10aae3970015276cfb1c658"}}, "hash": "ad5d62223298aa4c7b87da040dc5df7425d8d6c2578bdeb54ec5d0752f0dbb30", "text": "aspx?crName=Nepal FINANCING LOCAL RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE 27 Importantly, the establishment of a robust monitoring and evaluation framework, and creat- ing a process where the information on climate related activities is shared with the public can be an effective way of holding local stakeholders to account in the use of public", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b84bc5d7-22d1-49b5-b299-335a32f1aadf": {"__data__": {"id_": "b84bc5d7-22d1-49b5-b299-335a32f1aadf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-local-responses-climate-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Local Responses to Climate Change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-local-responses-climate-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "322299686e8ab10cc3d9f2935f4a24506cba5357c816ac89229e046865c60298"}}, "hash": "322299686e8ab10cc3d9f2935f4a24506cba5357c816ac89229e046865c60298", "text": "resources, and the results that they have contributed to. In this regard, civil society organisations and the media can be effective vehicles not only to disseminate the information, but also to take on their oversight roles. Along with the central government, CSOs can also play a role in the promotion of sharing and exchange of monitoring and evaluation reports from donor, gov- ernment and NGO-led projects. This can lead to practitioners learning from successes and failures to inform the future design of climate change programmes, not only at local level, but also for national efforts. Finally, as well as monitoring and evaluating the \u2018downstream\u2019 impact of mitigation and adaptation interventions, there is also value in monitoring the institutional capacity of local government to respond to climate change. For example, the previous sections have high- lighted some of the support required by local governments in terms of awareness raising, mainstreaming climate change concerns in local planning and budgeting processes, clari- fying institutional responsibilities, undertaking participatory planning exercises and so on. Setting out clearly proposed reform plans and then tracking progress against the plans is a useful way to monitor and evaluate the impact of initiatives aimed at building capacity at local level. FINANCING LOCAL RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE 28 THE WAy FORWARD FINANCING LOCAL RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE 29 3 t he Previous sections hAve summArised the key chAllenges for the local delivery of climate finance along the main four pillars identified. The following section summarises the most relevant next steps to improve each of these pillars, which were initially identified in consultations with countries, and were further refined and completed by a diverse group of stakeholders at the regional workshop in Bangkok in October 2012. Most of the ways forward listed below are broadly recognised in a number of coun- tries in the region (with a varying level of importance, depending on each country context). In many cases, challenges and next steps are common or very similar not only across countries, but also across stakeholders. Moreover, while they have been regrouped along the four pillars, which are the foundation of the regional framework and frame chapter two 36, they could be categorised thematically or by stakeholder group as well. It is worth mentioning that this list does not pretend to be exhaustive, but is an initial identification of common dimensions and recurring themes across the region, to provide an agreed starting point that could guide further action. a. Enabling institutional environment for climate finance In relation to the lack of an enabling environment, which includes issues such as policies on decentralisation, insufficient coordination, lack of political leadership, lack of awareness, and knowledge and capacity gaps, a number of next steps and ways forward were common to a number of country action plans, and also emerged in the regional framework. The most prominent ones, which can serve as a starting point for discussion in various contexts, are included here: i) Increase awareness about climate change at all levels. Most of the countries referred to the importance of providing the necessary capacity building support, 36 See Annex IIIII: Summary of Regional Workshop. Tom Perry / World Bank FINANCING LOCAL RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE 30 including, for example, articulating climate change adaptation concepts in a language that can be understood by local planning and budgeting officers. For this, Vietnam stressed the importance of involving community organizations more closely, while the Philippines mentioned the importance of political leadership to steer the process. ii) Develop a clear institutional set-up and follow-up with a functional assignment analysis. This was mentioned in many country action plans, but was particularly appar- ent in the Pakistan and Sri Lanka contexts. iii) Establish clear mechanisms for climate finance transfer at all levels of government. For example, Bhutan and Nepal included a diagram on their country action plans as an initial attempt to map the existing institutional set-up and the existing or possible deliv- ery mechanisms. Other countries agreed on the need to have clarity on such mechanisms. iv) Legislative review of existing policies related to decentralisation, and climate change to facilitate delivery of climate finance at the local level. Bangladesh and Lao PDR identi- fied this as an important step towards more effective response to climate change. b. More effective & equitable local planning and budgeting for climate initiatives In relation to the planning and budgeting for climate-related activities, local practition- ers find it challenging to protect vulnerable assets and population, to estimate the costs of climate-proofing investments, and in general to make informed investment decisions in the planning and budgeting process. The most prominent issues were: i)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "34e6ec67-9276-4625-82f4-e3467267a0dd": {"__data__": {"id_": "34e6ec67-9276-4625-82f4-e3467267a0dd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-local-responses-climate-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Local Responses to Climate Change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-local-responses-climate-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "da05e64cc1bfbcbbd70972d7e1049ea506970336438b527529283bcfce974fdc"}}, "hash": "da05e64cc1bfbcbbd70972d7e1049ea506970336438b527529283bcfce974fdc", "text": "Capacity development to mainstream climate change into local level planning and budgeting. This was a common area in most country contexts, but particularly high- lighted by Bhutan and Lao PDR. ii) Definition and identification of climate-related expenditures. The CPEIR was seen as a useful method to undertake this, and countries such as Myanmar and Pakistan saw the potential to undertake the exercise in their countries. Other countries, such as the FINANCING LOCAL RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE 31 Philippines explicitly referred to the importance of setting up specific budget codes and dedicated budgets for climate change at the local level. iii) Strengthen synergies between national and local level. Countries that have relatively centralised governance systems, expressed this as a request to the central government agencies to provide clear guidelines and dedicated funding for planning and budgeting climate initiatives. This was mentioned explicitly in the Indonesian and Vietnamese action plans. Nepal, on the other side, referred to the importance of reconciling \u201ctop-down\u201d and \u201cbottom-up\u201d views for planning and budgeting. iv) Support local resource mobilization. While there are numerous sources of funding for climate change, such as project specific funds, as well as grants, the importance of using locally sourced revenues, such as local taxes to increase and strengthen the sustainability of local climate change budgets was expressed. c. Improved delivery of climate finance With regard to climate responses at the local level, a few missing links were discussed vis- a-vis climate change programming and other areas, such as disaster risk management and social protection programmes. 37 Across the sectors, challenges related to the limited capac- ity of local stakeholders and the shortage of flexible mechanisms for the reallocation and realignment of the local budgets prompted the participants to propose the following com- mon actions: i) Improve coordination among different stakeholders. Bangladesh mentioned the importance of exploiting the synergies between climate change and other development issues and safety net programmes. Sri Lanka suggested developing local level alliances, within countries, but also regionally across Asia and the Pacific. 37 See section 1.1 and references throughout the document for more information about the close linkage between climate change related action (particularly adaptation), )livelihood and social protection, disaster risk management and prevention, and similar development issues. FINANCING LOCAL RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE 32 ii) Use existing national systems rather than establish new ones. Many countries mentioned the need to work with existing systems rather than create parallel ones. For example, Bhutan, in particular, proposed to include climate change in the resource alloca- tion formulae for the local level, and to increase predictability of local level funding. iii) Establish accountability mechanism. Lao PDR referred to the need of improving the monitoring of NGO and private sector funding. Myanmar requested to strengthen the capacity of sub-national committees to be able to monitor climate finance better. iv) Directing climate finance at the most appropriate levels. The scale of climate change adaptation initiatives can determine which level of intervention may have the most impact. This may not necessarily be the local level, but rather, the provincial, or national level (particularly for mitigation initiatives, for instance). d. Monitoring and evaluation of climate finance impact The monitoring and evaluation of the local impact of climate finance was another important dimension. This was particularly relevant in terms of understanding the impact of climate related activities on vulnerable populations, as well as to ensure accountability in the use of resources to respond to climate change. 38 The following areas were highlighted: i) Develop baselines and indicators specific to climate change finance as part of exist- ing Monitoring and Evaluation frameworks. As with the process of channeling climate finance, it was highlighted that working with existing systems would be more effective in the long-term, although amendments to take into account the climate change dimension may be required. This will need to be accompanied by capacity development efforts. ii) Use vulnerability as a criterion to inform subsequent planning and prioritization of climate finance. Integrate indicators related to climate vulnerability in existing moni- toring and evaluation frameworks. Many countries are already practicing this through small grant programmes for example, in Bhutan, Pakistan, and Nepal. However, a more 38 See section 2.2/D on M&E requirements to track climate finance at the local level. FINANCING LOCAL RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE 33 institutionalised approach was deemed to be more desirable for longer, sustainable effects. iii) Encourage third party/independent oversight and monitoring and evaluation. To have a transparent assessment of the use of climate change finance, independent over- sight was suggested, for example, in the Bangladesh, Myanmar, Pakistan and Vietnam action plans. iv) Enable public access to monitoring and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "310272f1-3bb0-402e-9d39-4a7fffd43f93": {"__data__": {"id_": "310272f1-3bb0-402e-9d39-4a7fffd43f93", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-local-responses-climate-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Local Responses to Climate Change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-local-responses-climate-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8a9a5036320ff02c0c722df95736e91ef0ab32092a356dabb82d978613fe213a"}, "3": {"node_id": "47f56385-af8c-4d47-adc8-003689ba0cd5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-local-responses-climate-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4c48a85e72c460ae7aaa0889d856746a915b68c9953c09a48e11122b09dcb84c"}}, "hash": "2ae46cf332c95bfb6ce28f726b60daaa2d4c68fd92dcac33d8111460795dd71e", "text": "evaluation reports. While countries such as Vietnam referred to transparency and the importance of ensuring public access, other countries like the Philippines specifically suggested a weekly reporting system through the local radio stations to inform on the results of project and programme implementation. These four pillars, which provide the framework to address climate change at the local level identify some of the key areas that can be addressed to make climate change finance deliv- ery more effective at the local level. The pillars underscore the fact that the local delivery of climate change finance cannot be addressed in isolation, and that the broader institu- tional environment will have a significant impact on what happens at the local level. The recommendations for the way forward also illustrated that each of the four pillars are com- plementary and that a comprehensive approach, anchored within a larger system is required.

The objective of the workshop was to highlight the impact of decentralisation and local gov- ernance context in a particularly country for the effective delivery of financial resources for climate change. It was an opportunity to share experiences among the different countries in Asia-Pacific about: (1) how the different sources of climate finance are currently being chan- nelled to the local level; (2) how different local actors have tried to improve the effectiveness of increased expenditures on climate finance; (3) how these efforts can be supplemented with additional support from international partners. Context \u2022 A better understanding of the challenges and opportunities at the local level to make climate finance more effective is necessary \u2022 Climate Finance discussions should not only focus on international finance, but equal attention should be paid to domestic resources, and how they are channeled and accessed at the local level \u2022 The delivery of financial resources that address climate change related issues must take into account the institutional context, particular with regard to decentralisation and local governance processes, and actors \u2022 Coordination among all stakeholders especially from central government and local gov- ernment are crucial for coherence cooperation \u2022 Participation in planning and implementing processes at all levels, and all relevant stake- holders at local level is important to build the ownership and to effectively take the climate change agenda forward FINANCING LOCAL RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE 44 \u2022 Local governance processes can play a role in ensuring accountability and transparency in the use of climate finance How is climate change finance being accessed and delivered at the local level?

It is often driven by political consid- erations, and not matched by commensurate administrative or fiscal decentralisation. The problem of \u2018unfunded mandates\u2019 is one prevalent in many recently decentralised systems of governance in the region, and this is particularly true in the case of climate change, where there is still ambiguity with regard to who is responsible for the issue, particularly at local level. Finance for climate change at the local level is understood to include climate specific funds as well as a range of public and private domestic funds. What many of the country experiences showcased is that due to the range of stakeholders who are involved in the implementation of activities related to climate change, there are challenges related to coherence and coor- dination, both in terms of financing mechanisms, as well as in terms of the coordination of activities. Experiences from countries and different stakeholders were shared during the meeting to illustrate the ways in which climate finance is being accessed and delivered at the local level. The case of Pakistan illustrated the impact of the 18th Amendment to the Constitution and the possibilities that it brings to the addressing climate change at the sub-national level. An example from Nepal also illustrated the role of NGOs, where climate related activities can take place through disaster risk reduction programmes, although the financial resources for that are accessed from project specific funds. This is in contrast to experiences where finance examples of initiatives from NGOs were also shared, whereby most of the financial resources FINANCING LOCAL RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE 45 are accessed from project specific funds, whereas on the other hand, the experiences of Cambodia show the way in which funds are integrated in the local planning processes. The perspective of a line ministry was also shared through the example of Lao PDR, illustrating the significant role that line ministries play in addressing climate change. Finally, the issue of including vulnerability in the design and implementation of climate-related initiatives was also highlighted to ensure both equity and equality in the reach and impact of climate finance delivery. It was highlighted that climate vulnerability is a variable that links climate change to human development. While each of the experiences were different, it was apparent that there are many stake- holders who are involved in the delivery of climate finance either through projects that are explicitly identified as \u201cclimate change related\u201d, or indirectly, through initiatives that address different manifestations of climate change. Depending on these variations, the access and delivery of finance for such initiatives also differed, including both national sources, as well as external. Detailed presentations from each of the countries can be accessed at http://www. aideffectiveness.org/Asia-Pacific-Local-Practitioners.html FINANCING LOCAL RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE 46 What challenges and opportunities do decentralisation and local governance pose for access and delivery of finance to respond to Climate Change at local level? Situating the discourse of climate change finance in the context of decentralisation is impor- tant in order to address institutional factors that may impede the effective delivery of the resources. The country specific pace and scope of decentralisation will determine the roles that institutions at the local level will play with regard to climate change, especially in rela- tion to the flows of financial resources, and the discretion over their use. The range of local practitioners includes the local administration, as well as line departments, central agencies, CSOs, CBOs, and the local private sector. Finance for \u2022 Decentralisation processes must be accompanied by adequate capacity, and financial resources in order for different practitioners to fulfill their roles \u2022 Political decentralisation is important to place climate change squarely on the agenda of local sustainable development efforts. Examples from Thailand illustrate how the involve- ment of elected leaders have resulted in positive impacts with regard to local mitigation measures, as well as enhanced resource base \u2022 The role of local councils was highlighted as being an important one, especially with regard to ensuring accountability and transparency \u2022 Decentralisation can bring in many opportunities for more effective delivery at the local level, for instance, more inclusive participation in planning, as well as political ownership. However, there can be persistent gaps between national and provincial level policy guid- ance, coordination among different agencies \u2022 There are many sources of funding, and the local administration may need to consider developing a local climate finance framework that responds to local needs by blending different sources of finance, and developing appropriate mechanisms for its delivery FINANCING LOCAL RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE 47 When addressing the local level challenges, it is imperative to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d8d193c-2b37-4074-aa20-0790d7e6de95": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d8d193c-2b37-4074-aa20-0790d7e6de95", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-local-responses-climate-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Local Responses to Climate Change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-local-responses-climate-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "839057641b0fc0719f40a2f2950aba318cd65f130afe667f5bdae064816b069e"}}, "hash": "839057641b0fc0719f40a2f2950aba318cd65f130afe667f5bdae064816b069e", "text": "strengthen and work with national level institutions in strengthening and enabling decentralisation, particularly with regarding to coordination between different levels of governance. Based on the type of stakeholder, the challenges and opportunities may also be different, although some overlaps were also observed. The following were identified from stakeholders at the national level: \u2022 Low levels of knowledge on climate change issue at the local level, which makes it difficult to facilitate the interface between national and local on climate change issues \u2022 Lack of coordination between central ministries and local level institutions, often exacer- bated due to overlapping mandates. \u2022 Clarity needed on what counts as a climate change activity \u2022 In terms of working with other stakeholders, the national institutions face these types of challenges: \u2022 Many opportunities to work with CSOs, but there needs to be coordination among them. \u2022 Low function and organizational capacity of local level institutions Local governments identified the following challenges: \u2022 Control of local and central government by different political parties \u2022 Accountability and transparency mechanisms need to be established or strengthened as the risks for misuse of funds are just as prevalent at the local level \u2022 There is huge potential to mobilize local resources to address locality specific climate change challenges, however, the capacity to raise such revenues remain weak. \u2022 No consultation from central level agencies with local institutions on issue of climate change. \u2022 Development partners have different rules and modalities which puts pressure on local institutions FINANCING LOCAL RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE 48 \u2022 Understanding the public financial management system and the intricacies of integrating climate change in that system \u2022 Potential for cross-learning, collaboration, and network among different stakeholders is a significant opportunity. From the perspective of CSOs, the following issues were identified: \u2022 Lack of enabling environment is often an impediment, manifested by weak or non-exist- ent legal framework \u2022 Not often seen as equal partners in the development process, and therefore, their poten- tial impact is limited Pulling together a framework for strengthening access and delivery of finance to respond to climate change at the local level Based on the discussions and country consultations, a framework for the delivery of climate finance at the local level was developed based on the following four pillars: Pillars for Climate Finance Framework at Local Level An enabling institutional environment for climate finance More effective and equitable local planning and budgeting for climate initiatives Improved delivery of climate finance Monitoring and evaluating the local impact of climate finance FINANCING LOCAL RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE 49 Based on these four pillars, each country developed action plans. As expected, each of the plans are different, however, some common trends were discernible, such as: \u2022 An enabling institutional environment for climate finance \u2013 A need to increase awareness about climate change at all levels \u2013 Identify institutions with responsibilities to address climate change, and for those that are indirectly responsible, identify specific functions \u2013 Establish clear mechanisms for climate finance transfer among all levels \u2013 Reviews laws and regulations that facilitate or impede on delivery of climate finance at the local level \u2022 More effective and equitable local planning and budgeting for climate initiatives \u2013 Capacity development for local level stakeholders to integrate climate change into local level planning and budgeting processes \u2013 Identify what climate change expenditure is \u2013 Synergies between national and local levels need to be strengthened, especially when different national and local levels are led by different political parties \u2013 Improve capacity for local resource mobilization \u2022 Improved delivery of climate finance \u2013 Coordination among different actors \u2013 Use existing national funding mechanisms rather than establish new ones \u2013 Clarify functional responsibilities of different local level stakeholders \u2013 Put accountability mechanism in place \u2022 Monitoring and evaluating the local impact of climate finance \u2013 Develop baselines and indicators \u2013 Strengthen monitoring and evaluation capacities of local stakeholders, including coordination among different actors \u2013 At the same time, ensure third party/independent monitoring and evaluation FINANCING LOCAL RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE 50 \u2013 Use vulnerability impact assessments to inform subsequent planning and prioritiza- tion of climate finance \u2013 Ensure public access to monitoring reports In addition to country specific action plans, each country level stakeholder put forth rec- ommendations that development partners need to consider in their efforts to support the delivery of climate finance. A complete list can be found on http://www.aideffectiveness. org/Asia-Pacific-Local-Practitioners.html, but some of the issues raised included the need for development partners to increase awareness about climate change and its integration in the development planning processes, facilitate cross-learning and collaborative network- ing.

Prior to this, UNDP had relied on ad hoc external technical support in the design and implementation of its individual country programmes, with regional projects managed and operated from a number of locations. In 2006, it was determined that UNDP could be more effective if it had a high quality technical advisory team based in the Pacific that possessed both specific technical expertise as well knowledge of the Pacific Island countries. As a tight knit team, the Centre has been able to demonstrate capacity to work across thematic areas; draw differing skills together to provide high quality and innovative policy advice; and build a range of partnerships with Governments, regional organizations, NGOs and the private sector. The Centre\u2019s connections to the global UNDP community has allowed Pacific Island decision-makers to benefit from the experience of others while also providing a catalyst for sharing Pacific knowledge more broadly. The Centre was established soon after the Pacific Plan became a reality and while the Plan\u2019s success as a regional strategic framework is currently under review, it has provided organizations, such as UNDP, with the leverage to advocate for a range of often sensitive issues as well as areas where regional cooperation provided the necessary platform for action in individual countries. The following are some examples of how UNDP through its Pacific Centre has been able to work with UNDP Country Offices to enhance activities at the country level; strengthen collaboration between countries under the auspices of the existing regional architecture of organizations and networks; advocate for change in sensitive areas such as human rights and gender equality; as well as the testing of new and innovative ideas prior to their adoption more broadly. None of this has been achieved by UNDP alone and has required the generous support of donors such as AusAID, NZAID, EU and Japan and the existence of close partnerships with Governments; civil society; regional and private sector organizations; UN agencies; and UNDP colleagues both in the region and globally. 2011-2012 HIGHLIGHTS 1 Cross-cutting Work on Women\u2019s empowerment and Gender equality Work towards women\u2019s empowerment and gender equality underpins much of the activity in the Pacific Centre.

The Regional Action Plan was launched on 19 October 2012 by the Chair of the Pacific Islands Forum, the Prime Minister of the Cook Islands, the Honourable Henry Puna. Gender mainstreaming activities were conducted for Disaster Risk Management \u2022\ufffd practitioners in the Pacific region. In both Papua New Guinea (PNG) and in Tonga, dozens of government officials, UN staff and development partners were trained on gender analysis and mainstreaming in disaster and climate change adaptation initiatives. A research proposal on the engendered impacts of drought and water management in Tuvalu has been prepared and submitted to the UN Pacific Humanitarian team for discussion; a case study examining the gender dimensions of climate change risk and adaptation was prepared and presented at the Pacific Women\u2019s Ministers meeting and a checklist on Integrating Gender in Disaster Management in Small Island Developing States was published in July 2012. Democratic Governance Policy-makers were sensitized to the importance of temporary special measures \u2022\ufffd (TSM) as a means of increasing women\u2019s political representation. In March 2011, the Centre supported the UNDP Fiji Multi-Country Office to organize a panel debate on temporary special measures on International Women\u2019s Day. In July 2011, the Centre organized a panel on TSM at the 4th Pacific Women\u2019s Ministerial Meeting. Both panels received very positive feedback. In collaboration with PIFS, pilots of the first ever Mock Parliaments for Women were held in Kiribati, Marshall Islands, PNG and Palau. A video of the Kiribati Mock Parliament was produced as an advocacy tool and can be found on YouTube. 2011-2012 HIGHLIGHTS 2 The Pacific Centre worked with the Cook Islands government to complete the \u2022\ufffd final draft of the Family Law Bill for submission to Parliament. The support included a legislative review of existing legislation, an overview of good practices from other countries, and an inclusive consultation process to ensure the Bill\u2019s content reflects the local context and responds to the needs of stakeholders. To facilitate the enactment of the Bill, additional technical support has been provided to the Government to draft supporting rules and regulations. More targeted technical advice was also provided to PICs on legislative reform, including to the Governments of Palau, PNG, Tonga, Kiribati, and Tuvalu. With regards to Tonga, specific advice was provided on CEDAW ratification on reservations. The Pacific Centre assisted the Republic of the Marshall Islands Government and \u2022\ufffd the Cook Islands Government in costing the implementation of laws addressing domestic violence. The support included an in-country costing exercise jointly with the government to determine the cost over a three-year period of implementing legislation addressing domestic violence. Costing exercises can be critical tools in ensuring the implementation of law and the allocation of adequate resources. In addition, they provide guidance in delineating responsibility among government offices in the law\u2019s implementation and an avenue for partnership with the non- governmental and private sectors. Poverty reduction and MDGs Work included comprehensive policy analysis, the production and dissemination \u2022\ufffd of statistics for MDGs and UNDAF indicators for monitoring purposes, providing PIC Governments with a menu of policy options and ensuring that sectoral and provincial policies and plans reflect national development priorities and MDGs acceleration. Stakeholders in Samoa and Vanuatu were trained on policy formulation and planning, including gender issues and macroeconomics. Technical advice and support was provided to the Pacific Islands Private Sector \u2022\ufffd Organization (PIPSO) including a workshop for Fiji, PNG, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu which focused on supporting women in business, including supporting value chain and inclusive market development and strengthening Pacific women in business associations. A follow-up programme of support has been developed to monitor the practical implementation of workshop outcomes. As part of the Women\u2019s Economic Security and Rights Initiative being \u2022\ufffd implemented in collaboration with UN Women, the \u201cMillennium Markets: One Market One Country\u201d Project was developed for Fiji, PNG, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. Through this project legal, socio-economic and financial development opportunities were provided to women market vendors in the informal economy, leading to the development of social protection mechanisms and a strengthening of the capacity of the local governments and town councils to respond better to the needs of the women vendors. 2011-2012 HIGHLIGHTS 3 In partnership with the AIDS Task Force of Fiji and the AIDS Council of New \u2022\ufffd South Wales UNDP supported a ground breaking community led research project \u201cSecret Lives, Other Voices\u201d exploring male-to-male sex, gender identity and HIV transmission risk.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "74be501e-3ded-47b8-a74d-99a5c9e5f0d4": {"__data__": {"id_": "74be501e-3ded-47b8-a74d-99a5c9e5f0d4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-highlights-2011-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Centre Highlights 2011-2012", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-highlights-2011-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8e14b3f3e4d47b15d1d6fc8a3af8c8e42e3cb3f08142bfeb6d2818a850dee180"}, "2": {"node_id": "bb55ad9a-fe04-4924-883f-8fe0984911b0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-highlights-2011-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "35bd7ff4e199844ce78788d0dbdf4cb7fddbe6ee6018ac1dffb23e010d5d080e"}}, "hash": "a6e3ab1fe992e9115179420615cf051820276f486d2c043606e5e6bea6b316a2", "text": "Another important operational research project \u201cMe, My Intimate Partner and HIV\u201d explored spousal transmission risk of HIV in Fiji using a qualitative approach.

The Federated States of Micronesia and Nauru have no women in Parliament, and as at October 2012 Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, Tonga and Marshall Islands had each only one female parliamentarian. This situation is despite the considerable work that has been done to raise awareness with policy- makers about the need for temporary special measures to promote women\u2019s representation. During 2011 and 2012, the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat and the UNDP Pacific Centre tried a novel approach to build the capacity of women candidates by running the first ever Mock Parliaments for Women in the Pacific. Kiribati In advance of the Kiribati elections, a Mock Parliament for Women was run in August 2011. Thirty women participated, including 17 from the outer islands and 13 from Tarawa. The national elections held in October 2011 resulted in the reelection of 3 incumbents, and the election of a new MP, Hon Maere Tekanene. Ms Tekanene won her seat after contesting national elections for the third time. (The other women members of the Kiribati Parliament are MP Rereao Tetaake (Teraina in the Line Islands), MP Teima Onorio (Arorae) and MP Tangariki Reete (Betio, South Tarawa)). Ms Tekanene who was one of the Department of Women organisers of the Mock Parliament specifically acknowledged the Mock Parliament following her win. \u201cThe Women\u2019s Mock Parliament has played a key role in helping female 2011-2012 HIGHLIGHTS 5 candidates win the constituencies of Betio and Teinainano both in South Tarawa. In the Teinainano constituency, where I contested, there were five of us, all of whom had had some kind of involvement with the Mock Parliament, either as an organiser or a participant\u2026 Each was trying her best in her own way but during the second round when I became the only candidate, they all gave a hand in advocating for me. At workshops and social and family gatherings they attended they would say, \u201cPlease, give a hand to the only female contesting in the final elections,\u201d she said. republic of the Marshall Islands National Elections in the Republic of Marshall Islands were held in November 2011, following a Mock Parliament for Women in September 2011. One new woman candidate, Dr Hilda Heine, was elected and has been chosen as a Minister. Dr Heine was a participant in the Mock Parliament. At the conclusion of the Mock Parliament she commented: \u201cThere have been mixed views about this activity being conducted in Marshall Islands but the reality is, women need all the support available. I found this training very useful and would like to see it happen on a regular basis. I encourage young women to take part in future trainings so that they are exposed to law-making processes and experience what it is like to be in the Nitijela. Reflecting on the usefulness of the training, Dr Heine noted: \u201cEvery election we hope women will win but not many women nominate in the first place. One of the reasons women don\u2019t run is because they feel intimidated when it comes to their place in the Nitijela.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b7142b4-21e8-43ae-ac08-ee71e8de21db": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b7142b4-21e8-43ae-ac08-ee71e8de21db", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-highlights-2011-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Centre Highlights 2011-2012", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-highlights-2011-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b63d2501d0cb997c4f2e58531db92b886147480fd97b08a927f6732049b307e1"}, "2": {"node_id": "d6303964-21d2-4af6-bb6d-c7cea1215204", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-highlights-2011-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1727c189ae941073156f9ebaec3530ee669955f2b889c5b33f281b6d0aedc2a2"}}, "hash": "242fc2360fd0339e77b8463ceffa1162f88cbada48fdedebc577e35bb6027c3d", "text": "This training allows women to experience being in the Nitijela, where all our national decisions are made and shows us that we too have a part to play.\u201d Palau In Palau a Mock Olbiil Era Kelulau (Congress) for Palauan women was held in September 2011.

Three women were elected at the June 2012 elections, one of whom, Honourable Loujaya Toni, was a participant in the Practice Parliament. Margaret Loko, a participant and a candidate for a seat in the National Capital District, was very positive about the usefulness of the Practice Parliament in promoting women\u2019s leadership in PNG. \u201cThe Practice Parliament was a real eye- opener for the women who participated and we learnt the finer details about parliamentary procedures of law making that we can put to good use once we are elected into Parliament. I felt like an MP in action today!\u201d Mr David McLachlan-Carr, the United Nations Resident Coordinator in PNG, attended the entire Practice Parliament for Women and was glowing in his praise for the women: \u201cI was incredibly impressed by the high quality of leadership, vision and policy knowledge demonstrated by the PNG women who participated. The women showed enormous commitment in researching and preparing their arguments, and anyone who was listening to the broadcast today on FM100 would have realized that they are very articulate. These women certainly demonstrated today that the women of this country can make great national leaders if they are only given the opportunity to engage in national policy and decision-making forums.\u201d 2011-2012 HIGHLIGHTS 7 supporting UNCAC ratification and Implementation in the Pacific The Pacific Centre worked closely with Pacific government officials and civil society to encourage countries to work towards ratification of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC). To date, nine Pacific Island countries have ratified UNCAC, namely Papua New Guinea (2007), Fiji (2008), Palau (2009), Vanuatu, Cook Islands, Marshall Islands, (2011), Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, and Solomon Islands (2012). In 2011 following national workshops on UNCAC facilitated by UNDP targeting members of parliament in Solomon Islands, and members of congress in the Federated States of Micronesia, the Solomon Islands Government publicly committed to accession, and the FSM Congress submitted a resolution to the President to accede to UNCAC. The progress made throughout the region is the product of almost five years of continued work by UNDP and its partners. UNCAC ratification is merely an early step in tackling corruption. In support of implementation of UNCAC, the Pacific Centre provided technical assistance to Marshall Islands to review the Criminal Code to bring it into line with the criminalization and law enforcement provisions (Chapter 3) of UNCAC, and these amendments were passed in September 2011. The Centre also provided inputs to Vanuatu\u2019s review of the existing Ombudsman and Leadership Code Acts. In support of UNCAC Article 10 on public reporting and information, the Centre partnered with the Commonwealth Pacific Governance Facility to support the Tongan Government to develop a Freedom of Information (FOI) Policy. A similar initiative was launched in Vanuatu in 2012, following a request from the Government for technical support in drafting an FOI policy paper, a draft FOI Bill, and an implementation plan.

PNG\u2019s Minister for Forest and Climate Change, Patrick Pruaitch said \u201cThe drafting of the Climate Change and Development Policy is the Government\u2019s blue print to achieve its vision in building a climate-resilient and carbon neutral pathway through sustainable economic development for PNG.\u201d Samoa has joined Nepal, Bangladesh, Thailand and Cambodia in launching a Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR). A team from the UNDP Pacific Centre, Samoa Multi-Country Office and the Overseas Development Institute met with representatives from the Government of Samoa to initiate the assessment of current policy priorities and strategies as they relate to climate change and the extent to which these strategies and policies are coherent with national development, 2011-2012 HIGHLIGHTS 9 poverty reduction and economic growth strategies. The study reviewed institutional arrangements for promoting an integration of climate change policy priorities into budgeting and expenditure management including within and across key ministries, local governments and stakeholders, and reviewed the integration of climate change objectives within the budgeting process, including as part of budget planning, implementation, expenditure management and financing. The CPEIR provided the Government of Samoa with detailed analysis and recommendations for accessing and managing climate finance. There is growing consensus that if developing countries \u201cdirectly access\u201d climate financing, this will result in more effective financial delivery, and promote greater country ownership of climate adaptation and mitigation initiatives. The Adaptation Fund is at the forefront of climate related global funds in providing direct access for governments through National Implementing Entities (NIE). The Cook Islands Ministry of Finance and Economic Management (MFEM) requested UNDP\u2019s support in anticipation of its application to the Adaptation Fund as a NIE. In partnership with the Samoa Multi-Country Office, the UNDP Pacific Centre Regional Climate Change Policy Advisor along with the Global Coordinator of the Boots on the Ground programme provided a capacity assessment of the proposed NIE. The anticipated outcome is that the Cook Islands MFEM will be accredited as an NIE which would allow Cook Islands to directly access the Adaptation Fund for climate change adaptation programming. 2011-2012 HIGHLIGHTS 10 tokelau Moves to renewable energy Pacific Island countries are the most petroleum-dependent region in the world. Despite this, Tokelau, a group of three small atolls in the South Pacific Ocean, is the first to meet its electricity needs entirely through renewable energy. Tokelau has a total land area of 10 square kilometres and a population of around 1,400. Its small size, isolation and limited natural resources are all constraints on its development. Worse, it had to spend approximately NZ$1million (approx. US$800,000) annually on imported fossil fuel. Since 2001 UNDP has worked with the Government of Tokelau, communities on the three atolls and development partners to prepare the ground for large scale sustainable energy utilization. With funding and technical assistance from a range of sources including UNDP and UNESCO, the first Tokelau National Energy Policy and Strategic Action Plan was prepared and endorsed by the government in 2004. The goals specified for energy development in this plan were twofold: 1) achievement of energy independence through the development of indigenous energy resources; and 2) provision of affordable, high quality electrical power to all residents. Further, in partnership with the Governments of New Zealand and France, UNDP supported key preparatory work that included: 2011-2012 HIGHLIGHTS 11 resource assessments, feasibility and design studies and the implementation of a solar system demonstration project in Fakaofo atoll. Since November 2008 the UNDP Pacific Centre has provided significant technical support related to the tender processes and contract preparations, to the Government of Tokelau and the UNDP Samoa Multi- Country Office. The first system, on Fakaofo atoll, was switched on in early August after a six-week construction period. The Nukunonu system was connected in mid-September, and the final system on Atafu was connected end of October 2012. The three power systems are funded by the Government of New Zealand. When fully completed around 4,032 solar panels and batteries will have been installed across the three atolls of Tokelau, making the plants some of the largest standalone solar systems in the world.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7bad7fbb-cded-4f6a-92bc-39e31335cd9e": {"__data__": {"id_": "7bad7fbb-cded-4f6a-92bc-39e31335cd9e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-highlights-2011-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Centre Highlights 2011-2012", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-highlights-2011-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3f1a8ea54ff725acf10d0931a16c3e3e1f9a939fc7ab9736f5a56d37ca298337"}, "2": {"node_id": "d46a3206-1aa7-4caa-b0a2-0f57629f844b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-highlights-2011-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1e2e6a4c103846a933e130e025df8fc7c39a5fc9846c6b13aebbb85f1c32e992"}}, "hash": "209c96a9fad3d4341df7eee9bbb4a84f6788e76da592a3fda7e5e14041d50bf6", "text": "The plants will provide 24-hour high quality electricity supply for all islanders, eliminating diesel use, and even produce surplus electricity to allow Tokelauans to expand on their energy use.

Since its launch in 2010, the project has had a number of highlights. These include: Climate observers training Programme In 2011 four Pacific Islanders participated in a ten-month climate observers\u2019 training programme at the Caribbean Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology. As they each embarked on a personal journey to learn more about climatology, agro-meteorology, operational radar, instrumental maintenance and repair, and aeronautical meteorology from their Caribbean counterparts, Konny Nato (Papua New Guinea), Wilson Saega (Solomon Islands), Williams Bae Worworkon (Vanuatu) and Vaaua Wilson (Samoa) also had the opportunity to share their experiences as part of a two-month work attachment in a Caribbean Meteorological Office. During the work attachment, Mr Worworkon was assigned to Entry Level Meteorological Technicians training section. Mr Nato (PNG Weather Services) and Mr Saega (Solomon Islands Senior Meteorological Observer) were assigned to the 2011-2012 HIGHLIGHTS 13 Climate Section which included data analysis and drought monitoring. They were also assigned to the Instrument Section which included training on Automatic Weather stations, while Mr Vaaua (Scientific Officer, Weather Operations Services in Samoa) was attached to the Barbados Meteorological Services. Other skills attained during the exchange include the skills to maintain, repair and calibrate relevant meteorological instruments, inspect and set-up weather observation sites, assist with field experiments, prepare summaries and reports of analyzed data among other skills. Looking south Across the oceans The film \u201cLooking South Across the Oceans: Promoting Cooperation Among Small Island Developing States\u201d was launched in 2011. It tells the story of how small island developing states (SIDS) in the Pacific and Caribbean have embarked on a journey to share knowledge and experiences to strengthen the resilience of their communities to natural disasters and climate change. It highlights that many adaptable solutions to the challenges posed by natural disasters can be found by looking South. Agro-Meteorology training Workshop A three-week long training by a world expert in agro-meteorology, Dr Roger Eduardo Rivera Vega, demystified the processes involved in agro-meteorology and provided weather specialists and agriculture officers from across the Pacific with knowledge, tools and skills to interpret the impact of changing weather patterns on crop and livestock production. It also provided the participants with an opportunity to map the next steps in building stronger agro-meteorology services in their countries. Roger Suat from the Department of Agriculture in Papua New Guinea said he found the training beneficial. \u201cIn Papua New Guinea, since 1997 we have noted a decrease in crop production directly linked to changing weather patterns. I can use my knowledge of crop modeling from this training to inform farmers on what types of crops to plant in areas affected by changing weather patterns.\u201d 2011-2012 HIGHLIGHTS 14 Pacific Approaches to Peace and Dialogue Since its launch in 2009, the Strengthening Capacities for Peace and Development (CPAD) project of the UNDP Pacific Centre has steadily built up a Pacific community of peace practitioners and the impact of this work is starting to be felt on the ground. CPAD has been very successful in opening up space and helping sustain conversations about peace and development in the region while supporting civil society organizations to engage more effectively in peace building. Now in its third year, the project is making inroads towards advancing the theory and practice of Pacific approaches to dialogue.

Lilly recently brought about a peace agreement in a Papua New Guinea Highlands community which had been in conflict for the past four years, and in which four previous attempts to bring peace had been unsuccessful. Lilly gave up her paid employment five years ago and returned to her village to work with women struggling to support themselves and their families. Working through the non-government organization, Voice for Change, she came across many women who, like herself, had been displaced from their traditional lands. \u201cVoice for Change is supporting women who have been displaced from the community. Many of these women did not have food, could not send their children to school and had no land on which to grow food or bury the dead,\u201d said Lilly. Last year, Voice for Change received a small grant under UNDP\u2019s Strengthening Capacities for Peace and Development (CPAD) programme to support their work in mediating a peace agreement to end the conflict between the clans and pave the way for the return of the displaced clan to their ancestral lands. A total of 500 people had been displaced as result of the conflict. Lilly said that in the past three years, various actors had made four attempts to resolve the conflict and while all were started they all failed. \u201cVoice for Change led the fifth reconciliation attempt.

This shift recently culminated in the official welcoming by Pacific Islands Forum Leaders in their 2012 Communique of the Pacific Human Security Framework, which was jointly developed by Pacific Centre and the Forum Secretariat. The Framework provides a common foundation and strategic guidance for improving the understanding, planning, and implementation of human security approaches in stand-alone and broader peace, security and development initiatives in the unique Pacific context. It also aims to strengthen cooperation on human security and is supportive of and complementary to the Pacific Plan. The process of transition to a human security approach was done over two stages. From 2006 to 2008 UNDP and the Forum Secretariat at the request of the Forum Regional Security Committee (FRSC) undertook consultations in partnership with civil society and academia, carried out case studies in Vanuatu, Samoa, Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and Kiribati, and conducted research to establish a theoretical foundation for the Framework including identifying human security threats, existing capacities to respond to those threats, and approaches to strengthen human security. In 2008, the FRSC welcomed the theoretical work and requested that UNDP and the Forum Secretariat shift their focus from theory to practical application. Between 2008 and 2012 UNDP and the Forum Secretariat implemented a wide range of projects based on the theoretical foundation including tackling sexual and gender based violence, women\u2019s involvement in peace and security, dialogues with civil society on security issues, capacity building of FRSC officials in conflict prevention, youth involvement in crime and violence, security sector governance, and land management. The experiences and results of project implementation on these types of issues informed the development of the Framework. The period 2012 to 2015 will see the Framework being utilized as a guide for security and development interventions by Pacific Island countries and the Forum Secretariat. In 2015 the FRSC will review the Framework. However, what is unmistakable is that the focus of security in the region has definitively shifted from a state centred approach to a human centred approach which will support better development outcomes for all. 2011-2012 HIGHLIGHTS 18 security sector Governance \u2013 regional Intervention Leading to National Adoption The effective governance of security institutions is vital for the Pacific. In the context of conflict and violence, it supports the efforts of state institutions to stabilize the security situation, begin the road to recovery and reduce the potential for relapse. In non-conflict contexts, it ensures security institutions fulfill their mandate to combat insecurity, creating an enabling environment for poverty reduction and sustainable development. The Pacific Island Forum Secretariat and the UNDP Pacific Centre jointly launched the Regional Security Sector Governance Initiative in 2008, consulting with stakeholder groups in Fiji, Papua New Guinea (PNG), Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu. As part of the initiative, a Regional Conference on Security Sector Governance in the Pacific was held in early 2009, and a joint paper was then presented to the Forum Regional Security Committee. These activities formed a launch pad for the first steps to develop a National Security Policy in PNG. In 2011, the National Security Council approved the development of such a policy for PNG in alignment with the PNG Vision 2050 \u201cPillar Four - Security and International Relations,\u201d the PNG Development Strategic Plan 2010\u20132030 and the Medium Term Development Plan 2011\u20132015. As a result of strong momentum in 2012, the policy is being developed under the leadership of the Office of Security Coordination and Assessment within the Department of Prime Minister and National Executive Council. Through nation- wide consultations, the policy seeks to respond to a range of security challenges and provides a comprehensive framework to address these", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "307be7f1-cbb0-4dae-89eb-c505cddd4c5b": {"__data__": {"id_": "307be7f1-cbb0-4dae-89eb-c505cddd4c5b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-highlights-2011-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Centre Highlights 2011-2012", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-highlights-2011-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4e6949c36e4609945faa8964e65039869821cf154914fcc9ad33f5ef1d04cf6c"}}, "hash": "4e6949c36e4609945faa8964e65039869821cf154914fcc9ad33f5ef1d04cf6c", "text": "in a coherent manner. It prescribes how the Government of PNG will provide security for the state and its people. It further ensures a collective understanding of security needs, threats and challenges, national priorities, and the role of different actors to enhance coordination, identify capacities and resources needed to deal with security threats, improve oversight and accountability and provide a sound basis for any subsequent institutional reforms. The policy also provides the overarching framework for the realignment of the Defence White Paper, the Foreign Policy and other enabling policies related to security service delivery. The Pacific Centre continues to provide support to the reform of the security sector in PNG through the provision of technical and financial assistance. 2011-2012 HIGHLIGHTS 19 Helping Pacific Countries Formulate MDG Friendly trade Policies While data constraints continue to be a challenge in monitoring progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in the Pacific, available data and information (mainly found in Household Income and Expenditure Surveys, scattered poverty analyses and national MDGs Reports) have not been fully and effectively utilized to guide policy decisions. Increasingly, national development plans and strategies focus on MDGs priorities, but MDGs are not reflected in sectoral and provincial plans. This exacerbates the weak economic governance already often present at the sector level and in the sub-national and rural areas. At the same time, development partner support has often focused more on individual projects, with little or no engagement in higher level planning and policy formulation. In 2011 in an effort to help countries address these challenges, the UNDP Pacific Centre, working with the relevant UNDP Country Offices, scaled up its policy engagement by providing direct support to planning and policy formulation in Samoa and Vanuatu. In Samoa, in early 2011 a comprehensive policy and economy wide analysis was launched to guide Samoa\u2019s next national development strategy 2013-2023. The exercise aimed to provide the Government of Samoa with a menu of policy options to enhance inclusive growth and accelerate progress towards the achievement of MDGs. As Samoa moves away from project-based planning at the sectoral level to a sector-wide approach, the team from the Pacific Centre provided technical support to the formulation of Samoa\u2019s first Foreign Trade, Commerce and Manufacturing 2011-2012 HIGHLIGHTS 20 Sector Plan (2012-2016). This sector plan brings to the forefront the acceleration of MDGs achievement, as well as strengthens the focus on the private sector, with more emphasis on youth and women entrepreneurs. The Plan also improves the links between the manufacturing and trade sectors, on one hand, and the primary production sector (e.g. agriculture, fishery and forestry), in order to increase income generating opportunities and sustainable livelihoods for the rural population and strike a balance between subsistence and commercial primary production. In Vanuatu, along with UNESCAP, UNFPA, UNICEF and UN Women, the UNDP Pacific Centre participated in the mid-term peer review of Vanuatu\u2019s National Development Strategy (the Priority Actions Agenda) and implementation plan. During the review, it was recognized that while the Government has established a separate Department of Industry under the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Tourism, there was no industrial policy in place to guide the nascent Department. In response, UNDP provided direct technical and financial support to lead the formulation of Vanuatu\u2019s first industrial policy. Vanuatu\u2019s industrial policy marks a strategic shift in the Government\u2019s policies to support the private sector, from general incentives and tax holidays to more targeted and selective support, particularly to women and youth, that is tied to performance and encompasses enhancing access to finance, technology, mentoring and marketing. Another strategic shift in the Industrial Policy is to adopt a clustered development approach to create sustainable value chains from primary production to trade with all supporting services (e.g. marketing education, research and development, banking and finance) working together to enhance value addition. Vanuatu\u2019s newly formulated industrial policy includes a road map to enhance the contribution of the manufacturing sector and thereby reduce the country\u2019s chronic and unsustainable trade deficit by building on Vanuatu\u2019s natural comparative advantage and traditional knowledge to produce high value-added products targeting niche markets. 2011-2012 HIGHLIGHTS 21 UNDP reaches out to schools to Promote the Millennium Development Goals The 2011 Miss Sugar, Renee Duguivalu partnered with the UNDP Pacific Centre to conduct a schools outreach in the Western Division in the lead up to the 2011 International Day for the Eradication of Poverty.

Ms Duguivalu who was also selected as the Best MDGs Speaker during the Sugar Festival, presented on the MDGs as well as conducted pop quizzes in the schools visited which included Natabua High School, Ba Provincial Freebird Institute, Lautoka Central Primary School, Drasa Avenue School, Lautoka Andhra Sangam School and Saint Thomas High School. All schools visited were presented with MDGs literature for the school library and for student research purposes. \u201cThis visit was useful because most of our students come from remote areas and the information shared today can help them uplift their lives at home. Education is the only means of changing lives of students and their communities,\u201d said the Principal of the Ba Provincial Freebird Institute, Beniamino Tawake. Students also felt empowered by hearing Miss Duguivalu speak. \u201cI came to know about the MDGs during the Sugar Festival earlier this year, but I really understood what they meant at the presentation today. We are facing hard times in Fiji. Achieving the MDGs and alleviating poverty will benefit the country as a whole,\u201d said Dorian Samuel, a Form 5 student at Natabua High School. The International Day for the Eradication of Poverty which falls on 17 October provided a great opportunity for raising awareness on this goal. MDG reports of Pacific Island countries indicate that poverty is generally viewed as hardship due to lack of services, like transport, water, primary health care, and education. Miss Sugar also spoke at the Laucala Campus of the University of the South Pacific (USP) on the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty Day during an event organized by UNDP in partnership with the USP Students Association to raise awareness on MDGs and poverty alleviation initiatives in the Pacific. 2011-2012 HIGHLIGHTS 22 single Mum Begins Banking Vosavosa is 19, the second Sosiceni Kaitani 17, Jope Lutu is 13 and the youngest Inoke Roko is 9.

To support her four sons and put them through school as well as take care of her bedridden uncle, Makereta has to exercise careful management over her money and be entrepreneurial at the same time. With the agreement of the Nausori District Primary School, where her children attend school, she began making lunches for the students and teachers two years ago. At 5am every weekday morning, Makereta Miramira is awake. She prepares breakfast for her four sons and her elderly bedridden uncle, prepares lunches for her sons before the sun begins to peep over the horizon. At 7.30am she packs three of her sons off to school and helps the eldest get ready for work. After this she helps her uncle get ready for the day by bathing him, cleaning up his room, making his bed and then situating his chair at a place he will be comfortable in. By 10.30am, if everything goes according to plan, she has time to get cleaned up and get her kitchen ready for business. Makereta, 36, is a self-employed single mother of four boys.

This goal is being accomplished by providing sustainable financial services to 70% of Pacific Islanders who remain unbanked today. PFIP believes that those who are financially excluded are not able to achieve their full economic potential and are denied the opportunities to attain a productive and dignified living. Through innovation, PFIP has introduced several scalable and replicable projects that have brought the project closer to achieving its goals. supporting the Launch of Mobile Financial services Vodafone Fiji\u2019s M-PAiSA launch in June 2010 was the first \u201cmobile money\u201d service in the Pacific supported by PFIP. M-PAiSA was followed shortly by Digicel Mobile Money which has since been introduced in Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea (PNG) by July 2011, with a launch pending in Solomon Islands. To date these services have registered over 450,000 clients across five countries, providing them with a lower cost, secure means to transfer or store money domestically, pay bills and since 2011 receive international remittances. Helping Banks Deepen outreach to savers National Bank of Vanuatu was PFIP\u2019s first partner by helping to bring their rural branch network on line and then partnered with Nationwide Microbank in PNG to develop a cost-effective branchless banking strategy. These two institutions have 2011-2012 HIGHLIGHTS 25 added over 50,000 savers since 2008 and both launched mobile phone services in 2011, linking up with Digicel Mobile Money. Both projects were supported in partnership with AusAID and the Asian Development Bank. In 2012, PFIP is also partnering with Westpac to launch In-store Banking in Fiji, Solomon Islands, Tonga and PNG. This latest initiative allows selected merchants to conduct certain banking services like includes cash deposits, cash withdrawal, bill payments etc. using EFTPOS terminals. Westpac In-store banking allows more people to enter the formal banking system. supporting the Inclusion of Financial education in Fiji Integrating financial education into the core curricula of schools started with a UNDP pilot in Samoa. Based on that early pilot, PFIP developed FinED Fiji. Through Fiji\u2019s financial education project, 197,000 students will be exposed to personal money management and investment within schools on an annual basis. By 2013, financial education will be integrated into the existing school curricula in both primary and secondary levels throughout the 910 schools in Fiji.

Microinsurance PFIP has worked to introduce microinsurance into the Pacific since 2009.

For further development in the Pacific PFIP, AusAID, and the ILO have placed three microinsurance fellows in Fiji, PNG and Timor-Leste to assist insurance companies in building microinsurance to scale. 2011-2012 HIGHLIGHTS 26 Helping regulators take the Lead Since 2008, PFIP has worked with the region\u2019s central banks and finance ministries and helped develop and pursue the MoneyPacific Goals aimed at broadly increasing access to financial services and financial education. The central banks have taken the lead with PFIP support to develop national action plans, sponsor microfinance expos, promote financial education, and collect more data on financial inclusion. With the Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI), the central banks have a high level, Pacific working group that has worked together to create enabling regulations for branchless banking, microinsurance, review and reduce regulations that restrict access to saving, and improve oversight of microfinance institutions. In 2012, the Central Bank of Solomon Islands, Reserve Bank of Fiji and Central Bank of Samoa have held national financial competency workshops and are finalizing respective national financial inclusion strategies. research to Understand Financial Knowledge and Behavior of Low Income Households One of PFIP\u2019s core outputs is to build knowledge on the supply and demand of financial services with a specific focus on analyzing the financial competencies and behaviors of low income households in urban and rural communities. The Financial Competency project measures the \u2018knowledge\u2019 and awareness to financial tools and \u2018ability\u2019 to engage with financial products. Working with 264 households in three provinces in PNG over a period of 40 weeks, PFIP has embarked on a Financial Diaries project measuring the \u2018financial behavior\u2019 based on financial transactions and response to unexpected events during this period. An important outcome of both these research efforts is to lay the foundation for plugging the information gap for designing appropriate products targeted at women and men. Both these research projects are implemented by the Bank of PNG (BPNG) with financial assistance from PFIP and will also assist BPNG to initiate appropriate policy responses to enable private sector players to deliver products to the segment. 2011-2012 HIGHLIGHTS 27 Financial Inclusion and Gender in the Pacific The Pacific Financial Inclusion Programme (PFIP) includes specific gender targets, which must be met by both the Project and its private sector partners. The financial competency study focused on assessing the competency of women by soliciting information independently of men within low income households in rural Fiji. It highlighted that women are more competent in household financial management like budgeting and manage the household finances better. However, they have less awareness, information and access to financial tools and products. In September 2012, a National Strategy Workshop was led by the Reserve Bank of Fiji to share the findings of the study where an important policy outcome was achieved. It was decided that educating and training women on financial tools and products will form a critical component of the National Financial Inclusion strategy of Fiji and targeted financial literacy programmes will be delivered to enable women to get access to financial products and tools. Similar financial competency studies have been carried out in Samoa, Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea (PNG). PFIP is currently working with the Central Bank in each country to share the findings and initiate appropriate policy responses through National workshops by bringing together both private and public sector stakeholders. In the areas of research, PFIP focuses on understanding both the competencies and the long term financial behavior of women. To this end, PFIP launched the first of its kind initiative in the Pacific called the Financial Diaries project which seeks to understand the financial behavior of 264 low income households including women and men across three provinces in PNG \u2013 Central, Eastern Highlands and West New Britain.

How can the Pacific\u2019s experiences on climate change be shared to the wider world? The Pacific Solution Exchange: Climate Change and Development Community, an email-group based network that links development professionals and practitioners together was launched in November 2011 to enable members to share knowledge, innovative ideas and practical experiences to help solve problems related to climate change in the Pacific. The first enquiry to the members on this community was from Nauru. Ms Mavis Depaune, on behalf of the Government of Nauru approached practitioners on the community to seek advice on how Nauru can ensure the effective implementation of a new national Water, Hygiene and Sanitation Policy. She asked for examples, innovative tools, lessons learned, and best practices that others have applied to improve management of their water sector and in particular how climate change issues have been addressed. The query elicited responses from other Pacific Island government departments, development partners as well as the civil society and were compiled into a consolidated reply and shared with the Government of Nauru and the community members. Since the Pacific Solution Exchange was launched, the community has discussed a wide variety of topics ranging from national climate funds to solar water heaters. In September 2012 the community held its first annual forum, and brought together practitioners to help finalize a good practice guidance note on how best to communicate climate change to communities for the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre in Vanuatu. The other workshop at the annual forum allowed gender and climate change practitioners to consult on a toolkit for gender and climate change in the Pacific. Following the workshops a networking event was held to introduce young professionals based in Suva to the work being undertaken by a range of regional and national organizations in the field of climate change adaptation. Joining the community allows members to tap into the knowledge, expertise and experiences of other professionals and people working in a wide range of areas connected", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "703994c0-9b73-4e84-8547-d0eab1c4d925": {"__data__": {"id_": "703994c0-9b73-4e84-8547-d0eab1c4d925", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-highlights-2011-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Centre Highlights 2011-2012", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-highlights-2011-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0515130f1029c34b28661ebe9270f0e860e68ec91669037635a6aa15ab22f2c9"}}, "hash": "0515130f1029c34b28661ebe9270f0e860e68ec91669037635a6aa15ab22f2c9", "text": "to both climate change as well as those working to improve aid management and development performance more generally.

Reverend Baleikorodawa, a Professor of Theology at the Davuilevu Theological College, was one of the 35 representatives of faith-based organizations from Fiji who attended a Transformational Leadership Development training on HIV and AIDS for church leaders. At the end of the three-day training, the participants made commitments on how they would encourage HIV prevention, provide support to those affected by the virus, advocate for their rights and assist them to lead productive and fruitful lives. Reverend Baleikorodawa\u2019s commitment was to preach about the sensitive topic of HIV. \u201cTwice I was stopped after a church service and questioned why I was talking about HIV and AIDS within the church and from the pulpit. \u201cBut I have been firm and answered that God loves everyone equally and also wants people to be aware of this issue. Being ignorant would only lead people to destroy themselves and God does not want this.\u201d The Transformational Leadership Development training on HIV and AIDS is a part of a regional project targeting three countries. The first training was held in April 2011 in Fiji, organized by the UNDP Pacific Centre and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/ AIDS (UNAIDS) with the South Pacific Association of Theological Schools (SPATS). The training was facilitated by Dr Ehab El Kharrat from Egypt, himself part of an Evangelical Church and a pioneer in UNDP\u2019s Leadership Development with religious leaders in the Middle East. The training was co-facilitated by Reverend Rusiate Tuidrakulu. \u201cEngaging religious leaders in the HIV response is strategic because they have a tremendous influence in most if not all aspects of the lives of Pacific Islanders and also because, given the modes of transmission, common discourses on HIV are often morally loaded,\u201d said UNDP\u2019s Ferdinand Strobel. During the training, participants discussed scientific basics of HIV and AIDS, analyzed the multiple dimensions of the disease and its implications, heard testimonies of and interacted with people living with HIV; and learned about a range of tools to 2011-2012 HIGHLIGHTS 31 assist them in raising the awareness of their churches members. John Wesley Primary School, religious education teacher, Mrs Salaseini Ragia has been a changed woman since she attended the training. \u201cI have been teaching for 12 years now. But since April last year have I started teaching the message of love, tolerance and awareness when it comes to HIV and AIDS. In the past, I would hear about HIV and AIDS and I would just ignore it. I never thought that I had any role to play in this. \u201cBut now it is one of the most important lessons I teach these young children. I believe I am giving them a firm foundation for whatever else they will learn about HIV and AIDS and sex later on in their lives.\u201d Mrs Ragia teaches 90 students, aged between 12-13 years and divided amongst three lots of Class 8. Catechist Netani Radravu said he has faced criticism from some members of his Church who believe that issues relating to HIV and sex should not be discussed in Church and was the responsibility of parents. \u201cWhen you see teenage girls get pregnant, that is proof enough that our young people are exposing themselves to this deadly virus. They are engaging in sexual activities and we should inform them of the risks they are in,\u201d he said. Mr Radravu who is based at the Koronivia Methodist Church in Nausori, pointed out that he faced criticism from mainly the older generation in the Church. He said whenever he faced criticism he would ensure that he explained himself in such a way that he was understood. \u201cI make sure they understand where I am coming from because it is important that everyone is on the same page.\u201d 2011-2012 HIGHLIGHTS 32 Pacific Advisers Providing technical support Beyond the Pacific During 2011, a number of staff from the UNDP Pacific Centre were requested to provide technical support in a range of areas by UNDP Offices from outside the Pacific.

The Pacific Centre\u2019s Regional Democratic Institutions and Accountability Specialist was requested by the Bureau of Development Policy (BDP) to support the development of a crisis and governance programme for Somalia. To complete this assignment, the Regional Democratic Institutions and Accountability Specialist worked with the Crisis Governance Advisor, BCPR an external consultant and the Somalia Country Office; and provided advice on the political governance components of the programme, providing substantive inputs into the programme document and two concept notes on parliamentary support and a joint programme on transparency, accountability and integrity. In November, the Regional Democratic Institutions and Accountability Specialist was requested to provide technical support to the UNDP Morocco Country Office to develop an Anti-Corruption Project Document with the Morocco Government, before the national elections on 25 November 2011. The support provided to the Morocco Office was considered critical to UNDP\u2019s engagement in the country. The Regional Democratic Institutions and Accountability Specialist was invited back to Morocco in December to provide further technical support to the Country Office, as well as acting as a resource person on freedom of information in support of the regional Arab States Anti-Corruption Integrity Network (ACINET) annual meeting. The Crisis Prevention and Recovery team\u2019s Conflict Prevention and Recovery Programme Specialist provided technical support to the UNDP Somalia Office and helped to develop outcome implementation plans for the new Country Programme Document 2011 - 2015 (in outcome areas: peacebuilding; governance and rule of law; sustainable livelihoods and economic recovery; gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment). The work involved drafting, co-designing and facilitating workshops, ensuring that plans were conflict and gender- sensitive. Following two early support missions to Pakistan in 2010, the Crisis Prevention and Recovery team\u2019s Disaster Risk Management Programme Specialist joined the Indonesia Office as the Early Recovery Adviser within the Resident Coordinator\u2019s (RC) Office on a one-year attachment and was responsible for coordinating and 2011-2012 HIGHLIGHTS 33 supporting the work of UN agencies, international and national NGO and Red Cross movements in the area of early recovery. The Pacific Financial Inclusion Programme\u2019s (PFIP) Regional Financial Inclusion Advisor and Project Manager in his capacity as Regional Advisor covering the Pacific and Timor-Leste undertook various missions in 2011 to Timor-Leste and provided management, technical support, oversight and direction to the Inclusive Finance for the Under-Served Economy Programme (INFUSE) in Timor-Leste. The support involved looking at replicating the project successes from the Pacific in Timor- Leste. As a direct consequence, INFUSE Timor-Leste benefitted from technical assistance by PFIP\u2019s Technical Specialist and the Financial Capacity Advisor conducting market research to inform potential branchless banking deployments and to establish a financial competency baseline for effective targeting, designing and measuring the success for financial literacy training programmes. The PFIP and INFUSE Deputy Project Manager, also undertook various missions to provide operational support to the INFUSE project. The MDG and Poverty team\u2019s Regional MDG Specialist provided support as a resource person to the UNDP Mongolia Office for the Annual Legal Empowerment Asia Partnership (LEAP) Meeting, in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia in October. The purpose of the meeting was a follow-up on LEAP regional meeting organized in Bangkok and provided a forum to share experiences and initiatives undertaken to empower the poor and vulnerable groups; introduce guidance notes on methods on identifying barriers to Legal Empowerment of the Poor in Asia Region; and discuss ways forward.

APHDRs are independent policy advocacy documents supported by UNDP as outcomes of multi -stakeholder participatory processes. The central mandate of HDRU is to produce Regional Human Development Reports for Asia-Pacific to support advocacy and capacity development on critical regional development concerns. The HDRU is responsible for the Asia-Pacific Human Development Network (AP-HDNet), a knowledge network where knowledge and good practices on human development amongst a wide audience of development practitioners and other stakeholders are shared. The Network is an integral part of the process leading to the preparation of the APHDRs, as a broad cross-section of stakeholders engages in a lively, diverse and rich debate of relevance to the Report. The Asia-Pacific Human Development Report The Asia-Pacific Human Development Report (APHDR) deals with long-term development concerns that are impor- tant for several countries, have cross-border dimensions, and contain sensitivities that are better addressed at a regional rather than country level. The Report helps UNDP engage with larger external audiences on such issues. Themes of the previous APHDRs are: \u2022\ufffd HIV/AIDS and Development in South Asia \u2022\ufffd Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals \u2022\ufffd Trade on Human Terms: Transforming Trade for Human Development in Asia and the Pacific \u2022\ufffd Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives: Accelerating Human Development in Asia and the Pacific Power, Voice and Rights: A Turning Point for Gender Equality in Asia and the Pacific \u2022\ufffd The theme of the APHDR under preparation is Climate Change. Climate change is of long-term relevance, has inherent cross-border dimensions, has some politically sensitive aspects arising from win-loose perceptions in the short-run, and is critical for all countries, making it suitable for a multi-country report. E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development In 2010 the Asia-Pacific Human Development Network (AP-HDNet) discussion on climate change and human development was launched to explore how climate change would affect human development, with a focus on how to improve the quality of human life in the changing climate. The discussion aimed to: Engage its subscribers in focused discussions on issues linked to the contours of the APHDR under \u2022 preparation Strengthen capacity through sharing ideas, examples, experiences and good practices around the theme of the \u2022 APHDR Provide a platform for generating and sharing knowledge, including data, research, priorities, views, ideas as \u2022 part of the bundle of raw material used for the preparation of the APHDR The e-discussion started on 4 February 2010 and ended on 30 July 2010. Due to the complexity and diversity of the issues involved, the e-discussion was divided into several sub-themes. In addition to the seven sub-themes initially announced, a sub-theme focusing on folklore and traditional knowledge was also discussed. The discussion was facilitated by Pak Sum Low and Bernarditas Muller, with the exception of the last sub-theme for which the discussion was facilitated by the HDRU Team. We would like to acknowledge with gratitude all the contributors who shared their knowledge and experience. Without them this exercise would not have been possible. We are indebted to Pak Sum Low and Bernarditas Muller who facilitated the discussion on the first seven sub-themes and prepared the synthesis of the discussion they facilitated.

Thus, it was timely for the Asia-Pacific Human Development Network (AP-HDNet) of UNDP to initiate the e-discussion on Climate Change and Human Development that aimed to explore how climate change would affect human development, and their complex interactions, with a focus on how to improve the quality of human life in the changing climate. The e-discussion started on 4 February 2010 when the Opening Message was posted, and ended on 30 July 2010 when the Closing Statement of the final sub-theme was posted. Due to the complexity and diversity of the issues involved, the e-discussion was divided into eight sub-themes, as follows: 1. Vision of a Climate-Resilient Society (8 February-7 March 2010) (facilitated by Pak Sum Low) 2. Mapping and Measuring (8-22 March 2010) (facilitated by Pak Sum Low) 3. Adaptation (including technology and financing) and Climate-Related Disaster Risk Reduction (22 March-18 April 2010) (facilitated by Bernarditas Muller) 4. Human Security (including food and nutrition, and energy security) and Human Rights (19 April-3 May 2010) (facilitated by Pak Sum Low) 5. Mitigation, Technology Transfer and Financing (3-24 May 2010) (facilitated by Bernarditas Muller) 6. Research, Education, Training and Public Awareness (24 May-14 June 2010) (facilitated by Pak Sum Low) 7. Global Negotiations from Copenhagen to Mexico: Implications for Future Generations (14 June-6 July 2010) (facilitated by Bernarditas Muller) 8. Folklore, Traditional Knowledge, Idiomatic Expressions, Proverbs and Quotes (8-30 July 2010) (facilitated by the HDRU Team) The above sub-themes were interlinked. The dates and duration of discussion for each sub-theme were indicated above. The duration of discussion for respective sub-themes varied from two to four weeks, but mostly lasted for three weeks. We have received extensive responses from the Network Members. Indeed, many have joined the Network as new members because of the e-discussion. Nearly 100 contributions have been posted, excluding the Facilitators\u2019 opening and closing statements for each sub-theme. Most contributions were submitted from the Asia-Pacific region, though a few contributions were submitted from other regions, including one from Seychelles. We would like to thank all contributors for their perceptive, useful and important contributions that have touched upon a rich and diverse range of important issues relating to all sub-themes. This synthesis report is largely based on the summaries provided in the closing statements of the above seven sub- themes. It aims to provide a quick review of all discussions undertaken in each sub-theme. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 11 2.

To facilitate the discussion, the Facilitator in the Opening Statement highlighted the following definition of \u201cresilient\u201d provided in the Oxford English dictionary: \u201cadjective: 1 able to recoil or spring back into shape after bending, stretching, or being compressed. 2 (of a person) able to withstand or recover quickly from difficult conditions.\u201d Thus, part 1 of this definition refers to the physical system, while part 2 refers to the human system.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e674e445-79f3-418f-be0c-1ca8af3d0810": {"__data__": {"id_": "e674e445-79f3-418f-be0c-1ca8af3d0810", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4466a5378d91f06cffa76c309dc4c8dbf9098d3ff206998cf83c8a2f2a7855e0"}, "2": {"node_id": "085aab66-f0c5-4ff3-8a79-a14a45d4345f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1e98c63b06502f5481b736896e2b677860cbaefdf0d2b8392a51b1ea0664b14c"}}, "hash": "de71a884a8b20b61e02c839564c101ce1b0e50e2e8c7e6c3c00a2c222a954c19", "text": "Based on part 2 of the definition, a \u201cclimate-resilient\u201d society could mean a society that is \u201cable to withstand or recover quickly from difficult conditions\u201d caused by the adverse effects of climate change, including climate-related hazards and disasters. However, the Facilitator also pointed out that the ability \u201cto withstand or recover quickly from difficult conditions\u201d caused by the adverse effects of climate change over short or longer term depends on many factors, especially on the vulnerability of a society to these adverse effects. The vulnerability of a society to climate-related hazards (natural or human-induced) is a function of duration of exposure, as well as environmental (including natural ecosystems that provide the environmental services), social, economic, technological and political (including policy) factors. Thus, the strengthening of coping or adaptive capacity is crucial to ensuring a climate- resilient society or a society with reduced risk to the adverse effects of climate change.

A few contributions cited specific examples or case studies, such as those in China (Andrea De Angelis and G\u00f8rild Heggelund), Bangladesh (Aminul Islam), USA and Myanmar (Chew-Hung Chang), and Viet Nam (Koos Neefjes; Mai Van Trinh). However, Ramesh Gampat provided \u201ca dissenting voice to the notion of a climate-resilient society (CRS)\u201d. He questioned if \u201ca society has the ability to completely recover\u201d or \u201cbounce back\u201d from a temporary or even permanent \u201cclimatic perturbation\u201d. He also questioned \u201cthe technical and economic viability of a CRS\u201d beyond a certain yet-to- be established threshold, and suggested that the cost may be \u201cprohibitive\u201d. He believed that \u201cit is more useful to talk about the planet\u201d rather than \u201ca society or some societies, affected by and coping with climate change\u201d, though he found \u201cit difficult to conceive of a climate-resilient planet, given that earth is a closed ecosystem\u201d. Sarwat Chowdhury echoed a similar view that it is not possible \u201cfor societies facing the manifold impacts of climate change to rebound back to their original state\u201d since the situation cannot be \u2018elastic\u2019. She highlighted the \u201csub- subsistence \u2018resilience\u2019\u201d that simply indicates that the people have \u201cadjusted to a new normal\u201d. Further to Ramesh Gampat\u2019s observation, Ernesto Bautista provided some equally thought-provoking comments by highlighting the time-dependent nature of the factors (e.g., state of knowledge, technology, resources, and institutions, among others) that affect \u201cthe ability of society", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c56f6d8b-05a6-4031-8923-0edd1d320ad8": {"__data__": {"id_": "c56f6d8b-05a6-4031-8923-0edd1d320ad8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e7bcae189f66c8bb8c11b581d42f626db5908482c36ff4b847fdeceaf0f4c911"}, "3": {"node_id": "998ab43c-0c4e-4906-8472-aa23a6ac48c7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3cb3274eb3932663a472aa167e0b450431c10e47dff85a96671dc00ab06fb184"}}, "hash": "50ae3f717955e5f9c9e7c7bedf39c229027de6976b67a13cb211cebb516b9c06", "text": "to completely recover from climate change disturbance\u201d.

On a similar point, Kishan Khoday and Usha Natarajan highlighted how the \u201cchanging nature of society\u201d in Asia will be central for understanding the nature of \u201ca climate resilience society\u201d and for design of effective responses. They emphasized the \u201cpotentially transformative role of civil society\u201d as \u201cboth global consumers and local agents of change\u201d, who can \u201cgenerate a forward-looking vision of multilateralism and galvanize a new generation of global environmental citizens across Asia\u201d to address the emerging \u201ccommon concern of humanity\u201d. Two contributions discussed the sub-theme within the context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Bernarditas Muller emphasized that the UNFCCC, \u201cwhen providing for responses to the adverse effects of climate change\u201d, focuses on adaptation, as the adverse effects of climate change \u201care wide -ranging, covering all aspects of human development and not only the physical environment\u201d as suggested by the word \u201cresilience\u201d in Article 1.1 of the Convention on \u201cdefinitions\u201d. She pointed out that adaptation \u201cis also the obligation for which financing and technology should be provided to developing countries\u201d, and that \u201cpolicy-making is solely under the competence of States\u201d, and \u201cit should not be imposed as a conditionality for enabling means to be provided to developing countries to meet their sustainable development objectives\u201d. Hasna Cheema highlighted that the major principles of the UNFCCC (1992) and its Kyoto Protocol (1997), such as \u201ccommon but differentiated responsibilities\u201d; \u201cprotection of vulnerable societies\u201d; \u201cprevention and mitigation\u201d; \u201csustainable development\u201d and \u201csustainable economic growth\u201d, are \u201ccritical to foster climate-resilient\u201d or \u201cclimate-adaptive\u201d societies. If fully CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 13 implemented, including the commitments of Annexes I and II Parties for non-Annex I Parties (e.g., Articles 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5), they \u201ccan lay the foundation of climate justice and promote international efforts to reduce global emissions\u201d. To add her voice on the issues raised by Bernarditas Muller and Hasna Cheema, Amelia Supetran stressed the need to translate \u201cknowledge\u201d into actions with the provision of financial resources \u201cfree of conditionalities\u201d, as well as development and transfer of technology, as agreed under the UNFCCC. 3. Summary of Discussions of Sub-theme 2 The two-week discussion of sub-theme 2 on Mapping and Measuring continued many of the issues raised in Sub- theme 1: Vision of a climate-resilient society.

This point was strongly reiterated by Anuradha Rajivan; The effects of human development, as captured by Human Development Index (HDI), are non-linear- higher \u2022 levels of HDI actually correlate with higher levels of risk (Anthony Patt); There are diverse patterns between CO \u2022 2 emission per capita and the HDI. For example, more than \u201cone- fifth\u201d of the 113 countries sampled \u201cpumped less CO2 per capita into the atmosphere even as their GDP and HDI have risen\u201d. In general, it seems that \u201cmost countries pump out increasing volumes of CO2 to achieve rising human development\u201d.

Summary of Discussions of Sub-theme 3 Fourteen contributions were received to enrich the discussions under this sub-theme Adaptation (including technology and financing) and Climate-Related Disaster Risk Reduction, which in many ways continued the exchange started in the previous sub-themes. The contributors were all experts on the ground: Lisa Schipper; Nishadi Eriyagama; Alain Lambert and Ioana Creitaru; Ramesh Gampat; Stephanie Hodge, Suchita Sugar and Sonia Sukdeo (joint contribution); Ilan Kelman and J.C. Gaillard (joint contribution); G. Padmanabhan; Amelia Supetran; Patrina Dumaru; Heather Bell and Ray Shirkhodai (joint contribution); Pradeepa Malkanthi; Mai Van Trinh; Bonheur Neou, Kien Tran Mai, Pornsook Chongprasith and Pak Sum Low (joint contribution); Sudip Mitra; and Wong Poh Poh. It seems, however, that there remains the need to clarify the understanding of the nature of the linkages among the concepts of climate resilience, climate change adaptation and disaster risk management. Is there a hierarchy of relationships among them, or do they represent various stages of one comprehensive strategy to address the adverse effects of climate change? How could management of both lead to sustainable development? Some answers can be gleaned from the discussions and the concrete examples provided by the contributors. The contribution of Ilan Kelman and J.C. Gaillard constituted one end of the spectrum of views, and held that climate change adaptation (CCA) can be encompassed within disaster risk reduction (DRR) strategies. Other contributors, such as Heather Bell and Ray Shirkhodai as well as Pradeepa Malkanthi, viewed the linkages between CCA and DRR clearly within the context of sustainable development. Lisa Schipper called for a \u201creal shift in development paradigms\u201d in order to address both DRR and CCA effectively. Still others clearly recognized the opportunities offered and challenges faced in redefining development in sustainable terms, including Amelia Supetran on the Philippine experience in implementing programmes on DRR that advance CCA. Concrete experiences were provided in the contributions of Alain Lambert and Ioana Creitaru on the Maldives and South Mexico; Nishadi Eriyagama on adaptation options in the water sector in Sri Lanka; Mai Van Trinh on adaptation strategies in the two main river deltas in Viet Nam; and Sudip Mitra in citing the recognition of this perspective shown for the first time in the 10th five-year plan of India. The Climate Change Adaptation Initiative of the Mekong River Commission, contributed jointly by Bonheur Neou, Kien Tran Mai, Pornsook Chongprasith, and Pak Sum Low, gave detailed information on an important initiative on the largest river system in Asia. Other important aspects that impact on the effective implementation of DRR and CCA activities were demonstrated in Stephanie Hodge, Suchita Sugar and Sonia Sukdeo\u2019s contribution on the importance of quality education, particularly for children. Patrina Dumaru\u2019s contribution on a pilot project in Fiji underlined the importance of an integrated approach to CCA, making use of traditional and local knowledge and the involvement of indigenous communities for successful implementation of adaptation strategies. For this reason, the UNFCCC provides for support for the development and enhancement of endogenous capacities and technologies of developing countries. The importance of people-oriented interventions was also highlighted by G. Padmanabhan in his contribution on the climate-related disasters in India. Wong Poh Poh pointed out that not only climate-related hazards but also disasters resulting from natural phenomena, such as tsunamis, should be taken into account in undertaking CCA in coastal areas. Innovative measures involving local solutions with the use of local resources should be explored to overcome problems of financing as well as difficulties in integrating CCA measures in national development planning. He cited in particular the rehabilitation of mangroves to address sea-level rise as an example of these measures. Almost all contributions touched on the financing and technology aspects of climate change adaptation. Amelia Supetran pointed to innovative means of financing that would be needed for adaptation strategies, one free from conditionalities that inhibit innovation and that would instill a sense of ownership essential for long-term responses to a decidedly long-term challenge of adaptation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e34876c1-a2d6-426d-ac5b-a6783b8e1404": {"__data__": {"id_": "e34876c1-a2d6-426d-ac5b-a6783b8e1404", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8ceca3d1deccd20d042df4a94d0841e4591b0b59698fcee16a15d7716e5e63a1"}, "2": {"node_id": "1cb7e70f-37ab-4732-9fb9-548c3cad95d4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f2bef37898fccf5457a86aa3f6bd640a894a3445491caec735229e18efbd9d4a"}}, "hash": "8c9d48833feadc36916908da2b5daa9bb4186624205526a7b0f837d64cc96bc7", "text": "The Facilitator added that adequacy and predictability of financing are necessary in order to allow for long-term planning for adaptation.

The same applies to the discussion in Ramesh Gampat\u2019s contribution of a proposal for a \u201cglobal carbon-price target\u201d and the establishment of a \u201cGreen Fund\u201d to reward compliance with this target. These proposals would be feasible and acceptable within the current climate change process if differentiated responsibilities for historical emissions are factored in the determination of a price target, and if the Green Fund would be under the authority of the Parties to the UNFCCC which would provide policy guidance, determine programme priorities and set eligibility criteria for the use of the Fund. It is a misperception to state that insufficient funding is portrayed within the context of the UNFCCC as a limit to getting societies to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change. Financing to address climate change and its adverse effects has specific provisions under the Convention, and is clearly not limited to adequacy alone. Moreover, what is \u201cadequate\u201d can only be determined by the countries themselves, and for this, the UNFCCC has programmes for financial and technology needs assessments. Adaptation in particular is considered to be country-specific, even site- specific, and its financing, including for technology, cannot be fully assessed in terms of global estimates. Adaptation and mitigation are mutually supportive, and the \u201cglue\u201d that holds them together is sustainable development. One must also keep in mind the first of the Rio Principles: \u201cHuman beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable development. They are entitled to a healthy and productive life in harmony with nature.\u201d (United Nations 1992a). 5. Summary of Discussions of Sub-theme 4 The discussion of sub-theme 4 on Human Security (including food and nutrition, and energy security) and Human Rights had attracted 12 contributions from 13 authors: Ulrik Halsteen; Ranjani K. Murthy; Sribas Chandra Bhattacharya; Susan Wong; Ohnmar Khaing; Usha Natarajan and Kishan Khoday (joint contribution); Manoja Wickramarathne; Kishan Khoday; Khurshid Alam; Keith Openshaw; Shiming Ma; and Abdul Qadir Rafiq, respectively. The contributions discussed the implications of the adverse effects of climate change on human security, and the issues covered range from human rights, energy security, food security, livelihoods, gender, population, disaster risk reduction, mitigation, adaptation, to wetland ecosystems. While some contributions focused on a single and unique issue, others touched upon multiple issues. Case studies, examples or experiences from Bangladesh, China, India, Myanmar, Pakistan and the Pacific Islands, have been shared. A number of specific response measures at both policy and operational levels have been proposed. Ulrik Halsteen set the scene by highlighting that the concept of \u201chuman security\u201d \u201cencompasses not only the absence of conflict but also the effective protection and enjoyment of human rights, including access to education and adequate food, housing and health care\u201d. In particular, he stressed that \u201cpolicies and measures\u201d are required to protect the \u201cwell-being of the most vulnerable communities\u201d, such as \u201cindigenous peoples\u201d, \u201cwomen, older persons and persons with disabilities\u201d. Both national and international human rights laws have provided \u201cimportant safeguards and guidelines for the protection of affected individuals and communities\u201d. Linking climate change to the right to development, Usha Natarajan and Kishan Khoday emphasized that a \u201cstable climate is an essential underlying element of the right to development\u201d. They regarded melting of glaciers in the Himalayas, which \u201cprovide food and water security for hundreds of millions of people in the region\u201d as one of the \u201cmost prominent and serious challenges\u201d, especially the glaciers in the Tibetan Plateau, where many of Asia\u2019s great rivers originate (e.g., Yangtze, Yellow, Mekong and Brahmaputra rivers). They have expanded Amartya Sen\u2019s \u201cDevelopment as a Freedom\u201d model to a \u201cSustainable Development as a Freedom\u201d model, and added \u201cecological security\u201d as the sixth freedom in addition to the \u201cfive freedoms outlined in the original framework\u201d.

He concluded that \u201cWithout continual and concerted investment in people and products from renewable resources, especially biomass, the world will not be able to have sustainable development.\u201d Kishan Khoday discussed the external implications of Asia\u2019s quest for energy security as a result of economic growth, particularly in the Arab region. He identified three key areas where opportunities exist for Asia-Arab (South-South) cooperation: (1) promotion of socially and environmentally responsible investments; (2) diversification of oil-dependent economies by shifting to global manufacturing and service sectors; and (3) establishment of enabling policy environments for local development of clean energy technologies, including public-private partnerships for their rapid commercialization in the domestic market. Three contributions discussed food security. Ohnmar Khaing described how the reduced rainfall and the lack of water in the dry zone of Myanmar in recent years has led to the significant decline in crop yields and livestock production, and hence the food insecurity. These have also affected the farmers\u2019 incomes, livelihoods and social dynamics (e.g., migration and out-migration), especially the vulnerability of women. She suggested a few possible \u201cclimate-proofing\u201d measures, and stressed the important role of non-governmental organizations in sharing experiences and knowledge on adaptation and mitigation measures. Manoja Wickramarathne highlighted the challenges that the Pacific Islands are facing as a result of \u201cocean warming, frequent tropical cyclones, flash floods and droughts\u201d, \u201cprolonged variations from the normal rainfall\u201d, sea-level rise, ocean acidity and coral bleaching, all of which \u201care likely to have dramatic impact on the food production system\u201d, including agriculture, fisheries, forests (a source of traditional medicines), and water resources, and hence these will have profound implications for \u201cthe people\u2019s food and economic security\u201d. She emphasized the need for \u201caccurate information\u201d relating to \u201cthe economic impacts of future climatic conditions\u201d; the strengthening of \u201cenabling environment\u201d for adaptation measures and their implementation, especially within the context of multiple stresses; and capacity development for decision makers and the public. Shiming Ma informed on an interesting case study conducted in Ningxia, northwest China, \u201cto investigate and evaluate the cost-benefit effectiveness of northward winter wheat as an adaptation option to climate change both in the field and in farmers\u2019 households\u201d. The case study, which has implications for food security, used two IPCC scenarios to project yield trends for this particular food crop. The results \u201cshow that the multiple cropping of winter wheat and vegetable had the best economic benefits\u201d, although it entailed maximum costs. Thus, \u201cwinter wheat could not totally substitute for spring wheat\u201d. However, further research is needed. Two contributions specifically focused on women issues in South Asia. Ranjani K. Murthy drew our attention in India to \u201chow different groups of women and men are affected differently\u201d by climate change \u201cbased on caste, class, pregnancy status, marital status and other aspects of identity and diversity\u201d. She cited a few examples of \u201cpre-existing gender inequities\u201d in social relations and development, including the extreme vulnerability of \u201cdalit and tribal women\u201d to \u201csexual exploitation in times of economic crisis following floods\u201d; high \u201cfemale illiteracy levels\u201d means that they are unaware of any \u201cearly warning on floods and cyclones (especially through newspapers)\u201d; among others. Thus, both government and donor policies have to be \u201csensitive to sex/gender differentiated human security needs and human rights interests of women and men in the context of climate change\u201d, and that the \u201cdiversity in needs and interests across marital status, economic status, caste, and pregnancy/lactation status etc. of women\u201d must be recognized in policy and practice. However, Khurshid Alam highlighted that in Bangladesh, women are more vulnerable to climate- related impacts due to their limited ability to cope, and they are facing more social, economic, political, informational and migration barriers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "99508d42-5d09-44a5-b3a6-ff3097d2721a": {"__data__": {"id_": "99508d42-5d09-44a5-b3a6-ff3097d2721a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "788ded1ca56c3a787480a6b893a1bcaef367b4d3336b849c13c6008f75206171"}, "2": {"node_id": "67ade5d8-a48c-454b-9e16-6846d95658f0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e33cf27036092797d17ccbe26e00c2fddd91a522e9a67d62c5606292b80c9193"}}, "hash": "b6a3b5143dad9f3686a6e22078f2ba197a0bc4dc199ee3df68cf0ae2ee4faa71", "text": "He added that food security, including intra-household food distribution, affected by climate change will \u201cexacerbate pre-existing inequalities in the society, in which women\u2019s share of household food will most likely go down\u201d.

These include provision of various important \u201cgoods and services\u201d, including the opportunities \u201cfor improving people\u2019s livelihoods, particularly for wetland-dependent, marginalized and vulnerable people\u201d; and as \u201cthe planet\u2019s natural infrastructure for addressing climate change\u201d. Thus, a \u201chealthy natural wetland infrastructure\u201d is not only \u201ca major asset in combating and adapting to climate change\u201d, but also essential in ensuring the preservation and enhancement of indigenous communities\u2019 livelihoods, cultures and traditional knowledge. The last contribution came from Abdul Qadir Rafiq, who highlighted many challenging issues experienced in Pakistan, especially the vulnerable communities in the coastal, arid and mountainous regions, where the threats of climate change \u201care increasing the vulnerability of the poorest segments of the Pakistan\u2019s society and imperil human security with reduction in food supplies, water stresses, unreliable access to the sources of energy and diminishing livelihoods at the local level\u201d. He stressed the need for local \u201cshort and medium term coping strategies that address the human security issues\u201d, while fully recognizing \u201cthe unequal impact on men and women\u201d. As \u201crural women are the principal contributor of basic foods, and the agricultural sector is highly susceptible to risks of drought and uncertain precipitation\u201d, any impacts on \u201cfood security\u201d would threaten their well-being and capacity to survive. A number of interesting observations have surfaced from the contributions. For example, Usha Natarajan and Kishan Khoday have expanded Amartya Sen\u2019s \u201cDevelopment as a Freedom\u201d model to a \u201cSustainable Development as a Freedom\u201d model, and highlighted the importance of \u201cecological security\u201d. This is very much along the same thinking of the Facilitator\u2019s opening message dated 19 April 2010, in which he pointed out that \u201cWhile every country has its right to development, it is important to emphasize that countries should aim for sustainable development, i.e., the \u201cgood\u201d development that integrates environmental, social and economic development as an entity rather than the \u201cbad\u201d development that pursues economic development at all costs (including environmental and social costs) without taking environmental and social parameters into consideration\u201d. Keith Openshaw raised the issue of \u201climits to growth\u201d, and cited Bhutan\u2019s \u2018Gross National Happiness\u2019 (GNH) as a model for sustainable development. Indeed, what makes people happy has been a focus of discussion in recent years by many social scientists. Susan Wong noted that the destruction of ecosystems is likely to cause the loss of \u201cboth the human repositories for traditional knowledge along with generations of that priceless knowledge\u201d of the indigenous communities through the loss of their livelihoods, \u201cfood security and sovereignty\u201d. Other human security issues relating to climate change include climate refugees and conflicts over scarce resources. Although these important issues have not been discussed in the contributions, they have been discussed elsewhere and they are expected to feature more prominently in the near future. 6. Summary of Discussions of Sub-theme 5 All of the ten contributions received for this sub-theme Mitigation, Technology Transfer and Financing covered very important aspects of climate change mitigation in developing countries in Asia, and the role of financing and technology development in these activities. The contributors were: Massimo Tavoni; K. Madhava Sarma; Lu Qi; G\u00f8rild Heggelund, Andrea De Angelis and Inga Fritzen Buan (joint contribution); Kishan Khoday; Pak Sum Low; Keith Openshaw; Yang Youlin; Thanakvaro De Lopez; and Sarwat Chowdhury. Many contributions underlined the crucial role of technology in climate change mitigation. K. Madhava Sarma shared the valuable experience on technology development and transfer in the Montreal Protocol on the phase-out of ozone-depleting substances, and offered areas that might be explored further for climate change mitigation. Massimo Tavoni also focused on the need for increased research and development in technology, both for present and innovative future technologies, for climate change. Citing the case of Cambodia, Thanakvaro De Lopez gave an analysis of the difficulties faced by small developing countries in acquiring the necessary technology for the implementation of mitigation actions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8842a4e3-41a4-48d1-83c4-8b84f1b1c48f": {"__data__": {"id_": "8842a4e3-41a4-48d1-83c4-8b84f1b1c48f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "484e33eed9a36e10381c80283fd88080151fb9f9e4c996866a89b4bfaf9d171c"}, "2": {"node_id": "b4538017-538d-42f7-b2f7-87fcaee4af70", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1129338cac4bea377d1678fefd3a3bfbb391b45302242ca51652bad13f4d9071"}}, "hash": "9fe0e4bb3b31a6ea2dd4c8ac14ed653e3577d394a9e08d276c55711ca7647ab9", "text": "The importance of technology for the pursuit of a low-carbon economy, especially in China, was also the focus of the contribution from G\u00f8rild Heggelund, Andrea De Angelis and Inga Fritzen Buan.

Very little progress has been made both on the ground and in the discussions on the implementation of developed countries\u2019 commitments on technology development and transfer in the UNFCCC, including in the current negotiations. Studies have also shown that little or no technology transfer has taken place through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The contributions by Yang Youlin and Lu Qi showed that much is being done for mitigation in Asian developing countries, in China in particular, through policies and programmes on sustainable land management. These demonstrated that developing countries are undertaking mitigation actions, even without the financing and technology resources from developed countries, but that they could do much more if these legal obligations would be met under the UNFCCC. These two contributions also underlined the co-benefits that are derived from climate change mitigation activities, in terms of providing better livelihoods for the people, and preserving biological diversity. Kishan Khoday\u2019s analysis of the impacts on global trade of national mitigation policies was a focus of the current negotiations because of the economic and social consequences of response measures to climate change. Article 3.5 of the Convention, taken from the Rio principles, stipulates that \u201cmeasures taken to combat climate change, including unilateral ones, should not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade\u201d (United Nations 1992b). The danger exists not only in the projected legislation in the United States, but also in Western Europe, especially France. This illustrates that policy responses to address climate change and its adverse effects should be dictated not by economic interests alone. Least developed countries (LDCs), as demonstrated by Sarwat Chowdhury, face many difficulties in taking mitigation actions. It is for this reason that, in the climate change negotiations, developing countries have taken the position that there must be a balanced consideration of adaptation and mitigation, in particular for financing. It is indeed true that LDCs have little project activities under the CDM. This is also because many LDCs, especially in Africa, are net sinks instead of net sources of greenhouse gas emissions. The recognition that many developing countries, especially LDCs and small island countries, have little mitigation capabilities is the main reason that the Adaptation Fund was set up under the CDM in the Kyoto Protocol. The Adaptation Fund, mainly financed through shares of certified emission reductions (CERs) under the CDM, is a solidarity fund through which the developing countries that have CDM projects share the benefits derived from these projects with other developing countries. Furthermore, the CERs are added to the assigned amount of developed countries which means that whatever is reduced in developing countries can be emitted by developed countries, and therefore have no direct climate benefits. The CDM is only beneficial for emission reduction if the project activities assist developing countries in their pursuit of sustainable development, or a low-emission pathway to growth. In this regard, developing countries refer to a low-emission growth, rather than merely to low-carbon development that covers only reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. Many developing countries in Asia have a large amount of emissions coming from agriculture, in particular rice production, and need to address these emissions as well. Keith Openshaw\u2019s contribution on the detrimental effects of unrestricted population growth on development in general and climate change mitigation in particular made valid arguments. A sustainable population policy in developing countries would, however, need to be accompanied by other sustainable development objectives. It has been shown that empowerment of women, education and the availability of basic services are also powerful \u201ccontraceptives\u201d. Pak Sum Low\u2019s important contribution on the need for equity in the consideration of mitigation actions in terms of changes in consumption lifestyles, given the poverty in developing countries struck the right note, and went to the heart of the need for climate change responses. The UNFCCC has stipulated that all countries shall \u201cprotect the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations of humankind, on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities\u201d as its first principle. \u201cAccordingly\u201d, it continues, \u201cthe developed country Parties should take the lead in combating climate change and the adverse effects thereof\u201d.

Summary of Discussions of Sub-theme 6 There were 14 contributions to the discussion of sub-theme 6: Research, Education, Training and Public Awareness from 16 authors: Prathivadi Bhayankaram Anand; Trevor Booth; Sukthawee Suwannachairop; Purba H. Rao; Michele Martin; Paula Pons and Binoy K. Choudhury (joint contribution); Elena Borsatti; Va Dany; Chew- Hung Chang; Linda Too; Kishan Khoday, Stephanie Hodge and Suchitra Sugar (joint contribution); Tim Taylor; and Ruwanthi Senarathne, respectively. Six contributions discussed various aspects of research (Prathivadi Bhayankaram Anand; Trevor Booth; Sukthawee Suwannachairop; Paula Pons and Binoy K. Choudhury; Va Dany; and Linda Too); while two contributions were specially focusing on education and training (Chew-Hung Chang; and Stephanie Hodge and Suchitra Sugar); and another six contributions on public awareness (Purba H. Rao; Michele Martin; Elena Borsatti; Kishan Khoday; Tim Taylor; and Ruwanthi Senarathne). However, a few contributions also touched upon multiple issues (e.g., research, education and training by Paula Pons and Binoy K. Choudhury; research and communication by Trevor Booth; awareness and education by Michele Martin; research, awareness and education by Tim Taylor). On research, Prathivadi Bhayankaram Anand emphasized the need for the social science input, especially governance; the need for \u201cmaintaining an approach of critical scrutiny\u201d; and the need to prioritize mitigation and adaptation measures due to scarce resources in developing countries and to avoid \u201cincorrect priorities\u201d. He also emphasized the importance of engaging the wider public for better policymaking. Trevor Booth highlighted the development of a Marine Climate Change Report Card, \u201cthe first-ever Australian benchmark of climate change impacts on marine ecosystems\u201d, including the development of communication programmes to convey relevant messages to a broad audience (e.g., through websites). This has provided useful experience for other Asia-Pacific countries. Sukthawee Suwannachairop stressed the importance of community-led participatory research (or the villagers research) in vulnerability and adaptation assessment, as well as the need to support a constructive and functioning Track III diplomacy, such as to provide the NGOs with \u201cparallel meeting where climate change adaptation issues can be discussed openly and the marginalized groups can make their voice heard\u201d. Paula Pons and Binoy K. Choudhury discussed the need for research (and also education and training) on appropriate technologies that encourage public participation as an important tool for achieving sustainable development, and national policies must be \u201csupportive of appropriate technologies\u201d, such as renewable energy technologies, including \u201chome-grown technologies\u201d. They also stressed the importance of tapping the innovativeness of people, particularly \u201cyoung people and farmer-inventors\u201d. Va Dany discussed the concepts of adaptation and vulnerability, the role of vulnerability assessment (VA) in the adaptation process, and methodologies. She introduced an ongoing research study (2009-2012) undertaken by the Royal University of Phnom Penh \u201cto evaluate the linkages of VA and adaptation strategy in the water and health sectors in Cambodia\u201d within the context of national poverty reduction strategies, while strengthening the \u201clocal and national capacity to conduct VA in order to enhance local and national adaptive capacity\u201d.

He also used these questions to gauge the progress of various environmental education activities that have been undertaken by both the government and the non-governmental organizations in Singapore since 1972, including the first Singapore Green Plan (SGP) in 1992 and its new SGP 2012. His ideas of \u201cgreen schools\u201d and green workforce are innovative. He believes that \u201cthe person on the street has as much a role to play in mitigating climate change impacts as governments and industries\u201d, and the consumers\u2019 choice of products could make a significant difference in terms of reducing \u201ccarbon miles\u201d. Stephanie Hodge and Suchitra Sugar stressed that \u201ccurrent education must be transformed to be inclusive, protective, democratic and child-centred\u201d, and it is important \u201cto uphold a vision of quality and access to education for all\u201d within the context of \u201cEducation for Sustainable Development (ESD)\u201d, which \u201cis particularly well- suited to addressing climate change in terms of understanding its causes, recognizing its impact, and implementing appropriate responses\u201d. They highlighted UNICEF\u2019s \u201cmodel for quality education\u201d and other UNICEF Education initiatives, such as \u201cEducation in Emergencies\u201d that provides \u201cdisaster risk education\u201d in more than 25 countries; and \u201cChild-Friendly Schools\u201d that include \u201cthe promotion of sustainable facilities in schools, including alternative energies, rainwater harvesting and school gardens\u201d. Paula Pons and Binoy K. Choudhury, apart from stressing the importance of technological research (see above), also emphasized the importance of education and training in assisting the communities to better prepare for the adverse impacts of climate change. Tim Taylor also emphasized the importance of education that provides \u201cthe next generation\u201d the \u201cinsights into the risks of climate change\u201d. On public awareness, Purba H. Rao found from their survey in Kolkata, India, that both the executives/managers of large corporations and the \u201chundreds and thousands\u201d of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and entrepreneurs were aware of climate change and its impacts. However, unlike large corporations, the SMEs found it difficult to get \u201cclimate friendly\u201d projects because they lack funding, intensive capital, manpower and technical know-how. She proposed two ways to overcome this dilemma: (1) \u201cinclusive growth to sustainability\u201d (i.e., let the large corporations show the way through forums and expertise advice by enabling the SMEs to follow their examples); and (2) Green supply chain management that holds \u201cregular awareness seminars\u201d to help suppliers and business partners to go green. Michele Martin shared the successful experience of the various public awareness activities undertaken by Sustainability for Seychelles (S4S), \u201ca non-governmental organization (NGO) established in 2007 to promote sustainable living in Seychelles\u201d. The S4S activities used various means, including workshops, media and art forms, targeting at different groups (e.g., children, post-secondary students, citizens, professionals in various sectors, tourists, members of parliament, various government ministries and private sector), and linked \u201cclimate change education to education for sustainability\u201d, including traditional cultural practices. Elena Borsatti emphasized the critical importance of \u201cchanges in individual attitudes and behaviour\u201d in preserving the environment and mitigating climate change, and hence the need for \u201cknowledge and information\u201d in raising the public awareness to initiate such changes \u201cat the local, national, regional and global levels\u201d. She cited a number of good environmental practices to reduce waste and save energy, and highlighted various initiatives that \u201cincrease awareness on climate change and promote environmentally friendly behaviour\u201d, including \u201cindividuals who are undertaking exceptional personal feats, high- profile expeditions, and other acts of environmental activism\u201d to publicize environmental causes. Her conclusion was particularly perceptive: \u201cAlthough only a few individuals\u201d may become \u201cclimate heroes or heroines\u201d, \u201cevery individual has the potential to be an agent for change in his/her daily life.\u201d Kishan Khoday highlighted the \u201chigh levels of citizen awareness within Asian countries on climate change and other environmental issues\u201d and cited China where \u201cthere is an increasing spirit of environmental rights, a desire particularly among the youth to address ecological change as a matter of human security and well-being of future generations\u201d.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f389d806-0b97-4bc2-a47f-fffe31a44a3e": {"__data__": {"id_": "f389d806-0b97-4bc2-a47f-fffe31a44a3e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c5bf63f839a0c4d202d8ed71dc86ce958b742213bd765a6a77e259b206bad788"}, "2": {"node_id": "35269a9e-698d-460b-b659-704ae508d718", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9a85740a718735817a76fb124c500000c0e03c1111ba3f96ebf9540de0936d44"}}, "hash": "a2554b992c4c9c81b047a41dc7b99c16327b3a465103575e895d8dc9c3e2a744", "text": "The growing environmental awareness in China was best captured in the green 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.

The above contributions were a small but useful sample of a range of diverse issues that have been discussed in the international forums. Under the UNFCCC, the discussion on Article 5 (RESEARCH AND SYSTEMATIC OBSERVATION) and Article 6 (EDUCATION, TRAINING AND PUBLIC AWARENESS) will continue, especially the aspects relating to financing, technology transfer and capacity-building that are very much needed for the effective implementation of these two Articles. 8. Summary of Discussions of Sub-theme 7 There is a widespread perception among observers of global climate change negotiations that the processes have grown extremely complex from the time that the UNFCCC itself was negotiated in 1991. Indeed, experience in the implementation of legal obligations of all Parties under the Convention resulted in the recognition that there are wide- ranging implications of any action taken to address climate change and its adverse effects. Negotiations have therefore expanded to cover these implications, such as global trade and economic impacts of mitigation and adaptation actions, and their impacts on sustainable development and the well-being of present and future generations. Scientific findings have evolved as well as concrete manifestations of climate change impacts, providing the incentive for deeper public involvement and concern. Climate change has become the \u201cdefining challenge of our time\u201d and expectations from climate change negotiations have been heightened. The previous sub-themes have covered essential components of these negotiations and this might explain why contributions to the general theme of these negotiations are not as numerous as on the other sub-themes. The five contributions received from Marcia V.J. Kran; Maria Melinda Ando; Kishan Khoday and Usha Natarajan (joint contribution); Pak Sum Low; and Mukul Sanwal nevertheless correctly focused on the fundamental principles that underlie the negotiations and have made important inputs to these discussions. Kishan Khoday and Usha Natarajan underlined the principle of equity, the primary basic principle of these negotiations. They called for \u201cgreater coherence between issues of equity and sustainability in global policy formulation\u201d to address climate change and its adverse effects. Equitable sharing of environmental and developmental space indeed forms the basis of the negotiations on all the main elements of mitigation, adaptation, provision of financial resources, development and transfer of technology, and capacity-building. The UNFCCC, in its first principle, provides that \u201cthe Parties should protect the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations of humankind, on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities\u201d. This principle permeates each Article of the Convention, and forms the key to the balance of common but differentiated responsibilities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "de4a8b71-ddba-4736-a9b8-1e2394a4afcb": {"__data__": {"id_": "de4a8b71-ddba-4736-a9b8-1e2394a4afcb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1837db46184913e6aff87149fbb34263bb64530ab5476c84e8babde9984a4c61"}, "2": {"node_id": "0421152f-1570-4959-af53-ddbf42765161", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c671de3af1fb9a173b2872822aa5c6aaff90abecc7e176a2ab9b246f662fc7cb"}}, "hash": "6270618d76bd6136349ebc3d5338bbf3801a5cc441fe73b4c1187984539affcf", "text": "From this principle flows the commitment of developed country Parties, responsible for historical emissions that caused climate change, to \u201ctaking the lead in modifying longer-term trends in anthropogenic emissions\u201d (Article 4.2a), referring to production and consumption lifestyles.

This contribution recognized that \u201cboth the causes of climate change and options for responding to it\u201d are in the hands of people. Climate change CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 23 and its adverse effects exacerbate damaging impacts on vulnerable communities. Current negotiations, in particular on adaptation, but also on the economic and social consequences of response measures on mitigation, focus on these impacts on people and their well-being, indeed for some, on their very survival. High populations are not synonymous with high-energy consumption, as Maria Melinda Ando correctly observed in her contribution. Once again, equity should be observed, as the problem of climate change has its origins in historical emissions of greenhouse gases by countries with much lower populations than developing countries of today. More effective responses to climate change could be achieved by controlling consumption rather than by controlling birth rates, the contribution rightly stated. The conclusion encapsulated the crux of the negotiating positions of developing countries in these negotiations, that \u201cequitable and just climate change strategies should not displace responsibility for carbon emissions upon those least responsible for them\u201d. Pak Sum Low\u2019s contribution touched on one of the most sensitive issues under these negotiations, and that is the inconsistencies between the Copenhagen Accord and the UNFCCC, in particular as relates to the provisions on the preparation of national communications of non-Annex I Parties. The exclusive and non-transparent manner in which the Copenhagen Accord was concluded among a small group of countries caused the breakdown at the final plenary of the 15th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP15) of the UNFCCC in Copenhagen in December 2009. The great majority of developing countries were excluded from representation in the discussions leading to the Copenhagen Accord. This travesty of the multilateral intergovernmental process led to the rejection of the Accord that was then taken note of instead of being adopted by the COP. This means that the Accord has no legal standing in the current negotiations. However, developed country Parties of the Accord are pushing for its integration in the current process. While about half of the developing country Parties of the UNFCCC supported, endorsed or associated with the Accord, many of them did so subject to conditions stated formally in their letters of endorsement or association. These conditions are mainly related to the provision of the necessary financial resources and development and transfer of technology in order to allow developing countries to take nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs) that can then be reported through national communications. Pak Sum Low pointed out that the conditions put forward by the Copenhagen Accord are inconsistent with the provisions of the UNFCCC, and that these work to the detriment of the interests of developing countries. Once again, we are faced here with an issue of equity. Developing countries, starting with the big developing ones, but also extending to the second and third levels of developing economies, are being required to undertake NAMAs where they have no such obligations under the Convention. Moreover, any mitigation action to be undertaken voluntarily by developing countries should be accompanied by the necessary financing and transfer of technology in accordance with Convention provisions. In addition, financing obligations of developed countries under the Convention cover not only mitigation actions but also all the necessary conditions that would allow these actions to be formulated, published, and regularly updated, as well as implemented. Mukul Sanwal proposed a shift in the approach to negotiations that would render operational the element of equity as a concrete outcome for Canc\u00fan. Given the reality of the Copenhagen Accord, it must now be taken into account in the negotiations. As it stands, however, the pledges from those countries that have supported the Accord, as reflected in the appendices, remain totally inadequate to meet the objective of reaching a temperature increase \u201cbelow 2\u00b0C\u201d contained in the Accord, not to mention the intention of assessing the implementation of the Accord by 2015, \u201cincluding in relation to temperature rises of 1.5\u00b0C\u201d. There is in fact nothing in the Accord that links the expressed goal of \u201cbelow 2\u00b0C\u201d with the listing of either emission targets for Annex I countries or NAMAs of non-Annex I countries. In his contribution, Mukul Sanwal stated that in order to achieve equity in sharing the global carbon space, a global carbon budget must be agreed at international levels with allocation criteria based not only on the responsibility for historical emissions alone, but also with a closer base year of 1970, and take into account present and future emissions as well.

CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 24 Equitable sharing of the remaining atmospheric space must take into account the need for developing countries for economic and social development, as recognized in the Convention. The key to the balance of common but differentiated responsibilities of the Convention also recognizes that economic and social development and poverty eradication are the first and overriding priorities of developing countries (Article 4.7). Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions cannot be seen as damaging the environment alone, Mukul Sanwal pointed out, but also as an engine of growth. Developing countries should be allowed to have their rightful share of the remaining global budget in order to achieve sustainable development. In climate change negotiations, developing countries have referred to their emissions as \u201csurvival emissions\u201d as opposed to \u201cluxury emissions\u201d of developed countries that would like to maintain their lifestyles. Movement in the negotiations must come from both sides, and developing countries have the obligation to pursue economic and social development in a sustainable manner, at the same time the developed countries should adopt production and consumption lifestyles that would likewise be environmentally sustainable. Technology development and transfer is crucial to sustainable growth. The balance of obligations carries the key to a successful outcome in Canc\u00fan. In this manner, equitable sharing of the atmospheric space could be achieved, one that would fully serve the objective of the Convention. All five contributions to this sub-theme focused on the fundamental element of equity in negotiations. For this reason, developing countries, including those in the Asia-Pacific region, call for an equitable, comprehensive, concrete, and legally binding outcome of the climate change negotiations in Canc\u00fan. 9. Summary of Discussions of Sub-theme 8 The discussion of sub-theme 8 on Folklore, Traditional Knowledge, Idiomatic Expressions, Proverbs and Quotes attracted six contributions from Jayati Ghosh; Sukthawee Suwannachairop; Kishan Khoday and Usha Natarajan (joint contribution); Try Thuon; Tep Boonny and Kumi Careme (joint contribution); and Sumitra Sundram, respectively. Jayati Ghosh shared an old Italian folk tale with a clear \u201canalogy with climate change and the other ecological disasters created by the global pattern of economic growth\u201d. But this folk tale was only a departure point to highlight the need \u201cto shift from an obsession on growth (\u2026) to a more rational organization of society, economy and of the relation between humanity and nature\u201d. \u201cThe interests of people in the centre are not inevitably opposed to those of people in the periphery, since both are now adversely affected by the results of such ecological imbalances\u201d. Tep Boonny and Kumi Careme highlighted that \u201cchanges in the environment and ecosystems\u201d negatively affect the \u201calready fragile livelihoods\u201d of the Cambodian fishermen. Their contribution, in which a few proverbs from Cambodia were presented, focused on the natural capture fisheries and indicated that \u201cthe range of cultural traditions, together with the different topographic settings in which they have existed, has led to differences in the fishing equipments developed by the various communities/ethnic groups through their interactions\u201d. Kishan Khoday and Usha Natarajan highlighted the importance of traditional knowledge as it is \u201cvital to preservation of a plural and diverse world from both ecological and cultural perspectives\u201d. They focused on the Melanesian culture in South-East Asia and the Pacific, and as an example of \u201cthe infusion of environmental knowledge and climate change into local traditions\u201d, \u201cthe Dreamtime tradition of Australian Aborigines\u201d was considered. They also considered the belief in the Rainbow Snake which \u201csymbolizes the regenerative power in nature and serves as a main character in Dreamtime mythology\u201d. People\u2019s beliefs and practices were considered also in other contributions. Sukthawee Suwannachairop shared some of the beliefs of the Karen community (indigenous peoples living in Thailand and Myanmar) for which \u201chealthy life is a reflection of healthy ecosystems\u201d and therefore \u201cone must protect the environment\u201d.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cedde5e7-8979-4709-916f-0106d7a1ba83": {"__data__": {"id_": "cedde5e7-8979-4709-916f-0106d7a1ba83", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d233357f47c96d295dc5c070dce93dddb99c231993eea5a25f9b7b2f148f51b2"}, "2": {"node_id": "0d2fe133-ef15-4293-af03-1d54c79f8a50", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fa82bcd0835b4bd23e83c95ca5bb2e43d13a52251a748f2fe625ba6e33f3439d"}}, "hash": "3bdbc36baff9384117c14fe6b93f309446a01e61617785d9fe86430ba6591f75", "text": "The contributor concluded that as ecosystem-based approaches to climate change can \u201cincrease the resilience of natural systems and are based on existing practices and local knowledge\u201d, they could be mainstreamed \u201cinto climate change strategies of national frameworks\u201d.

Conclusions Climate change affects every aspect of human development. A total of nearly 100 contributions covering the inter- connected sub-themes -Vision of a Climate-Resilient Society; Mapping and Measuring; Adaptation (including technology and financing) and Climate-Related Disaster Risk Reduction; Human Security (including food and nutrition, and energy security) and Human Rights; Mitigation, Technology Transfer and Financing; Research, Education, Training and Public Awareness; Global Negotiations from Copenhagen to Mexico: Implications for Future Generations; Folklore, Traditional Knowledge, Idiomatic Expressions, Proverbs and Quotes - were submitted to the AP-HDNet e-discussion on Climate Change and Human Development during the period of 4 February to 30 July 2010. Based on the lively and vigorous discussions, the following conclusions could be drawn: 1. A climate-resilient society will be a society that has the ability, capacity and the necessary resources \u201c to withstand or recover quickly from difficult conditions\u201d caused by the adverse effects of climate change over short or longer term and to adapt to these adverse effects. These include the reduction of vulnerability of a society to climate-related hazards (natural or human-induced), which is a function of duration of exposure, as well as environmental (including natural ecosystems that provide the environmental services), social, economic, technological and political (including policy) factors. Thus, the strengthening of coping or adaptive capacity, including technological and policy measures, such as nature-based responses, ecosystem-based adaptation, sustainable development (including human development), poverty reduction, research and development, livelihood diversification, reduction of carbon footprint and low-carbon or low- GHG emission development, disaster risk reduction, equitable global system, among others, is crucial to ensuring a climate-resilient society or a society with reduced risk to the adverse effects of climate change\u201d. 2. It is important to map and measure climate change and its adverse effects on human development, including the interrelationships between climate change and ecosystems, as well as other environmental, ecological, social and economic changes and their interrelations that affect human development and vice versa. Thus, physical, ecological and socio-economic data and hybrid socio-physical measures (e.g., Environmental Performance Index; Environmental Vulnerability Index; Green GDP; Human Development Index; social and environmental vulnerability indices; Global Climate Risk Index). The uncertainties and the limitations of the current global and regional climate models must be recognized. Adaptation to climate change and climate-related disaster risk reduction are essential for building a climate- 3. resilient society. It is important to understand the nature of the linkages among the concepts of climate resilience, climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk reduction (DRR), and how they are related to sustainable development, including a real shift in development paradigms, as well as implementing programmes on DRR that advance CCA, especially making use of traditional and local knowledge and technologies and the involvement of indigenous communities, as demonstrated in many concrete experiences in various countries. It is important to recognize that adaptation measures are very much country and location-specific. It is also important to recognize that adaptation and mitigation are mutually supportive, and the \u201cglue\u201d that holds them together is sustainable development. However, innovative financing and technologies are urgently needed for short-term and longer term adaptation measures in developing countries particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change.

It is interesting to note that many developing and least developed countries are facing difficulties in acquiring the necessary technology for the implementation of mitigation actions because of lack of markets, as demonstrated in the case of the difficulty in acquiring biogas technology in Cambodia. This is an example of market failure. Research (in both physical and social sciences), education (from primary to tertiary), training (in all aspects 6. relating to climate change, including climate change negotiations) and public awareness (including outreach activities that may be undertaken in conjunction with other environmental activities) are important elements for the effective implementation of the UNFCCC, as provided by Articles 5 (RESEARCH AND SYSTEMATIC OBSERVATION) and 6 (EDUCATION, TRAINING AND PUBLIC AWARENESS) of the Convention. Climate change has become the \u201cdefining challenge of our time\u201d, and the global climate change negotiation 7. processes under the UNFCCC have grown extremely complex, with wide-ranging implications of any action taken to address climate change and its adverse effects. There are inconsistencies between the non-legally binding Copenhagen Accord and the provisions of the UNFCCC. The provision of the necessary financial resources and development and transfer of technology in order to enable developing countries to take nationally appropriate mitigation actions are the key issues under negotiation. Developing countries, including those in the Asia-Pacific region, call for an equitable, comprehensive, concrete, and legally binding outcome of the climate change negotiations at COP 16 in Canc\u00fan. The balance of obligations carries the key to a successful outcome in Canc\u00fan. Any failure to achieve a successful outcome will have profound implications for the well- being of present and future generations. 11.

CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 28 1. Opening Message Dear Network Members, Climate change is strongly affecting both natural ecosystems and our society, which are interlinked. Given the profound impact of climate change on every facet of our society, especially the poor and the disadvantaged groups who are most vulnerable because they have the least resources to cope with, or adapt to, the adverse effects of climate change, I think it is appropriate to start our discussion with the vision of a climate-resilient society, the topic chosen for sub-theme 1. \u201cClimate resilient\u201d is a term widely used in the literature and by the media, but not everyone seems to have the same understanding of its meaning and implications. The Oxford English dictionary defines \u201cresilient\u201d as follows: \u201cadjective: (1) able to recoil or spring back into shape after bending, stretching, or being compressed. (2) (of a person) able to withstand or recover quickly from difficult conditions.\u201d Thus, part 1 of this definition refers to the physical system, while part 2 refers to the human system. Based on part 2 of the definition, a \u201cclimate-resilient\u201d society could mean a society that is \u201cable to withstand or recover quickly from difficult conditions\u201d caused by the adverse effects of climate change, including climate- related hazards and disasters. However, the ability \u201cto withstand or recover quickly from difficult conditions\u201d caused by the adverse effects of climate change over short or longer term depends on many factors, especially on the vulnerability of a society to the various impacts of climate change. The vulnerability of a society to climate-related hazards (natural or human- induced) is a function of duration of exposure, as well as environmental (including natural ecosystems that provide the environmental services), social, economic, technological and political (including policy) factors.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3ed86edd-99cb-4dfb-87fa-b54eee89082c": {"__data__": {"id_": "3ed86edd-99cb-4dfb-87fa-b54eee89082c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b33076fab02552fafe9b63238b031c592d01ffb41723fb7deb68afa914a0605a"}, "2": {"node_id": "8a66dfaa-0736-4369-bb06-e1194922f702", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "62bd7b610e91d94bf86627c98be91c55a4ea1f7dd777a871ad6ec8c6589ee741"}}, "hash": "83e6d8acc9543e59c21a00434fc21c9508af7a30bb81abbdb9c2541321b341e8", "text": "For example, a country with an intact natural ecosystem is likely to be more resilient to climate risks.

She puts \u201cclimate-resilient\u201d within the context of the Convention, and emphasizes the importance of adaptation for responses to the adverse effects of climate change. She points out that adaptation \u201cis also the obligation for which financing and technology should be provided to developing countries\u201d, and that \u201cpolicy-making is solely under the competence of States\u201d, and \u201cit should not be imposed as a conditionality for enabling means to be provided to developing countries to meet their sustainable development objectives\u201d. Dear Network Members, \u201cClimate resilience\u201d in the light of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) The only reference in the UNFCCC, the only science-based, universally-agreed, legally-binding agreement dealing with climate change, to resilience is in Article 1.1, on \u201cdefinitions\u201d. It refers to the understanding of \u201cadverse effects of climate change\u201d to mean \u201cchanges in the physical environment or biota resulting from climate change which have significant deleterious effects on the composition, resilience or productivity of natural and managed ecosytems\u2026\u201d. A focus of human development on climate resilience alone would limit this development to responses to adverse effects that affect the physical environment. The adverse effects of climate change however are wide-ranging, covering all aspects of human development and not only the physical environment. For this reason, the UNFCCC, when providing for responses to the adverse effects of climate change, focuses instead on adaptation. Any mention of policies and measures dealing with these adverse effects are on adaptation. It is important to clarify this understanding because all Asian countries are Parties to the Convention, and the activities of UN funds and programmes operating in the region must be consistent with the international commitments of these countries when addressing climate change. Adaptation is also the obligation for which financing and technology transfer should be provided to developing countries. The advantage of this approach is that there are already existing mechanisms which allow developing countries under the Convention to identify their needs and determine their vulnerabilities, essential to any development of programmes or national plans dealing with climate change. Among these are the preparations of national communications, the first obligation of all Parties to the Convention, which would provide the bases for developing programmes containing measures to address climate change. A thorough identification of sources and sinks of emissions as well as vulnerabilities is essential for any action to be taken on climate change. Much work has already been accomplished under the Convention, including the development of national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs) for least developed countries. Building upon this work wold greatly facilitate any capacity-building activities to be financed by UNDP, including strengthening of human and institutional capacities, to promote the capacity of a country to respond to the challenge of climate change. The Convention of course recognizes that poverty eradication and sustainable development are the first and overriding priorities of developing countries, and the balance of differentiated responsibilities under the Convention, particularly in reference to financing and transfer of technology commitments of developed countries, and it is therefore clear that any action to be undertaken would take these into account. Finally, it is important to recognize that policy-making is solely under the competence of States, and cannot be taken over by other external entities. In particular, it should not be imposed as a conditionality for enabling means to be provided to developing countries to meet their sustainable development objectives.

He provides a few good examples to illustrate his points. Dear Network Members, Climate change: An opportunity to build a resilient society The impact of climate change in Asia-Pacific region-which is already home to bulk of the world\u2019s poor, facing severe demographic pressure, environmental degradation, and social vulnerabilities-is likely to be severe and threatens to neutralize whatever attainments the region has made in MDGs. Conversely, failure to make progress on MDGs can further aggravate the consequences of climate change. Within this region, less developed countries, small island states and the poor are more vulnerable due to their dependence on climate-sensitive resources for sustenance and lack of capacities, technologies and resources to neutralize adverse impacts of climate change. Women and girls face disproportionate burden. Social tensions over sharing of depleting and degrading natural resources can trigger more destabilizing conflicts. Climate change has thus brought to the fore, and added a sense of urgency to, the question of building more resilient, sustainable and equitable societies. In that sense, it is an opportunity. A climate-resilient society is essentially one in which the communities are able to reduce their vulnerabilities to protect their lives and livelihoods against climate variations and extreme weather events. This is not a society different from the one that follows sustainable environmental resource management practices. Communities have for ever adapted themselves to climatic variations and environmental degradation using local knowledge and resources. Farmers in the dry and rain-fed areas in India have learnt to diversify their livelihoods and not rely on a single crop. Flood-affected communities in Bangladesh grow vegetables on top of their houses so that they have something to feed on in case their crops are lost. Societies that have not adapted themselves over time are also the ones that face higher risks of being adversely impacted by climate change. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 32 Building climate-resilient societies involves reducing underlying vulnerabilities as distinct from responding to impacts of climate change. Thus, what is required is anticipatory action and not reactive one. This is also at the core of promoting sustainable and equitable development. Even though current level of research and information on adaptation does not adequately guide development policy makers on how to adapt and how to mainstream adaptation in development agenda, the societies and communities must not wait for better knowledge and start adapting. In climate change, there may not be certainties but enough is known about the risks and vulnerabilities which are at the heart of building resilience to climate change. Based on scientific evidence and traditional knowledge on how communities have adapted historically, different scenarios should be worked out and likely impact assessments prepared with associated capacity and financial needs analyses. Risk management and risk reduction strategies need to be integrated in development planning. Imprecision of climate change science should not be used as an excuse for inaction. Climate change offers an opportunity to build sustainable and equitable society which is also a climate-resilient society. Poverty reduction efforts must be reinforced through rights to land, water, energy and forests for the poor. The village of Ralegaon Siddhi in Maharashtra (India) was transformed from a drought-prone village and a degraded ecosystem to a prosperous one in partnership with people who carried out programmes of environmental conservation. As a result, they now have access to water year round, reliable energy from renewable sources and have come out of extreme poverty. Sukhomajiri (in northern state of Haryana in India) is another example of people\u2019s participation in natural resource management through community-based micro-watershed development to build climate resilience. These examples show how community action can have salutary effect on underlying vulnerabilities of the poor and their resilience to climate change. In fact, ability to adapt is directly linked to the levels of development. Climate change severely limits people\u2019s choices but simultaneous poverty reduction efforts can expand these choices. Local governance must be strengthened to find local solutions to make people more resilient to climate change. In sum, we should continue to promote environmentally sustainable and egalitarian development to build climate-resilient societies using climate change as an opportunity and an entry point.

Peter Neil wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note (Pak Sum Low): Peter Neil highlights the importance of nature-based responses to climate change as an integral part for building a climate-resilient society. In particular, he discusses the benefits and co-benefits of ecosystem-based adaptation that uses ecosystem services as part of an overall adaptation strategy. Ecosystem-based adaptation, which can be integrated into community-based adaptation, is a cost-effective way to protect vulnerable communities from the adverse effects of climate change. Healthy and well-managed ecosystems also have great potential for climate change mitigation. So it is a win-win solution for both adaptation and mitigation. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 33 Dear Network Members, Vision of a climate-resilient society While many of us in the conservation arena are interested in biodiversity, it is useful to remind ourselves that for most people the biggest climate change adaptation issues are not about biodiversity conservation directly but are food security, coping with extreme weather and natural disasters, and dealing with the potentially massive re-locations of people and land-uses in the face of sea level changes and shifting ecosystems and species ranges. However, IUCN believes that nature-based responses to climate change are an integral part in tackling this increasingly problematic issue and can help to build a climate-resilient society, and thus warrant investment. For several years, the world has been investing in technology and engineering to fight climate change. Technology is vitally important, but we must be careful not to put all of our eggs in a \u2018techno-fix\u2019 basket. Some technologies will work; others will not; and others will be economically unviable. Some may even be unsafe or risky. What is Ecosystem-based Adaptation (*)? Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) is the use of biodiversity and ecosystem services (**) as part of an overall adaptation strategy to help people to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change. As one of the possible elements of an overall adaptation strategy, ecosystem-based adaptation uses the sustainable management, conservation, and restoration of ecosystems to provide services that enable people to adapt to the impacts of climate change. It aims to maintain and increase the resilience and reduce the vulnerability of ecosystems and people in the face of the adverse effects of climate change. EbA can generate significant social, economic, cultural and human well-being co-benefits; contribute to the conservation of biodiversity; and build on the traditional knowledge and practices of indigenous peoples and local communities; including the important role of women as custodians of local knowledge. In addition, healthy, well managed ecosystems have climate change mitigation potential, for example, through the sequestration and storage of carbon in healthy forests, wetlands, and coastal ecosystems. Ecosystem-based Adaptation activities should be part of a broader portfolio of adaptation measures Ecosystem-based adaptation can be applied at different geographical scales (local, regional, national) and within various time frames (short to long term). It can be implemented as projects and as part of overall adaptation programmes. It is most effective when implemented as part of a broad portfolio of adaptation and development interventions, such as early warning systems, education, and physical infrastructure. EbA promotes policy coherence In promoting the sustainable use of nature and biodiversity, ecosystem-based adaptation strategies provide policy coherence with other national and international commitments. For maximum effectiveness, these strategies should be aligned with ongoing action under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Convention on Biological Diversity, the UN Convention to Combat Desertification, the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and other relevant international commitments.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "878f9afd-05de-4339-ac8c-50651b13a044": {"__data__": {"id_": "878f9afd-05de-4339-ac8c-50651b13a044", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5853ac65213b162f1bea772e7835335a6e7d15ca0e02ba2b65286db1a63f5965"}, "2": {"node_id": "18fd5ca4-22e1-4409-b573-5a35dc8376d4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "79dfe56d28d76f49a765cd47a93b7c5d15261a5165f3dc490c127cbd385f5aac"}}, "hash": "29658cd870202bfac003efc15b5f327331a7a0f40a9da32236236b7a828c0404", "text": "Ecosystem-based Adaptation is a cost-effective way to protect communities from climate change and extreme weather events Healthy ecosystems, such as intact forests and wetlands, are beneficial to local populations for the many livelihood benefits that they provide: firewood, clean water, fibres, medicines, shelter and food.

Dear Network Members, A vision for the planet in 2020 In drawing up a vision for the planet in 2020, the question that should be asked is how our complex social and economic systems should interact with a complex planetary system undergoing rapid change to create a sustainable future for all citizens? As a result of globalization, the economic crisis and its global response the centre of political gravity has shifted towards a wider and balanced structure and this trend will continue as larger numbers of developing countries breakout of poverty and their citizens will demand an increasing share of the scarce atmospheric resource. The defining characteristic of the world in 2020 will be patterns of resource use that are common for all countries. The global goal should, therefore, be identified as improvement in human well-being in line with sustainable development, with a new model of growth whereby consumers consider their needs rather than their wants, so controlling material consumption. We need to question the current paradigm that encourages people to define their well-being through their consumption patterns. For Asia, the trade offs in the kinds of deep structural changes that will be necessary will be very different to a focus only on carbon management. While the global consensus around climate change will be the driver for these changes, the response should be shaped by a strategic perspective of the future, and not just by the Copenhagen Accord, for transformation of the economy and human activity to achieve sustainable development.

For example, in India, with 10 per cent of emissions from the transport and residential sectors, energy use per capita is one-fifth of developed country levels and 300 million people waiting to move into towns (Climate Modelling Forum, India 2009), the problem must be framed in terms of urban development and transportation. The strategic policy issue for decoupling energy use from economic growth will not just be developing energy efficiency standards and de-carbonizing energy-as developed countries are doing-but rather a modal shift in transport patterns to railways and modifying the nature of the urbanization process itself, in particular new land-use patterns that minimize personal transportation and maximize natural resource use. Moving beyond energy efficiency to conservation of energy is a necessity, because actions taken now will largely determine options for many decades to come. New ways of thinking must impact not only energy services but also ecological services affected by the growing scale of human activity. For example, payments for allocation of the limited capacity to absorb waste (carbon dioxide, chemicals); as an integral part of the incomes of the poor (forests); recognition of the economic and social gains from new products (biodiversity); and, augmentation of water supply and agricultural productivity (watershed management). Innovative market based trading mechanisms need to be developed to augment these ecosystem services on the lines of the proposed carbon, energy efficiency and renewable energy units, to support both cost-effectiveness and patterns of resource use. The societal response to resource scarcity is already very different in Asia compared with the West, as innovation here is driven by need and not by greed. The interaction between poverty, societal forces and technology has already led to new products and services. For example, Indian firms have established themselves as cutting-edge innovators targeting the poor-some 500 million consumers (*). That trend surfaced with the Nano (the small car costing approximately US$2,000, introduced by Tata Motors in July 2008, whose design and innovation is considered a trendsetter by the global auto industry), and has resulted in a number of products for people with little money who aspire for a better life. The products are not just cheaper versions of well established models available in developed countries, but have taken design and manufacturing to a whole new level in the way they use resources. Modifying longer term trends in patterns of resource use for achieving the transition to global sustainability requires a policy frameworks tailored to social value creation to chart new pathways in transportation and urbanization; new instruments to impact on modifying consumption patterns; and, innovative policies for augmenting services provided by critical natural resources-energy, water, forests. The required shifts will come from infrastructure decisions, new institutions, changing values, behaviour and innovative technology.

Dear Network Members, Vision of climate-resilient society: Can it ever be achieved in isolation? If we were to start the discussion by removing the word \u201cclimate\u201d from the title, and just label the subject, \u201cVision of a Resilient Society\u201d, what would that mean in the broader context of the human condition and response? According to the Oxford English definition, \u201cresilience\u201d implies the ability of any society \u201cto withstand or recover quickly from difficult conditions.\u201d The \u201cdifficult conditions\u201d at the level of a society or community do not entirely relate to the impact of climate change, but could encompass both catastrophic or sudden events (e.g., a natural disaster, or an armed uprising, or outbreaks of infectious disease such as SARS and H1N1 flu) as well as events that will gradually affect the livelihoods of society, which could be as wide-ranging as globalization, urbanization, revolutions in technology, population ageing, terrorism and climate change itself. This implies that the climate-change driven impacts on society (both catastrophic and gradual) cannot be easily disentangled from other elements of change and pressures, occurring simultaneously in varying degrees, whether discernable or not. Any response in policy and its implementation and prioritization, in terms of use of scarce resource, is hence complex when we talk of a climate-resilient society. For instance direct adaptation to climate change is difficult to separate from other livelihood adaptations. Given the intricate linkages of climate change to other development challenges, policies for building resilience to climate change have therefore to be better formulated. After all, climate change is a relative slow and subtle event (*) whose impact varies across communities in different parts of the world, under multiple time horizons and levels of human development. We therefore need to understand better the whole concept of building resilience or what allows families, communities and countries to manage risk and crises, and the critical role of institutional linkages, including effective governance. One may even say that such a formulation can only be partial as there is no clear exit strategy for the problem of climate-driven impacts. Hence we are not talking about an issue or a development challenge that has a beginning and an end with well-defined sets of solutions that fit all or at least most conditions. Building climate resilience in isolation of other development challenges is like to be futile. Moving to the societal level, what kind of environment will allow individuals and households to build their resilience and adaptive capacity? Society or human society is the manner or condition in which the members of a community CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 37 live together for their mutual benefit in a region or country or the world at large. Another way is to consider a society as an economic and social infrastructure, made up of a varied collection of individuals. Societies will remain fragile if there are disparities across individuals in terms of access to assets and technology, the level of human development and opportunities to participate. It is clear that an open society, with transparent and accountable government and the corporate sector, where citizens trust their government and leaders of business community, are some of the constituent elements of resilient societies. Likewise a more equitable global system of sharing the burden of climate change adaptation including transfer of appropriate technology and finance would create conditions for building resilience. Taken at one extreme, a climate-resilient society, whichever way one looks at it, has to ensure that each individual is empowered with the capacity, resources and knowhow as well through responsible institutions to respond, at least at the livelihood level, to climate change for mutual societal benefit and stability. But in reality the additional impact of climate change and variability affect mostly the people who are at the edge of coping with poverty and hence most vulnerable and least able to adapt. The recent food, fuel and economic crises have further eroded the resilience of the poor, especially women. Without food and water security or basic access to service delivery in health and education, water and sanitation, a person cannot have the capacity to respond or prioritize climate adaptation initiatives until basic needs are met. Climate change adaptation is an integral part of development issues involving poverty eradication, food-fuel-water security, human rights, governance, gender empowerment and equality and human development. The Millennium Development Goals and other internationally agreed goals, albeit not fully comprehensive, represent at least an international consensus on the way forward. A climate-resilient society cannot be created without the addressing of these development challenges.
