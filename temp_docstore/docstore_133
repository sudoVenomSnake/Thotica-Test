IMPROVE ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LOGGING REGULATIONS Rationale: Legal and illegal logging have both direct and indirect impacts on sun bear populations, through habitat degradation and loss, and increased accessibility leading to increased poaching and disturbance, etc. Logging regulations exist but are often not fully enforced. A review of existing regulations would identify the agencies responsible for enforcement and point to the strengths and weaknesses in the current system, which would indicate opportunities for improvement. (Action 4.1) A better understanding of the factors driving illegal timber trade, including who is violating logging regulations and why, may aid in efforts to change the behaviour of illegal loggers and traders, and help identify areas for targeted law enforcement. Ultimately this will help protect bear habitat. (Action 4.2) Logging regulations exist, which would benefit sun bears (by protecting their habitat) if implemented, but the regulations are not enforced. Identifying areas where illegal logging is having the greatest negative impact on sun bear status will allow for the targeted allocation of resources and interventions.

IMPLEMENT EFFORTS TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE HUMAN-CAUSED FIRES THAT DEGRADE SUN BEAR HABITAT Rationale: Fires degrade sun bear habitat by destroying trees, eliminating food sources (fruit trees, insects), and reducing cover and shelter sites. Some fires are started by people, so fires can potentially be reduced if the motivations and actors responsible are identified and addressed. Determining the locations, causes and timing of fire threats to sun bear habitat will identify areas most at risk and help to determine potential mitigating measures. (Action 5.1). Illegal burning degrades sun bear habitat, and will increase if not prosecuted. It is therefore important to identify gaps in enforcement and capacity needs within enforcement agencies, to increase successful prosecution rates of violators and reduce the incidence of illegal human-caused fire in sun bear habitat. (Action 5.2) Unlike logging and forest conversion to plantations there is little recognition of the negative effects of fires among the wider public. Greater recognition of this source of habitat deterioration is necessary to spur actions to reduce it.

MAKE PLANTATIONS MORE BEAR-FRIENDLY HABITAT Rationale: Plantations are rapidly expanding across the range of the sun bear. Bears sometimes enter plantations from adjacent forest to eat oil palm and other plantation crops. But they also suf- fer heightened risk of mortality from snaring or hunting in plantations. Improving plantation management may help sustain nearby bear populations. In many places, sun bears have been relegated to small forest patches near plantations. In these conditions, sun bears are known to make feeding forays from the forest to adjacent plantations, which provide rich, concentrated sources of food (e.g., palm oil fruit). In so doing, these bears are subjected to mortality risks. It is not known whether habitat manipulations in and around plantations could provide more security for sun bears seeking food in plantations and at the same time (1) not entice more hunting, (2) not increase agricultural losses (from sun bears and other species), and (3) not adversely affect other wildlife species. Small-scale pilot projects will help to improve understanding of the costs and benefits of plantation regimes. Most present plantations are expansive, with ready access to people (including hunters) and little cover for bears. If a more bear-friendly design can be developed (including habitat manipulations and hunt-free zones), it could be promoted through a certification programme, so buyers could select products that have had less detrimental impacts on bears, and thereby put pressure on the industry to use more bear-friendly techniques.

IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT CONSTITUTES HIGH QUALITY SUN BEAR HABITAT, AND HOW VARIOUS HABITAT COMPONENTS AFFECT SUN BEAR POPULATIONS Rationale: Sun bears rely on forests, but factors influencing the quality of forests for sun bears are not well understood (e.g., forest age and density, forest type, understory, patch size and shape, disturbance, human access). It is also not clearly understood how various configurations of forest and agriculture, or forest and plantation, affect sun bear occurrence, density, survival and reproduction. Answering these questions will help to conserve bears by (1) revealing the extent to which different types of land use change can be expected to impact bear popula- tions, and (2) informing land use plans or agricultural development plans to protect and improve habitat for sun bears.

Improved knowledge of where sun bears exist (Action 9.1) would enhance the targeting of conservation actions and allow for measuring effectiveness of those actions. A set of criteria with which to objectively assess sites would facilitate their prioritisation and the allocation of resources. (Action 9.2). In order to make recommendations for protect- ing more forests for sun bears, we need to know where sun bears are present, what areas are currently protected and determine how much of the sun bear\u2019s distribution falls within designated protected areas. (Action 9.1 and 9.3) Sun bears occur in habitats used by other species of high conservation priority (e.g. tigers, elephants, orangutans) in some portions of their range. Sun bear conservation may benefit from the resources allocated to areas with other high priority species (e.g., anti-poaching), thereby freeing resources for other places important for sun bears but ignored by other conservation projects. (Action 9.4) Sun bears exist in different habitats, of different quality, with different threats, and different levels of protection. Some areas warrant or need more attention than others in terms of restoring this species. Highest priority sites need to be identified, and targets established for conserving them.

Presently we do not know where such potential corridors are already being used by sun bears. There may be degraded habitats, or narrow swaths of forest that are used by sun bears, and could be protected so as to prevent them from being destroyed. (Action 10.2) The efficacy and feasibility of corridors connecting core sun bear populations varies across the range in relation to the habitat, land use, human density in the corridor, size and distance between core areas, threats to the core areas, and political will to protect and possibly enhance the corridor. Prioritising the need for corridors based on threats, presence of roads, human settlements, plantations, sun bear population size, likelihood of success, etc., will inform the allocation of resources. (Action 10.3) Before generalising to a large-scale, there is a need to test corridors on a small-scale, to make sure all attributes are considered. This will involve establishing test sites with appropriate monitoring. Implementation of small-scale corridor development projects will provide the evidence on which to base recommendations for large-scale projects to increase the con- nectivity and this demographic resilience of sun bear populations.

DEVISE AND EMPLOY METHODS TO RELIABLY MONITOR TRENDS IN SUN BEAR POPULATIONS OBJECTIVE 11. DEVELOP PROTOCOLS FOR MONITORING TECHNIQUES THAT RELIABLY DETECT POPULATION CHANGES FOR SUN BEARS Rationale: Population trend estimates of sun bears tend to be based on the opinions of professionals, who may consider forest loss and poaching. Some monitoring also involves interviews with local people. Monitoring methods using quantifiable data, such as sign surveys and camera trapping, are becoming more common, but are not coordinated or conducted in a compa- rable manner across the range. More rigorous assessments of population change are needed to (1) target areas most in need of conservation interventions, and (2) assess and identify which interventions are most effective and efficient, thereby enabling management strategies to be adapted to benefit sun bear conservation. (Action 11.1, 11.2) Southeast Asia is a global biodiversity hotspot with several species of conservation interest throughout the sun bear\u2019s range. Studies that utilise camera traps to monitor other species, or terrestrial biodiversity in general, may also detect sun bears as by-catch. Such by-catch data may be useful for monitoring sun bear population trends, thereby reducing the need for sun bear-specific surveys.

IDENTIFY KEY AREAS WHERE SUN BEAR POPULATION MONITORING AND TRAINING ARE NEEDED Rationale: Sun bears are distributed throughout much of Southeast Asia but it is not feasible to monitor population trends throughout their entire range. Identification of key areas where it is most important/useful to monitor sun bear population trends will be more efficient and will inform the allocation of conservation resources. (Action 12.1) Conducting monitoring surveys throughout the sun bear\u2019s range, at a scale and frequency necessary to evaluate and adapt management strategies, will require in-country capacity. Assessment of the capacity of relevant government agencies, university departments, and NGO\u2019s within each range state will identify potential collaborators and training needs for the implementation of a long-term monitoring programme.

IN RANGE COUNTRIES, ENSURE LEGISLATION PERTAINING TO KEEPING SUN BEARS IS CLEAR, UNAMBIGUOUS AND SUPPORTS EFFECTIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT Rationale: Sun bears are a protected species throughout their range and regulations exist regarding the conditions and circumstances under which sun bears can be kept in captivity. Despite this, large numbers of sun bears continue to be taken illegally from the wild and kept as pets (particularly cubs), status symbols, tourist attractions and occasionally for use in bile farms. This represents an ongoing threat to the conservation of the species. Weak or poorly enforced legislation pertaining to keeping bears in captivity creates opportunities for laundering of wild-caught bears, may contribute to the black market trade, and impedes wildlife law enforcement.

They are held in facilities throughout their range, as well as in non-range states across Europe, North America, and Australasia. These bears are a valuable resource for research and are the focus of a growing number of research projects.

INCREASE EFFICIENCIES WITHIN EX SITU PROGRAMMES Rationale: Existing regionally-managed breeding programmes for sun bears are not sustainable in isolation and are not fulfilling their conservation potential. Clearly defining regional roles and priorities, and improving coordination and cooperation between key programmes (e.g. AZA, EAZA, SEAZA, ZAA and JAZA), will be essential for the long-term success of the ex situ population in meeting conservation goals. (Actions 17.1, 17.2) Within range states there are no standardised welfare programmes and little communication and collaboration between facilities housing sun bears, which may result in inefficiencies and lost resources, for example when establishing new rescue centres. (Action 17.3) Ex situ sun bears are accessible sources of education and communication. Awareness of sun bears and their conservation is low. Increased awareness may lead to increased financial and political support of conservation of sun bears.

RAISE AWARENESS OF SUN BEAR CONSERVATION NEEDS AND THE ROLES THAT CAN BE PLAYED BY INDIVIDUALS, SOCIETY, AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR Rationale: Lack of information communicated to the media about actions undertaken by sun bear conservationists is leading to a lack of awareness about sun bear conservation among the general public which may be contributing to negative conservation values, attitudes, and behaviours. (Action 18.1) Industry is affecting sun bear populations, often negatively, so it\u2019s necessary to understand the motivations driving the behaviours that negatively affect sun bears. Lack of knowledge and information about sun bear conservation may be contributing to social, cultural and personal acceptability of using bears, their parts and products, which in turn contributes to continued poaching and trade of sun bears. (Action 18.2) The continued widespread and sometimes open hunting, trade and use of sun bears is, in part, enabled by societal apathy and lack of political will. Personal and social changes are required to ensure that the cruel, unsustainable and illegal behaviours of others towards sun bears are no longer acceptable nor tolerated.

Increased commitment for a long-term strategy to maintain sun bears as a flagship species for Southeast Asian wildlife/wildlife trade/tropical forest lost/unique ecological/fundraising values. 18.2 Engage with industry, e.g. transport sector, Traditional Medicine community, logging and plantation companies, to increase the effectiveness of sun bear conservation efforts. 1 year (then indefinitely) All managers of sun bear conservation- focused organisations. Increase in policy statements, mitigation measure and concessions related to sun bears. Baseline data from Vietnam about TM practitioner beliefs and behaviours.

fisheries are vital for achieving food security, alleviating poverty, and increasing economic growth around the world. In coastal countries, seafood accounts for up to 70% of protein intake and is an essential source of vitamins, fats, and minerals.1 At the global level, more than 40 million people are employed as fishers, with an estimated 90% operating at the small-scale.2,3 Wild-caught fisheries production reached 90.9 million tons in 2016, and approximately 30% of the world\u2019s marine fisheries are over-fished.4,5 Understanding that the fisheries sector offers a vital pathway for development, numerous development agencies and partners, including USAID, work to promote sustainable wild- caught fisheries and conserve marine biodiversity around the world. Women play a substantial role in the sector, making up nearly half of the overall fisheries sector workforce.6 Present throughout the value chain, women are found in harvesting, processing, marketing, trading, and leadership roles. However, persistent gender inequalities prevent women from fully participating in economic opportunities and decision making, ultimately restricting the potential of the sector.7 Additionally, a limited understanding of women\u2019s unique roles and contributions can result in a lack of recognition of their needs and interests in policies and programs, therefore affecting sustainable development outcomes.8 1 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).

FISHERIES MANAGEMENT IS STRENGTHENED BY ADDRESSING GENDER ISSUES A growing body of evidence suggests that addressing gender issues and integrating women\u2019s empowerment interventions into conservation result in improved governance and ecological results.9,10 The effectiveness of programmatic approaches is improved when women\u2019s roles and perspectives in the sector are better understood. For example, engaging women as stewards for key fishery resources has improved the enforcement of regulations of nearshore ecosystems.11,12 Additionally, increasing women\u2019s access to improved processing technologies has reduced product loss and increased product value, allowing fishing families to realize the same income while catching fewer fish.13,14 9 Agarwal, B.

The FAO estimates that women comprise 15% of the workforce involved in harvesting and fill 90% of the jobs in fish processing, which includes activities such as canning and gutting.15 Since women represent a significant part of the fisheries workforce, the sector represents a high-impact opportunity for women\u2019s economic and social empowerment. Evidence shows that interventions to improve women\u2019s entrepreneurial and negotiating skills have strengthened women\u2019s livelihoods through increased income and agency, as well as better social and health outcomes.16,17,18 15 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).

DATA FROM E. MATTHEWS, ET AL GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE (GBV) IS A SPECIFIC CONCERN IN THE FISHERIES SECTOR Though fisheries are an important entry point and opportunity towards advancing gender equality and increasing effective sustainable fisheries management, the sector is still challenged by pervasive inequalities, including GBV. Fisheries programming tends to not include considerations towards the elimination and prevention of GBV, constituting a lost opportunity and potential risk as programming can unintentionally exacerbate vulnerabilities. Worldwide, 35% of women have experienced some type of GBV in their lifetime.19 In the fisheries sector, structural inequalities and harmful social norms put women and girls in vulnerable situations, where they may be affected by and exposed to violence and abuse. GBV negatively affects the long-term health, well-being, and productive capacity of survivors, creating consequences that extend beyond the survivor to her family and community.20 Some fishing communities are also hotspots for HIV/AIDS, with HIV infection rates 4 to 14 times higher than national averages.21 19 World Health Organization, Department of Reproductive Health and Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, South African Medical Research Council (2013).

GENDER IN FISHERIES\u2014A SEA OF OPPORTUNITIES | 12 USAID.GOV KEY DEFINITIONS Gender is the economic, political, and cultural attributes and opportunities associated with being male or female. The social definitions of what it means to be male or female vary among cultures and change over time. Gender refers to the array of socially constructed roles and relationships, personality traits, attitudes, behaviors, values, and relative power and influence that society ascribes to the two sexes on a differential basis (USAID Gender Terminology). Gender analysis is a systematic approach, usually using social science methodologies, for examining problems, situations, projects, programs, and policies to identify the gender issues and impacts (USAID Gender Equality and Female Empowerment Policy). Gender equality concerns women and men, and it involves working with men and boys, women and girls to bring about changes in attitudes, behaviors, roles, and responsibilities at home, in the workplace, and in the community. Genuine equality means more than parity in numbers or laws on the books; it means expanding freedoms and improving overall quality of life so that equality is achieved without sacrificing gains for males or females (USAID Gender Equality and Female Empowerment Policy). Gender equity refers to the fairness of treatment for women and men, according to their respective needs. This may include equal treatment or treatment that is different but which is considered equivalent in terms of rights, benefits, obligations, and opportunities (United Nations). Sex is the classification of people as male or female. At birth, infants are assigned a sex based on a combination of bodily characteristics including: chromosomes, hormones, internal reproductive organs and genitalia. Gender is the socially defined set of roles, rights, responsibilities, entitlements, and obligations of females and males in societies. The social definitions of what it means to be female or male vary among cultures and change over time (USAID Gender Equality and Female Empowerment Policy). Female empowerment is achieved when women and girls acquire the power to act freely, exercise their rights, and fulfill their potential as full and equal members of society. While empowerment often comes from within\u2014 and individuals empower themselves\u2014cultures, societies, and institutions create conditions that facilitate or undermine the possibilities for empowerment (USAID Gender Equality and Female Empowerment Policy). In order for women\u2019s empowerment outcomes to be achieved, several domains of empowerment must be addressed, including increased income, voice, and agency, among others.27 Women\u2019s empowerment interventions should be coupled with male engagement strategies that sensitize men to better understand the benefits of gender equality in order to avoid unintended negative social consequences.28 Gender integration involves identifying and then addressing, gender inequalities during strategy and project design, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation (USAID Gender Equality and Female Empowerment Policy). 27 United States Agency for International Development (USAID).

Understanding the whole sector\u2014broadly defined\u2014 with a gender lens is a critical part of any robust strategy to strengthen fisheries management and achieve sustainability outcomes. Collecting, analyzing, and using gender data to inform policies, projects, and interventions goes beyond collecting only sex-disaggregated participation data. It requires a full accounting of gender considerations and sex-disaggregated data through the sector, from direct fishery activities, to division of household labor and discriminatory laws. Without the full context of the range of stakeholders across the sector, fisheries management strategies can fall short of achieving their goals. For example, the true economic impact of fisheries activities cannot be fully understood if the roles women play in all parts of the sector are not counted.

GENDER IN FISHERIES\u2014A SEA OF OPPORTUNITIES | 15 USAID.GOV WOMEN IN HARVESTING Harvesting is the process of catching or collecting fish, mollusks, crustaceans, and other species for consumption, trade, or sale. Women\u2019s and men\u2019s roles in harvesting activities are embedded in their social, cultural, and economic contexts. Traditionally, women are more involved in nearshore harvesting methods, such as collecting and gathering\u2014activities known as \u201cgleaning.\u201d30,31 Gleaning can be performed close to home and often requires low-cost equipment, enabling women to participate. At times, women\u2019s gleaning activities take place in nearshore ecosystems, such as mangroves, that are important habitats for the fin-fish caught by men. Women\u2019s harvesting and conservation activities can therefore affect the stock of fish available for men to catch. Evidence suggests that where women are effective stewards of mangrove resources, they assist in increasing the stock of fin-fish available for men to catch.32 Similarly, efforts to conserve mangroves as part of fisheries management efforts can improve women\u2019s livelihoods.33 In some cultures, it is considered taboo for women to go out onto boats or to participate in fin-fish harvesting, resulting in men dominating these activities.34,35 Though women are not as prevalent in the overall harvesting sector, they do support harvesting activities in many ways. In many parts of the world, women are responsible for boat maintenance and selling and mending fishing gear, such as nets.36,37 In some examples, women finance men in purchasing or repairing their fishing gear in exchange for fish products to sell for profit.38 In Koko, Nigeria, where most fishers are migrants, women earn additional income by providing lodging and meals for the transient fishers.39 30 GenderAquaFish.org.

Women make up the majority of the world\u2019s industrial- and small-scale processors, holding up to 90% of these jobs.40 This makes many women\u2019s livelihoods directly reliant on a sustainable supply of quality fish. Depleted fisheries could downsize or close industrial processing plants, thereby negatively impacting women through lost wages and jobs. In small-scale fisheries, exhausted fisheries constitute the loss of entire livelihoods as women not only process goods, but also market and sell them. 40 Food and Agriculture", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f9570438-853e-4bd3-bebe-ba47af37cf63": {"__data__": {"id_": "f9570438-853e-4bd3-bebe-ba47af37cf63", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/advancing-gender-environment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing gender in the environment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/advancing-gender-environment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b4caca050d920355b3b224812fd39faa7c980ff2cba0337484566a6c2a4fb853"}, "3": {"node_id": "b086fb4d-20ef-40a3-9a2e-611b674d8409", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/advancing-gender-environment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7c0a0da795db2c4e46e7615bacea8f2f2621a7a21c8acff4abbd60d7bec95ffc"}}, "hash": "eb2b596b5fa3c2409fb05861adce2104234422bee04c4e39b23c4bd84a71569f", "text": "Organization of the United Nations (FAO).

In industrial fish processing, women perform various tasks such as shucking scallops and shrimp, filleting and skinning fish, and packing and canning seafood products. Globally, commercial tuna canneries\u2014one of the world\u2019s most popular and commercially valuable fish\u2014tend to mainly employ women for canning and other processing activities.42,43 Similarly, women dominate positions in plants processing. In the South African fishing industry, women make up 62% of the workforce in fish processing plants and at least one third of this workforce is employed on a seasonal basis.44 Though women are an essential part of industrial fish processing, they have differentiated experiences and opportunities than men. For instance, gender stereotypes and norms can limit women\u2019s opportunities to develop new skills and advance professionally, confining women to low- technology, short term, and lowest-paying jobs (e.g. weighing, grading, packing, and trimming), while men tend to hold secure, skilled, and higher paying jobs such as filleting, skinning, and deboning.45 In many cases, as in Latin America, even if men and women receive equal payment for the same tasks, women rarely occupy higher-paid occupations.46 Women also face numerous risks and threats for their safety and job security. From Asia, to Africa, to Latin America, studies reveal that women employed in this part of the fisheries sector are subject to unsafe and exploitative labor conditions.47,48 Workplace hazards include mechanical accidents, excessive noise levels, and exposure to chemicals and infections. For example, women involved in prawn and shrimp peeling spend long hours with their hands in ice water, without gloves or projection, which can lead to skin infections.49 Furthermore, with increased mechanization, those employed in the lowest paying, least skilled jobs are often the first to lose their positions in the fisheries sector.50 For example, the introduction of a shrimp grader can reduce women\u2019s labor input by 55%.51,52 Sustainable fisheries are therefore not only critical for marine conservation, but to also protect and promote stable and dignified employment for women. 42 The World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF). \u201cWild-caught Seafood: Tuna: Overview.\u201d At: https://www.worldwildlife.org/ industries/tuna 43 Demmke, P.

Through such trade and enterprise, women control a multitude of supply chains for both home consumption and for the commercial sale of fish products. In addition to these enterprises, examples exist in which women subsidize men\u2019s fishing activities to enhance their contribution to household income and food.55,56 In some situations, such as in Cape Coast, Ghana, and on Lake Victoria, Uganda, women are able to use their income from fish sales to invest in boats and gear to sell or rent to men for their harvesting activities.57,58,59 These areas of work are critical for development programming as small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are essential towards increasing prosperity and reducing poverty. The UN estimates that SMEs account for an average of 60-70% of total employment and 50% of gross domestic product (GDP). As such, SMEs are a key pathway towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth).60 In 2019, the Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment Act (WEEE) amended the 1961 Foreign Assistance Act\u2014which focused on support for microenterprises\u2014to include small and medium-sized enterprises as well.

As women tend to dominate nearshore harvesting gleaning, the types of fish and products sold by women and men differ. For example, in the Solomon Islands women trade mollusks, crustaceans, and low-value fish while men sell larger reef fish.62 Women\u2019s entrepreneurial involvement in the fishery sector is in small- to medium-scale enterprises, often because in many parts of the world, self-employment is the sole choice women have for their livelihoods.63 In other cases, such as in Mexico, the women who own and manage small-scale businesses have often inherited them, and rely on a supportive family structure for their businesses to thrive.64 62 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).

For example, on the Surma River in Bangladesh, women\u2019s wages are only half of their male counterparts\u2019 despite playing the same roles in sun- drying processes.67 In areas of Kenya, where matriarchal systems prevail, women have rights to a share of what their husbands catch as the men use boats and equipment their wives inherit through marriage customs.68 When women are limited in their ability to access resources, such as fish, finance, and technology, it can affect the scale, efficiency, and safety of their operations.69 On Lake Victoria, women will sun- dry fish instead of smoking it\u2014as men do\u2014due to their lack of access to credit to afford fuel for smoking.70 In some areas, occupational health hazards, such as the risk of parasitic infections, stings from fish spines, and ergonomic injuries result in significant income loss for women.71 67 Marine, S., et. al.

To-date, when fisheries programming includes women, they tend to be included only as beneficiaries. As women constitute half the sector, their skills and knowledge should also represent half the ideas and solutions. Though under-representation exists at all levels of the sector, women are increasingly creating their own associations and organizations to advocate for their rights and access to productive resources, showing that investment in women\u2019s leadership promotes their agency towards achieving a more prosperous and sustainable fisheries sector. CORPORATE AND GOVERNMENT LEADERSHIP Compared to their participation in the fisheries sector at-large, women are severely underrepresented across government and corporate leadership positions. A 2018 report found that women received only 20% of 820 speaking opportunities at 20 seafood-related conferences.72 In 2018, the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s Environment and Gender Information (EGI) research found that of the world\u2019s national fisheries ministries, only 9 of the top positions (15%) were held by women.73 This is a lost opportunity as studies show that there is a strong correlation between more women in governance with ratifying environmental decisions, showing that women can be effective environmental stewards.74 The data is just as stark in the corporate world.

Minister Susi Pudjiastuti is committed to advancing the sovereignty, prosperity, and sustainability of the Indonesian marine and fisheries sectors by protecting Indonesia\u2019s economic and environmental interests by strengthening enforcement against billion-dollar pirate fishing operations and foreign fleets.81 However, the ministry could improve the monitoring and tracking of existing fleets which aim to shift to legal, reported, and regulated fisheries.82 Additionally, she instated a six-month moratorium on issuing new fishing licenses so that the Ministry can adequately monitor and track the operations of existing fleets.83 In 2017, Minister Susi Pudjiastuti received the Peter Benchley Ocean Award, one of the world\u2019s most prestigious maritime awards, in the leadership category.84 80 The Nature Conservancy (TNC).

While there is an opportunity for women to be a part of these organizations, women are often underrepresented\u2014both as members and as leaders\u2014due to social norms and a lack of recognition of women\u2019s roles in the industry. For example, in Cambodia\u2019s Kep Province, women\u2019s candidacy for elected leadership positions is not welcome, as patriarchal beliefs dictate that women are inferior to men for leading roles and in decision making.85 In fishing communities in Malaita province, Solomon Islands, 72% of women interviewed for a study reported they were never involved in resource management decisions, even though inheritance of land and marine tenure operates through both patrilineal and matrilineal descent.86 However, unlike appointed high-level corporate and government positions, at the community level, women increasingly create spaces for themselves. As community fishing organizations are diverse and dynamic\u2014varying in formality, membership, and goals\u2014women fishers are increasingly founding their own organizations and associations to sustainably advocate for their rights, share knowledge with one another, and design savings and credit facilities. For example: \u2022 In 2010, the Women\u2019s Network for the Defence of Fisherfolk Rights was formed in Thailand to protect women\u2019s rights to access, use, and management of natural resources.87 \u2022 The Pakistan FisherFolk Forum (PFFF)\u2014a large network of 70,000 fishers working together to create a gender friendly and democratic environment that advocates for fishing rights, fish marketing, fish conservation, the rehabilitation of the Indus Delta, and community-based disaster risk management\u2014has high participation rates of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e487431d-0ba6-47a7-8b12-52630e93af98": {"__data__": {"id_": "e487431d-0ba6-47a7-8b12-52630e93af98", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/advancing-gender-environment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing gender in the environment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/advancing-gender-environment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "78ab35311833fa0ac3d7bcf113fcd35448c3babf39bc5d94ed85dff3c445c2b8"}, "3": {"node_id": "b805b2d2-3e29-41c6-8ec1-1e4cbb407faa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/advancing-gender-environment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a23f337edf4bc7040d3749d47d7f1d0938eaea93f456d37892e27f8764b8c8c6"}}, "hash": "3ae33b7ee42371338176a7dd6abebe806b64d2b8d4c4c3fab3cf2d3703e245f1", "text": "women (approximately 50%) because the Forum\u2019s leadership recognizes the importance of women\u2019s roles and livelihoods within the community and therefore designs activities available and beneficial to them.88 \u2022 Brazil\u2019s Articula\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional das Mulheres Pescadoras, established in 2006, addresses worker and land rights.89 85 Sornkliang, J., et al.

Sustainable harvests rely on effective management arrangements, which are most successful when negotiated, recognized, and enforced by an inclusive range of stakeholders.90 In addition to improving ecological outcomes, engaging women in fisheries is a meaningful opportunity to reduce gender inequalities and support women\u2019s economic empowerment. Integrated programming can strengthen key conservation and gender outcomes when women are engaged as constituents and leaders for sustainable fisheries management; when women are empowered as effective stewards of fisheries and associated ecosystems; and when women are engaged to become drivers towards sustainable fisheries markets. Each of these keys areas of consideration demonstrate that women\u2019s engagement strengthens fisheries management and results in stronger gender outcomes. 90 Gutierrez, N. L., R. Hilborn, & O.

Ignoring women\u2019s unique roles and needs is a missed opportunity that can result in poor project outcomes. In 2005, the fisheries administration of the Congo worked with a fishing community in the Makotipoko district to establish new measures to protect resources along the Congo River.93 In developing these measures, the roles and impact of women\u2019s harvesting and processing activities were not analyzed, nor were women present in any of the community discussions. As a result, the fishing practices used by women were banned and the women received no information on the new and promoted practices. This led to detrimental conservation impacts for the fish and invertebrate resources that women predominantly harvest. In response to these failed measures, the community established a gender action plan (see page 44) that assessed all community members\u2019 fishing activities and gave women access to trainings on the new practices. \u2022 Evidence reveals that mixed-sex natural resource management groups are more effective than men-only groups in strengthening resource governance and conservation.94 The TRY Oyster Women\u2019s Association holds exclusive rights to cockle and oyster fisheries within a national park in the Gambia.95 For more than ten years, the association has worked in partnership", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "24562790-6553-47d7-bfe2-f803140b57dc": {"__data__": {"id_": "24562790-6553-47d7-bfe2-f803140b57dc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/advancing-gender-environment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing gender in the environment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/advancing-gender-environment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2e83ea5943eea832e7c0d8de19e7de3c650430b37be9b73c2ca70b7625a92507"}, "3": {"node_id": "3d09b458-9041-466c-8671-77b82097c29f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/advancing-gender-environment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4f946b0e7996232edd28a18a5ab2cbeb2adcb9ea49ffbade6a52920c690048e1"}}, "hash": "47e6cd88471298c03c863cb95565e03737bb93686eaeace6ec3d81369927a4b1", "text": "with the national government and local authorities\u2014who were predominantly men\u2014to successfully develop a co-management plan for the national park, which included establishing size limits for catch and enforcing an optimal harvesting season.

In the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, Pescado Azul, a women\u2019s cooperative, was created by local women to improve their employment opportunities and to provide for local food security.97 The cooperative connects women to new markets for sustainably sourced tuna by selling it to tourists\u2014the Islands\u2019 main industry. Its business model is to add value to its tuna catch by selling smoked products, rather than increase the scale of tuna fishing activities. To smoke the tuna, cooperative members burn wood from a destructive and invasive species of tree, therefore protecting the unique biodiversity endemic to the Gal\u00e1pagos. \u2022 Advocacy opportunities can increase legal recognition of the roles women play in fisheries sectors. In the Philippines, women fish workers have organized at the community level, successfully advocating for fisher women\u2019s rights to be included in the Philippine Fisheries Code of Conduct and the Magna Carta for Women.98 National policies on gender in fisheries are important because they can serve as a framework to guide effective fisheries governance, or hold countries accountable for their commitments. At the corporate level, research by the World Economic Forum suggests that increasing women\u2019s representation in corporate leadership roles is shown to correlate with future increased hiring rates of women leaders.99 WOMEN AS STEWARDS OF FISHERIES AND ASSOCIATED ECOSYSTEMS To achieve sustainability in fisheries, USAID recommends implementing an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management. This approach recognizes the importance of focusing on the ecosystems and broader socio-ecological systems that support fisheries, rather than a single target species.100 Within this framework, women can serve as stewards for key fishery resources and related ecosystems through restoration efforts and direct management of the resources they harvest themselves.

Throughout the tropics, mangroves are an essential habitat for a variety of fish species harvested by both women and men. In many areas, mangrove forests have been degraded and over-exploited for building materials, firewood, or construction of aquaculture ponds. Across Asia, IUCN and the United Nations Development Programme lead Mangroves for the Future, a restoration and sustainable development project with gender integration as a core strategy.106 In northern Vietnam, Mangroves for the Future works with impoverished women fishers who depend on harvests of shells, mollusks, and crabs, which are often collected illegally within Xuan Thuy National Park.107 Through trainings and awareness raising, these women have become actively involved in the management and monitoring of these resources. Although the women continue to gather these species, they now do so in a more sustainable manner.

USAID.GOV 6 | ADVANCING GENDER IN THE ENVIRONMENT WOMEN AND MARKETS AS DRIVERS FOR SUSTAINABILITY IN FISHERIES The FAO estimates that 30% of fisheries are overexploited; this unsustainable management results in more than US$ 80 billion of forgone losses annually.111,112 Meanwhile, 60% are fully exploited; therefore, economic growth in wild fisheries will come not from catching more fish, but from reducing post-harvest loss of fish and increasing product quality and value through improved processing techniques.113 Women dominate these parts of the fisheries value chain, so their roles and perspectives will influence the underlying economics that drive either the sustainability or overexploitation of fishery resources. WOMEN\u2019S ENGAGEMENT STRENGTHENS FISHERIES MANAGEMENT \u2022 Women can influence fishery value chains and create incentives for legal and sustainable harvesting practices through their purchasing and monitoring practices.

In another area of the Philippines, women working at landing and docking areas serve as informants of illegal fishing practices.115 \u2022 Including women in fisheries monitoring and data collection efforts improves information and transparency for management decisions. As women are often the first buyers of fish, they are uniquely positioned to improve data and information on catch documentation and traceability. In Bitung, Indonesia, USAID is seeking to pilot a financial technology solution towards women\u2019s economic empowerment alongside the documentation and traceability app currently in use by small-scale buyers and brokers. This activity operates on the assumption that increased access to financial tools will result in better fisheries data, improved livelihoods for women fisherfolk, and ultimately better fisheries management through economically empowered and engaged women in the fishing sector. WOMEN\u2019S ENGAGEMENT IN FISHERIES STRENGTHENS GENDER OUTCOMES \u2022 Access to market information and financial tools can improve profits and support for conservation. In several projects around the world, increased access to technology, markets, and pricing information for women working in fisheries led to increases in fair market prices. For example, information and communications technology (ICT) can provide access to fish market and pricing information, which enables women to set competitive and profitable prices. On Lake Victoria, increased access to ICT better equipped women to negotiate prices, and within six months, the price of omena increased 20% in their village, benefitting both women and men.116 Furthermore, when women fish traders, processors, and transporters have increased access to ICT paired with training that improves the hygiene and quality of dried omena, they are able to reduce post-harvest losses by taking advantage of improved pricing systems and prices, reduction in marketing costs and transportation, and a better awareness of market trends that pay higher prices for better quality product.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b6131fe1-eb55-44cd-8d1a-23ec4a322ec9": {"__data__": {"id_": "b6131fe1-eb55-44cd-8d1a-23ec4a322ec9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/advancing-gender-environment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing gender in the environment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/advancing-gender-environment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8f005520b46f4ac030627bcc601ed07690aad4ebac07e1152afd783945a2ddaa"}, "2": {"node_id": "184df66e-dc31-458a-965a-cda0a05bf992", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/advancing-gender-environment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "58e75e2a3bd052b373f0e22ffc588b3e6d4c55ee08e0c923dc7277d8688df109"}}, "hash": "217e36fcab2c158e318ffee3616a5668071ec35a8630c9ba3cf23ea1abd4510a", "text": "\u2022 When women organize to participate in fishery-related businesses, it can improve self esteem and confidence.117 In Barbados, interviews with women fishers participating in a processing association revealed the women\u2019s personal feelings about their livelihoods and functionality of the group.

Limited opportunities for income diversification, decline of fish stocks, food insecurity, poverty, and migration for work are factors that increase the vulnerability of women, girls, and boys\u2014as well as men\u2014to violence and abuse.122,123 The victims of GBV face physical harm, including rape, physical trauma such as fistula, increased exposure to HIV/ AIDS, and death. Additionally, survivors can experience severe psychological and social impacts, such as mental trauma, depression, self-isolation from public life, and fear.124 In sustainable fisheries programs in Pakistan, practitioners have found that when women and girls in coastal communities are victims of GBV, it can reduce their self-esteem, potentially affecting their ability to advocate for their needs or participate in activities.125 GBV also impacts the ability of survivors to achieve their full potential and contribute to the economy: studies in Tanzania show that women experiencing GBV in the form of intimate partner violence earned 29% less than those who did not, and this increased to 43% less when the violence was severe.126 These impacts extend beyond the individual survivor, negatively affecting children, workplaces, communities, and national GDP.127,128 In the fisheries sector, GBV persists due to social and structural inequalities that create vulnerable conditions, which include: a lack of access to fisheries resources; shifting social and power dynamics regarding fisheries roles; and increased risks of HIV/AIDS in fishing communities. 122 Ratner, B., Asgard, B., & Allison, E.

For example, an initiative in a coastal district of Vietnam works with fishermen to stop violence against their wives through the establishment of the Responsible Men Club. Through the Club, fishermen receive knowledge, skills, mentoring, and peer support which enables them to develop coping mechanisms regarding the isolating and stressful nature of fishing work as well as positive ideas about masculinity and their role in their communities.134 Importantly, microfinance projects that target women without understanding local gender dynamics can inadvertently increase GBV as increased resources to women does not mean they have the ability to exert control over them or make decisions. In fact, providing such resources to women can contribute to GBV by changing household and gender dynamics. International studies also show that women breadwinners are more at risk of intimate partner violence than where men are the 129 Bene, C., & Merten, S.

After the war, male ex-combatants returned home and cited such changes as contributing to household tension.136 International resources point to the value of gender analyses to help identify and understand gender dynamics to help inform sensitized approaches that avoid unintended consequences.137 More information on gender analyses can be found on page 42. FISHERY COMMUNITIES CAN BE HIV/AIDS HOTSPOTS Globally, HIV rates in fishing communities are 4 to 14 times higher than national averages, making them HIV/AIDS hotspots.138 For example, Kenya has a national HIV prevalence of 5%, yet the rate can be as high as 34% in fishing communities.139 Fishermen may engage in risky sexual behavior during long fishing voyages, increasing the prevalence of HIV or other sexually transmitted infections. However, the rate of HIV/AIDS in fishing communities is often higher among women than men, in part due to women\u2019s diminished bargaining power, lack of income, food insecurity, and other considerations that can lead to risky practices such as \u2018sex-for-fish.\u2019140 In Zambia, a study found that women fish traders are likely to be at risk for substance abuse and mental health symptoms such as anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and HIV sexual risk behaviors, with the results suggesting a relationship between trauma and HIV sexual risk behaviors.141 135 Abramsky, T., et al.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c0766f8c-e295-4f85-91ce-9783bcb71e56": {"__data__": {"id_": "c0766f8c-e295-4f85-91ce-9783bcb71e56", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/advancing-gender-environment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing gender in the environment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/advancing-gender-environment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9c0038eac9c954e46b3e4e5ac1c4540077a7a426228e3be8165529885de72e68"}, "3": {"node_id": "70a75c94-bf64-4582-97a6-306d98bc6352", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/advancing-gender-environment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d0d5363b986b7a6ab7958c77c4c6b9b348a2377f462c68e7748d49258cf12e42"}}, "hash": "3b7ce45a29fde581e26f72f033538bb70375b2f28fbacd394b6dfa901db2efa4", "text": "(2011). \u201cWhat factors are associated with recent intimate partner violence?

In developing a national gender strategy for fisheries, USAID and partner organizations carried out a gender analysis in fishing communities around four major lakes. The study revealed that women are often enticed into \u2018sex-for- fish\u2019 to secure fish and access to resources. To reduce instances of \u2018sex-for-fish\u2019 and to mitigate the risk of HIV infections, the study recommends ensuring that both women and men have opportunities in village savings and loan associations, training in efficient processing techniques, and to increase HIV/AIDS counseling and propaganda campaigns. In 2015, FISH recommended that the National Fisheries and Aquaculture Policy should recognize that women and men play different yet complementary roles in the fishery sector and called for HIV/AIDS and gender issues to be mainstreamed throughout the sector.142 These changes were made to the National Policy in 2016.143 Read more about USAID\u2019s FISH program in Malawi here.

As women can be leaders and advocates for sustainable fisheries management; successful stewards of fisheries and associated ecosystems; and effective as market drivers for sustainability in fisheries, it is necessary for practitioners to understand how gender issues and socio-economic dynamics impact all parts of the fisheries sector. Successful programming must therefore utilize gender tools to mine as many productive and effective integrated results and impacts as possible. Analysis and planning tools such as conducting a gender analysis, creating a gender action plan, and developing results chains can help practitioners develop effective integrated programs that can help maximize gender equality outcomes and sustainable results. Importantly, they can also help avoid unintended outcomes. When designing and implementing programs to strengthen sustainable fisheries management and gender equality, it is equally important to anticipate and monitor for unintended consequences. Conservation interventions that do not adequately account for women\u2019s resource use and needs can unintentionally exacerbate gender inequality. Similarly, interventions to support women\u2019s economic empowerment by expanding their fisheries-related business can drive overfishing if these efforts are not well considered and thoughtfully embedded in a broader fisheries management programs. For example, in the Okavango Delta in northwestern Botswana, women basket fishers use their unique ecological knowledge of fish migration and flood variability to make informed decisions on where and when to harvest.144 However, this ecological knowledge did not inform zoning and closed- season regulations. As a result, these policies, which intended to improve sustainable outcomes, were instead perpetuating gender disparities between women\u2019s and men\u2019s access to resources and asset accumulation\u2014whereas including their unique knowledge could have done the reverse.

As the world\u2019s largest environmental fund, the Global Environment Facility updated its Gender Policy in 2017, producing a Guidance to Advance Gender Equality requiring gender analyses for all project proposals to ensure projects do more than recognize the vulnerability of women or pay lip service to the potential of women to enact change.145,146 In accordance with the Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment Act (WEEE), a gender analysis is mandatory for all USAID projects and is required at the strategy, project, and activity levels in order to design interventions using the most context- specific and relevant gender information as possible.147,148 145 The Global Environment Facility (The GEF).

The dynamics uncovered by gender analyses are complex and highly context-specific, especially as levels of gender equality can vary greatly from region to region. A gender analysis is a socio-economic analysis of available and/or gathered quantitative and qualitative information to identify, understand, and explain gaps between women and men and typically involves examining the differences in the status of women, men, boys, and girls, in relation to: \u2022 The laws, policies, regulations, and institutional practices that influence the context in which women and men act and make decisions; \u2022 The social norms and beliefs about what are appropriate qualities, life goals, and aspirations for women and men; \u2022 Gender roles, responsibilities, and time use; \u2022 Access to and control over assets and resources; and \u2022 Patterns of power and decision making that reveal the ability of women and men to decide, influence, and exercise control over their lives. Importantly, gender analyses include conclusions and recommendations towards enabling development policies and programs to narrow gender gaps to improve the lives of women and girls.149 In", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c1cc84e-8f8a-4666-964e-ee368d5384a9": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c1cc84e-8f8a-4666-964e-ee368d5384a9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/advancing-gender-environment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing gender in the environment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/advancing-gender-environment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3fba8ea05dbaeadf6e56dedb3ea9827d7e7c3816af9d0eaf87ff4f9ad85d43a7"}, "3": {"node_id": "52a3d98c-b0a1-45ad-a301-2669ce5e24af", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/advancing-gender-environment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "807a29d7267daf81cf3016ccfabcb068db297c00a6ed24c1c842ff59ffbb4319"}}, "hash": "b042d87b07ab6519a5943d698d3ef363444ed97a0790eda97e9480a5d23644ac", "text": "the context of fisheries management, it is critical for program and project designers the ways in which women are not only considered as beneficiaries of empowerment programming, but as agents of change that can grow in agency and prosperity while contributing to sustainable fisheries outcomes as effective environmental stewards. While there are different frameworks and approaches to conducting a gender analysis, USAID\u2019s guidance can be found in ADS Chapter 205: Integrating Gender Equality and Female Empowerment in USAID\u2019s Program Cycle. 149 Ibid. Gender analyses of seafood value chains can identify actions to ensure economic autonomy for women and men by providing information on the differentiated positions of power and agency. In the Philippines, USAID supported a gender-responsive value chain analysis (GRVCA), focusing on fishing activities in the area of General Santos City, to understand women\u2019s unique roles and contributions in the sector. The guidelines for the GRVCA were developed following the six domains identified in Integrating Gender Equality and Female Empowerment in USAID\u2019s Program Cycle. The analysis identifies ways for strengthened involvement of women to promote sustainable fisheries management. For instance, findings show that women buyers are perceived to be shrewder than men when it comes to fish trading and includes the recommendation to identify, recruit, and train local gender champions to participate in program work on sustainable fisheries management and seafood traceability.

This plan is a set of strategic interventions that address and reduce the obstacles, impacts, and risks identified in the gender analysis, as well as strengthen program design and implementation. These strategic interventions aim to meet gender equality objectives, are implemented through a set of activities, and are tracked by gender indicators, which should be embedded in program planning and contribute to overall program goals. The Global Environment Facility\u2019s Gender Policy requires gender action plans.150 At IUCN, national environmental gender action plans note the importance of earmarking budgets towards implementation.151 RESULTS CHAINS Results chains are a type of logic model that displays the relationships between what a program intends to do and the changes or results the program hopes to accomplish to achieve its purpose. The process of developing a results chain helps program teams discuss goals, refine assumptions, and assess strategic approaches. Results chains are thus effective tools for visualizing cause-and-effect relationships that could otherwise remain invisible and they are useful for guiding program decisions about monitoring and adaptive management. 150 The Global Environment Facility (The GEF).

The goal of the USAID-supported Sustainable Fisheries Management Project is to rebuild marine fisheries stocks through responsible fishing practices, improved co- management, and strengthened information systems. A gender analysis, gender action plan, and needs assessment of the program identified specific gender objectives, including increasing women as entrepreneurs in improved fish processing, increasing women\u2019s involvement as co-managers of fisheries resources, and increasing their access to finance.

An illustrative results chain is presented below, showing one way strategic approaches for women\u2019s empowerment, sustainable fisheries management, and improved access to finance might improve development outcomes. I. BIODIVERSITY FOCAL INTEREST (IMPACT) is the desired state of the biodiversity focal interest that a program seeks to achieve. In the illustrative example (Fig. 2), small pelagic fisheries are the biodiversity focal interest. II. HUMAN WELL-BEING FOCAL INTEREST (IMPACT) is the desired human well-being or development outcome that the program seeks to achieve. In the illustrative example, improved food security is the human well-being focal interest. III. THREAT REDUCTION RESULT(S) are the desired reduction in a specific threat that a program seeks to achieve. In the illustrative example, the program aims to reduce fishing effort. IV. RESULTS are the preliminary or interim results needed to achieve a threat reduction result and ultimately the biodiversity focal interest impact. In the illustrative example, desired results proposed include increasing women\u2019s capacities, increasing women\u2019s engagement in ecosystem approaches to fisheries management (EAFM), and increasing support for a \u201cclosed season,\u201d during which fishing is suspended. V. A STRATEGIC APPROACH is the set of actions with a common focus that work together to achieve a series of results in the chain. The three strategic approaches for this example include supporting women\u2019s empowerment, facilitating access to appropriate financial tools, and promoting sustainable fisheries management. VI. SELECTED ACTIONS are the specific interventions or sets of tasks undertaken in order to reach one or more results. An action must be linked to a result. In the illustrative example, \u201cconduct organizational capacity assessments\u201d is an action intended to support the associated results.

The handbook focuses on the specific responsibilities of States and all other stakeholders to implement policies and plans that help promote gender equality, while also supporting the sector\u2019s growth and sustainability. It is primarily intended for use by policy-makers and public institutions in their design and implementation of fisheries-related policies and programmes, and by fishing communities and their organizations. The handbook is organized into three parts: 1. PART 1 briefly explains the concepts of gender and gender mainstreaming, followed by a description of women\u2019s work and roles in the small-scale fisheries sector. 2. PART 2 provides guidance related to the thematic areas of Part 2 of the SSF Guidelines: Responsible fisheries and sustainable development. 3.

STRENGTHENING WOMEN\u2019S VOICES THROUGH ORGANIZATIONS IN FISHERIES Women\u2019s organizations have the potential to benefit women in fisheries by enabling them to work collectively to promote access to resources, finance, technology, and equipment. Organizing can also amplify women\u2019s voices in advocating for sustainable fisheries management and improving working conditions. These types of associations are also often effective in improving women\u2019s business and negotiating skills and increasing their confidence. For example, in Tunisia, women clam collectors earned very little due to their weak bargaining power within a larger system characterized by exploitative intermediaries who applied unfair transport and service fees.153 FAO conducted a gender analysis and identified critical gender entry points, leading to a gender action plan. Several standalone gender activities were implemented, including the creation of an autonomous women\u2019s association to strengthen their bargaining power and advocate for their economic and political rights. The clam collectors mobilized to negotiate for better prices at the market and lower transport costs. The results were clear\u2014women\u2019s incomes increased by 22%. 153 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). (2017).

The Voluntary Guidelines provides a framework that States can use when developing their own strategies, policies, legislation, programs, and activities while informing civil society, private sector actors, and others to use as reference points on what constitutes internationally acceptable tenure practices. In particular, the Voluntary Guidelines stress the need for: \u2022 Equal tenure rights for women and men; \u2022 Taking the differentiated obstacles women and girls face in relation to tenure and associated tenure rights; \u2022 Participatory processes that include women and men from the outset of decision-making processes; \u2022 Safeguards to protect women and other vulnerable people; \u2022 Equitable access for women to customary tenure systems; and \u2022 Guaranteeing equal access of women and men to land, fisheries, and forests in redistributive reforms. You can read the Voluntary Guidelines here. IMPROVING FINANCIAL TOOLS TO INCREASE WOMEN\u2019S ECONOMIC WELL-BEING AND AGENCY As women comprise a significant proportion of poor fishing households, specific financial tools to meet women\u2019s diverse and differentiated needs in the fisheries sector are necessary for a more sustainable value chain. However, these interventions need to be integrated into broader sustainable fisheries management strategies in order to account for and prevent risks of driving overfishing. In the Philippines, the FAO implemented a project in two provinces, targeting women fishers\u2019 economic needs, by establishing a revolving-fund scheme administered by two banks.159 Women who received credit to support their fishery-related enterprises reported increased incomes, which they used to purchase household appliances, pay their children\u2019s school fees, and reinvest in their businesses.

Regional Initiative for the Assessment of Climate Change Impacts on Water Resources and Socio-Economic Vulnerability in the Arab Region xi Executive Summary Countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region have been dealing with the challenges of an arid climate for a long time. Over the last decades, however, pressures on water and energy systems have risen significantly as has the pressure to increase agricultural productivity and food supply. These developments have largely been driven by overall macroeconomic trends, such as population growth, urbanization, socio-economic development and environmental degradation; combined, all these factors are making the countries of the region more vulnerable to climate change. As a result, the region is facing new challenges that require a higher level of coordination between the three key sectors of socio- economic development -energy, water and food (WEF)- to ensure sustainable development. The Nexus Approach is part of the response to these challenges. Yet, how to implement the Nexus WEF Approach through pertinent policies and adapted national and pan-Arab regional development programmes and what governance structure or changes are needed for this purpose are the core questions that the current research is designed to address (The Energy- Water-Food Nexus in the League of Arab States - Franziska Otte, 2015). This study is aimed at the assessment of current policies, regulatory and legal frameworks on renewable energy & energy efficiency, water management, the food security nexus and sustainable development in the countries of Jordan, Lebanon and Tunisia. While it assesses the aforementioned issues, this study closely considers climate change and the issue of gender. Also, the gaps, the needed solutions and recommendations for improvement were all embedded within the context of the report and summarized in the last part to include a policy framework for regulating the Nexus WEF at municipal and national levels, mapping regulations and evaluating governance to propose relevant alternatives in regulatory strategies and measures. xii 1 l WATER, ENERGY AND FOOD SECURITY NEXUS IN JORDAN, LEBANON AND TUNISIA 1.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "87a4e2fb-5e3a-446a-abf4-a7918382b5ad": {"__data__": {"id_": "87a4e2fb-5e3a-446a-abf4-a7918382b5ad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Water, energy and food security nexus in Jordan, Lebanon and Tunisia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8a04029c9fc883e58a41351620582d69eb148d5c30cb74d75c41cc4f9c432f89"}, "2": {"node_id": "2a692530-b341-40ad-bfb7-38bcb0cfa1ee", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "415a532b5244d5ce99ba1e8cb6c84602ba80cdbbbb1ee80e01037ca8de8978be"}}, "hash": "c3408bf6574f337ff0e2e168604c7d4bf8f8bfb07712e197812ed94ef0ae0a2e", "text": "Water - Energy - Food (WEF) Nexus 1 l WATER, ENERGY AND FOOD SECURITY NEXUS IN JORDAN, LEBANON AND TUNISIA ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT POLICIES AND REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK l 2 karsten-wurth-karsten-wuerth-unsplash.com ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT POLICIES AND REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK l 2 3 l WATER, ENERGY AND FOOD", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "87a8b08e-4983-4448-8cdf-b1693f73dc12": {"__data__": {"id_": "87a8b08e-4983-4448-8cdf-b1693f73dc12", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Water, energy and food security nexus in Jordan, Lebanon and Tunisia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "89b053f40fb012ad7be105b0feeb344954af5c35835d69db672b5f33ff4df353"}, "3": {"node_id": "a2b15031-3fa6-4b0e-80af-e3f00c9aa630", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bd51cf5c687a01bdaad4150555e5750e4ac5ea0a7d3b8068a545742aeae2e020"}}, "hash": "24b06ca9aa4f88939a9ed0a2d3658548869fa0ec3f49f9373287da6f2cc4b4fb", "text": "SECURITY NEXUS IN JORDAN, LEBANON AND TUNISIA 1.1. Background and History Water, energy, and food security are complex sectors on their own, but their interactions make them even more complex. The interrelatedness of the water, energy and food security sectors should not be viewed as a hindrance, but rather their relationships should be used as an opportunity to tackle development issues with a multi-sectoral approach. The Water, Energy and Food (WEF) Security Nexus Approach aims to understand how of each of these three sectors relates to the other two and how this understanding can be used to make policy decisions that promote sustainable development and poverty reduction (Bizikova et al., 2013). The connection between water, energy and food security may seem apparent in some cases; for example, agriculture is a main user of water and energy and water can be used as an energy source to power food production processes. In other cases, the link between the sectors may be more discrete. For example, does an increase in the production of biofuels affect a country\u2019s food security? (Bizikova et al., 2013). Similarly, advances in one sector may lead to degradation in the others. The inefficient use of water for agriculture can lead to the excessive withdrawal of groundwater, which may lead to food insecurity in the future. The Nexus Approach involves more than technological advances; it requires collaboration and cooperation among ministries, various levels of government and international partners. Reliable and effective governance is critical to the Nexus Approach. A crucial aspect of effective governance is the engagement of participatory approaches. Participatory approaches, including stakeholder involvement and the monitoring and evaluation of community responses, are critical to ensuring that the priorities of those affected by policies are being met. As we enter a post Millennium Development Goals world, we must tackle contemporary issues as well as continue the fight for poverty elimination. Outside pressures, such as urbanization and climate change, are playing a significant role in the water, energy and food security sectors and will continue to do so in the future. Not only does the Nexus Approach focus on the link between water, energy and food security, but it also aims to address external pressures and how they ultimately affect quality of life and development. ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT POLICIES AND REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK l 4 1.2. The WEF Nexus and Climate Change in the Arab Region Water security, energy security and food security are inextricably linked in the Arab region, perhaps more so than in any other region in the world. Generally, the region is known to be energy-intensive, water-scarce, food-deficient, and one of the world\u203as most economically and environmentally vulnerable regions to climate change. This strong interdependency between water, energy, food and climate change in the Arab region calls for the consideration of Nexus Approach when addressing the management of these three vital sectors. The Nexus Approach integrates management and governance across sectors, and where conventional policy and decision-making in \u2018silos\u2019 give way to an approach that reduces trade-offs and builds synergies across sectors especially in light of the global UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the COP21 Paris Climate Change commitments in 2015. Fortunately, this has been recently well-recognized in the Arab Strategic Framework for Sustainable Development (ASFSD), adopted by the League of Arab States in 2013, aiming at addressing the key challenges faced by the Arab States in achieving sustainable development during the period 2015-2030. This new development has created unprecedented opportunities for fundamental policy changes in various economic, institutional, technological, and social systems, as well as boosting resource efficiency and productivity by addressing externalities across sectors. 1.2.1. Water Average water availability in the Arab Region is 840m3 per person per year, only 12% of the world\u2019s average of 7000m3 per person per year (Sadik, 2013). The Arab region is currently using 75% of exploitable water sources in the region, and it is estimated that 58% of the region\u2019s renewable water resources will be depleted by 2030 (Sadik, 2013; Immerzeel et al., 2011). Arab countries obtain their water from several different sources, including groundwater, desalination and wastewater treatment.

Energy The Arab Region has become almost synonymous with oil production. Oil and gas are major sources of income in the region, contributing to 36% of total Arab GDP. The shares from export earnings range from 33% to 97% in the region. However, as recent events have shown, oil revenues are vulnerable and subject to shocks and instability (Gelil, El Ashry & Saab, 2013). Oil and gas are not only important for earnings from exports, but they provide 97% of domestic demand in the region. The region\u2019s overwhelming dependence on traditional energy sources has had a tremendous impact on greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon dioxide emissions in the Arab Region increased by 247% from 1990 to 2010; 95% of this increase has been attributed to the production and use of oil and gas sources (Gelil, El-Ashry, & Saab, 2013). Progress in renewable energy (RE) sources is being made. As of 2013, there were 106 renewable energy projects in the works. These projects equalled a more than 4% increase in current non-hydropower renewable capacity. Additionally, between 2008 and 2011, non-hydropower renewable capacity doubled (Bryden, Riahi & Zissler, 2013). Despite these advancements, regional policies that have kept energy prices artificially low have helped traditional energy sources remain popular and more attractive than renewable sources (Gelil, El-Ashry & Saab, 2013). 5 l WATER, ENERGY AND FOOD SECURITY NEXUS IN JORDAN, LEBANON AND TUNISIA 1.2.3. Food Security The Arab Region is the number one importer of wheat in the world (World Bank, 2009). Despite being almost self-sufficient in red meats, vegetables and fruits, the region severely lags behind the world in cereal productivity and requires twice as much land to grow the same amount of cereal as other parts of the world. Many countries have suffered from stagnant productivity for years (Sadik, 2013). Seven countries account for 85% of total agriculture GDP in the region. Population is expected to reach 633 million by the year 2050 and reaching self-sufficiency in cereal production will require an additional 105 million hectares of land. Land quality is limited in the region so increases in yields will have to come from improvements in irrigation, agriculture inputs and research and development (Sadik, 2013). Malnutrition is also present across the region. About 25% of children under five years old suffer from stunted growth and there are vast differences between countries. Yemen has the highest rate of childhood stunting at 57.9% (Breisinger, Ecker, Al-Riffai, & Yu, 2012). The poor are especially vulnerable to food insecurity in the Arab region. The poorest families in the region are estimated to spend 35% to 65% of their income on food (Food security and nutrition in the Arab region: key challenges and policy options, 2012). 1.2.4. Climate Change Climate change, which impacts the Arab region more than any other region in the world, is acting as a threat multiplier across all of the above resources and human security issues. Climate change adds pressure to ecosystems and natural resources and with that, also to human securities. For example, the reduction of water availability and/or the reliability of water systems (with knock-on effects e.g. for energy systems) causes increased risks of droughts and floods (also risks for water and energy infrastructure), land degradation and desertification, the loss of agricultural productivity, the loss of hydropower production potential, higher temperatures and more heat waves, increased energy demand for cooling, reduced agricultural yields, etc. (World Bank Group, 2014). The Arab Plan of Action to deal with Climate Change (APACC, 2012) suggests that these climate change impacts \u201cmay have social consequences due to the flow and migration of people from the affected areas to others within the same country, neighbouring countries or other countries [environmental refugees], which would result in increased pressure [there] on the environment and resources.\u201d The Arab Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction also highlights that the region is highly vulnerable to extreme events and natural disasters. 1.2.5.

The opportunities for utilizing a nexus approach are particularly apparent when observing the interactions between the water and energy sectors. It is estimated that the water cycle, from abstraction to treatment post-use, may use up to 15% of national electricity consumption in most Arab countries (Gelil, El-Ashry & Saab, 2013; Siddiqi & Anadon, 2011). ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT POLICIES AND REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK l 6 The Arab Region is currently home to 50% of the world\u2019s desalination capacity. Desalination is a highly energy-intensive process, using an average 3.5 kWh of energy per cubic meter of water (Mofor, 2013; Moawad, 2011). By 2050, desalination and wastewater are predicted to provide 28% and 15% of the region\u2019s water, respectively (Sadik, 2013). Energy demand for desalination will increase with the increased capacity, and the Arab region must consider how it will power these plants in the future. These links become even more critical when you consider the impact these changes in water and energy use will have on agriculture and food systems. The benefits of conservation are also tremendous for the Arab Region. Reducing energy losses to only 10%, from the current 19.4%, would save the region US$ 5.5 billion. Furthermore, transitioning to compact fluorescent lighting could reduce carbon emissions by 2.56% (Gelil, El-Ashry & Saab, 2013). Expanding the water cycle could also bring immense benefits to the region. Agriculture policies that reduce the production of water-intensive crops and consider virtual water trade should also be regarded as conservation tools for the water and energy sectors (Gelil, El- Ashry & Saab, 2013). The Arab Region must also consider the effects of climate change as it moves forward. Studies estimate a 3\u00b0 to 7\u00b0 C temperature increase by the end of the century. This temperature increase could reduce groundwater supplies by 40% (Food security and nutrition in the Arab region: key challenges and policy options, 2012). Climate change may also reduce crop productivity and agriculture yields. 7 l WATER, ENERGY AND FOOD SECURITY NEXUS IN JORDAN, LEBANON AND TUNISIA 2.

Background and History The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were launched in 2000, set 2015 as the target year. Recognizing the success of the goals (and the fact that a new development agenda was needed beyond 2015), countries agreed in 2012 at RIO+20, the UN Conference on Sustainable Development, to establish an open working group to develop a set of sustainable development goals. After more than a year of negotiations, the Open Working Group presented its recommendations for the 17 SDGs. In August 2015, the 193 member states of the United Nations reached a consensus on the final document of the new agenda \u00abTransforming our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\u00bb Member states decided to hold the UN summit for the adoption of a new sustainable development agenda with its 17 goals from 25 to 27 September 2015 in New York; members convened at this high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly. There are 17 Sustainable Development Goals with 169 targets in contrast to the 8 Millennium Development Goals with 21 targets. The complex challenges that exist in the world today demand that a wide range of issues is covered. It is critical to address the root causes of the problems and not only the symptoms. The SDGs are the results of a negotiation process that involved the 193 UN member states and unprecedented participation of civil society and other stakeholders. This led to the representation of a wide range of interests and perspectives.

As a systems approach that aims to reduce trade- offs and build synergies by considering interactions and dependencies at all stages, the Nexus Approach enhances the efficiency of the entire system rather than increasing productivity of a specific sector often at the expense of others. An example of this is the climate change goal, SDG 13, which focuses on combating climate change and its effects. Climate change is a cross-sectoral stressor and a key driver of water and food systems. The energy system drives climate change and in return, is being affected by it. Projections by RICCAR, the Regional Initiative for the Assessment of Climate Change Impacts on Water Resources and Socio-Economic Vulnerability in the Arab Region, indicate that the Arab region will be affected by a general rise in temperature, more hot summer days and decreasing average monthly rainfall. ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT POLICIES AND REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK l 10 At the core of the water-energy-food security nexus, Goals 2, 6 and 7 are easily identified. Goal 2 seeks to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture, and it has five associated targets and three means of implementation. Goal 6 aims to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, and it has six associated targets and two implementation means. Goal 7 aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all, with five targets and two implementation means. A closer look at the SDGs and their targets reveals several connections. For example, target 6.4, increasing water use efficiency across all sectors, is linked to targets 2.3 and 2.4 that call for better agricultural productivity and resilient agricultural practices, which are connected to target 7.3 related to improvement in energy efficiency. Connections are not limited to these three core goals of the nexus, but are present in others too, such as health target 3.9 that calls for the reduction in the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and contamination, which is closely connected to target 6.1, which focuses on achieving universal access to safe drinking water for all. Examining the SDGs as a system with a nexus lens helps identify these connections and guide decision makers along the long-term path of sustainable development. Governing bodies must ensure that the interdependencies among SDGs and sectors are accounted for in strategy and policy formulation. The water-energy-food Nexus Approach may also provide a cross-check on how progress in some thematic targets affects others. The integrated nature of the 2030 Agenda was echoed in the key messages from the Arab Forum for Sustainable Development, to the follow-up high-level political forum on sustainable development. They highlighted the links between goals related to the environment, natural resources, climate change and economic and social objectives, and they called for increased cooperation across the region given the cross-border nature of water, energy, agriculture and food security challenges. The messages also stressed that human rights, including the right to development, gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment, are the foundation of the agenda, and they are in harmony with ESCWA\u2019s proposed water-energy-food security nexus. 2.3. SDGs, Targets and Implementation Means at the Core of the Water- Energy-Food Security Nexus and Climate Change Each country has primary responsibility for its own economic and social development and the role of national policies, domestic resources and development strategies cannot be overemphasized. Good governance and the rule of law at the national and international levels are essential for sustained, inclusive and equitable economic growth, sustainable development and the eradication of poverty and hunger. Relevant SDGs for this study include (Table 1): SDG-2: End Hunger, Achieve Food Security and Improved Nutrition and Promote Sustainable Agriculture. SDG-5. Achieve Gender Equality and Empower All Women and Girls. SDG-6: Ensure Availability and Sustainable Management of Water and Sanitation for All.

The WEF Nexus and Climate Change Related to the SDGs \u2013 Arab Region The following analysis is mainly based on the WEF Nexus in the Arab Region Series, which was published by the League of Arab States (LAS) in 2016. Resource scarcity challenges and other emerging development issues were recently well recognized in the Arab Strategic Framework for Sustainable Development (ASFSD) adopted by the LAS in 2014. The ASFSD is promoting the Nexus Approach to water-energy-food sustainability in the Arab region and encouraging the transition towards a low carbon economy to address the interdependencies between water, energy and food in order to make the nexus work for the poor. In addition, the Nexus Approach will enhance system thinking and integration of sectoral policies; this, in turn, will help the Arab region achieve the targets of the SDGs. In the SDGs of the UN\u2019s post-2015 Global Development Agenda, the three components of the WEF Security Nexus are clearly explained as: \u2022 Goal 2 calls for ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition and promoting sustainable agriculture. \u2022 Goal 6 calls for ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. \u2022 Goal 7 calls for access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. \u2022 In addition, Goal 13 addresses climate change. In other words, access to water, energy and food are prioritized to achieve sustainable development. This highlights the necessity of the WEF Nexus Approach and the important role it can play in policy formulation for achieving both the SDGs and the Paris Climate Change targets. By acknowledging sustainable development inter-linkages among various environmental, social and economic dimensions, the SDGs are better achieved through integrated management of resources. The WEF Nexus Approach would offer the necessary foundation for forming potential synergies and win-win situations that would help parties achieve sustainable development.

ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT POLICIES AND REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK l 14 2.5. Assessment of Current Policies Although the Arab region was among the first to develop a regional strategy for Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP), the implementation of this strategy at the national level has been sub-optimal as the vast majority of SCP policies that exist in the Arab region are predominantly supply-oriented. Examples of these include improving efficiency of power generation and water networks, building new desalination plants and improving agriculture productivity. Demand-side policies curbing and influencing consumer demand by using economic instruments or rationalizing subsidies, for example, are rarely used. It is also worth noting that though the Arab SCP strategy identified energy, water and food as regional priorities, the nexus concept was not developed enough at that time of its adoption in 2009. The strategy addresses the efficiency of those three resources independently. In most of the Arab countries, energy, water and food policies are developed within each sector with little horizontal coordination. Additionally, climate change is still being addressed as an add-on policy issue rather than a core development challenge in the region. Conventional policy- and decision-making in \u2018silos\u2019, therefore, needs to give way to an approach that reduces trade-offs and builds synergies across sectors. This new development has created unprecedented opportunities for fundamental policy changes in various economic, institutional, technological and social systems. It offers real opportunities for synergies such as: \u2022 Coordinated investments in infrastructure related to water, food and energy. \u2022 Innovation to improve resource use efficiency and harness renewable energy to meet climate change obligations as per Paris Climate Change Agreement in 2015. \u2022 Use of economic instruments for stimulating investment including pricing of resources and ecosystem services. \u2022 Maximizing the beneficial uses of water and energy amongst competing demand. \u2022 Applied and adaptive research to enhance adaptation to climate change in the agricultural sector and to ensure production systems resilience. \u2022 Capacity building and sharing of experiences at national and regional levels.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "30929b28-7e61-4f78-9208-db9ddca462cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "30929b28-7e61-4f78-9208-db9ddca462cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Water, energy and food security nexus in Jordan, Lebanon and Tunisia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a9eaac20de7215e7abd71da01e485f7065a6d241415c5484ab1b4d1d08aec3df"}, "2": {"node_id": "502e78e2-b63d-4af6-bd1d-348fe17a9e35", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ccb1747f9437ec59fcbd8298eccc879d24f1c406981a0e8a061ab34b69239df0"}}, "hash": "51c2bca59b6c5ac416850f0443a59898045e10890f66bffb77f9edb84d57ab7b", "text": "\u2022 Capacity building and sharing of experiences at national and regional levels. \u2022 Bridging the present science-policy gap. 15 l WATER, ENERGY AND FOOD SECURITY NEXUS IN JORDAN, LEBANON AND TUNISIA 2.6.

The newly established climate change institutions and different forms of multi- stakeholder bodies, such as the national climate change committees that are already formulated in many Arab countries, could serve as catalysts to mainstream the Nexus Approach at all levels of policy development. Arab policymakers need to revisit their current and future development strategies and plans with a new nexus lens. Water, food and energy form a complex web of interlinkages, and due to their strong interdependence, policies and subsidies in one sector strongly influence the other two sectors. For example, changes in energy policies and subsidies influence water use for food production. This has been evident in many Arab countries. The subsidy system implemented in many Arab countries is an across-the-board, or universal, subsidy system, which in fact, works in favour of the rich rather than the poor. Thus, the issue of setting the prices of water, energy and food has been always politically sensitive and thus requires careful consideration. Reassessing the pricing schemes of the three resources needs to be conducted using a holistic approach, taking into consideration the complexities of the interlinkages explained above. Furthermore, to achieve social justice, universal subsidies should give way to targeted subsidies that are directed at the needy segments of Arab society to ensure equity and apply the policy \u201ctreat unequals unequally.\u201d The most important policy reform to be considered is to revise the current pricing policies in these three sectors and redesign them to reflect the real value of the resources and to contribute to their sustainability. These pricing policies should aim to ensure that basic human needs are met, incentivize the conservation of resources and recover the cost of their service provision without impacting the poor groups of society. Moreover, in order to achieve both the mandate and the targets of the SDGs and the 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement, Arab policy makers need to mainstream the WEF Nexus Approach in their sustainable development strategies, plans and programmes. The League of Arab States needs to revise its current institutional framework of sustainable development to foster the WEF Nexus Approach, system thinking and institutional learning. National and regional efforts to address the climate change challenge offer an unprecedented opportunity for a needed institutional reform in order to mainstream the nexus thinking in policy development and implementation. Several pioneering projects are offering opportune examples of the need to foster the Nexus Approach. Saudi\u2019s first solar desalination plant will produce 60,000 cubic meters of desalinated water per day and will be the world\u2019s largest utility scale solar desalination plant. Another excellent example is the Lake Manzala engineered wetland in Egypt, which has proved to provide an economically- and environmentally-sound alternative to traditional wastewater treatment facilities, while using the treated wastewater for agriculture and aquaculture. Both examples make a testing ground for the need to coordinate energy, water and food policies, while reducing environmental footprints and improving resilience to climate change at the national level. ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT POLICIES AND REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK l 16 2.7. Conclusion The integrated management of natural resources would enhance resource efficiency and ensure that SDGs are reached at the national and regional levels. The ASFSD realized the WEF Nexus as an effective tool to enhance resource efficiency and achieve sustainable development. Subsidy reform of energy, water and food should be undertaken in a holistic fashion to target the poor. Furthermore, the newly-adopted Paris Climate Change Agreement, along with the established climate change bodies at the national levels, could serve as a catalyst to foster the WEF Nexus Approach. 17 l WATER, ENERGY AND FOOD SECURITY NEXUS IN JORDAN, LEBANON AND TUNISIA 3.

Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) The most recent survey data that were publicly available for Jordan\u2019s MPI estimation are from 2012. In Jordan, 1.2 percent of the population (85,000 people) are multidimensionally poor while an additional 1.0 percent live near multidimensional poverty (69,000 people). The breadth of deprivation (intensity) in Jordan, which is the average deprivation score experienced by people in multidimensional poverty, is 35.3 percent. The MPI, which is the share of the population that is multi- dimensionally poor, adjusted by the intensity of the deprivations, is 0.004. Table-6 shows the percentage of Jordan\u2019s and Tunisia\u2019s populations that live near multidimensional poverty and that live in severe multidimensional poverty. The contributions of deprivations in each dimension to overall poverty complete a comprehensive picture of people living in multidimensional poverty in Jordan and Tunisia.

The Jordan Case \u2013 Energy Sector 4.1.1. General Overview of the Energy Sector - Jordan Jordan has limited energy resources and depends heavily on imported crude oil for its energy use. The major national objectives in the energy sector in Jordan are to provide adequate energy for intensive development at the lowest possible cost and with the best specifications. Recent developments, such as extreme volatility in oil prices, concerns about security of energy supply and demand and fears about future energy supplies, continue to remain at the top of our political agenda. The Government of Jordan (GoJ) is seeking to address challenges in the energy sector through a combination of medium- to long-term solutions. Additionally, the GoJ is seeking to improve its energy security and lower its exposure to external shocks in terms of supply. It is also working on the implementation of measures in line with the objectives to improve the fiscal and macro-economic situation in the country and create sound, sustainable growth for Jordan. Crude oil and oil product imports have decreased from 7,130 thousand tons in 2012 to 5,705 thousand tons in 2016, a drop of around 20%. Table 9 and Figure 2 below show the quantity of crude oil and oil product imports in the period 2012-2016. Table 9.

General Overview and Main Challenges Jordan is heavily dependent on foreign energy sources with over 96% of its needs being met by imports of oil products, natural gas and electricity; the annual cost of these imports totals more than JOD 4 billion. The Second Gulf War created a shock in the energy sector in Jordan and brought the country\u2019s oil supply vulnerability to light. This has increased the calls for more serious efforts to diversify energy supplies and develop domestic energy resources to reduce Jordan\u2019s dependence on foreign energy resources and improve the security of the supply.

Key Actions and Strategies Securing the energy supply and diversifying energy sources are two of the main objectives of the GoJ\u2019s Executive Development Program (EDP) for 2016-18. In line with the Energy Strategy, which was updated for the years 2015-2025, the GoJ is seeking to diversify its energy supply and is currently considering the development of projects, which could be implemented in the very short term. Additionally, the GoJ is working on the security and reliability of its supply chain to avoid future energy shortages. Several on-going initiatives in that respect can be highlighted: \u2022 Discussions with neighbouring countries to secure reliable supplies. \u2022 On-going discussions with the Egyptian authorities to secure the supply of contracted quantities of gas from Egypt. \u2022 Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Terminal in Aqaba, which was inaugurated on 30 July 2015, to import LNG through three main tracks i) importing LNG from international market through tendering or bilateral agreements ii) constructing an LNG Jetty and connecting it to the main Arab Gas Pipeline iii) leasing floating storage regasification units (FSRU) through requests for proposals from FSRU providers. \u2022 Electricity production capacities (IPP1: 370MW; IPP2: 373MW; IPP3: 573MW; and IPP4: 240MW for peaking units) developed and financed by the private sector. \u2022 Increase the country\u2019s strategic oil and oil product storage capacity to secure a strategic 60-day supply of petroleum products and develop infrastructure projects: \u2022 Oil terminal rehabilitation project. \u2022 Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) Jetty. \u2022 Aqaba oil terminal (100 thousand tons storage). \u2022 Aqaba LPG terminal (6 thousand tons storage). \u2022 Amman Strategic Reserve Terminal (250-300 thousand tons of light oil products and 10 thousand tons of LPG). \u2022 Liberalization of the downstream oil sector: the GoJ granted licenses to three initial Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) to import and trade white products. \u2022 Exploitation of national energy resources: there are medium- to long-term prospects for oil shale and additional extraction of natural gas from Risha field. \u2022 Renewable energy programmes: 200 MW will be contracted (Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) and Implementation Agreement (IA) signed) in 2013 further to a direct proposals process carried out in 2011 and 2012. Considering the existing technical potential for solar and wind energy in the country, the Energy Strategy calls for 10% of the Kingdom\u2019s energy mix to come from renewable energy sources by 2020. To achieve this, the GoJ is following an evolving multi-faceted action plan with partners from public and private sectors to significantly increase electricity generation from renewable sources, substitute conventional fuels for renewable energy across sectors and increase energy efficiency to reduce overall demand for energy without sacrificing economic growth. ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT POLICIES AND REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK l 30 4.1.2.3. Renewable Energy Policy The Jordanian government\u2019s policies are focused on planning, supervision and regulation for bolstering the sector\u2019s capacity and enhancing the volume of investment. Jordan already signed agreements for more than 1000MW of renewable energy projects (both wind and solar); around 135MW of this total are already connected to the grid and under commercial operation. Another 900MW are currently under construction and financial closure. The 2007-2015 strategy aims at promoting the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency. The strategy has adopted an ambitious renewable energy target to capitalize on local resources and has targeted a contribution rate of 10% of the country\u2019s energy needs by 2020.

The following RE projects are considered as committed renewable energy projects until 2015 within the baseline scenario in the Jordan\u2019s Third National Communication report on Climate Change: \u2022 Wind power project in the Tafila area with a capacity of 117 MW. \u2022 Wind power project in the Fujeij area with a capacity of 90MW. \u2022 Wind power project in Maan area with a capacity of 70 MW (Gulf Grant). \u2022 PV solar project in Quweirah area with a capacity of 70 MW (Gulf Grant). \u2022 PV solar project with a capacity of 10 MW in the area of Mafraq. \u2022 Direct proposal solar PV projects to generate solar electricity 200 MW. \u2022 PV solar project with a capacity of 5 MW (Spanish Grant). \u2022 Wind energy projects from direct proposals to generate electricity 100 MW. The Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Law (REEEL) was approved and released in mid- 2012 (Law No. 13 for year 2012). The main objectives of the REEEL include: \u2022 Increasing the contribution of RE to the total energy mix in Jordan. \u2022 Promoting and exploiting RE for environmental protection and sustainable development purposes. \u2022 Enhancing energy efficiency in all sectors of the economy. According to Article 10 of this law, rules and regulations to guide implementation of the REEEL were issued by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources and the Electricity Regulatory Commission, which was substituted by the Energy and Minerals Regulatory Commission in 2014. 31 l WATER, ENERGY AND FOOD SECURITY NEXUS IN JORDAN, LEBANON AND TUNISIA According to the REEEL\u2019s approved directives and regulations, Jordan follows a five-track approach to develop and connect RE systems to electrical transmission or distribution grids in the country (see Annex B). These are: \u2022 Direct Proposals (DP). \u2022 Competitive Bidding System (CBS). \u2022 EPC Turn-key (through grants). \u2022 Small Scale RE Scheme (Net metering). \u2022 Power Energy Wheeling. In order to be ready to achieve policy targets and attract and receive commercial investments in this field, Jordan has established the following regulatory and policy frameworks as well as commercial tools for renewable energy: \u2022 The Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Law (Law No. 13), the first in the region, allows investors to identify and develop grid-connected electricity production projects through unsolicited or direct proposal submission. \u2022 This law also created the Jordan Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Fund (JREEEF). The fund is financed by national and international institutions. The fund has a legal temperament and is financially and administratively independent. Both national and foreign private companies are allowed to apply for the Fund\u2019s support when setting up renewable energy generation projects. \u2022 Net- Metering for small RE Systems (Roof Tops) with Fixed Purchase Prices for Excess Power is a directive that allows consumers to install, use and connect RE systems (solar, wind, bio- energy, geothermal, small hydro) to the grid if their expected generation does not exceed their average monthly consumption for the previous year (to be estimated by the distribution company in case of new users). The net value of the electricity consumption (or generation) is calculated each month. In case of net consumption, the user pays the value of electricity to the distributor. If there is net generation, the distributor can roll over the surplus to the next month as long as the balance is cleared by the end of the year according to the tariffs set by the law (0.17, 0.13 and 0.12 USD/kWh for solar, hybrid and other forms of renewable energy, respectively). \u2022 Tax Incentive regime: A by-law was issued on tax exemptions for RE and EE systems and equipment. Article 11 states that \u201cAll systems and equipment of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency and its production inputs, whether manufactured locally and/or imported, will be exempted from all customs duties and sales tax.\u201d The By-law on Exempting Renewable Energy and Systems and Energy Saving Equipment from Custom Fees and Sales Tax (By-law No.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "60a5174f-37d4-4379-9792-6e6070d4c6cd": {"__data__": {"id_": "60a5174f-37d4-4379-9792-6e6070d4c6cd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Water, energy and food security nexus in Jordan, Lebanon and Tunisia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e86419b5181ef9b205e581bd304bd27829373f553d00cadc214000236282223c"}, "2": {"node_id": "5ac8d234-9433-4086-a9d3-ad9a46fa64fb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "11ee4c3887c5375af2363dfb74aec0a882f4a810b2d0affb13f189aa4bf57dd1"}}, "hash": "36242d8c6dbd1c77844d534d6f328e0bad57d48c3ac19a388eed729def2aaa4d", "text": "13 for year 2015) was issued by virtue of Article (11/B) of REEEL.

ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT POLICIES AND REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK l 32 4.1.2.4. Energy Efficiency Policy The energy efficiency of the overall economy of Jordan can be assessed through the evolution of its primary and final energy intensities. The primary energy intensity has decreased from 0.942 toe/ JOD 1000 in 2005 to 0.728 toe/JOD 1000 in 2011, which translates to a reduction of around 4.2%. The final energy intensity has decreased at a higher rate 4.9% in the same period. However, since 2011, both intensities have slightly increased with annual rates of 1.8% and 2.3%, respectively, which shows some kind of degradation of the economy\u2019s energy performance. In the 2005-2015 period, the primary and final energy intensity has decreased at annual rates of 1.8% and 2.1%, respectively. Primary and Final energy Intensities 2005 1.0 0.9 0.8 0.7 Primary EI toe / 1000 JD fixed prices Final EI toe / 1000 JD fixed prices 0.6 0.5 0.4 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Source: Calculations from MEMR,2017 Figure-3. Primary and Final Energy Intensities, Source: MEMR Annual Report 2016 Compared to other countries, the primary energy intensity of Jordan is considered high. It was around 0.21 toe/US$ 1000 in 2010, 1.2 times the world intensity and 4 times the average EU intensity. The situation is worse when we consider the electricity demand which has increased much higher than the GDP. The electricity intensity has fluctuated from 1168 kWh/JOD 1000 in 2004 to 1416 kWh/JOD 1000 in 2015, partly due to the switch from fuel to electricity in space and water heating. The situation is quite different for electricity generation, which has shown an important improvement in performance, mainly due to the introduction of gas-fired power plants with higher efficiency. The specific consumption of the electricity generation has, in fact, dropped from 251 toe/GWh in 2004 to 211 toe/GWh in 2014, showing an improvement of around 2.5% per year. 33 l WATER, ENERGY AND FOOD SECURITY NEXUS IN JORDAN, LEBANON AND TUNISIA The energy strategy 2007-2020 has included a targeted 20% improvement in energy efficiency by the year 2020. In turn, MEMR developed the first National Energy Efficiency Action Plan in 2013. This plan included the following recommendations: \u2022 Promote solar water Heaters (SWH) in different sectors. \u2022 Upgrade and update the Solar Energy Code. \u2022 Capacity building of engineers and technicians in the fields of solar and wind technologies. In 2011, after the adoption of the Arab EE Guideline by the Arab Ministerial Council for Electricity (AMCE) in late 2010, Jordan set its 2020 target as part of the development of its first NEEAP for 2012-2014. The baseline was used as the 5-year (2006-2010) average electricity consumption prior to the adoption of the Arab EE Guideline late in 2010; therefore, the 2020 target remains 20% of the (2006-2010) baseline consumption of 11291 GWh. This results in 2258 GWh of cumulative electricity savings by 2020, which equals the 20% target. According to the Renewable Energy & Energy Efficiency Law, Article 18, the MEMR issued energy efficiency By-law No. 73 for the year 2012; it is titled \u201cRegulating Procedures and Means of Conserving Energy and Improving Its Efficiency.\u201d The main objectives of this by-law are: \u2022 Set the general policy of energy conservation and improvement of its efficiency and submit it to the cabinet for endorsement and enact the plans and programmes necessary for its implementation. \u2022 Encourage investment in the field of conserving energy and improving energy efficiency. \u2022 Monitoring energy audit procedures and implementation of systems and activities related to the conservation of energy and improving energy efficiency. \u2022 Submit summer and winter daylight saving time dates to the Cabinet.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a986ec79-6eb6-4098-9659-797a9b12b374": {"__data__": {"id_": "a986ec79-6eb6-4098-9659-797a9b12b374", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Water, energy and food security nexus in Jordan, Lebanon and Tunisia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "253f3b3142f0692b8e5d2d8c23c206ab6e45e4f37e8b18b892f3723eeffa6c26"}, "2": {"node_id": "ecad4c77-6969-49c7-b6f9-73e2e39f57a8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "87b54637d9aa215b0d2fae9fab46f0277efdeeb6a8d34a4c1110080defbcf82f"}}, "hash": "09212cefc4a52aecb171050b757dbf576caea2b25f31faa3bb1fd83a6a8a3deb", "text": "\u2022 Submit summer and winter daylight saving time dates to the Cabinet. \u2022 Take the necessary measures for implementing an emergency plan to reduce energy consumption. \u2022 Spread national awareness in the field of conservation of energy and improvement of its efficiency. \u2022 Opine on energy-consuming projects. \u2022 Establish a database related to the conservation of energy and the improvement of its efficiency.

ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT POLICIES AND REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK l 34 4.2. The Jordan Case \u2013 Water Sector 4.2.1. General Overview of the Water Sector - Jordan Jordan is considered to be the second poorest country in the world in terms of water resources per capita. In fact, it ranks far below the global threshold of severe water scarcity at less than 100m3/ capita compared to 500m3/capita (National Water Strategy). In the past few years, the conflict among states in the region, high population growth and development needs have increased the demand for water and depleted the available, limited natural resources. Thus, water supply has become a major problem that needs to be addressed in a sustainable matter; this can be achieved by having institutions that cooperate to reach the overall vision of the water sector. In terms of water governance, the Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MWI) was established with the aim of providing an integrated water management system, project execution as well as strategic direction and planning for water related issues. The MWI has two organizations under its mandate: The Water Authority of Jordan (WAJ) and the Jordan Valley Authority (JVA). Water sector expenditures are mainly from the construction and expansion of collection systems and treatment plants as well as water production. Benefits are transferred to customers through quotas and subsidies for irrigation and domestic use. Capital projects are funded through donors and loans to the government. Water revenues have exceeded 100% of the operation and maintenance costs but only covered 60-70% of the total costs. Different measures have been considered as a way to reduce the gap between costs and revenues. Some of them include: increased fees on connections and services, reduced physical and administrative losses, improved energy efficiency and optimized systems. Strategies have been developed in order to build a management structure for the water sector over the past years. The first strategy, formulated in 1998, is called \u201cJordan Water Strategy and Policy\u201d. This strategy encompassed policies addressing water utilities, water, wastewater reuse, groundwater as well as water used for irrigation. Then, it was followed by \u201cWater for Life: Jordan\u2019s Water Strategy 2008-2022,\u201d which was adopted until the formulation of a National Water Strategy, which has regulations to ensure optimal service and management levels. In total, Jordan has written four national policy and strategy documents and six sector policies that provide guidance for the water sector. The National Water Strategy 2016-2025 is based on the previous strategic documents and is aligned with the sustainable development goals adopted by the United Nations in 2015. It aims to prepare the sector to be better prepared for future challenges by ensuring sustainability of water resources, strengthening integrated water resources management and planning. The following are key areas covered by the strategy: integrated water resources management; water, sewage and sanitation services; water for irrigation and energy; institutional reforms, management and monitoring; and other cross-cutting factors such as transboundary issues, public/private partnerships and the economic dimension of water. 35 l WATER, ENERGY AND FOOD SECURITY NEXUS IN JORDAN, LEBANON AND TUNISIA Legislation amendments, including Article 28 of the WAJ Law, were implemented to allow private sector participation (2002). The Groundwater by-law aims to protect groundwater resources (2002). The National Water Master Plan (NWMP) was put into operation in 2004.

In addition, it is in line with the new strategies adopted in other sectors, including the National Energy Strategy 2007-2020 adopted by the Royal Energy Commission, the \u201cAgriculture Document of 2009\u201d issued by the Ministry of Agriculture and the \u201cEnvironmental Policy and Plan of Action\u201d developed by the Ministry of Environment. Strategy documents for health, education and municipal affairs also reflect synergies and partnership with the water sector and the new updates of water wastewater management master plans, solid waste management and the newly approved reform legislation including the decentralization law. As Jordan moves towards the post-MDG era, it needs to examine the outcomes and achievements of its existing water strategy at endpoint (2015), evaluate its performance, contextualize the current situation in the country and the region, reinforce efforts to achieve the strategic goals set as part of this strategy and reconfigure the strategy for the future. The Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MWI) recognized the need to introduce an updated National Water Strategy 2016-2025 to ensure that national goals and priorities are realigned to the country\u203as changing needs and relate to the new SDGs. The revised strategy will respond to the substantial changes in the regional geopolitical situation, the ongoing risks and threats to Jordan\u2019s renewable water resources, a growing population and an expanding economy that is water- and energy-dependent and highly vulnerable to risk. MWI has also elaborated on a set of principles to guide future water sector planning: \u2022 Jordanians must recognize that there are limits to the country\u203as renewable, affordable, traditional, available water supply. \u2022 Jordanians must use and reuse water more effectively, efficiently and responsibly. \u2022 Citizens and the private and public sectors must share responsibility for water management and protection and work together to improve conditions within their local watersheds. ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT POLICIES AND REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK l 36 \u2022 A deeper knowledge of the availability, quality and protection of water is the foundation for effective decision-making. This includes knowing that there is an increased cost for any new, additional non-conventional resources. \u2022 Healthy aquatic ecosystems are vital to a high quality of life for Jordanians and must be preserved in pursuing socioeconomic and community-level development. \u2022 Jordan needs to address the impact of climate change on its social, economic and environmental development. Adaptation measures must ensure institutional response capacity, community education and awareness of the risks. 4.2.2. Municipal and Tourism Sectors The government has implemented a strict water-rationing program, supplying water to households only once a week. Households that are not connected to the formal networks or have limited storage capacity, including those in informal settlements, nomadic communities, the poor, refugees and migrants, consume less. The per capita domestic consumption of water is moderate. In 2010, MWI adopted a policy note that stated that the planned consumption of water from networks will be 120 L/C/day in Amman, 100 in other cities and 80 in rural areas. The targeted consumption amounts vary according to the industrial and commercial percentage of subscribers (non-residential subscribers). Urbanized areas in Jordan make up about 83% of the country, and the percentage is increasing. The Water Reallocation Policy illustrates the amounts of water supplied to each governorate. Requirements for water are increasing in the municipal sector due to the population increases resulting from both a high birth rate and the recent influx of refugees, but rural areas have suffered the most. The Government focuses on water distribution in highly populated areas, and as a result, rural residents have access to water only every 12 days, while those in cities like Amman receive water at least once every seven days. The tourism industry uses about 4MCM annually, a figure projected to increase in the future. Efforts are underway to enhance quantities and improve services. 4.2.3. Institutional Framework For the water sector and the Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MWI), there is a growing need for a more consolidated, harmonized and coordinated water management organization. It is critical that this organization is backed by a strong legal/regulatory framework, especially when the Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) approach, supported by key management instruments, is being reinforced to optimize water resource use.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0a3841f5-de5e-4821-81aa-debf4a46b289": {"__data__": {"id_": "0a3841f5-de5e-4821-81aa-debf4a46b289", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Water, energy and food security nexus in Jordan, Lebanon and Tunisia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "076a319e7bd49c586252d1b8a49f9eb2f1730e3d9dda8ca064a9f6c8fa35e043"}, "2": {"node_id": "fa25ffbb-d257-414a-9710-24480e2a9f01", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e1550dc9ae0c2a37ea7137be835d27e9b75be178713b21468d0f8c8984e2bcb5"}}, "hash": "1e7278c7c1f802ce5e2dcef6800695dacfc1d51eb3ee94086d17978bc59bcded", "text": "A harmonized national structure needs to be implemented to execute operational plans for water resourcing, distribution and delivery systems; mobilize public/private capital for expansion and improvement of infrastructure; sustainably recover operating and maintenance costs; protect the quality of water resources and water-dependent ecosystems; and protect the rights of customers.

The long-term average annual precipitation is 8,317 million cubic meters (Ministry of Water and Irrigation, 2014) of which about 92.5% is lost to evaporation (Freiwan et al., 2007). The Eastern Desert (also known as the Badia) that lies east of the mountainous region and covers about 80% of the land area of Jordan has low precipitation. (The Hashemite Fund for Development of Jordan Badia, 2014). Agriculture\u2019s contribution to GDP declined from 20% in 1974 to 2.9% in 2011 (Bahdousheh, et al, 2010), while in absolute terms it has increased (e.g. from JOD 57 million in 1974 to JOD 598.3 million in 2011 as shown in Table 12).

It is estimated that the indirect contribution of agriculture through auxiliary (supporting) industries of agriculture, such as agribusiness, food processing and the fertilizer industry, accounts for 27% of GDP. However, the importance of the agricultural sector stems from the fact that it is not only the major source of food products (especially red meat, poultry, dairies, fruits and vegetables), but also one of the sources of hard currencies earned from exports. About 20% of the poor in Jordan live in rural areas depending mostly on agriculture; they are livestock keepers, smallholders of farm households and landless former agriculturalists. Despite lack of motivation for rural youth, agriculture is still an important source of employment in rural communities (IFAD 2010). Jordan has five agro-ecological zones (AEZs) based on the annual rain levels (Table 13). A common element in all AEZs is the rainfall factor that determines the land use and farming systems in each zone. Drier zones are areas of small ruminant grazing and rain-fed barley cultivation. Wheat is also rain-fed but in higher rain areas, whereas irrigated farming, including intensive dairy, fruits and vegetables, is in the settled permanently irrigated areas. Table 13.

The maximum potential contribution of improved rangeland is not expected to exceed 30% of the daily feed requirements of one adult sheep or goat (Sidahmed, 2011). Supplementary feed has been encouraged by the government\u2019s barley subsidies and reduced forage availability and has, as a result, led to lower profit margins for producers and less competitive products in national and international markets. Twenty years of subsidies and ease of transportation around the desert have enabled the livestock industry to become dependent on barley, which accounted for 63% of feed costs for producers. The government policy for subsidizing prices of imported inputs, especially during the dry season, has also encouraged livestock herders to keep excessive numbers of animals, exceeding the carrying capacity of the rangeland.

Policies, Strategies and Laws Related to Agricultural Sector, Source: MoA, 2011 Document Year Type Description Agricultural Policy Charter (ACP) 1995 Policy The Charter aims to achieve consistency in agricultural development with local, regional and international requirements and changes and an integrated socio-economic development characterized by efficiency, sustainability and equity. Clear policy objectives and priority sub-sectors were defined. Environmental Protection Law No. (52) of 1999 1995 Law The Jordanian Environmental Law was enacted as a temporary legislation in 2003 and was ratified by the Parliament in 2006. This law provided the appropriate legislative umbrella for issuing the various detailed regulations and instructions regarding the protection of the environment. National Rangeland Strategy 2001 Strategy This strategy was developed in 2001 with the main objectives of controlling deterioration of the rangelands and reversing the desertification process; increasing sustainable livestock production by restoring the productivity of rangelands and increasing sustainable range fodder production; supporting fodder production in order to encourage intensive breeding; and encouraging local communities and sheep breeders to adopt intensive breeding techniques to regulate stocking rates. National Strategy for Agricultural Development: - 2002 2010 2002 Strategy This strategy discusses the role of the agricultural sector in social and economic development to achieve sustainable agricultural and rural development, taking socio-economic and environmental aspects, e.g. protection and conservation of ago-biodiversity during such development, into consideration. The strategy presents profiles of proposed projects in the five agricultural subsectors of rain- fed agriculture, irrigated agriculture in the Jordan Valley, irrigated agriculture in the highlands, livestock and rangelands and the marketing of agricultural produce. Agriculture Provisional Law No. (44) of 2002 2002 Law This law was enacted to organize and develop the agricultural sector to attain developed, growing, diversified and integrated agricultural production that conserves the environment and natural resources. This law helps enhance self-dependency and meets the international, regional and domestic requirements. National Strategy and Action Plan to Combat Desertification 2006 Strategy The National Strategy and Action Plan (NSAP) to Combat Desertification was launched in 2006. It includes six major programmes that are mainly \u201cproject-based.\u201d The programmes include several projects related to desertification monitoring and control, capacity building, natural resources rehabilitation and development. The National Agenda 2006 2006 National Strategy The National Agenda was launched in 2006 comprising a comprehensive political and socio-economic reform plan for the country until 2017. The main goal of the National Agenda is to achieve consistent policies and ensure that they will not be subject to government change while taking into consideration the need to regularly develop and update these policies. 41 l WATER, ENERGY AND FOOD SECURITY NEXUS IN JORDAN, LEBANON AND TUNISIA Irrigation Equipment and System Design Policy of 2008 2008 Policy This policy statement follows from longer-term objectives outlined in the Water Strategy and supplements the Irrigation Water Policy and the Irrigation Water Allocation and Use Policy by establishing a policy on irrigation equipment and system design standards. The policy addresses the following themes: defining and updating equipment standards, raising farmers\u2019 awareness of standards, testing and enforcement of standards, training and certifying drip system designers and institutional responsibilities. Irrigation Water Allocation and Use Policy of 2008 2008 Policy This policy statement follows from longer-term objectives outlined in the Water Strategy and elaborates on priorities specified in the Irrigation Water Policy. As such, it includes updates and extensions of selected elements of the Irrigation Water Policy. In particular, it consolidates and elaborates on elements of that policy relating to on- farm water management, general management and administration, water tariffing and irrigation efficiency. The policy addresses the following themes: defining and updating crop water requirements, allocating water and managing billing practices, building farmers\u2019 water management skills, using reclaimed water, measuring deliveries and delivering water to groups. 4.3.3. Analysis on how Relevant Policies are Impacting the Agriculture Sector 4.3.3.1. Water Policies The JVA is responsible for the delivery of water to the farm gate and is not directly responsible for providing farmers with advice on how to grow their crops or manage the use of irrigation water at the farm level. Also, the JVA is mandated to conduct studies of new irrigation technologies, but the law is unclear about how the information generated should be disseminated to farmers. The JVA officials believe that the authority should also play a greater role in providing extension services to farmers related to water management; this is now the responsibility of the MOA.

The quantity of fresh water available for agriculture is on a continuous decline, and its quality is continuously deteriorating due to the increased rate of its mixing with treated wastewater of high salinity, especially in the middle Ghors (Jordan Valley), which has already resulted in increasing soil salinity, at a time when there are no adequate water resources to be used for soil leaching. Currently, farmers are not granted permits to dig groundwater wells for agricultural purposes as farmers in Disi indicated during an EU mission field visit to the area and meeting with farmers. Policy and programmes need to concentrate on improving on-farm efficiencies, and a significant part of such improvements can come from altering cropping patterns in order to concentrate on products that generate higher returns per unit of water used. New strategies for water development and management are urgently needed to avert severe national, regional and local water scarcities that will depress agricultural production, damage the environment and escalate water-related health problems. Close coordination must be maintained between the Ministry of Agriculture and JVA and with other related institutions with the aim of enhancing on-farm irrigation efficiencies and maximizing the agricultural output of a unit of land area per unit flow of irrigation water. It is also recommended that a new set of standards be developed for use of treated wastewater and blended water in agriculture, and that a framework be established for the kinds of irrigation technologies appropriate to each grade of water quality. ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT POLICIES AND REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK l 42 4.3.3.2. Quality Control All agricultural products that are either produced within Jordan or imported into Jordan are inspected for health and quality standards. While health standards are well defined, quality standards are not. Most quality standards are based on the size of the fruit or vegetable. Livestock products are inspected at government slaughter houses. Imported products require certificates of origin and a health certificate stating that the product is clear of diseases and radiation and not hazardous to humans or the environment. Live animals being imported are subject to inspection and quarantine. Fruits and vegetables for export are inspected by request to ensure international quality standards are met and to obtain necessary certification to prove that goods are free of diseases and residuals. Jordan\u2019s crop and livestock product standards related to health are internationally recognized norms. Laboratory facilities for testing for chemical residues are present in the city of Baqa\u2019a (near Amman) and being supervised by the MOA. The process of obtaining international certification of the laboratory results needs to be completed so that importers in other countries do not feel obliged to submit the products to new tests at accredited laboratories. Jordan now has laboratory capabilities for microbiological testing at the Royal Scientific Society and some producers have used that facility. On the basis of this infrastructure, the most urgent needs in this area are the development of a national set of food safety standards and obtaining international accreditation for laboratories in Jordan. 4.3.3.3. Marketing Policies Jordanian agricultural production, including that which is destined for export, does not receive any incentives (except the price of irrigation water, the cost of pumping and the temporary export ban in the face of perceived scarcities on the domestic market). Extra costs on the production and marketing chain are imposed in the form of requirements to use municipal markets, even in the case of exports and even when direct sales to retailers could be made by farmers or farmer organizations. Current import tariff policy encourages resource allocation to crops that represent inefficient uses of water, in terms of income generated per cubic meter of irrigation water: bananas, apples and oranges. In the case of apples and oranges, for example, it is clear that Jordan does not have a comparative advantage in production. Syria produces apples and oranges of equal or higher quality at a much lower price. Government policies have long considered marketing only as a supplementary service for production despite the fact that marketing starts before production its creation of greater economic benefits, and its importance in determining economic returns. Most policies have focused on developing production, which resulted in over-supply of some products, and caused the wasting of large quantities of horticultural produce because of imbalance between supply and demand. The lack of organized production plans and weak farmer organizations also add to the problem of poor marketing. The marketing infrastructure suffers from clear weaknesses, especially in the fruit and vegetables sectors.

Infrastructure for post-harvest operations also suffers from shortages in the areas of pre-cooling, grading, packaging, refrigerated transport and storage and processing of products. There is an absence of support for small farmers\u2019 groups (farmers\u2019 organizations) to improve their capacities to enhance vertical integration means along the food supply chain (e.g. cooperatives that are capable to acquire cold chains, packaging facilities). 43 l WATER, ENERGY AND FOOD SECURITY NEXUS IN JORDAN, LEBANON AND TUNISIA Significant weaknesses also exist in the provision of marketing support services, including market research, agricultural extension services, market information and to a lesser extent, the area of financing. There are few policies for direct economic market intervention; those that exist are characterized by their instability and temporary nature, such as in the case of protecting local production, or by the unsuitability of the mechanism used for their objectives, such as in the subsidies provided to sheep and goat breeders. It is recommended to have a comprehensive marketing policy to address all the gaps previously mentioned. 4.3.3.4. Agricultural Credit The Agricultural Credit Corporation (ACC) makes soft loans available to farmers and investors in agribusiness. The loans fall into one of two classes: operational or developmental. Operational loans are from 12-24 months in duration while developmental loans may be made for up to 15 years. At present, the Agricultural Credit Corporation (ACC) is the only specialized agricultural credit institution in Jordan. Most of the loans offered by ACC are medium-term loans for financing land reclamation, purchasing farm machinery, planting fruit trees, drilling deep wells, erecting greenhouses and purchasing drip irrigation systems. ACC development loans were in strong demand, not just because of the discounted interest rates and lack of commissions and fees, but also because commercial banks generally refused to provide loans with maturity beyond three years. ACC has not at all been involved in agricultural marketing, yet it could play a vital role in promoting high-value agricultural exports. It would be important to try to involve ACC in this area, particularly in providing export credit. Equally, it could participate in financing schemes for more efficient irrigation, especially low-pressure irrigation. 4.3.3.5. Food Safety Laws The current food control regime in Jordan falls under two laws: Agriculture Law No. 44 of 2002 and Jordanian Food Control Law No. 32 of 2003. These laws were adopted at the Aqaba Special Economic Customs Centre in May 2002 and at the Amman Customs Centre in January 2004, respectively. Inspection criteria are codified into a computerized system. This system has been applied at all completed border centres and will be expanded as more centres are completed. A border committee comprised of representatives from relevant agencies inspects imported agricultural and food products. 4.3.3.6. Social Welfare Policies and Programmes The government has implemented a series of programmes aimed at poverty alleviation by providing a better source of income for the poor and unemployed. The programmes implemented include: free education, free primary health care, business training for micro and small enterprises and social productivity programmes, such as small agribusiness projects (food industry, growing mushrooms and medicinal herbs, pickling, processing dairy products and honey beekeeping). 4.3.4. Challenges/ Issues Related to the Institutional and Legal Framework \u2022 Low efficiency of agricultural institutions. \u2022 Generally poor and/or inefficient agricultural services. \u2022 Weak cooperative system and limited private sector involvement in certain sub-sectors and activities. \u2022 Improper legal framework to govern the agricultural sector; some of the regulation is either lacking, weak or weakly enforced. \u2022 Despite several policies, strategies and plans that have been formulated, government commitment and donor support to the sector are minimal. \u2022 Inconsistent data, few agricultural statistics and weak GIS and MIS systems.

Climate change scenarios indicate that Jordan and the Middle East could suffer from reduced agricultural productivity and water availability among other negative impacts. At the same time, a significant potential for cost-effective reduction of GHG emissions exists in Jordan. Although Jordan does contribute less than 20 million tons of CO2eq p.a. (2000) to global emissions, it maintains a strong commitment to the objectives developed by the international community for the integrated environmental and economic response to the threat of climate change. The national circumstances in Jordan relevant for climate change mitigation and adaptation were described in detail for the first time in Jordan\u2019s 2nd National Communication to the UNFCCC (later updated in the 3rd National Communication). The Ministry of Environment (MoEnv) of Jordan has strengthened the policy and legal frameworks in Jordan to foster compliance with the three Rio Conventions, including the UNFCCC. 4.4.2. Mitigation Measures 4.4.2.1. Mitigation in the Energy Supply, Renewable Energy and Climate Change The energy sector is by far the major source of GHG emissions in Jordan. Jordan has very limited primary energy resources and depends to a large extent on imported petroleum, petroleum products and natural gas from neighbouring Arab countries. Due to economic growth and increasing population, energy demand is expected to rise by at least 50 percent over the next 20 years. The Energy Strategy\u2019s main national priorities are to set supply security and reduce the fiscal burden to the national budget as imposed by the national energy bill. Climate change is not mentioned explicitly. However, the main objectives in this regard are: \u2022 Exploiting renewable energy sources to increase their contribution to the total energy mix, achieving a safe renewable energy supply and promoting additional renewable investments. \u2022 Contributing to environmental protection and achieving sustainable development by promoting the exploitation of renewable energy. \u2022 Rationalizing the exploitation of energy and improving its efficiency in various sectors. In conventional electricity generation (through fuel switch) and in electricity distribution (efficiency improvements), a substantial technical potential for GHG reduction exists. However, the current conditions in the power sector, including the restrictions on gas imports and the lack of investments in new infrastructure, make these measures unfeasible from a mitigation policy point of view in the period considered in this Climate Change Policy. Other (economic) drivers are far more important. The Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Law was approved in 2012. This law intends to promote private sector investment in renewable energy projects. Also, the Jordan Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Fund has been established (JREEEF). 45 l WATER, ENERGY AND FOOD SECURITY NEXUS IN JORDAN, LEBANON AND TUNISIA The main barriers to renewable electricity development is the lack of long-term certainty on feed-in tariffs, the lack of national financing and the lack of institutional and legal support, including lack of enforcement for renewable energy projects. Another key area for application of renewable energy is solar water heating in the residential sector, which faces a range of barriers (high upfront costs, owner-tenant dilemma, weak enforcement of building codes and low domestic value added). 4.4.2.2. Mitigation in End-Use Energy Efficiency and Climate Change After the Jordan Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Fund (JREEEF) was established, a by- law was adopted In 2012, establishing a framework for specific energy efficiency regulation, including auditing, appliance labelling, minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) and smart metering. In addition, solar water heaters will become mandatory for large buildings. Current building codes in Jordan include standards for energy efficiency. Programmes are ongoing to promote green building codes and standards in Jordan, but so far, few buildings have complied. Key barriers to energy efficiency remain, including: weak enforcement of existing measures and regulations, lack of knowledge by energy users of the benefits of energy efficiency, lack of coordination between stakeholders in developing energy efficiency projects, high initial implementation costs, high perceived risks, lack of suitable \u00abnuancing mechanisms\u201d and lack of consistent institutional frameworks.

Available water resources per capita are falling, while water demand is rising. The water shortage will drastically increase in the future due to population growth and anticipated socio-economic development. Groundwater levels have dramatically declined showing that groundwater exploitation has been unsustainable. Water management in Jordan is supply-based and, despite significant improvements in water-supply infrastructure, a critical and serious supply-demand imbalance remains. Jordan has been subjected to additional water stress due to the influx from neighbouring countries impacted by political instability in the region. Finally, the potential decreasing precipitation in Jordan as a result of climate change could worsen the existing problems. The GoJ has developed a comprehensive water strategy entitled \u201cWater for Life\u201d for the period 2008 to 2022. The Strategy was updated in 2012. It mainly focuses on effective water demand management, effective water supply operations and institutional reform. The Strategy has climate change as part of its vision and as one of its principles. Jordan has already identified a list of no-regret measures that are required urgently to address the water sector problems in the short and medium terms. The water sector investment according to the Executive Development Program (2011-2013) is estimated to reach US$ 3 billion, not including investment needed for the Red Sea - Dead Sea Conveyance project. Lack of financing was a major and persistent barrier facing water sector development activities over past decades. Concerning the Dead Sea, pan evaporation measured at the Southern Dead Sea in the last decades has significantly increased. Wind, temperature and humidity measurements at the Dead Sea starting in the 1930s as well as 3-D model simulations all seem to indicate a statistically significant change in the local climate of the Dead Sea region. ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT POLICIES AND REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK l 46 4.4.2.4. Adaptation to Climate Change in Agriculture - Food Security Although a small country, Jordan has many different climatic regions; there are at least three different climatic regions: sub-tropical, Mediterranean and desert. Only about 5 % of Jordan\u2019s land mass is considered arable, and the country is among the world\u2019s most water-deficient countries. Agriculture is one of the most sensitive sectors to climate change induced impacts. The increased temperatures and lower precipitation resulting from climate change would adversely affect crop and water availability, critically influencing the patterns of future agricultural production in Jordan. The main expected impacts of these scenarios are a decrease in available soil moisture for crops in the rain-fed areas, an increased crop water requirement, increased crop/weed competition, more frequent droughts, changes in rainfall intensity with more possible floods, a shortened growing season and the reduction in yield of rain-fed and irrigated crops. As a result, the climatic change could adversely affect agriculture in several ways: \u2022 Productivity, in terms of quantity and quality of crops. \u2022 Agricultural practices, through changes of water use (irrigation) and agriculture inputs such as herbicides, insecticides and fertilizers. \u2022 Environmental effects, particularly in relation to the frequency and intensity of soil drainage, soil erosion and reduction of crop diversity. \u2022 Land use, through the loss and gain of cultivated lands, land speculation, land renunciation and hydraulic amenities. The sector strategies for agriculture refer to climate change but not in detail. The strategic document from the Ministry of Agriculture (2009) lists climate conditions (drought and frost) as challenges to the development of agriculture, but the document does not mention climate change in particular. The Ministry is currently developing the agriculture strategy in cooperation with the FAO. Climate adaptation in agriculture comprises two related challenges: adaptation to current climate variability and to future climate change. In the 2nd National Communication (2009), adaptation measures are suggested for both rain-fed and irrigated agriculture in Jordan. Adaptation measures in agriculture to adapt to climate change have been identified in other studies. These options are no-regret options, which should be implemented independently of future human induced climate change. 4.4.3. Legal and Institutional Framework and Stakeholder Involvement The legal framework was developed to ensure that the climate change objectives are embedded in national legislation and to provide the legal mandate for all public organizations involved in the implementation of the National Climate Change Policy.

The Jordan Case \u2013 Sustainable Development Related to Water, Energy and Food (WEF) and Climate Change 4.5.1. General Overview Jordan\u2019s vision for the water-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) envisages a sustainable environment, universal access to sanitation, sound wastewater management and reuse, pollution prevention, safe drinking water delivery, water security and regional cooperation. This vision will optimize the utilization of the interlinked resources of water, energy and food security. Jordan will adopt as a national water sector objective, \u2039Sustainable management of water and sanitation for all Jordanians\u2019. It will align and refine the SDG targets and indicators in the context of the National Water Strategy. Jordan will also work towards the related SDGs and targets that complement the achievement of the national water sector objective, guided by principles of human rights and justice. Jordan realizes that SDG implementation and sustainable development require significant mobilization of resources for developing countries from a variety of sources as well as the effective use of financing. Good governance and the rule of law at the national and international levels are essential for sustained, inclusive and equitable economic growth, sustainable development and the eradication of poverty and hunger. 4.5.2. Review of the Implementation of the 2030 Agenda of Sustainable Development Food security, water availability and sustainability, affordable and reliable energy, environment and climate change action and gender equality were designated as top priorities when the first national review on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda of Sustainable Development was conducted by the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation in 2017. Below is a summary of Jordan\u2019s efforts in this regard. 4.5.2.1. Food Security Jordan has always attached priority to the issue of food security, from both an access and availability standpoint. The most recent estimates show that the prevalence of food insecurity in the country remains excessively high. The Food Insecurity Experience Scale survey shows that 12.8% of the total population was affected by severe food insecurity during the 2014-2016 period. The latest data on stunting shows that 7.7% of children under five years of age suffered from some form of malnutrition in 2012. Food security is closely linked to population growth and reliance on the global commodity markets. In 2013, DOS reports estimated that the official yearly overall growth rate was 2.21%. This growth rate has changed significantly after the influx of hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees during the years since 2011. The results of the last census (2015) indicated that the average rate of population growth over the period 2004-2015 (the two recent censuses) was 5.3%. They also showed that the average population growth rate for the same period was 3.1% for Jordanian nationals and 18% for non-Jordanians. This situation has translated into a sharp rise in the import of basic food commodities and inflation, affecting the poor disproportionately. With 81% of its food requirements procured externally, Jordan is highly vulnerable to fluctuations in international prices of basic commodities. Satisfying the growing demand for food, for a growing population, will need to be addressed within the context of extreme water scarcity, as the demand for water for domestic use and sanitation services is increasing for Jordanian and non-Jordanian residents alike. This struggle falls among many other economic and social challenges. ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT POLICIES AND REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK l 50 As mentioned above, the absolute poverty rate (food and non-food) was 14.4% in 2010, and the abject poverty rate (food poverty) was 0.32 % in 2010. The rural poor make up 33.5% of the total poor in Jordan, the disadvantaged among rural populations are often the first victims of natural resource degradation and are impacted by crisis more severely than any other segment of the population. Lack of employment opportunities, poor labour productivity and lack of decent employment in agriculture are, therefore, serious constraints to food security in Jordan. This situation also contributes to increasing rural-urban migration and the rise of food insecure people in the cities.

Agriculture will, therefore, have to optimize the productivity of water, in terms of its efficiency of use, value added and job opportunities provided by this sector and develop mechanisms that better reflect the value of water in agricultural production. Food and agricultural production is facing many challenges, including: limited availability of surface water resources in the Jordan Valley; the rapid depletion of groundwater resources in the uplands due to over-exploitation; inefficient and misuse of irrigation water; and the degradation of soil and water quality. Small size holdings, especially in the Jordan Valley, and weak extension services that link agricultural research result in farmers having additional constraints. Another major challenge facing the agricultural sector is marketing that is closely linked to high post-harvest losses; inefficient markets; food safety issues; and the difficulties to ensure production that meets quality standards. The recent loss of some export markets has also affected agriculture considerably. In response to the challenges of food security and agriculture, the Government has developed the National Strategy for Agricultural Development in addition to the National Water Strategy in line with \u201cJordan 2025.\u201d Policies that will increase growth in agricultural production have been developed. 4.5.2.2. Water Availability and Sustainability Jordan is facing complex challenges as a result of the geo-political environment of the region and the chronic water scarcity that it has traditionally experienced. The increase in population has placed a further strain on the very limited water resources of the country. Water management in Jordan has focused on prioritizing supplying water for human consumption. The country has reviewed its development plans and strategic options within the context of other crucial resources, i.e. the production of food and the generation of energy to ensure a better understanding of the water-food- energy nexus. Almost all Jordanians (94%) have access to safe drinking water through water supply networks. However, the daily per capita water consumption is low; average consumption is 74.7 litres/person/ day and the government is working to raise this to approximately 122.6 litres/person/day by 2030. The agricultural sector is the largest water user, using 51% of Jordan\u2019s water; this is followed by the municipalities, which utilize 45%. The industrial sector makes use of 4%. The sewage service coverage in Jordan in 2015 was around 58%. In addition, Jordan reuses approximately 93% of its treated wastewater for agriculture and is exploring additional sources of supply, such as deep aquifers, and brackish and large-scale seawater desalination. The Red Sea-Dead Sea Water Conveyance Project is currently under a PPP tendering process. Efforts are being made to optimize the use of existing resources by reducing physical and commercial losses and improving energy efficiency in water treatment and distribution. 51 l WATER, ENERGY AND FOOD SECURITY NEXUS IN JORDAN, LEBANON AND TUNISIA The \u201cWater for Life: Water Strategy in Jordan\u201d for 2016-2025 has captured national efforts to manage the water sector and ensure optimal service levels. The strategy focuses on the limited freshwater resources and on the responsibility of all citizens, government and civil society to be partners in responsible water management, protection and sustainable use. The strategy is based on the integrated water resource management approach and includes policies and strategic directions in water and sanitation and working mechanisms with the agriculture, energy, industry, tourism and environment sectors. The key areas of the Strategy are as follows: \u2022 Integrated Water Resources Management. \u2022 Water, sewage and sanitation services. \u2022 Water for irrigation, energy and other uses. \u2022 Institutional reform. \u2022 Sector information management and monitoring. The Strategy would also address crosscutting issues of climate change adaptation; trans-boundary/ shared water resources; humanitarian-WASH sector coordination; public/private partnerships; and the economic aspects of water. The Strategy identifies the results (objectives) to be achieved and reflects the Government\u2019s national vision for the sustainable development of the water sector. Within the timeframe of this Strategy, the Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MWI), in coordination with other related institutions, will adopt a sector-wide integrated water resource planning and management approach, develop sector policies and legislation to enhance performance, equitable service provision and optimizing of available resources, initiate institutional reforms to restructure sector management, enhance fiscal discipline in cost recovery, improve internal efficiencies in sector coordination and management and build technical capacity.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "09b5e72e-8db4-4008-a3ea-626fe35de688": {"__data__": {"id_": "09b5e72e-8db4-4008-a3ea-626fe35de688", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Water, energy and food security nexus in Jordan, Lebanon and Tunisia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "de002e0d07364f00a0653d4e31e5c65b7b80f519110b36d878d0430dba5a9705"}, "2": {"node_id": "ac368db2-aa15-4842-9533-20443163e33b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3ff6ce141496f3869baef4dd09cc5b812660dac07333bd4dc18e7cd594f2785e"}}, "hash": "c6e11fab2929368e836ae3580b7a92f6abab2fb6fd66d6ef2ee50096bbe1d672", "text": "MWI will coordinate and lead the implementation of the water-related SDGs and targets in coordination with other relevant stakeholders in Jordan.

Under the new strategy, the Government is working towards a target of 84% of wastewater service coverage by 2030 and will continue expanding the sewage network. The re-use of the water from sewage plants (effluent) reached 93% in 2015 and is forecasted to reach approximately 96% in 2030. This is expected to total 373.22 million cubic meters by 2030, an increase of 150% compared to the current measurements, which were 147 million cubic meters in 2015. 4.5.2.3. Affordable and Reliable Energy During the past decades, Jordan has been able to maintain the security of it energy supply by diversifying its sources of imported energy, developing local and renewable energy sources, rationalizing energy consumption intensity and improving its efficiency in order to ensure access of energy supplies to all segments of society and development sectors at reasonable prices. Jordan currently imports 95% of its total primary energy mix, mainly crude oil and its derivatives and natural gas, used to generate 88% of the country\u2019s generated electricity. This has significantly contributed to reducing the emissions of CO2 over the previous years. ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT POLICIES AND REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK l 52 In terms of electricity, all areas in Jordan have been covered by an electricity network that meets international standards, with 99.9% of the homes receiving electricity at suitable and sustainable prices. All the electricity needs of the commercial, industrial and tourism sectors are met on a regular and affordable basis. Jordan has worked closely with neighbouring countries to strengthen regional electrical connections by linking with Syria and Egypt. As part of the country\u2019s drive to strengthen partnership with the private sector, the Government has provided incentives to the private sector to invest in infrastructure projects by establishing electricity generation projects. Build-Own-Operate (BOO) and Build-Own-Transfer (BOT) power generation projects have been expanded with international and local companies alike. Jordan aims to increase the contribution of renewable energy to its total primary energy mix to reach 10% in 2020, equivalent to about 20% of the total electricity generated. The Government is working on setting higher targets by 2030. Jordan also intends to expand the use of natural gas, which contributed 35.3% to the total energy mix in 2016. Furthermore, nuclear energy will contribute about 43% of electricity generated by 2030, which is equivalent to 22% of the total primary energy mix, leading to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The Government set the target to decrease its energy consumption from 296 to 276 kg of oil (equivalent to US$ 1,000 at constant prices) by 2030 and to strengthen its partnership with the private sector in achieving this goal. In order to further rationalize and optimize the efficiency of energy consumption intensity, Jordanian building codes (energy efficient building codes and solar energy codes) and the Jordan Green Building Manual have been issued to promote green buildings. National efforts continue to improve energy efficiency in street lighting, public buildings, commercial and industrial buildings and places of worship as well as measures for the use of energy-saving technology and equipment, including energy-saving lamps, lighting units, tools and electrical equipment according to international standards. Additionally, the Jordan Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Fund has played a supportive role by providing citizens with green financing to increase the efficiency of the energy they use and to shift towards renewable energy technologies. 4.5.2.4. Environment and Climate Change Action Climate change presents a major environmental, economic and development challenge, and the sooner it is possible to address its negative impact, the better the opportunity is to mitigate its effects at lower costs. Jordan is affected more intensely by this phenomenon rather than contributing to it, as is the case in many developing countries. The negative effects of global warming on Jordan include: an increase in temperature; expansion in areas affected by drought; the loss of some natural eco-systems; migration and habitat degradation; deforestation; a rise in the incidences of forest fires; a fluctuation in rainfall; recurring heat waves; and a decrease in the amount of water available (groundwater and surface) as a result of the decline in water flows, which, in turn, impact food security. Jordan\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions total approximately 28.7 million tons per year, or 0.06% of global emissions. The annual amount of CO2 emissions per capita amounted to approximately 4.41 tons at the end of 2016 and this figure is expected to rise to 5.59 tons by 2030.

It has already taken concrete steps to adapt and reduce the effects of climate change. 53 l WATER, ENERGY AND FOOD SECURITY NEXUS IN JORDAN, LEBANON AND TUNISIA An ambitious, evidence-based policy framework has been put in place through the National Policy on Climate Change covering various development sectors in the country. One of the most important steps taken by the Government of Jordan was the mainstreaming of objectives related to climate change within the various sectoral policies in the country, for example, within the new Water Strategy for the years 2016-2025. The Government is also accelerating its efforts to reach 10% in the renewable energy sector (of the total energy mix) by 2020. Key results have been achieved: The Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Law was adopted and enacted, fuel prices liberalized, strategies were adopted in the transport sector to promote energy efficiency, tax exemptions were provided and the use of low-carbon hybrid and electric transport vehicles was facilitated. The National Commission on Clean Development Mechanism was established, and Jordan developed its first, second and third National Communications as per the Climate Change Convention Agreement. Jordan also joined the Partnership for Market Readiness (PMR) to ensure its economy is ready for climate change. In addition, the preparation of its Biennial Update Reports (BURs) has been institutionalized. In September 2015, Jordan submitted its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) secretariat; it faces a host of challenges in achieving the commitments spelled out in its NDC document. Most importantly, the implementation of projects related to the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change and the mainstreaming of environmentally-friendly green technologies requires further efforts for access to funding. The NDC document stipulates a reduction of emissions of 14% by 2030, of which 1.5% is unconditional contributions to the availability of funding at a cost of US$ 0.5 billion, while 12.5% is contingent upon the availability of funds totalling US$ 5.2 billion. A series of measures are proposed in this regard, including: \u2022 Fundraising for the implementation of 73 projects incorporated in the NDC document in priority sectors such as energy, transport, waste management, industry, water and agriculture. \u2022 Preparation of a funding strategy for the implementation of projects included in the National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) document. \u2022 The development of a Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) System for Green House Gas (GHG) emissions. \u2022 Preparation of necessary legislation, including the development of a by-law on climate change. For the medium and long-term, the Government has adopted green economy principles and applied them at all levels. Several important steps have been taken in this regard, the most recent of which is the completion of the National Plan for Green Growth (2017-2025). This is a roadmap to encourage the public and private sectors to invest in priority areas like energy, water, transport, agriculture, tourism and waste management for the benefit of local communities by providing jobs and reducing unemployment. In its efforts to shift towards sustainable production and consumption patterns, the Government has recently concluded the National Strategy and Plan of Action for Sustainable Production and Consumption (2016-2025) for the transport, waste management and agriculture/food sectors. A draft waste management framework law was prepared which would provide a legal umbrella to increase sustainable investments in the waste management and recycling sector, where the proportion of re- processed and re-used solid waste reached 15% by the end of 2016 and is expected to increase to 40% by 2030. A number of pieces of legislation in this area, including a by-law on manufacturing, importing and trading of biodegradable plastic bags, were issued in 2016. ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT POLICIES AND REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK l 54 Finally, the Government has put in place an improved infrastructure at the hazardous waste dumping site in Swaqa and has initiated the preparations for an international tender for the establishment of comprehensive hazardous waste management units based on the principle of partnership between the public and private sectors (PPP).

However, the major challenge is the lack of data and indicators in these fields; priority will be given to addressing these data gaps. 4.5.2.5. Gender Equality The adoption of the 2030 Agenda represents an opportunity to make a tangible shift in participatory development planning approaches and mechanisms. This entails mainstreaming gender into all national development plans in the years to come. The National Higher Committee for Sustainable Development now includes the Jordanian National Commission for Women (JNCW) and representatives from civil society coalitions. Two additional working groups were formed to better align the working groups of the EDP with the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs: The Gender Equality Working Group, headed by JNCW, and the Human Rights and Freedom of Expression Working Group. The Gender Equality Working Group includes representatives of civil society, ministries and relevant governmental and national institutions, including the DoS. Together, all of these parties will ensure that the data on the indicators required to monitor the implementation of SDG5 and other goals related to gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment are properly reflected. The Gender Equality Working Group will also ensure coordination with regular reporting mechanisms established to account for commitments to international treaties and conventions. As part of the \u201cJordan 2025\u201d and the EDP covering 2016-2019, a set of strategic goals has been developed to address the empowerment of women in the following sectors: health, education, poverty, social protection, employment and labour. Over the past decade in Jordan, women\u2019s participation throughout all walks of life has steadily improved. The percentage of female judges in the judiciary system is now 18.5%. Women make up 35.5% of political party members, 37.8% of municipal councils, 21% of trade unions, 19.9% of diplomatic corps, 8% of professional syndicates, 7.9% of chambers of industry and 0.6% of chambers of commerce. Despite these achievements, there are still a number of social and political challenges facing gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment that act as barriers to changing the stereotypes related to women\u2019s roles within social, political or economic spheres. To address these challenges and further build upon progress achieved thus far, Jordan aspires to increase women\u2019s political participation in all political forums, especially in local councils. Jordan is continuously reviewing its legislative system to further empower women, ensure their access to decision-making processes and protect them from all forms of discrimination and violence. The following are some significant results to date: 55 l WATER, ENERGY AND FOOD SECURITY NEXUS IN JORDAN, LEBANON AND TUNISIA \u2022 The 2016 Electoral Law for the Lower House of Parliament raised the women\u2019s quota for seats from 10% to 11.5%. This is in addition to any seat that women could take in open competition. In 2016, the percentage of women in the upper and lower houses of parliament reached 15.4%. \u2022 The 2015 Decentralization Law allocated a 10% quota for women in the elected seats in addition to a third of the appointed seats, thus ensuring a total of 15% of seats within the Governorates\u2019 Councils are reserved for women. \u2022 The Municipalities Law allocated 25% of the Municipal Councils\u2019 seats for women. \u2022 By-law number 48 on the Alimony Advancement Fund was issued in 2015 to expedite the enforcement of alimony for the wife, children and the elderly. \u2022 The 2016 By-law number 171, regarding shelters for women at risk, was issued. \u2022 The Flexible Work By-law was issued in 2017. \u2022 The Law on Domestic Violence was also issued in 2017. In addition, a home-based business licensing legislation has been enacted that will start to contribute to increasing women\u2019s economic empowerment and formalizing women\u2019s informal businesses that are not being captured in formal economic participation statistics.

These discussion papers stress the positive contributions of women in all political, economic, social, environmental and cultural fields, recognizing women as crucial partners in sustainable development and reforms for a better future. 4.5.3. SDGs Targets and Indicators for Water and Wastewater Services The MWI, in collaboration with WAJ, expanded specific targets and indicators that are in harmony with the SDG 6 Goal that has three clear targets that build on the MDG drinking water and sanitation targets, providing continuity while expanding their scope and refining definitions. These targets and indicators will be moderated to reflect the current Jordanian water situation and adopted for use in the monitoring and evaluation mechanism in all sector-related institutions and in performance reporting (Table 17). In order to monitor the implementation of the SDGs, the availability of and access to data and statistics disaggregated by income, gender, age, race, ethnicity, migratory status, disability and geographic location should be improved. It is urgent that steps be taken to improve the quality, coverage and availability of disaggregated data to ensure that no one is left behind. Table 17.

Gender Mainstreaming in the Water Sector The women of Jordan possess a very significant body of knowledge and understanding of the social, cultural, environmental, economic and political issues and approaches in water sector management. In communities, women play a pivotal role as providers and users of water and as guardians of the living environment. Involvement of women in sector decision-making and with in-service delivery implementation will be encouraged.

Jordan\u2019s Position (Related to Climate Change) on Vulnerable Groups, with Emphasis on the Poor and Gender Mainstreaming Jordan is a signatory to and member of several key international agreements that already commit the country to gender mainstreaming. Under the UNFCCC, increased attention is paid to securing a gender perspective in international policies and initiatives. The relationship between climate change and gender and poverty is apparent in the following issues: Dependence of such vulnerable groups on natural resources that are susceptible to climate change. Twenty percent of the population depends on agriculture for their income. Agriculture vulnerability, especially in rain fed and irrigated areas, was also discussed in detail. These discussions lead to the conclusion that this 20% of population \u2013 who are also part of the poorest segment \u2013 will be most susceptible to climate change impacts. \u2022 The dependence of communities on ecosystem services (water springs, rangelands and natural vegetation in medicine, etc.) that could be affected by climate change. \u2022 A lack of assets, which hinders effective adaptation by the poor segments of population. \u2022 Settlements in high-risk areas (i.e. drought-prone) in Jordan are known to be of the lower income groups, a fact which magnifies the potential negative impact of climate change on these groups\u2019 poverty levels. \u2022 Low levels of education and professional skills that prevent members of poor households from shifting to climate-resilient sources of income. \u2022 Though gender issues are still under-investigated in Jordan, the role of women in the economy of rural areas is known to be substantial. Women in these areas are traditionally responsible for the household economy and are active in field work as well. Any negative impact of climate change will be most sensed by women. Women make crucial contributions in agricultural and rural enterprises in drylands as farmers, workers and entrepreneurs through their indigenous knowledge. Climate change issues are not directly addressed in the existing national strategies for poverty, childhood and early childhood development in Jordan. They are expected to be integrated into the upcoming Poverty Reduction Strategy. The \u201cProgramme for Mainstreaming Gender in Climate Change Effort in Jordan\u201d was prepared in 2010 (MoEnv, IUCN and GGCA). The document was endorsed by the GoJ and presented to the international community as the official stand of Jordan on the issue of gender and climate change. The document is also endorsed by the Women\u2019s National Committee and was adopted as part of the Committee\u2019s strategy.

Public and private finance, financial approaches, instruments and options and a range of public-private partnerships support government, the private sector and civil society in the implementation of the SDGs. Similarly, management that is based and owned in the community supports integration between different levels of government within a country; it also represents a grassroots bottom-up approach to the implementation of the SDGs. Projects that are based and owned in the community also assist in the implementation of those SDGs that require community engagement and involvement. Modelling and assessment tools illustrate the numerous benefits of an integrated approach to resource planning and can support broad implementation of many SDGs with the expansive focus on climate, land, energy, water and development. Most of Jordan\u2019s water is used in the agricultural sector, while agriculture contributes less than 5% to the economy and employment. Jordan\u2019s water strategy focuses on large-scale supply infrastructure projects in addition to food imports. Jordan\u2019s supply water management options are reaching their limit. 59 l WATER, ENERGY AND FOOD SECURITY NEXUS IN JORDAN, LEBANON AND TUNISIA Options include greater reliance on food imports with high virtual water values, improving the efficiency of the urban water systems including reducing the loss rate, using recycled water and treated waste water for agriculture, exploiting renewable energy for desalination, recovering heat from waste water and increasing efficiencies in all sectors. Furthermore, integrated land and water planning could preserve rain-fed agricultural land from development. Jordan\u2019s National Water Strategy supports increasing energy efficiency across water supply and treatment and using renewable energy to meet energy demand for water. A shift in focus to an integrated approach to water and resources, such as is present under the SDGs, could benefit Jordan by exploiting the interconnections. Potential benefits include: avoiding sunk costs that preclude funding other projects, improving the efficiency of the water system, improving the resilience of the economy and population and improving collaboration and cross-sectorial coherence across government. 4.6. The Lebanon Case \u2013 Energy Sector 4.6.1. General Overview of the Energy Sector - Lebanon Lebanon has embarked on the path of sustainable energy since the commitment launched in Copenhagen in 2009 by the Lebanese Government to develop renewable energy. That famous commitment was well defined in the 2010 Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) policy. The policy \u201cPaper for the Electricity Sector\u201d has become a challenge and a source of pride for the country. It is a real challenge to all concerned parties to reach the target by 2020, yet it is a real pride because this commitment has boosted sustainable energy development in Lebanon to a high priority level. The first RE power plant in Lebanon was installed back in 1924 using the hydroelectric power. The B\u00e9char\u00e9 plant was built under the French mandate, and it is still operational today, although only partially. The average available electricity production capacity (including imports) was 1,500 megawatts (MW) while the average demand was 2,000 \u2013 2,100 MW. The instantaneous peak demand in the summer of 2009 was estimated at 2,450 MW. The total energy demand in 2009 was 15,000 gigawatt-hours (GWh) although the total produced energy (including imports) was 11,522 GWh. Accordingly, the electric energy deficit in Lebanon was estimated to be 3,478 GWh. (Policy Paper for Electricity Sector, Bassil 2010). In Lebanon, electricity is basically generated from thermal and hydroelectric power plants. Approximately 7.5% of the total electricity production in 2009 was purchased from Syria (589 GWh) and Egypt (527 GWh) through regional interconnections. In addition to the deficit in electricity supply, the Lebanese electricity sector was facing several problems such as load shedding, technical losses and the aging of power plants. This situation resulted in technical and financial impacts on customers, the Government and the entire economy. The Lebanese end-users were forced to rely on diesel generators to overcome the electricity shortages (The National Renewable Energy Action Plan for the Republic of Lebanon 2016-2020). The country\u2019s primary energy imports cover essentially the following types of oil products: liquid gas, gasoline, gas oil, fuel oil, kerosene and asphalt.

On the other hand, electricity imports from both Syria and Egypt amounted to approximately 1,248,871 MWh, whereas hydroelectricity produced by the different hydropower plants on the Lebanese territory amounted to approximately 836,537 MWh (equivalent to 180,909 toe). In addition, the amount of energy produced by solar water heater installations totalled approximately 12,719 toes (The National Renewable Energy Action Plan for the Republic of Lebanon 2016-2020). Accordingly, the primary energy mix in Lebanon for the baseline year can be summarized as shown in Figure 5.

Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Potentials Lebanon has a Mediterranean climate characterized by long, hot, dry summers and short, cool, rainy winters. Moreover, Lebanon is a mostly mountainous country, east and west, separated by the fertile Beqaa Valley; a narrow coastal strip of land fronts the Mediterranean Sea. This climate and its special nature give Lebanon great potential to produce large amounts of renewable energy. 4.6.3. Policies and Strategies In Lebanon, electricity is generated from thermal and hydroelectric power plants. Approximately 7.5% of the total electricity production in 2009 was purchased from Syria (589 GWh) and Egypt (527 GWh through regional interconnections. In addition to the deficit in electricity supply, the Lebanese electricity sector was facing several problems such as load shedding, technical losses and the aging of power plants. This situation resulted in technical and financial i mpacts o n customers, the Government and the entire economy. The Lebanese end-users were forced to rely on diesel generators to overcome the electricity shortages. To overcome all these problems, the MEW published a comprehensive energy policy (the 2010 Policy Paper for the Electricity Sector) that was approved by the Council of Ministers (COM) on June 21, 2010. In addition to proposing a strategic solution to the electricity sector in Lebanon, the Policy Paper also built on the 12% commitment of RE to propose some future milestones. The year 2010 is then considered the turning point in the development of the electricity sector and, more specifically, RE in Lebanon (The National Renewable Energy Action Plan for the Republic of Lebanon 2016- 2020). The Policy Paper for the Electricity Sector covers all the aspects of the energy sector in Lebanon and includes 10 initiatives, 3 of which are dedicated to EE and RE grouped as follows: infrastructure (generation, transmission and distribution), supply and demand (fuel sourcing, RE, demand side management/EE and tariffs) and legal framework. In terms of RE, the Policy Paper focused on the development of hydropower, wind energy, solar photovoltaic (PV applications, solar water heaters and waste-to-energy. The Policy Paper for the Electricity Sector has set the strategic path for the development of RE in Lebanon. 4.6.4. Policy of Institutional Key Players 4.6.4.1. The Lebanese Centre for Energy Conservation (LCEC) LCEC is the national energy agency in charge of energy efficiency and renewable energy (EE and RE) matters in Lebanon. LCEC has succeeded in establishing itself as a focal point for energy conservation issues within the Lebanese Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW). LCEC has been in operation since 2002 and more actively, since 2005, on a project basis financed by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the Ministry of Energy Water (MEW) in addition to other bilateral donors and under the management of UNDP.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "27e36f36-93d3-412d-ac02-78c7db5f4715": {"__data__": {"id_": "27e36f36-93d3-412d-ac02-78c7db5f4715", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Water, energy and food security nexus in Jordan, Lebanon and Tunisia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fc2ca64a8fbf96c3f1570e2b87d0ca703ffb20ffaf02992a070d0e7a39be77c5"}, "2": {"node_id": "782632e9-0ede-4e80-b661-fc385614fb1e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8b60e7f39fd9f5f560d54a7febbc80b9c3000fec0828ee0a47679f5210155cf1"}}, "hash": "2d666fdedaf424ed190113a847ee0ee5f19e1828a93fabb227b9d3906675efd2", "text": "LCEC developed energy efficiency standards and labels for some household appliances (in cooperation with Libnor and IRI) and helped in the creation and support of Energy Services Companies (ESCOs), which were able to conduct LCEC-funded energy audits for companies and institutions.

Recently, LCEC and Kafalat signed a cooperation agreement to provide interest rate subsidies for energy efficiency projects. LCEC is the official representative of Lebanon in the Mediterranean Association of the National Agencies for Energy Conservation (MEDENER). It is also a founding member representing Lebanon in the Regional Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (RCREEE). LCEC is the national focal point for different EU-funded projects like MED-ENEC and MEDEMIP. LCEC is building a solid platform to become the national counterpart for the upcoming Mediterranean Solar Plan (MSP). The role of LCEC is growing with extended responsibilities for energy audits, financial incentive schemes, standards and labelling, promoting the use of renewable energy, a national energy database and the promotion of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) for carbon offsets. 4.6.4.2. \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 Du Liban (EDL) EDL produces, transmits and distributes electricity through seven thermal power plants and three hydraulic power plants. It is a public establishment with industrial and commercial operations. Its role would be to help in the implementation of all EE programmes. EDL will guarantee the recovery of credit through its electricity bills. EDL will collaborate with LCEC in conducting various surveys. Those surveys will be performed by EDL personnel when collecting electricity bill payments. 4.6.4.3. Ministry of Environment (MoE) The MoE was established in 1993 (Law 216/93) and reformed late in 2005 (Law 690/2005) to empower its mandate to preserve the environment and strengthen decentralization. Its general duties are to formulate general environmental policies and to propose measures for its implementation in coordination with various concerned Government administrations. The MoE also strives to protect natural and manmade environments in the interests of public health and welfare and fight pollution by taking preventive and remedial actions. The MoE\u203as role would be to set the emission reductions objectives by promoting efficient technologies and supporting EE project financing through the Environment Fund. 4.6.4.4. Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) MEW is a governmental department in charge of water and energy resource policy and management. It controls 21 Lebanese water authorities and the semi-autonomous public institutions in charge of providing drinking water. In May 2000, a Government decree merged the authorities into four larger public establishments. The MEW, through the energy department and LECEP, drives all activities related to RE and EE project implementation and awareness campaigns. 4.6.5. Renewable Energy Strategy The government of Lebanon aims to have 12% of its total energy needs from renewable energy sources (RES) in 2020. This means roughly the production of 1800 GWh of electricity coming from renewable energy sources by 2020 if this entire objective is met through electricity-supplying sources only (Policy Paper for Electricity Sector Bassil 2010). 63 l WATER, ENERGY AND FOOD SECURITY NEXUS IN JORDAN, LEBANON AND TUNISIA In terms of set numbers, the main target is to implement RE projects that would actually produce approximately 767 kilotons of oil equivalent (ktoe) in 2020, equivalent to 12% of the projected total electricity and heating demand in Lebanon during that year. MEW is aware that this target is challenging, but experts are also confident that aligning the efforts of all national players and international allies would lead to achieving this target. Three main paths need to be developed in order to reach this 12% target. Wind energy for electricity production would represent one major milestone with a projected share of 2.06% of the total Lebanese demand for Energy in 2020.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "207d27d9-8278-4cb8-be9a-214c8c5fa32b": {"__data__": {"id_": "207d27d9-8278-4cb8-be9a-214c8c5fa32b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Water, energy and food security nexus in Jordan, Lebanon and Tunisia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ccddb787fb8f0ead0814e1c2023f8616fe70b076a14a2dec6c4d1417d663d81a"}, "2": {"node_id": "7f01750d-7cbf-456f-a9ee-4222004c2fd7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "25bb69ac4b625e49bfe2e70bec5acd0e15d0c6a8de50c91df205b866f7aaf818"}}, "hash": "b53420bcb8dcbacca89fe06fc0769007f11c5a1af26731c2fb7f2f723cf04dfa", "text": "Solar energy, including solar photovoltaic (PV), concentrated solar power (CSP) and solar water heaters, would be another important milestone with around 4.20% of Lebanon\u2019s total annual energy demand.

The Lebanon Case \u2013 Water Sector 4.7.1. General Overview of the Water Sector - Lebanon Lebanon has relatively high per capita water endowment (1,000m3/capita, making the country the fourth best-endowed in MENA). Lebanon is already using two thirds of its available water resources, which is high by global standards. By comparison, other regions average 10-30%, and there is significant groundwater mining. There is a seasonal mismatch between supply (at its peak in the rainy winter) and demand (peaking in the hot, dry summer months). Factors exacerbating this seasonal water imbalance are the very low water storage capacity (6% of total resources, compared to the MENA average of 85%), the deficiency of water supply networks and, on the demand side, fast rising demand from the municipal and industrial sectors. These seasonal imbalances are likely to lead to chronic water shortages. Already, dry season shortages are emerging and water quality is deteriorating. If no actions are taken to improve efficiency, manage demand and increase storage capacity, the country could be dependent on mined groundwater or on high cost desalination for incremental resources in the long run. Despite Lebanon\u2019s relatively high level of income, development of water services has lagged. Water supply services are below the levels expected in a middle-income country. Although network coverage is relatively high (79%), there are big regional differences, whilst unaccounted for water averages 48%, and supply continuity is low. For example, in summer, water is supplied for as little as ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT POLICIES AND REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK l 64 three hours a day in the capital service area where over half of the population live. The poor record is due largely to the low efficiency of public expenditures and to the slow implementation of the reforms begun under Law 221 of 2000 that were intended to create the Water Establishments (WEs) as autonomous, efficient and integrated water service providers. Due to capacity and institutional constraints, WEs have not been able to apply key measures to improve water supply reliability or to improve their financial viability. Flat rate tariffs provide no incentives to consumers to save water or to the WEs to improve service delivery. The intended increased role of private capital and management has not materialized. The MoEW is responsible for the strategic planning of water resources management, including the preparation of the water master plan, regulation and conservation of surface and groundwater resources and design and implementation of large projects and dams. The MoEW also has the mandate to supervise the WEs in the planning and formation of their strategies for water monitoring and distribution. Until recently, there has been neither an accepted overall water resource master plan nor a strategy for development of water storage. MoEW has had weak capacity in water resources planning, allocation and regulation. The regulation of groundwater abstraction, including the issue of permits for well drilling, is currently not enforced; a large number of wells are reported as illegal. Little has so far been done to anticipate the effects of climate change on water resources or on water supply and irrigation; similarly, little has been done to plan for adaptation and mitigation. Meanwhile, demand has not been moderated by management measures such as regulation and pricing. An expensive but poorly sequenced investment program and absence of a viable business model for wastewater have left 92% of Lebanon\u2019s sewage running untreated into watercourses and the sea. Responsibility for irrigation was supposed to be transferred to the WEs, but this has not happened. Also, proposals to decentralize management to user associations and to increase cost recovery have not been implemented. More than half or the irrigation schemes lack adequate O&M. Returns to water ($/drop) are low, and the country is missing opportunities to increase production and trade in high value crops. Underlying these poor sub-sectoral performances is the sector-wide issue of accountability. Reforms initiated under Law 221 of 2000 were designed to increase accountability between public agencies and between WEs and customers.

Reciprocal accountability between WEs and clients remains weak as WEs are not adequately empowered to improve service levels. Overall, the water sector is delivering poor services at a high fiscal and household cost. The WEs have to overcome tough economic and socio-political challenges if they are to become efficient and accountable service providers. In the meantime, water sector inefficiencies (particularly low collection of tariffs and high-water losses) and environmental damage are costing the economy the equivalent of almost 3% of GDP annually. 65 l WATER, ENERGY AND FOOD SECURITY NEXUS IN JORDAN, LEBANON AND TUNISIA 4.7.2. Water Policies in Lebanon The water sector in Lebanon has various laws and regulations which date back to the Ottoman Empire and the French Mandate. Before the creation of the Lebanese state in 1920, the water sector was managed based on norms and customs according to each village. Organizing their own water usage, each village ensured a balanced and fair distribution among residents to prevent conflicts. However, driven by the growing demand for water, a franchise was issued by Ottoman Sultan to meet the citizens\u2019 needs; the first of these needs was to drag water from the Naher El Kalb River to Beirut. This issuance initiated the transition to water management within a general administrative structure. As of 1920, a new legal phase began in Lebanon with the issuance of Law 144, dated June 10, 1925. This law related to the public domain and decision 320, dated May 26, 1926, which addressed the protection of public water and its use. The first clear water policy that was backed up with legislation and regulations was law 221 issued May 26, 2000. This law organized the water sector by addressing its institutional setup; however, some issues related to water management were not solved, including the overlap of responsibilities and the understaffing of stakeholders (MOE/UNDP/ ECODIT, 2011). In 2012, the Council of Ministers (CoM) endorsed the National Water Sector Strategy (NWSS) prepared by the Ministry of Energy and Water in 2010. The strategy presents a detailed road map for improving water conditions and service delivery in the country and is presented in the following section. In general, water in Lebanon is regarded as a public domain, and its sale for profit is prohibited except for three cases: \u2022 Rainwater harvesting by individuals. \u2022 Resources extracted from a private land which do not come from a river (under a certain limit). \u2022 Water for which rights were acquired before 1925 (Hayek, 2009). 4.7.3. Water Strategies in Lebanon The mission of the National Water Sector Strategy, which was prepared by the MoEW in 2010 and enacted by the Lebanese CoM under decision No.2 dated March 2012, is to ensure water supply, irrigation and sanitation services over all the Lebanese territory on a continuous basis and at optimal service levels with a commitment to environmental, economic and social sustainability. The NWSS has seven main objectives: \u2022 Maximizing the potential and improving the quality of surface water resources. \u2022 Improving the management and protection of groundwater resources. \u2022 Fulfilling deficits through groundwater and/or surface water. \u2022 Ensuring proper and continuous access to a high quality water supply. \u2022 Providing adequate quantities and quality of water for irrigation. \u2022 Increasing coverage of wastewater collection networks and treatment capacities. \u2022 Optimizing current wastewater treatment processes and sludge disposal. ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT POLICIES AND REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK l 66 The strategy presents initiatives which fall under three headlines: \u2022 Production: provision of additional water resources. \u2022 Conveyance: water supply transmission and distribution. \u2022 Wastewater: wastewater collection and treatment. 4.7.4.

Legislative Gap As identified by The Way Forward to Safeguard Water in Lebanon (2016) and the above analysis, there is a clearly-fragmented legislative gap with weak enforcement. Lebanon has a good baseline of laws and regulations related to the water sector, but they are poorly implemented and enforced. This results from the existing overlap of roles and responsibilities between and within institutions. The contributing factors to this are: \u2022 Lack of operational decrees for existing laws and long processes or delays in ratification of laws. \u2022 Weak legal prosecution and absence of a single entity that is responsible for the enforcement and follow-up of violations. \u2022 Absence of accountability mechanisms and the presence of corruption within the monitoring agencies. \u2022 Political deadlock. \u2022 Deficit in human and financial resources in institutions related to the water sector, mainly primary stakeholders. \u2022 Poor coordination between relevant ministries. 4.7.7. Recommendations for Reform and Enforcement The issuance of the stated operational decrees referred to in Law 221/2002 Article 9, could be considered a first step towards legislative reform. These decrees would expand each institution\u2019s roles and responsibilities in relation to planning and implementation of water resources policies. The adoption of a basin management approach, which will be a form of decentralized resource management. The creation of a national water board that includes all involved executive and legislative governmental bodies. Most importantly, this board shall overlook activities in relation to water resource and sector management and shall be interconnected and represented within the anti-corruption committee. Activation of existing mechanisms and institutions which promote and regulate accountability and transparency in the public sector is urgently needed. Based on Article 19 of law 4517/1972, public institutions are under the obligation of submitting annual reports of their work (performance, financial audits and progress reports). 4.8.

Land dedicated to agriculture has been declining over the past twenty years, to below 11% in 2011 (World Bank, 2013). Overall, the agriculture sector (including livestock) is responsible for almost 5% of Lebanon\u2019s GDP. Lebanon\u2019s climate is typical of the Mediterranean region with four distinct seasons that encompass a rainy period followed by a dry period. According to the PRECIS model, temperatures by 2040 will increase from around 1\u00b0C on the coast to 2\u00b0C in the mainland, and by 2090 they will be 3.5\u00b0C to 5\u00b0C higher, respectively. Rainfall is also projected to decrease by 10% by 2040 and by 25-45% by the year 2090, compared to the present. This combination of significantly less wet and substantially warmer conditions will result in an extended hot and dry climate (MoE, 2011). Agriculture is one of the most vulnerable economic sectors to climate change as it is directly affected by changes in temperature and rainfall. Limited availability of water and land resources in Lebanon, together with increasing urbanization, adds challenges for its future development. In general, the direct effects of climate on agriculture are mainly related to lower crop yields or failure owing to drought, frost, hail, severe storms and floods; loss of livestock in harsh winter conditions and frosts; and other losses owing to short-term extreme weather events. 69 l WATER, ENERGY AND FOOD SECURITY NEXUS IN JORDAN, LEBANON AND TUNISIA ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT POLICIES AND REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK l 70 Agriculture in Lebanon is the highest consumer of available freshwater, consuming nearly 60%, while the remaining 40% is distributed amongst domestic use (29%) and the industrial sector (11%) (MoE/UNDP/ ECODIT, 2011). The energy sector is able to meet 77% of the total demand while the remaining 23% is provided by private generators at the local level. Only 4.5% of energy in Lebanon is generated by hydropower plants while 95% is generated by thermal plants (Ministry of Energy and Water, 2010a). Lebanon is a net food importing country where 20% of the total demand for food is produced locally and the rest is imported. Nearly 44% of processed food, 30% of livestock and 16% of crops are imported (MOA, 2009). The animal production sector is considered the mainstay of the Southern, Northern and Beqaa rural economy and has a key impact on household well-being and poverty alleviation due to: \u2022 The generation of cash income by sales of live animals and animal products. \u2022 Livestock being one of the main users of manpower in rural areas as there are a few opportunities for industrial employment in these areas. \u2022 Most of the low income rural families in rural Lebanon relying on livestock for food security, nutrition and economic status. The agricultural sector faces institutional, policy, technological and financial resource constraints, resulting in the sector\u2019s low performance. The convergence of all these constraints results in: \u2022 Small and fragmented land holdings (70 percent of the total farm holders have an area of less than one hectare and cultivate less than 20 percent of their total cropping area); farmers\u203a low income as a result of low productivity; inequality in ownership and access to productive assets; rural poverty; increased vulnerability of rural women; and decreasing food security. \u2022 Lack of farmers\u203a access to infrastructure (irrigation networks, agricultural roads, marketing outlets for agricultural and agro-processed products). \u2022 Widespread use of foreign labour. \u2022 Rural-urban migration. \u2022 Insufficient knowledge of modern techniques and environmentally-friendly practices. \u2022 Excessive use of pesticides. \u2022 High cost of production resulting from high costs of inputs, labour and energy. \u2022 Degradation of natural resources. \u2022 Low competitiveness of agricultural products coupled with an increase in the agricultural trade deficit. A rapid analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats to Lebanon\u2019s agriculture sector shows that (Lebanon Agriculture Public Expenditure Review Note, World Bank, 2009): Strengths include adequate arable land; a Mediterranean climate suitable for early season fruit and vegetable production; an entrepreneurial local population and Lebanese diaspora; and a strategic location between Europe and the Gulf states.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e54a9a33-cdd4-499e-9283-57caf39a171b": {"__data__": {"id_": "e54a9a33-cdd4-499e-9283-57caf39a171b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Water, energy and food security nexus in Jordan, Lebanon and Tunisia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "de1e82ecc313f54cdda9144bec44144a5e5b166122354d60562d1cfc622b2ca6"}, "2": {"node_id": "ddc99a04-b224-4e37-a2b5-871ac2d24e75", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cd8bd8cebbcf45ebe0ad86a50c75b3c6687735e74f965562643f1e05f6ccb0ba"}}, "hash": "a32e8277b1e1beb0903e774132664aa958b4f84f43833b99875f3bf45cf8a827", "text": "It also has sufficient water resources to position its high-value fresh and processed horticultural crops for domestic consumption and export.

Government Planning and Initiatives for Agriculture The MoA is the institution responsible for setting the agricultural strategic framework, as well as formulating and implementing policies and programmes for the development of the agriculture sector. The MoA is also responsible for developing a suitable legal and regulatory framework and enhancing infrastructure development to promote investment and improve agricultural production and marketing. MoA also plays an important role in the management of natural resources of the country (agricultural land, irrigation water, forests, fisheries, pasturelands) and contributes to rural development. Recent initiatives by the Government of Lebanon (GoL) to strengthen agriculture have included the development of the 2004 Agriculture Strategy, which was prepared with FAO and the World Bank, and the 2006 Agricultural Strategy Implementation programme. However, the strategy and the programme could not be implemented, as priorities shifted toward the relief and rehabilitation efforts of the sector which was severely affected by the July 2006 war. The past two years have been marked by further major developments in support of agricultural and rural development. In January 2010, the MOA issued an updated Strategic Plan 2010\u20132014 and, with assistance from the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), will revise the implementation plan to reflect the new Strategic Plan. The Strategic Plan 2010\u20132014 revolves around eight pillars which set forth interventions at the central and local levels, using a combination of programmes, projects and policy measures aimed at containing the cost of production and improving quality of Lebanese agricultural products. These pillars are as follows: \u2022 Updating the regulatory/policy framework. \u2022 Developing MOA\u2019s new organizational chart and improving coordination with the public, private and civil society sectors. \u2022 Upgrading the agriculture infrastructure. \u2022 Re-activating extension services. \u2022 Enforcing control over all agricultural products and inputs. ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT POLICIES AND REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK l 72 \u2022 Developing value chains that focus on better quality, production, marketing and export of agricultural products. \u2022 Establishing a credit scheme for SMEs. \u2022 Managing natural resources (water, forests ...). In early 2011, the Government launched its cross-sectoral National Social Development Strategy formulated with the contribution of several line ministries. The Strategy aims to achieve an integrated development through better and more equitable provision of social services and an expansion of socio-economic activities. A National Ten-Year Strategy for Women\u2019s Affairs in Lebanon (2011-2021) was formulated in 2011 and a National Action Plan is currently being developed. The Strategy identifies twelve objectives including: combating poverty among women and giving special attention to the eradication of poverty in general; promoting the participation of women in the economic sector; enhancing the contribution of women to environmental protection; strengthening the capacity of institutions concerned with women\u2019s issues at the national level; reinforcing the partnership between The National Commission for Lebanese Women and public-sector departments, institutions, and civil-society organizations; and introducing gender mainstreaming in all fields. The MoA has embarked on updating the sector\u2019s legal and regulatory framework and reinforcing control on agricultural products. In 2010, the MoA created 30 national technical committees. These committees later led to the development of a platform where all actors (public, private, civil society) can interact as well as exchange information and experience. Main challenges facing the implementation of the MoA strategy include the mobilization of adequate financial resources and development of the strategy\u2019s implementation and technical capacities. This could be achieved by exploring innovative approaches to building stronger partnerships with donors, NGOs and other economic actors. 4.8.3. Agricultural and Food Policies 4.8.3.1.

This input from the French Government was included in a comprehensive agreement known as the French Protocol. The FAO project was focused on a useful agricultural census, the EU project on agriculture policy and planning and the French assistance with professional organizations in fruits, vegetables and vine production. Surprisingly, public expenditures on the agricultural sector have been low, which indicates the absence of agricultural policies. The current food policy objectives of the Lebanese Government are focused on securing a steady stream of reasonably-priced produce for the Lebanese consumer and supporting local producers with their production and marketing efforts. The policy was also created to facilitate the smooth transition to the new state of agriculture as envisioned by the agreements entered into with the EU and other international relevant entities. 73 l WATER, ENERGY AND FOOD SECURITY NEXUS IN JORDAN, LEBANON AND TUNISIA 4.8.3.2. Formulation of Agricultural and Food Policy The government considered undertaking structural reforms that further liberalize the economy by modernizing existing laws, minimizing restrictions and simplifying procedures, which will promote private investment, enhance public services, improve productivity, facilitate the process of privatization and render the economy more competitive. Several measures were taken to modernize the laws and enhance the legal framework. The measures most relevant to agriculture are: \u2022 A new, WTO-compatible Customs Law was enacted in June 2001 which, among other things, simplifies procedures and introduces modern information technology for customs declarations and international standards for clearance. \u2022 Imports of oil were liberalized in 2001 and this is somewhat of a positive respite from the upward- spiralling cost of oil. \u2022 Licensing requirements for trade are being streamlined to allow exports and imports to flow without hindrance. 4.8.3.3. Agricultural Policy Instruments Being Used Policy instruments in Lebanese agriculture have been supportive through direct payments, price guarantees and subsidies. The problem has been that there was no comprehensive approach to agriculture. Important matters, like the organization of marketing activities in the form of associations and boards, never really received the attention they deserved. The ongoing implementation of agreements in the sector with the EU and GAFTA is forcing such issues to the forefront. As a result, the exports of Lebanese agricultural goods are increasing. Subsidized loans have long been a favourite instrument of the Government. These are used to promote the activities of farmers and form professional organizations focused on fresh fruits, vegetables and vine production. Another agricultural policy instrument of the Lebanese Government is the more traditional one of supporting subsidies of specific a gricultural p roducts. W heat and tobacco are classic products that have enjoyed this preferential treatment for years in Lebanon. Olive oil has also received this treatment, while fresh produce has not. The Higher Commission for Relief, a body that is under the authority of the Council of Ministers, is authorised to provide special relief and development support. 4.8.4.

The first strategy paper tackled the MoA\u2019s problems, including legal issues structural improvements within the ministry, enhanced relations with other governmental and non-governmental institutions and organizations and renovations and infrastructure planning to reduce trade-offs across sectors. This first strategy also addressed the monitoring of agriculture practices, raising the standards of product quality, encouraging small and medium enterprises through micro finance loans and protecting the natural resources (soil, forests, biodiversity and land management) within its scope (MoA, 2009). As for the second strategy, it has been finalized and is awaiting approval from the CoM. Like the first strategy, this one has eight pillars, but they are more elaborate and detailed. Some of these pillars were carried over from the previous strategy, such as improved food quality and the protection of the natural resources. This strategy, however, includes the concept of good governance, the development of the ministerial capacities and the improved funding.

The Lebanon Case \u2013 Climate Change Relate to Water, Energy and Food (WEF) 4.9.1. General Overview Lebanon is a developing country with scarce water resources and high population density in the coastal areas. Lebanon is already facing and will continue to face several challenges as a result of climate change (Second National Communication, SNC, 2011). According to the climate models, temperatures are expected to increase by around 1\u00b0C on the coast and 2\u00b0C in the mainland by 2040, and by 2090, they will be 3.5\u00b0C and 5\u00b0C higher, respectively. At the same time, rainfall is projected to decrease by 10-20% by 2040 and 25-45% by the year 2090. This will lead to substantial detrimental effects in a number of areas. Lebanon has a diverse natural environment, including coastal, agricultural, forest and mountainous areas; many of these areas have unique biodiversity and ecosystems that are sensitive to climate change. 4.9.2. Climate Change Adaptation Related to Water, Energy and Food (WEF) Lebanon\u2019s electricity infrastructure needs to cope with increased demand for cooling. Temperature increases are expected to cause approximately 2,400-5,200 additional deaths annually by 2030; the public health sector needs to address this issue (SNC, 2011). Tourism needs to adjust to rising sea levels, warmer temperatures and shrinking snow cover in the mountains resulting from an increase in temperature. Lebanon\u2019s arid / semi-arid climate makes it poor in terms of water resource availability and vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The projected changes in rainfall will put tremendous pressure on national water security and create other negative effects in sectors such as agriculture, where around 70% of the available water is used for irrigation. Given the projected decrease in precipitation, there is an immediate need to increase water resources by designing and commissioning dams and hill lakes as well as artificially re-charging the groundwater. In addition, there is a need to optimize the use of current water resources through the rehabilitation of the existing network and the installation of water meters. Lebanon is already undertaking major initiatives to ensure the availability of affordable water for domestic, industrial and agricultural use, in line with the National Water Sector Strategy (2012). However, more technical, financial and capacity building support and technology transfer is needed to optimize water storage, 75 l WATER, ENERGY AND FOOD SECURITY NEXUS IN JORDAN, LEBANON AND TUNISIA water use efficiency, irrigation systems and the reuse of wastewater. To reduce these adverse impacts on environmental, economic and social systems, Lebanon will promote climate change adaptation by mainstreaming and building institutional capacity. The National Sustainable Development Strategy, which is currently being prepared in cooperation with the Council of Ministers, clearly highlights the importance of adaptation and points out necessary action in nearly all of its sectoral chapters. The objective is to provide security and well-being for the Lebanese people while increasing the resilience to climate change. Yet climate change is one of Lebanon\u2019s many national development challenges. Other such challenges include population growth, rapid urbanization and geopolitical location. Addressing these issues should be pursued simultaneously to avoid working in silos; this is possible by collaborating with multiple government ministries and agencies, the private sector and other relevant stakeholders. Lebanon has already made progress in mainstreaming climate change adaptation into the biodiversity (National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan draft, NBSAP, 2015), water (National Water Sector Strategy, 2012), forestry (National Forest Plan, NFP, 2015) and agriculture (Ministry of Agriculture Strategy, 2015) sectors. The key actions included in these strategies are listed in Table 20 below. The actions reflect Lebanon\u2019s priorities given the current understanding of expected climate impacts. Sectoral strategies will be assessed regularly as part of the national development process and/or when new information about climate change and impacts become available. Furthermore, Lebanon aims to reach land degradation neutrality by 2030, in line with the recommendations in the UNCCD framework. This has recently been agreed to by the Committee on Land Degradation and Desertification, led by the Ministry of Agriculture.

The Lebanon Case \u2013 Sustainable Development Related to Water, Energy and Food (WEF) and Climate Change 4.10.1. General Overview This analysis is based on the \u201cNational Report to the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (RIO+20) - Sustainable Development in Lebanon: Status and Vision, 2012\u201d The path to sustainable development in Lebanon since 1992 has been fraught with difficulties and challenges, both external and internal. Externally, several wars have eroded national resources and Lebanon\u2019s ability to plan for and manage sustainable development challenges. Three devastating wars with Israel (1996, 1999 and 2006) displaced thousands of people and also destroyed homes and primary infrastructure on a large scale. Lasting 35 days, the war in 2006 also caused the worst environmental oil spill in Lebanon\u2019s history causing $200 million in oil-related damages. These events altered national priorities and often delayed sustainable development initiatives by siphoning away government (and donor) resources for emergency response and reconstruction efforts. Wars and related damages have also aggravated poverty issues and delayed social reform programmes. Lebanon\u2019s path towards sustainable development was also derailed by regional factors. In particular, the global financial crisis, partly brought about by a failing real estate model, affected the Lebanese economy and distorted its real estate market. Whereas real estate crashed in the region, the Lebanese real estate market experienced unprecedented growth and kick-started a construction frenzy. Soaring real estate prices are impacting economic sectors and have severely limited the ability of the Lebanese people, particularly youth and newlyweds, to buy or even rent a home. 77 l WATER, ENERGY AND FOOD SECURITY NEXUS IN JORDAN, LEBANON AND TUNISIA Civil society organizations contend that the government\u2019s piecemeal approach to development, usually focused on individual economic sectors separately (tourism, agriculture, industry, etc.) and/ or basic services (health, education, transport), is counter-productive and cannot achieve sustainable development goals. Rather, Lebanon should approach development by looking at all sectors in a holistic and comprehensive manner, by understanding societal aspirations and by strengthening national identity. For example, instead of focusing exclusively on free trade agreements (bilateral, regional and multilateral), including WTO accession (in progress since 1998), the GoL should articulate a national strategy for developing productive sectors (including agriculture) and services. Rather than spending time and resources supporting a specific subsector in agriculture (e.g., tobacco, dairy), the GoL should set out a comprehensive framework for revamping the agricultural sector and mobilize the necessary resources to implement it through inter-ministerial coordination. 4.10.2. Gender Maternal health has improved since 1993 with a decrease in maternal mortality from 140/100,000 live births in 1993 to 23/100,000 live births in 2009 (UNDP, 2010).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a2f90d71-b82f-4a71-a47c-4082769c8505": {"__data__": {"id_": "a2f90d71-b82f-4a71-a47c-4082769c8505", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Water, energy and food security nexus in Jordan, Lebanon and Tunisia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e0dd10a5268f035ba1ed10f8d3c520b5d4be1e8b551d0872cc35065d1c52ad69"}, "2": {"node_id": "cc0eaf43-eec9-4008-8aa3-c660f00f0000", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fcd48d7e8f9fd7acdccfa20b3c03f98e9cd9eafd8140141e2752dbe16607d346"}}, "hash": "bf14076ec9d93dfaff6bb6198a5c3aa8c993f7c15c38d2adda855e706eb4c9c9", "text": "Women represent almost half of the Lebanese population but only 21% are economically active, mostly working in services, finance and insurance (CAS, 2009).

For example, women represent less than 4% of the parliament\u2019s 128 seats. The Council of Ministers (COM) does not fare better. Two women were appointed ministers for the first time in 2004 but the current cabinet is exclusively made up of men. The need to introduce a quota system for women in the new electoral law is urgently needed to increase women\u2019s participation in the political life. Although Lebanese women enjoy a better status than other Arab women, several issues hinder their progress in the Lebanese society. For example, Lebanese women who are married to foreigners cannot pass their citizenship to their children. Gender is respected in the Lebanese Constitution and in many national policies. However, the need to articulate a national vision on how to improve the status of women in all aspects of society and to mainstream gender issues (as declared in Lebanon\u2019s 1926 Constitution) in social development is urgent. Gender mainstreaming positions women and men at the heart of policy-making. It can also improve governance based on diversity and equity. An immediate step in this direction is to combat gender-based violence. In 1995, the GoL established the National Commission for Lebanese Women (NCLW) as the official national mechanism responsible for realizing women\u2019s advancement and gender equality in Lebanon. The commission developed a 10-Year National Strategy for Women and is currently being reviewed by the COM. In 1996, Lebanon acceded to and ratified the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) but has yet to sign the Optional Protocol which allows individual women, or groups of women, to submit claims of violations of rights protected under the Convention to the Committee (the body that monitors States parties\u2019 compliance with the Convention). A Women\u2019s Affairs Division at the Ministry of Social Affairs was established to monitor the implementation of the said UN Convention (and other Conventions) and formulate programmes which respond to the needs of women by improving and strengthening their capacities; the Department proposes budgets to implement these programmes. ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT POLICIES AND REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK l 78 Local and regional NGOs are also promoting women\u2019s participation in public life and implementing awareness campaigns to counter stereotypical attitudes in the country. Recently, one of Lebanon\u2019s commercial banks launched the \u201cWE\u201d initiative to empower women to become social and economic entrepreneurs in the workplace and wider community and to facilitate their entry in the Global Banking Alliance for Women. 4.10.3. Water Two-thirds of Lebanon\u2019s surface area is covered with Karstic formations characterized by springs, caves and sinkholes. They make up a unique hydrogeological system resulting in aquifers that are highly productive but extremely vulnerable to water contamination. Lebanon\u2019s water sector faces great challenges including unsustainable water management practices, population growth, urbanization and pollution. The long-term effects of climate change (potentially reduced precipitation and water availability) cannot be understated. Water demand in the country varies depending on source. Assumptions range from 1,473 to 1,530 million m3 per year (WB, 2009 & MOEW, 2010, respectively). Available water, defined as \u201cpresent renewable resources per capita,\u201d is just over 1,100m3/capita/year, dangerously near the international benchmark of 1,000m3/capita/year. Falling below this benchmark would indicate water resource stress (WB, 2009). The GoL is fully aware that meeting the country\u2019s water demand over the medium- and long-term poses a significant challenge to its work. Although Lebanon is blessed with a favourable water regime - the country has the highest average annual rainfall of any country in the Middle East: 661 mm/year (FAO, 2012) - water supply is a serious problem almost everywhere in the country. It should be noted that Lebanon does not have the capacity to measure the volume of snow cover with any degree of confidence, but some institutions are conducting research related to snow cover and snowline. Total available water in Lebanon, including rivers and springs, storage dams and groundwater is estimated at 2,000-2,700 million m3 per year. This exceeds projected water demand of about 1,800 million m3 in 2035, but widespread pollution and substandard water infrastructure are restricting the Government\u2019s ability to meet water demand in the future.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5fe62dc-a0f4-49c7-94dd-905ca4bcdb2f": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5fe62dc-a0f4-49c7-94dd-905ca4bcdb2f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Water, energy and food security nexus in Jordan, Lebanon and Tunisia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "af7ed8127fd99884163bad793ff3fda20f890cf371d488aa90318d856c01e634"}, "2": {"node_id": "40e90b89-3de8-4d57-a48e-3434a1a77ecf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8f583da2ef6375b5a67e510054be2f6e0d4321a64d9b02ccfc76aa056cd32498"}}, "hash": "c49b8f8d7da3dc81f5d774cb833add5d031ba3f1b4e9853fc6131a0e58bd16d7", "text": "Irrigation is the largest water consumer in the country (61%) with low efficiency as open channels still constitute the majority of the networks (MOEW, 2010).

Contamination occurs from raw sewage overflow, septic tanks and leaking sewer lines. Also, according to CAS, only 52% of buildings in 2004 were connected to sewage networks with significantly low treatment levels (4%). This means that at least 48% rely on septic tanks; most septic tanks are permeable or deliberately drained to prevent overflow. Nationwide, the highest rate of sewage connection was recorded in Beirut (96%), and the lowest was recorded in Batroun-North Lebanon (1%), followed by Bent Jbeyl-South Lebanon (4%). In the absence of industrial wastewater treatment plants, most industrial wastewater is discharged into the environment with little or no prior treatment, either directly into rivers and streams or through municipal wastewater networks. Many river systems receive raw sewage resulting in dangerously high biological loads. The Litani River is probably the most publicized case of river pollution. Since 2000, the Ministries of Interior and Municipalities, Energy and Water and Environment as well as the Council for Development and Reconstruction have invested millions of dollars in solid waste management, wastewater treatment and land use management (agriculture) in and around the Litani river and watershed to prevent and reduce pollution of the Qaroun Lake (the river estuary). Unfortunately, severe pollution problems persist today. In 2011, a business plan for combating pollution of the Qaroun Lake was prepared by MOE-UNDP. The $150 million business plan was presented to the Parliamentarian Committee for the Environment and discussions are underway to find sources of finance. 79 l WATER, ENERGY AND FOOD SECURITY NEXUS IN JORDAN, LEBANON AND TUNISIA In 1999, to protect and increase water resources (Principle 18 of Agenda 21), the Ministry of Energy and Water (MOEW) developed a 10-Year Plan to build 17 dams and lakes across the country, which would capture approximately 650 Mm3 of water per year (Comair, 2010). Dams and lakes envisioned under the Plan were mainly for drinking water and to a lesser extent irrigation. The 10- Year Plan was slated to be substantially completed by 2010. To date, only the Chabrouh Dam in the upper Kesrouan area (Mount Lebanon) was completed at the cost of approximately $65 million for a 9 million m3 capacity. Despite technical challenges, budget overruns, construction delays and now growing evidence of leaks (which even if unplanned help replenish aquifers), the dam represents a much-needed water reservoir for the upper Kesrouan region and should serve as a case study for future dam projects in the country. Very little progress has been made towards building the remaining 16 dams. However, in 2010, the MOEW developed a National Water Sector Strategy to revamp the water sector in the country (described in Section VI under aspirations in the water sector). 4.10.3.1. Water \u2013 Balancing Supply and Demand In 2010, the MOEW developed a National Water Sector Strategy (NWSS). The strategy, approved two years later by the COM (March 9, 2012), provides a general overview of the water sector and the legal and institutional framework, presents projections of how planned resource augmentation will meet future demand (1,800 million m3 in 2035) and identifies US$ 7.7 billion worth of capital investment for reshaping the water sector (infrastructure and management). This strategy aims to significantly improve water supply, irrigation and sanitation services over the Lebanese territory with a commitment to environmental, economic and social responsibility.

ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT POLICIES AND REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK l 80 Industrial wastewater treatment plants are still missing in the country and industrial wastewater is discharged into the environment with little (small-scale treatment plant within the industry) or no prior treatment, either directly into rivers and streams or through wastewater networks. To reduce industrial pollution, the MOE and the CDR, with a grant from GIZ/EFL, prepared a Policy Paper on Industrial Wastewater Compliance and Management. The Policy Paper provides a complete analysis of the legal framework impacting industrial wastewater treatment and disposal in Lebanon and formulates policy recommendations to improve and enforce effluent discharge standards. This paper will guide the design of the Lebanon Pollution Abatement Project (LEPAP). 4.10.4. Energy \u2013 Improving Energy Sustainability Lebanon is a net energy importer (97% of its energy needs is imported) and has been hit hard by the global energy crisis. Poor energy planning since the end of the Civil War has had a compounding effect on Lebanon\u2019s energy sector. So far, Lebanon has been relying heavily on High Emission Factor Fuels (HEFF) or \u201cdirty\u201d fuels such as light (mainly Gasoil and Diesel) and heavy fuel oil in its primary energy mix. Although Lebanon is a signatory to the UNFCCC, this poses no requirements for decreasing national GHG emissions. The GoL has submitted national inventories of GHGs for baseline years 1994 and 2004; these reports quantify the carbon footprint of various economic activities, assess Lebanon\u2019s vulnerability to Climate Change and propose adaptation and mitigation strategies to reduce GHG emissions. Surprisingly, the building sector is the largest energy consumer, followed by the transport sector. The following sections describe Lebanon\u2019s aspirations and current planning to alleviate energy poverty in the country. In 2010, the Ministry of Energy and Water developed the much-anticipated Policy Paper for the Electricity Sector which seeks to redress the country\u2019s ailing electricity sector by 2015. The policy paper includes 10 strategic initiatives to improve sector performance, improve supply/demand (fuel sourcing and renewable energy, including wind, biomass, solar, hydro, etc.) and revamp the legal and institutional framework for energy production. The paper proposes a battery of short-, medium- and long-term measures to remedy the sector\u2019s problems, starting with increased power generation to cover the existing gap (e.g., leasing electricity-generating ships, rehabilitation of existing power plants and construction of new power plants). The policy paper envisions that Lebanon\u2019s power generation capacity will reach 4,000 MW in 2014 and 5,000 MW after 2015. The Policy Paper also aims to switch the energy mix from polluting fuels to Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), increase electricity generation efficiency and promote renewable and alternative energy sources. To implement the switch, Lebanon would need to build an off-shore LNG terminal at Selaata or Zahrani and connect all the power stations in the country with a land (or subsea) pipeline extending from Beddawi (North Lebanon) to Sour (South Lebanon). The pipeline will follow the railway track to limit expropriation costs and would eventually also feed industrial, commercial and residential facilities (city gas). It could in the future also support a Natural Gas Vehicle initiative. The energy switch would not only make the energy mix in Lebanon more acceptable (cleaner) but also more economical. One year in the making, the Policy Paper was formally approved by the Council of Ministers in June 2011. The Lebanese COM agreed in March 2012 to lease power- generating ships to produce 270 MW for a period of three years and to build 1,500 MW power plants. To ensure environmental sustainability, the policy paper would require a full Strategic Environmental Assessment. 81 l WATER, ENERGY AND FOOD SECURITY NEXUS IN JORDAN, LEBANON AND TUNISIA 4.10.4.1.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eb58cd33-9a8d-43a0-9c8e-a54f807c903d": {"__data__": {"id_": "eb58cd33-9a8d-43a0-9c8e-a54f807c903d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Water, energy and food security nexus in Jordan, Lebanon and Tunisia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "54b3f9b7b6e92baede3fdfec91e31f770af369bef69f2c5ba551b10acbb2fa52"}, "2": {"node_id": "8891eab2-63d8-40a7-b7bf-de090ef3076d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cc6c9d5a208b6c5fbed0641e3079ec53c03af87845295b3131f7c5586632f4f3"}}, "hash": "55e0e0f7aa340232024ddd6dfa3506a7692c521b717058b6138000aa8a612847", "text": "Renewable Energy Pledge The GoL has voluntarily committed itself in Copenhagen (2009) to increase renewable energy shares to 12% of the total electrical energy consumption by 2020.

Legislation is currently being considered to introduce Feed-in Tariffs (FIT) mechanisms at EDL. Feed-in tariffs imply that consumers will be able to generate power and inject it into the grid at a preferential rate. However, allowing the private sector to invest in the energy sector requires amending Law 462 (dated 02/09/2002). FIT will go a long way towards removing economic barriers to using PV and wind turbines. Without FIT systems, there is little incentive for consumers to produce their own clean electricity from clean energy sources. Another clean electricity production incentive tool is net metering. Piloted in Lebanon in February 2012, net metering allows consumers to inject power that is generated at their premises into the grid. Like FIT, the consumer will be charged the net balance of electric energy supplied and consumed. 4.10.4.2. Energy Efficiency In February 2012, the COM approved the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP). The plan describes 14 initiatives: \u2022 Banning the import of incandescent lamps to Lebanon. \u2022 Adoption of the energy conservation law and institutionalization of the LCEC. \u2022 Promotion of decentralized PV and wind applications in the residential and commercial sectors. \u2022 SWH for buildings and institutions. \u2022 Design and implementation of a national strategy for efficient and economic public street lighting. \u2022 Electricity generation from wind power. \u2022 Electricity generation from solar energy (PV). \u2022 Hydropower for electricity generation. \u2022 Geothermal, waste-to-energy and other technologies. \u2022 Building codes for Lebanon. \u2022 Financing mechanisms and incentives. \u2022 Awareness and capacity building. \u2022 Paving the way for energy audits and ESCO business. \u2022 Promotion of energy-efficient equipment. ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT POLICIES AND REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK l 82 4.10.4.3. Energy Conservation Law NEEAP implementation requires a framework document. The Draft Energy Conservation Law, which was approved in early 2012 by the COM (but is still awaiting Parliament\u2019s approval), would provide the MOEW a framework for mainstreaming EE & RE activities in Lebanon, and would institutionalize the Lebanese Centre for Energy Conservation as the lead energy entity in the country for the management of EE & RE activities. The draft law proposes: \u2022 Conducting obligatory and periodic energy audits. \u2022 Evaluating and assessing energy intensive projects. \u2022 Hiring the services of energy auditors or energy service firms. \u2022 Energy labelling of products, machines, equipment and electrical appliances. \u2022 Energy saving in both the private and public sector. \u2022 Brokering agreements between LCEC and institutions who want to invest in energy conservation. \u2022 Providing tax exemptions for EE & RE equipment. If implemented, the Energy Conservation Law will create a dynamic market for energy audit firms or energy service companies (ESCO\u2019s), improve the energy efficiency of the Lebanese economy, spread technological know-how and introduce best practices in energy efficiency. Lebanon is also applying to become a member of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). 4.10.4.4. National Energy Strategy (the Missing Capstone) So far, Lebanon has already declared four initiatives related to the energy sector: \u2022 Electricity Sector Policy Paper. \u2022 12% Renewable Energy Pledge. \u2022 National Energy Efficiency Action Plan. \u2022 Energy Conservation Law. 4.11. The Tunisia Case \u2013 Energy Sector 4.11.1. General Overview of the Energy Sector - Tunisia Tunisia\u2019s primary energy consumption has increased since 1990 in a roughly-linear way with approximately 4,500 ktoe in 1990, 6,700 ktoe in 2000 and 8,300 ktoe in 2010 (without biomass). As shown in Figure 6, the sharpest increase was in the gas sector, which represented 55 % of the primary energy supply in 2012. As a result, the share of oil, including crude oil and petroleum products, has slightly decreased. The share of coal and peat has always been minimal and reached zero in 2012. In 2014, primary energy consumption was about 9,200 ktoe (Tunisia Energy Situation, 2016).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "00c21bca-ed6a-4c8a-8ce4-07d990b8d1f6": {"__data__": {"id_": "00c21bca-ed6a-4c8a-8ce4-07d990b8d1f6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Water, energy and food security nexus in Jordan, Lebanon and Tunisia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "70cf355a341e400d9732cf9e9f42d114596accc1dbfb5911b8c21019548a62ca"}, "2": {"node_id": "73277126-6a98-4830-9a56-2c408275f859", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f140f828cc516cc2a92bf3abbbf3d9df3771ed399354741ce8f08bd9a102ea7b"}}, "hash": "6be12d7e9860b7c8407e6073e7fa956da17f8ac1371a47020d03ee7369dff80b", "text": "9000 Ktep Source: ONE 8000 1% 1% 2% 72% 60% 41% 55% 39% 7000 6000 5000 4000 3000 2000 1000 Coke 1990 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 0 Gas Natural Pet Coke Produit p\u00e9troliers hors coke d\u00e9petrole Figure 6.

Energy Policy and Legal Framework 4.11.2.1. General Overview The energy sector is managed by the Ministry of Energy. The Ministry defines the Government\u2019s energy policy and monitors the enforcement of legislation related to the energy sector. The Energy General Department (DGE) within this Ministry is in charge of the execution of Tunisia\u2019s energy. In the mid-1980s, Tunisia developed an energy control policy. The implementation of this policy is based on four main instruments: institutional, legislative, financial and fiscal. The National Agency for Energy Control (ANME) is the institutional body in charge of implementing the State\u2019s policy in terms of RE promotion and the rational use of energy. In order to reduce its dependency on Algerian gas, Tunisia needs to diversify its electricity mix and extend its interconnections. A gas interconnection with Italy (\u201cGazoduc\u201d) already exists and is currently being used to transport Algerian gas to Europe. This interconnection may be used for gas imports to Tunisia in the future. An electric interconnection with Italy with a 400-kV submarine cable is currently being considered. It may be used for import and/or export later on; complementary daily and annual production and consumption profiles of North Africa and Europe can create synergies. In 2016, Tunisia developed an energy strategy which aims to guarantee the security of the country\u2019s energy supply while ensuring access to energy at an affordable price for the economy and the Tunisian population. This strategy focuses on four key areas: \u2022 The development of national hydrocarbon resources, especially natural gas. \u2022 The strengthening of the refining, transport and distribution of petroleum products. \u2022 The development of electrical production and strengthening of interconnections, including the construction of the interconnection with the Italy line. \u2022 The transition to strengthened energy efficiency and the development of renewable energy. Tunisia has set objectives to reduce its consumption of primary energy by 30% and to achieve a share of renewable energy in the production of electricity by 30% by the year 2030. Furthermore, there is a strong need for institutional and budget reforms in the energy sector since the current situation drastically differs from that of 20 years ago. Some things about the sector, such as subsidies, have become a burden, hindering the sector\u2019s continued development. In November 2014, the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Mines called for drastic cuts for the year 2015. Subsidies should decrease from \u00a41.3 billion (TND 2.7 billion) to \u00a40.9 billion (TND 1.96 billion) in order to use the saved money in investment projects. In 2014, energy prices were raised by approximately 10% in total in order to reduce subsidies. By June 2014, electricity price subsidies for cement producers were completely phased out. Forecasts from the ANME expect the consumption to double by 2030 if comprehensive action is not implemented; therefore, energy efficiency should be strengthened.

Subsidies for natural gas as well as electricity increased sharply in the early 2000s. In 2012, energy subsidies amounted to TND 5,600 million (\u00a4 3,100 million), i.e. 20% of the public budget or 9% of GDP, whereas energy subsidies only represented 3% of GDP in 2005.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "810541a8-33ae-479c-b89d-aff4fb3c45df": {"__data__": {"id_": "810541a8-33ae-479c-b89d-aff4fb3c45df", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Water, energy and food security nexus in Jordan, Lebanon and Tunisia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c71a4cc3310d77cf9a98e61647f488591808f39224926cd6607bcdf428d5b717"}, "2": {"node_id": "c0d3d221-e727-4edb-9867-e4b6fb11406e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b28e7b4638c8b00e8ea86b399833d24f0ebb7aa682288a158c1c44cc1837532e"}}, "hash": "09e0925467c4a36d4b4eca8be9dc01c72d5bce43020e1a748f13aa2f402bde27", "text": "This rise in subsidies is not sustainable for the state and has several negative impacts on public spending, such as a decreasing budget for public investments.

Renewable Energy Policy By the 1980s, Tunisia had spearheaded a proactive policy regarding continuous energy management, positioning itself as one of the pioneer countries in the region. In the mid-2000s, Tunisia was engaged in a process of accelerating the energy transition, which was part of a strategic vision toward a Bursar to low carbon. It was based on two main principles: A. Improving energy efficiency through a better control of energy demand; the goal for this is to reduce the demand for primary energy by 30% by 2030 compared to the scenario. B. Substantial use of renewable energy, for the diversification of the energy mix for electricity production; the target for this is to achieve a 30% share from renewables in electricity generation by 2030. Since the middle of the 1980s, Tunisia has developed a suitable regulatory framework for the development of RE, which has been constantly enhanced to support the Government\u2019s policy in this domain. Decree 2002-3232, dated December 3, 2002 and later modified by Decree 2009-3377, authorizes cogeneration facilities to sell their surplus to STEG and to transmit their production via the national network. Law n. 2015-12, dated May 11, 2015, related to the production of electrical power through RE complements the existing legal framework. It takes on provisions related to self-production and authorizes the creation of specialized companies in the production of power designed for local consumption (STEG) or for exports. (Centre of Mediterranean and International Studies & Konrad Adenauer Stiftung). Law n. 2005-106, dated December 19, 2005, provides for the creation of the National Fund for Energy Control (FNME). This Fund constitutes the financial instrument supporting RE promotion policies and can be used to provide direct financial incentives granted in the framework of the energy control law and related legal texts. Direct subsidies granted by FNME have been complemented by specific fiscal incentives allocated to the purchase of equipment and products used in RE production: application of minimal customs fees and VAT exemption. Despite the relatively low levels of current installed RE capacity, it could be argued that Tunisia has, in fact, spent the last 20 years preparing for the current transformation of its energy sector. Since 1985, Tunisia has pursued a \u201cRational Use of Energy\u201d policy and has sought to establish an appropriate institutional environment conducive to energy conservation and management. Among the MENA countries, Tunisia is acknowledged as a \u201cpioneer\u201d in the initiation of energy efficiency and renewable energy policy.

It was reviewed in 2012 and in 2015. The Tunisian Solar Plan is a renewable energy development plan elaborated by the ANME but not officially adopted by parliament or government. The Plan foresees a 30% share of renewables in the electricity mix by 2030. This corresponds to an additional total capacity of 3 GW and an overall investment of \u00a44.75 billion. Figure 7 shows Foreseen RE Installed Capacity in Tunisia in 2020 and 2030. The Tunisian Solar Plan was updated in 2014. A new law on renewable energies was adopted by Parliament in May 2015. The objective of this law is to promote private investment in renewables to contribute to the 30/30 objective of the Tunisian Solar Plan. The Tunisian Government has adopted a Renewable Energy Action Plan with two main objectives: \u2022 Development of large scale projects for the production of electricity from renewable energy sources; the target RE production value is 14% of the national electricity production by 2020. \u2022 Strengthening of the solar water heater program in the residential and tertiary sectors and its extension to the industrial sector (for process heat).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8ed3c0bd-be45-46ed-a9b6-b907752970c5": {"__data__": {"id_": "8ed3c0bd-be45-46ed-a9b6-b907752970c5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Water, energy and food security nexus in Jordan, Lebanon and Tunisia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a99e1e513330caee1ffbda7553363db38383b2d8b6851d256ed9fdd1bcb61e63"}, "2": {"node_id": "89fcf6cb-0c8d-4cd9-a0ec-8f21ff22bc6a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "552eed307973c0380af0605cb764f6b37e84581be1366830a2ded21445157dac"}}, "hash": "9b5d752cd44527eb92e0ec17168a7e924e199a00d202a8b58f0ce47858820e7c", "text": "Thus, the program targeting the installation of 1010 MW of renewable energy in the 2017-2020 period is divided as follows: \u2022 The installation of additional wind capacity of 570 MW; of this, 490 MW will be centralized and 80 MW will be decentralized. \u2022 The installation of an additional 420 MW of PV capacity; of this, 290 MW will be centralized, 65 MW will be used by clients connected to the network (Net metering) as part of the \u00abSolar roofs\u00bb", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "822f8d3c-19a6-4c2b-9a47-cee9f892bfa9": {"__data__": {"id_": "822f8d3c-19a6-4c2b-9a47-cee9f892bfa9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Water, energy and food security nexus in Jordan, Lebanon and Tunisia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f4a38ab989a6f9417742b97fae2f667952a9281863321fd2cdc417158e8ce837"}, "3": {"node_id": "44f770f1-05df-43a5-828d-f6c7127d8d17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7167b317f174426a94ce1bd7a42e7388433f1d0201127c4c3dc5e1a7f160cdb9"}}, "hash": "94317945fdb3dbf5650d227a54db8266b8b4874acda4d503c5b020a8ca59abf6", "text": "program and 65 MW will be used by clients connected to the network MT/HT. \u2022 The installation of an additional 20MW of electric capacity from biomass (mainly electric generators to biogas). \u2022 The installation of an additional 487,000 m2 of capacity from solar hot water collectors, 450, 000 m\u00b2 in the residential sector, 23,000 m\u00b2 in the tertiary sector and 14,000 m\u00b2 in the industrial sector. 87 l WATER, ENERGY AND FOOD SECURITY NEXUS IN JORDAN, LEBANON AND TUNISIA The implementation of the action plan in the field of renewable energy will require the mobilization of a total investment of about US$ 1.46 billion (TND 3.36 billion) and should prevent the emissions of 1.9 Mteco. The Tunisian program \u201cAlliance of Commons for Energy Transition\u201d (ACTE), which was launched on May 27, 2015, formed the partnership between the National Agency for the Control of Energy (ANME), the Fund of Loans and Support of Local Communities (CPSCL) and the General Directorate of Public and Local Authorities (DGCPL). The program aims to strengthen the capacity of Tunisian municipalities to contribute to their capacity levels. The scope of the ACTE program at the local level covers all Tunisian municipalities. Currently, there are 350 municipalities; 86 were created in May 2016 and are not yet functional. The program mainly addressed six areas: \u2022 Building and urban planning to support municipalities in their roles in regulating and developing their territories; to promote territorial and sustainable urban planning; and to be resilient to climate change. \u2022 Equipment and municipal buildings to support municipalities to encourage consumers and public service providers to be models of energy diversification. \u2022 Enhancing municipalities\u2019 capacity to promote energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy in its regions. \u2022 Provide support to municipalities regarding transportation-related issues. \u2022 Strengthen municipalities\u2019 capacities to improve their internal organization, monitoring and evaluation; to set up a system of internal governance within each municipality, including a monitoring and evaluation system for the local energy policies. \u2022 Enhancing municipalities\u2019 capacities to cooperate and communicate matters to support public, private and civil society; to facilitate energy control, including areas that are not directly within its jurisdiction. A local authority that commits to energy control through the ACTE program will benefit from a threefold support system: \u2022 Direct or indirect technical assistance through national, regional and local experts throughout the project cycle: energy audits, development and implementation of action plans and monitoring and evaluation of program contracts. \u2022 Legal and institutional support for the structuring of investment projects, the preparation of energy performance contracts and development of management methods best suited to the public service concerned (e.g. use of energy service companies (ESCOs) or other forms of public-private partnerships). \u2022 Mobilization of financial support through the CPSCL. ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT POLICIES AND REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK l 88 4.11.4. Energy Efficiency Policy Law No. 2004-72 on the rational use of energy defines the wise use of energy as a national priority and as the most important element of sustainable development policy. It states three principal goals: energy saving, renewable energy promotion and the creation of new forms of energy that favour cost reductions and national economic alignment as well as environmental protection. The Action Plan of Energy for the period 2017-2020 has been developed as part of the preparation of Tunisia\u2019s new development plan over the same period. The implementation of this action plan should combine 2.5 Mtoe of primary energy savings with a reduction in GHG emissions of 6.3 Mteco2. For the 2017-2020 Action Plan, the total investment required would be 4.7 billion dinars, equivalent to US$ 2 billion. The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan consists of three phases: 1. Awareness raising, first concrete and grass-root actions were taken under two programmes, (2000-2013) that contributed to an annual decrease of 2% in energy intensity. 2. Continued implementation and voluntary investment via the mobilization of industry, construction and transport (audits, cogeneration, lighting, household appliances, buildings and transport). 3. Implementation of large scale projects in order to reach the 30-30 goals \u2012 30% of electricity shall be produced by renewable sources by 2030 (2020-2030).

The Tunisian Case \u2013 Water Sector 4.12.1. General Overview of the Water Sector In 2015, 98% of the Tunisian population had access to \u00abimproved\u201d water. This total included 100% of the urban population and 93% of the rural population. Subsequently, there were, in 2015, 253,000 people lacking access to \u00abimproved\u201d water. Regarding sanitation, in 2015, 92% of the population had access to \u00abimproved\u00bb sanitation; this included 98% of the urban population and 80% of the rural population. The total number of people that lacked access to \u00abimproved\u00bb sanitation in 2015 was around 944,000 people. (WASHwatch.org \u2013 Tunisia, 2017) Responsibility for the water supply systems in urban areas and large rural centres is assigned to the National Society of Water Exploitation and Distribution (Soci\u00e9te Nationale d\u203aExploitation et de Distribution des Eaux (SONEDE)), a national water supply authority that is an autonomous public entity under the Ministry of Agriculture. Planning, design and supervision of small and medium water supplies in the remaining rural areas are the responsibility of the Directorate General of Rural Engineering (Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du G\u00e9nie Rurale (DGGR)). 4.12.2. Water Policies, Strategies and Governance in Tunisia Due to its geographic location between the Mediterranean and the Sahara, Tunisia has an arid climate throughout most of its territory. This aridity, coupled with the variability of the Mediterranean climate, makes water resources both scarce and unevenly distributed in time and space. Indeed, rainfall varies from less than 100 mm in the extreme south (Saharan climate) to more than 1500 mm in the extreme northwest (wet climate). Rainfall is, on average, 594 mm in the north, 289 mm in the centre and 156 mm in the south of the country. The ratio between the minimum and maximum rainfall varies from 4.4 to 15.8 in the South to the North, confirming the significant inter-annual irregularity and variability from one region to another. Given this difficult hydraulic environment, Tunisia has developed strategies for the mobilization of water resources; these strategies have enabled the mobilization of more than 90% of the mobilized resources towards the end of 2012. This was possible due to the construction of 34 dams (with a capacity greater than 5 Mm3), 234 hill dams (with a capacity of 1 to 5 Mm3), 800 hill lakes (with a capacity of less than 1 Mm3) and more than 100,000 water wells. This mobilization policy, along with a policy of transferring water from the Northwest region, which has a surplus, to the deficit regions of the Northeast and Central East, has helped satisfy water demand. In addition, the implementation strategies for the mobilization of resources, such as desalinated water and treated wastewater, have also been key in providing water to different regions and socio- economic sectors and ensuring a relatively comfortable balance between supply and demand. 4.12.3. Water Governance Governance is a complex process involving participation at several levels beyond the state. Its implementation follows its path and its optimization is a priority today. Water governance has four main interdependent dimensions: A social dimension that aims for an equitable use of the resource.

Water Policies in Tunisia The water policy in Tunisia has two main phases. \u25cf Phase-I - 20th Century: This initial phase includes supply management and the expansion of services with major investment programmes: a network of dams, water supply, sewerage and irrigation services and intensive aquifer operations. There were three master plans (North, Central and South: 1970s) leading to the establishment of a chronogram of mobilization works, water transfer, flood protection and valorisation of the use of groundwater. Master plans have helped distribute water allocations, meet the demands of various sectors and identify the best land to be irrigated. During this phase, the First National Strategy for Mobilizing Water Resources (1990-2000) was developed with the following objectives: mobilize 85% of the water resource potential, realize the boreholes of recognition and exploitation, realize the piezometers of control and monitoring, improve and develop networks to measure and monitor water resources and create 21 dams, 203 hillside dams and 580 hillside lakes. \u25cf Phase-II - Medium-Term (2030) and Long-Term (2050) Strategies This phase began at the beginning of the 21st century, when Tunisia began to realize its limits and that the transition to water management was necessary. There is a slow evolution towards a new approach that takes into account the quality and quantity of water as well as the whole hydrological system, the promotion of demand management, tariff reform, the establishment of public-private partnership and the strengthening of the enforcement of environmental protection regulations. This is the concept of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM). 91 l WATER, ENERGY AND FOOD SECURITY NEXUS IN JORDAN, LEBANON AND TUNISIA 4.12.5. Water Strategies The various strategic studies developed in the water sector have made it possible to develop strategies for mobilization, rational exploitation, integrated and sustainable management and the conservation of water resources and protection of the environment. Three main strategies have been adopted and implemented: \u2022 The ten-year strategy for the mobilization of water resources (1990-2000). \u2022 The complementary strategy (2001 -2011). \u2022 The medium-term strategy (2030) and the long-term strategy (Water 2050). \u25cf First Strategy (1990 \u2013 2000) This strategy defined supply growth as a priority. It enabled the realization of: \u2022 21 large dams to mobilize 1,927 Mm3; \u2022 203 dams and 1,000 hilly lakes to mobilize 273 Mm3; \u2022 1,150 deep boreholes to mobilize 1,127 Mm3; and \u2022 105,000 surface wells to mobilize 740 Mm3. These achievements have mobilized 4.067 billion m3 of water, representing a mobilization rate of 87.5% at the end of 2004 compared to 60% in 1990. During this phase, the Ten-Year Strategy for Water and Soil Conservation (1991-2000) was developed, which permitted the development of 892,000 hectares at the watershed level, 580 hilly lakes and 3,500 spraying and recharge facilities. and mitigating erosion, solid transport and silting of dams. \u25cf Second Strategy (2001 \u2013 2011) This was a complementary strategy for the mobilization of water resources during the period 2001- 2011. It aimed to mobilize 90% of the water resource potential, increase irrigated areas to 405,000 hectares, reach 97% rural drinking water supply and improve the quality of water supply. It included plans for the construction of 11 large dams, 50 hill dams and an interconnection between large dams. This purpose of this interconnection is to balance water stocks in water works, improve drinking water quality and ensure water supply to the capital city (Tunis) and major coastal cities (Sousse, Monastir, Mahdia and Sfax) in times of drought. During this phase, the Complementary Strategy for Water and Soil Conservation (2002 -2011) was developed.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aa169c6f-c858-42ce-aa6f-a33e04c6c8c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "aa169c6f-c858-42ce-aa6f-a33e04c6c8c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Water, energy and food security nexus in Jordan, Lebanon and Tunisia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e00e3ce4ad70e2a81382ba23dab1803b5136251395dda53e1c7417e453f0193e"}, "2": {"node_id": "a652e9e1-f98d-4060-b546-8d9c54397f47", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/water-energy-and-food-security-nexus-jordan-lebanon-and-tunisia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d47f3782265db686b8d825db0cd93d54f25dc5084515f95f6173b17ecbb264a4"}}, "hash": "8ea3cda296208bc16e1da8bc9a080247c3326e466f6fabb255e12cb7ccdc9f95", "text": "It permitted the development of 700,000 hectares of erodible land at the rate of 70,000 hectares/year; it also called for the construction of 1000 hilly lakes, 3500 spreading and recharging structures.

The Tunisian Case \u2013 Food \u2013 Agriculture Sector 4.13.1. General Overview The Tunisian agricultural development model has enabled important advances, such as a significant increase in production and improved agricultural and food supply. The development process, however, showed signs of fragility during the 2007-2008 international crisis that shook the agricultural and food markets. This period revealed the structural limitations of the model. At the same time, issues of global scope, but with significant consequences at the national level, emerged as the country continued its process of economic opening. Tunisia must adapt and adjust its agricultural development model in order to continue the process of intensification and growth of production and ensure a better distribution of the fruits of growth. The country also needs to preserve natural resources and improve the control of integration of Tunisian agriculture into the global economy. 4.13.2. The Foundations of Agricultural Policy in Tunisia Beyond a few temporary reflections, the Tunisian agricultural policy has been registered over the last 30 years in relative continuity characterized by the importance accorded to market mechanisms (both national and international) and the efforts made in rural infrastructure. This policy has mainly mobilized two types of tools, namely intervention on prices and interventions on production structures. The main elements of the Tunisian agricultural development model can be characterized as follows: \u2022 Priority is directed at the roles of the internal market, food safety and the preservation of consumer purchasing power. \u2022 Support is given at family farming and medium-sized farms through agricultural and rural development projects, the promotion of irrigation and price guarantees for certain products. \u2022 Support is manifested, in particular, by the important role of pluri-activity and the direct mode of assertion. 93 l WATER, ENERGY AND FOOD SECURITY NEXUS IN JORDAN, LEBANON AND TUNISIA \u2022 Emphasis is placed on promoting export earnings from a limited range of traditional products for which Tunisia has comparative advantages. \u2022 Importance is given to the mobilization of natural resources with priority for the agricultural sector \u2022 Development of rural infrastructure (roads, drinking water, electrification, etc.) since the early 1980s is ongoing and is possible by mobilizing relatively large resources. The results of this model in the long-term speak for themselves both in terms of the development of the agricultural sector itself and the improvement of living conditions in rural areas. Agricultural production has grown more than the population (an average of more than 3% in the long-term), thereby improving the country\u203as food supply. At the same time, Tunisia has managed to preserve, or even improve, its market share for certain products for which it has a comparative advantage and an export tradition. As a result, export earnings have increased and the rate of import coverage by exports has improved. However, this significant progress over the last thirty years in the growth of the agricultural sector has not prevented the gradual reduction of agriculture in the Tunisian economy, as is the case in many other countries. This development undoubtedly explains the relative reduction in government support in terms of the percentage of agricultural investment in total public investment, given the rapid development of other sectors of the economy and the achievement of all major projects, such as irrigated public dams and perimeters. 4.13.3. The Main Elements of Agricultural Policy 4.13.3.1. The Construction of a Reasoned Argument The promotion of a new model that is collectively desirable calls for new forms of public intervention that must be reasoned with the greatest rigor and with the support of the greatest number of operators.

Summary and Conclusions \u2022 Adopting the WEF Nexus Approach will provide great benefits for the Arab region in its pursuit to achieve the SDGs and mandates of the 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement. \u2022 The interdependency among water, food and energy in the Arab region is strongly and \u2022 closely interlinked, probably more than any region in the world. \u2022 The Arab Region is one of the most vulnerable regions in the world to the potential adverse impacts of climate change. The current water-energy-food-climate policy landscape in the region is complex and fragmented; these sectors have been developed independently of each other. \u2022 Water, energy and food security are central to the sustainable future of the Arab world. Arab countries devised policies to tackle this security nexus challenge, which will set the tone for the sustainable development of the region in the years to come. \u2022 National and regional efforts to address climate change offer an unprecedented opportunity for a needed institutional reform in order to mainstream the nexus thinking in policy development and implementation. \u2022 In view of the recent global commitments of the SDGs 2030 and the new mandate (of the Paris Climate Summit in December 2015) to have a lower carbon economy, the current institutional framework in many Arab countries will probably need to be reviewed. \u2022 The institutional framework governing the elements of the WEF nexus in the region needs strengthening mechanisms for effective resource management.

This value should be protected by all of those involved, including public, private and civil society organizations. Appropriate and fair policies are necessary to support social equity and equality and could be achieved through a greater inclusion of all stakeholders, regardless of status, gender, age or power. Equality and equity, both within and between generations, improvements in efficiency and the maximization of benefits will require a policy and legislative framework that puts emphasis on rights, inclusiveness and fairness, while also aiming to improve livelihoods and well-being. Good environmental governance can be achieved if equity and equality are reflected in policy formulation, strategies and programmes at all levels (Waslekar 2011, UN and LAS 2014). \u2022 Women, as other disadvantaged groups, are especially vulnerable to climate change. Current socio-economic and cultural constraints affect women disproportionately. Women in Arab ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT POLICIES AND REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK l 98 countries, especially the poorest ones, already suffer high rates of illness and death related to pregnancy and other reproductive functions. \u2022 It is obvious that the power sector will only achieve sustainable development if gender analysis is integrated into policy formulation. It is crucial to involve at various levels those who stand to benefit most from the technologies - women - as agents of change. They should be trained in how to promote, set up and operate renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies (e.g. improved cook stoves) because RE and EE projects are much more effective when women are involved. Their input in the design phase makes energy appliances more user-friendly. \u2022 Little attention is currently given to gender mainstreaming in the development of energy policies and programmes. It will be of high value to mainstream gender in the energy sector and enhance energy access for women and other vulnerable groups, especially in rural and peri-urban areas, through targeted programmes. Beyond this gender issue, sustainable energy can also empower vulnerable groups, such as single parent households, orphans, elderly and people with chronic illnesses or disabilities, and help them break the cycle of poverty. \u2022 The current low pricing policies of resources in the majority of Arab countries have been promoting unsustainable consumption and production patterns leading to more resource depletion. Low pricing and across-the-board non-targeting subsidies have resulted in domestic over-consumption of resources and the absence of incentives to achieve resource efficiency. This calls for a paradigm shift in policies and policy development. Reforming pricing schemes would improve resource efficiency, enhance economic and climate resilience, lessen burdens on governments\u2019 budgets and help achieve the newly adopted SDGs and mandates of the Paris 2015 Climate Summit. \u2022 In order to achieve reliable water, energy and food supplies at a national and global scale, multi-stakeholder platforms are needed in order to develop and explore science-policy-society linkages and opportunities to share knowledge and employ it to meet the targets for both the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Climate Change obligations. \u2022 Decision support tools are highly valuable in promoting cross-sector communication and trade- offs, thus it is critical to create these competencies at individual as well as institutional levels. 5.2. Opportunities \u2022 Even though existing institutions of the Arab world face many challenges regarding a Nexus Approach, there are many opportunities that should be tapped into, such as increased awareness of the importance of the Nexus Approach in Arab countries among policy makers and the existing research projects and small-scale pilot projects, which could inform policy options. \u2022 The established climate change institutions and different forms of multi-stakeholder bodies, such as national climate change committees, that are already formulated in many Arab countries could serve as catalysts to mainstream the Nexus Approach at all levels of policy development. The ultimate aim is to have institutions that are able to mainstream and reflect the WEF Nexus Approach in policies in Arab countries in light of the mandate and targets of both the SDGs and the Paris 2015 Climate Summit. This is important in order to ensure that the Arab countries will not, in the near future, be side-tracked by crippling resource insecurities on their sustainable development path. \u2022 Regional institutions and initiatives such as those under the League of Arab states could play an important role in assisting Arab countries with mainstreaming the WEF Nexus Approach.

Enabling existing institutions could be more important and appropriate than establishing new institutions to achieve the targets for both the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 2016-2030) and the mandates of the 2015 Paris Climate Change Summit. 5.3. Recommendations for Improvement \u2022 Governance and institutional structures in the Arab region can be enhanced and strengthened for more effective and integrated resource management by analysing current national institutional arrangements for better understanding of the weaknesses and gaps that hinder the implementation of the WEF Nexus Approach in each Arab country. \u2022 Empower and strengthen existing institutions already active in developing and implementing strategies/policies that are related to WEF sectors to develop a comprehensive WEF nexus national strategy; a key element of this is data homogenization and sharing. \u2022 Enhance coordinating and collaborating mechanisms amongst institutions as a key for mainstreaming the WEF Nexus Approach at local, national and Arab regional levels; this does not necessarily require establishing new institutions for the WEF nexus. \u2022 Adopt a WEF Nexus Approach policy to increase policy coherence among the three sectors and climate change policies to provide integrated solutions and to mitigate nexus-related risks (integrated policies, non-siloed thinking, linking up across sectors and ministries). \u2022 Apply appropriate policy and legislative and economic tools to ensure that basic human needs for the three resources are met at a low, subsidized price, while excessive use is priced at a tariff that reflects the cost. \u2022 Implement integrated planning and management that reduces trade-offs and builds synergies across the three sectors. \u2022 Improve resource efficiency towards the transition to a sustainable economy by reforming economic policy and market incentives. \u2022 Promote sustainable consumption and production patterns to achieve SDGs and mitigate and adapt to climate change mandates and targets as agreed upon in the Paris Climate Change Summit. \u2022 Harness existing multi-stakeholder platforms to improve policy coherence, institutional and social learning and leadership. Multi-stakeholder platforms are needed in order to develop and explore science-policy-society linkages and opportunities to share knowledge, including the public sector (legislators, politicians, utilities, etc.), the private sector (utilities, supply chain, agricultural and industrial sector, etc.), civil society and foreign aid agencies. \u2022 The establishment of a network of leading experts in the region is encouraged to create more synergy with technical knowledge as well as in transboundary issues, international conventions and legal and institutional aspects. \u2022 The involvement of civil society in the nexus governance can be an important asset in generating better dialogues and bringing legitimacy and accountability to governing institutions. \u2022 Mainstream the nexus mental models, concepts and tools in policy and development plans. \u2022 Create training programmes across the various sectors to build capacity on the analytics as ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT POLICIES AND REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK l 100 \u2022 well as the negotiation aspects of the implementation of nexus solutions at different levels, and develop specific institutional programmes and individual capacity-building programmes across the three sectors. \u2022 Legislators have a central role in facilitating institutional reforms, laws and enforcement mechanisms that will create better collaborative platforms. \u2022 Scale up, replicate and fund on-going projects related to the nexus, including integrated seawater energy and agricultural systems, renewable energy for wastewater treatment and reuse and solar desalination. \u2022 Build capacity for policy makers and institutionalize regional knowledge management systems to share best practices on the WEF nexus. \u2022 Support and provide incentives for strategic partnerships and cooperation between research centres and the private sector. \u2022 Introduce inclusive and fair rules, institutions and practices governing social interactions to improve outreach to the vulnerable, such as poor men and women, and the younger and older generations. \u2022 Gender equity and women\u2019s empowerment are declared goals for all Arab countries.

One option (which is more favourable than others as it does not aim to develop new entities with the specific mandate of managing the WEF nexus) is to make one designated body the focal point for preparing a comprehensive WEF nexus strategy for the country. Ideally, this would be a body that is already active in elaborating and implementing strategies that are related to the WEF sectors. This is possible through periodic policy dialogues and the evaluations of WEF nexus policies. Also, the Nexus Approach may be mainstreamed as part of the sustainability reporting mechanism. Other models that can possibly mainstream the nexus include: \u2022 Shared Governance: all the units involved have representatives to a body that will be empowered and entrusted to govern the nexus. 101 l WATER, ENERGY AND FOOD SECURITY NEXUS IN JORDAN, LEBANON AND TUNISIA \u2022 High Level Governance Unit: establishing an independent body with representation of all stakeholders involved in the nexus that will have resources and authority to implement policy. \u2022 Private-Public Partnership (PPP): the implementation of the Nexus Approach is expected to conserve resources, which may be reflected in the form of financial savings. \u2022 Whichever mechanism(s) is/are adopted, more improved coordination between ministries related to WEF sectors needs to take place to meet future challenges. Arab countries need to assess key public entities that are already involved in all of the WEF sectors as the principal administrators of the development and mainstreaming of policies and strategies that tackle the WEF sectors in an integrated and comprehensive way.

Table 1: Most important agricultural export products in Viet Nam; Viet Nam Customs, 2016 Export product Quantity FoB Value Unit Price 1,000 Mt million USD USD / Mt Coffee 1,782 3,336 1,872 Cashew nut 347 2,843 8,193 Fruits and vegetables n/a 2,458 n/a Rice 4,836 2,172 449 Rubber 1,254 1,672 1,333 Pepper 178 1,429 8,028 \uf0b7 A global coffee supply deficit of 60 million bags gbe is expected by 2030 (Figure 1). This is equivalent to double Viet Nam\u201fs coffee production in 2017/2018. Figure 1: Global coffee production and consumption \u2013 historic trend and forecast until 2030 (in mio 60 kg bags gbe); Neumann Kaffee Gruppe, 2016 3 \uf0b7 Viet Namese coffee sector offers jobs for circa 620,000 coffee farming households; assuming 4 members per family this adds up to ~2.5 million people or ~40% of the entire population in the Central Highlands. In the Srepok and Sesan river basins (2S) circa 236,000 ha are planted with Robusta coffee (i.e. 38% of the total production area). \uf0b7 During the 2016/2017 season average production costs were ~1,761 USD/ha (@ current exchange rate of 23,274 VND per USD, 28.03.2019), revenues (based on farm gate prices) were 6,058 USD/ha and net profits 4,297 USD/ha or ~1,718 USD/Mt (assuming 2.5 Mt/ha as a national average); Agri-Logic, 2018, p421. 2.2 Environmental impacts \uf0b7 Coffee production in Viet Nam requires water for irrigation in the dry season to produce yields up to 4 Mt/ha for the current coffee variety (i.e. an inhomogeneous tree stock originating from the Congo basin). Farmers are irrigating excessively, mainly using groundwater resources, leading to seasonal water shortages in the dry season (drying up of wells). \uf0b7 These water shortages appear related to power supply in urban areas like Buon Ma Thuot where regularly power cuts are observed during the dry season. \uf0b7 Based on MARD data (2018; Figure 2), the yield per ha in relation to dry versus normal years seems to be 10% (data 2010-2017) on average. There appears no clear trend in productivity decline vs. drought events. Figure 2: Yield per ha (gbe) per year. Red bars indicate dry years (MARD, 2018) \uf0b7 In case of water scarcity 6-8 weeks after flowering the coffee cherries will not grow to their full extent (cherry swelling stage). As a consequence, the green beans will remain smaller than normal, which reduces the overall tonnage per hectare. On top of this, smaller bean size is considered lower quality by the industry, fetching lower prices which reduce the potential gross income of the farmers. 1The Agri-Logic, 2018 report, assesses farmers\u2019 performance based on farmer field book records in the supply chains of trading companies under the IDH/ISLA program These farmers (900 in total) produce on average 4.13 and 3.05 Mt/ha gbe respectively in Lam Dong and Dak Lak province; p8. 4 \uf0b7 Farmers usually fertilize excessively with soil acidifying (urea based) fertilizers (IDH, 2013). As consequences: \uf0fc More nematode infestations are observed; these creatures feed on the coffee roots and can kill coffee trees. \uf0fc Intercrops such as pepper cannot survive on very acid soils. \uf0b7 Large scale deforestation happened over the last 40 years in order to grow coffee.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "26fb070d-96be-49bb-8e76-f4f0e7435143": {"__data__": {"id_": "26fb070d-96be-49bb-8e76-f4f0e7435143", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/optimizing-water-use-central-highlands-viet-nam-focus-robusta-coffee", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Optimizing water use in the Central Highlands of Viet Nam : focus on the Robusta coffee sector", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/optimizing-water-use-central-highlands-viet-nam-focus-robusta-coffee", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2c32b4920c8bd123dbcb617654ec2fb3fa6390f80774a438faf6c6522178d8fa"}, "2": {"node_id": "815b54a2-084f-47d2-9687-41f5903df8c8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/optimizing-water-use-central-highlands-viet-nam-focus-robusta-coffee", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b657a0bb5c267a114a255b13de4cb5e87abfe6ec033b903de47b3af682b92831"}}, "hash": "f0337698858e7ef72b1e2e0bd4be947436bb903097517cd9f3ce9e49bb6d7796", "text": "\uf0b7 Large scale deforestation happened over the last 40 years in order to grow coffee. As a result, some new pests arose such as cicadas. These insects feed on the roots of plants and can kill coffee trees.

Currently the average national productivity per ha is ~2,8 Mt/ha (GAIN report, USDA, 2018; p4). \uf0b7 Below Table 3 shows an overview of the new coffee varieties including their quality characteristics, water requirement and production potential. On average the new varieties have a production potential of 6 Mt/ha. According to WASI the water requirements would remain at 400 liter/tree/round for the higher yielding new varieties.

Assuming hose irrigation only in the entire 2S region, the total estimated water requirement is 314 million m3. Assuming only overhead sprinkler the required water volume would be 45% higher or 472 million m3 per annum.

Figure 4 presents a scenario whereby the entire 2S area would be rejuvenated over 10 years. Given the fact that it takes 8 years to reach maximum productivity for the new varieties (5 Mt/ha), there will be an overall reduction in production until year 5 (red dashed line). In year 10 the regional production in the 2S would be 12% higher compared to the current situation (i.e. 661,000 vs. 590,000 Mt gbe). 8 \uf0b7 Figure 5 is identical to Figure 4 but for the entire economically viable lifecycle for Robusta coffee (i.e. 20 years). This graph shows that production can theoretically be doubled compared to BaU (590,000 Mt gbe) in year 17. Note that a new rejuvenation cycle would start in year 21. In the BaU scenario, it is assumed that there is no coffee rejuvenation and hence productivity will gradually decline to 1 Mt/ha gbe by year 10. The second scenario assumes full rejuvenation with new coffee varieties over a 10-year horizon without intercropping. By year 10 the total area is rejuvenated (hence the production in the non- rejuvenated areas turns zero). The red dashed line simulates the total annual coffee production under a rejuvenation program. It is the sum of the blue full (rejuvenated) and blue dashed lines (not yet rejuvenated) in the graph.

This graph is identical to Figure 4 but simulated over a 20-year horizon (i.e. the productive lifecycle for Robusta coffee). 9 4 Impact of climate change on coffee production 4.1 Recent studies on climate change vs. coffee production \uf0b7 Several studies have been conducted regarding the potential effects of climate change on coffee production in Viet Nam. A report by CIAT (2012) analyzed future climate trends based on global climate models. The study used historical climate data from the www.worldclim.org database (Hijmanset al., 2005) to define the 2012 climate baseline and future trends. This study suggests the following: \uf0fc In Viet Nam, the yearly and monthly rainfall will decrease by 2020 and progressively increase by 2050. The yearly and monthly minimum and maximum temperatures will increase by 2020 and progressively increase by 2050. \uf0fc The seasons will be more pronounced; the dry season will be drier and hotter and the rainy season will be wetter and hotter. \uf0fc The optimum coffee-producing zone is currently at an altitude between 300 and 900 masl and will by 2050 increase to an altitude between 600 and 1000 masl. \uf0fc Land suitability is expected to decrease by 2050 compared to the 2012 situation (Figure 6). No information is presented in terms of current coffee acreage decrease. \uf0b7 The report mentions that likely a shift of coffee production will have to take place to higher altitudes, but does not mention soil suitability and water availability at those new locations. \uf0b7 Another study, which assessed historical climate trends in the Central Highlands based on daily climate data for all weather stations since the start of data collection, conducted by the Viet Nam National University (Phan Van Tan, 2013 & 2016, Baker, 2016) in Hanoi (Error! Reference source not found.) suggests: \uf0fc Total annual rainfall remains stable \uf0fc Length of the wet season remains unchanged \uf0fc Maximum daily temperature remains stable \uf0b7 The VNU study reports following threats for coffee production in relation to climate change: \uf0fc It is expected that an increased number of wet weather outbreaks will occur in the dry season in the south Central Highlands which is likely to affect flowering patterns. \uf0fc Diurnal temperature changes i.e. higher minima and less change in maxima leads to a reduced diurnal range. This is very likely to favor some pests and diseases. For example, fungal diseases mostly prefer a \u201enot-too-hot; not-too-cool\u201f regime that reduces likelihood of drying out and low temperature inhibition of the delicate germination process.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "44b33afd-a0ba-44d9-984a-64332ff9f254": {"__data__": {"id_": "44b33afd-a0ba-44d9-984a-64332ff9f254", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/optimizing-water-use-central-highlands-viet-nam-focus-robusta-coffee", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Optimizing water use in the Central Highlands of Viet Nam : focus on the Robusta coffee sector", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/optimizing-water-use-central-highlands-viet-nam-focus-robusta-coffee", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f903186dee9ca9c77025bba5a4ad31d223f48226966bbb0fa7f8d40544d71182"}, "2": {"node_id": "c42080ad-aa2c-4d10-a75a-5c776528a251", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/optimizing-water-use-central-highlands-viet-nam-focus-robusta-coffee", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e9492289e67fa24ae893611dc89bf94b786a797a59b2554f7f907377e4a195ba"}}, "hash": "ad61b0ce5b9d05aeb59c87a4f79a6ce990171c47391f05a42c1793d51be4ecb1", "text": "Figure 6: Land suitability forecast for Robusta coffee production in Viet Nam; from left to right 2012 (baseline), 2020, 2050; CIAT, 2012 10 \uf0fc On top of this, higher average temperatures mean that insects like the coffee berry borer may be able to complete an extra life-cycle and therefore exert greater economic loss. \uf0fc Higher temperatures may also stress the trees: it is well-established that many insects find it easier to overcome the defenses of weakened trees.
